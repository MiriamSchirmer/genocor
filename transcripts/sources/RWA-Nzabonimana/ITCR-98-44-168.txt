MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 20th of September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the Defence and to the registry.  The Prosecutor today is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Gregory Lombardi, Gilles Lahaei, Takeh Sendze, and Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  My name is Dior Diagne-Mbaye, from the Dakar bar.  I'm assisted by Félix Sow, also from the Dakar bar.  Our assistant, Mr. Leopold Nsengiyumva, are here to represent Mr. Édouard Karemera, who is also present, Your Honours.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  My name is Chantal Hounkpatin.  I'm defending Mathieu Ngirumpatse. And I'm with my co-counsel, Frédéric Weyl, and Guissé, who is our assistant.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I'm Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorera, assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva, and legal interns Russell Hopkins and Gina Mensah-Datsa.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Again, one or two preliminary matters before we start the day's programme, and the first one has to do with the scheduling orders which we have made concerning the issue of the number of witness to be called by the Prosecutor.  On the 19th of September, the Defence filed a motion, moving for an order to the Prosecution to reduce the number of witnesses to be called to prove count 5 of the amended indictment.  Now, the Chamber recalls the scheduling order of 14th September 2005, on the time limits for both parties for the filing of their submissions to reduce the Prosecution witness list.  The Chamber also recalls the scheduling order of 19 September where the Prosecution was instructed to file its submissions regarding the variation on its witness list no later than 3rd October 2005.  

After reviewing all of these elements, the Chamber considers that it is appropriate to deal with the issue of the Prosecution witness list at one single time.  The prior scheduling orders of 14th and 19th September are, therefore, amended as follows:  The Prosecution shall file its submissions to amend its witness list by Monday, 3rd October 2005.  The Defence for each Accused shall file its reply to the Prosecution's motion, and any submission seeking reduction of the Prosecution witness list, by Monday, 10th October 2005.  The Prosecution shall file its reply by Monday, 19th -- by Monday, 17th October 2005.  The above-mentioned Joseph Nzirorera's motions will, therefore, be addressed by the Chamber at the time it will rule on the submissions of the parties on the Prosecution's witness list.  

Now, the second matter is this, and it deals with the application by Joseph Nzirorera to exclude the testimony of Witness GFJ.  The Defence for Nzirorera requests the Chamber to exclude testimony of Witness GFJ.  It argues that 193 pages of statements in his dossier to the Rwandan authorities were not disclosed within the time limits prescribed by Rule 66(A)2 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  It contends that the Defence has been prejudiced by the delay in the disclosure because the said documents were served in Kinyarwanda, which counsel responsible for cross-examination cannot read.  It claims that the only remedy is the exclusion of the testimony of the witness.  

The Prosecution responds that it had endeavoured to comply with the rule, 66(A), in good faith.  It claims that only a few pages, translated and provided to the Defence, could be characterised as a statement of the witness.  The remaining part of the documents being mostly summaries and conclusions by the judge based on evidence from a variety of sources.  It contends that the witness can be recalled for further cross-examination later in the trial if subsequent review of his judicial records provides material for impeachment.  

The Chamber is of the view that the documents disclosed to the Defence on 8 September 2005, pertaining to Witness GFJ, does not fall within the ambit of Rule 66(A)2 of the rules but merely under the practice which has developed, subject to considerations of the interest of justice, of requiring the intervention of the Prosecution to obtain and disclose certain records, specifically including Rwandan judicial records of Prosecution witnesses.  The Prosecution, therefore, did not fail to comply with its disclosure obligations under Rule 66(A)2.  

In addition, the Chamber notes that the documents were disclosed in Kinyarwanda, a language that the Accused understands.  The Chamber, however, accepts the Defence concerns with respect to the fairness of the trial and the preparation of the Defence and is of the view that time and facilities should be granted to the Defence.  The Chamber does not know whether the documents in their entirety are needed for the Defence.  The language unit cannot be requested to translate each and every document due to the massive volume of the documents.  So as a practical matter and to prevent the problem from arising again and again in the future, the Chamber invites the Accused to indicate which parts of the document in Kinyarwanda should be translated to allow the language unit to provide, in short time, oral interpretation, or written translation where appropriate.  And in that context, I would like to inquire, first of all, of Mr. Robinson, counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, as this is your motion, to what extent you have had -- already had an informal translation of the document and whether you are in a position to indicate what sections of the documents are required to be translated for the purpose of your defence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I've had no informal translation of the document itself.  The document was disclosed to us on the 8th of September.  We didn't know which witness order the Prosecution would use until Thursday evening, the 15th of September, and we were guessing, in fact, that they would call the witnesses who are already here in custody in Arusha.  So we were translating documents relating to ALG and UB informally and didn't do any translation of GFJ's documents.  So I have, at this point, no translation of that document.  I do note that the Prosecution has designated nine pages which it believes are pertinent, which have yet to be translated.  So certainly that would be a starting point, of those nine pages, but we have not had sufficient time to be able to look through the document and designate any other pages that should be translated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time would you require to discharge that activity  -- exercise, do you think?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that depends on whether we're sitting in court session or not.  Obviously, my whole team is here working in court session, but I think that maybe a total of four hours or five hours for somebody to read that document in Kinyarwanda to themselves and to tell me a summary of what pages could be -- should be translated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, would it be appropriate to suggest that that activity be concluded no later than Wednesday.  You could give information to the trial coordinator as soon as you are aware of the documents that require translation, and the Chamber will assist and liaison with the language unit for this purpose.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, will we be sitting on Tuesday and Wednesday?  Because I don't have anybody who can do that while we're sitting.  If we're -- if we're going to be in recess, yes, that can be done.  If not, I would say it would have to be done by Monday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the Chamber wants to sit.  I mean, we made a scheduling order for this case in March.  This case initially started in 2003.  The Accused have been arrested a long time ago.  We want to sit and hear the evidence in the matter.  So that's what we're here for.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, but you're putting the entire burden of the Prosecution's failure to disclose on us.  The reason that we're not prepared is that we did not receive this material until September 8th; we didn't know until September 15th who was going to be testifying; and this is material that should have been disclosed a long time ago, even by the Prosecutor's own admission.  So you're putting the burden of the -- of the -- on us, when, in fact, the reason we're in this situation is because the disclosure wasn't timely.  I think this is a systemic problem that is affecting the Trial Chamber's deliberations on motions to continue and on the motion to exclude evidence.  We would be ready if, in fact, the conditions existed where the rules were complied with and the trial -- the witness was, in fact, ready.  The Prosecutor knew on the 8th of September that he didn't have all the disclosure complete for this witness, and he chose to bring him from Rwanda as the first witness.  So we're not the ones responsible for the problem.  I appreciate you looking for a solution, but I think the solution has to accommodate our interests as well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Are there any other Defence who wish to comment?  Mr. Weyl?  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  I associate myself with what has been said by my learned colleague Robinson, and I would like to add two observations, the first being that the Prosecutor has indicated that he has done everything he -- in his power to disclose to us about 15 days ago.  But having looked at these documents, they have been in existence for three years, and I don't think that it was necessary for us to go through a period of three years for the disclosure to be done.  

My second observation regards the testimony of Witness GFJ, and he has a will-say statement of 3rd September in which he mentions document -- documents in his possession and which have not been disclosed to us up to now.  Because he says that -- the Prosecutor says that -- says that a letter was written by the witness before January 2001.  We do not have this letter.  And the Prosecutor must have received this document before January 2001, if the witness is saying the truth and this document has not been disclosed to us.  We are well, indeed, past the 60-day deadline before the commencement of trial.  It's the 20th of September today, and we do not have the documents which are necessary before Witness GFJ is heard.  And I don't think we should go into a listing of all the documents which have not been disclosed before his testimony, and I think this would be a prejudice to our cross-examination of the said witness.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Weyl, do you know what is contained in the letter the witness wrote to the Prosecutor?  
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, I do not know because it is only mentioned in the will-say in which the Prosecutor is getting the witness to say, "I was, myself, in prison in Kigali, and I took the initiative of writing to meet the ICTR investigators so that I could tell them what I knew about Mathieu Ngirumpatse."  Now, that letter must be around.  It has a content, but I don't know because that's how it was described to me.  And if I had cross-checked by reading the letter, the precise letter, which should have been disclosed if it was there because the Prosecutor is using it.  

Now, one more little information, so far as this particular case is concerned about Mr. Robinson.  We have not yet received a Kinyarwanda -- Kinyarwanda investigator because his world programme was rejected initially, but it took us to talk about the decision, confirming investigators are helping counsel, for the decision of the registrar to be rectified so he was allowed to come.  Now, he should have been here to help us to go through the Kinyarwanda disclosures.  He can only be here, unfortunately, tomorrow, and that is still a problem so far as we are concerned.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SHORT:
The reason I asked you is because you must -- on this question of disclosure, you can only expect the Prosecution to disclose witness statements that fall under Rule 66.  I assume you understood the -- the ruling that was given by the presiding Judge.  So the Prosecution's obligation is to disclose statements that fall under Rule 66 or Rule 68.  So unless you can demonstrate that the Prosecution has witness statements that fall under Rule 66 or that he has failed to disclose statements which fall under Rule 68, then how can you say there has been a failure to disclose, and, therefore, you have suffered unfair prejudice?  I think we must clarify this issue as to what is required to be disclosed.  It's not just every letter that has been written by the Accused that has to be disclosed.  
MR. WEYL:
Your Honour, if I may, I, first of all, believe that the Prosecutor's disclosures under Rule 66 should be automatic and comprehensive, to be fair.  And I also believe that I can only presume the existence of prejudice because of non-disclosure of missive, that necessarily if it says that it calls into question Mathieu Ngirumpatse, must be tied to the witness statements and to the documents that the Prosecutor should disclose under Rule 66.  And as far as there is a letter, I didn't see the letter, but a letter that tells the Prosecutor that a witness wants to call Ngirumpatse into question and wants to see him, that makes it a letter that falls under Rule 66 -- Rule 66(B), including the possibility of sussing the credibility of the witness if tomorrow he says something that we want to verify on the basis of the disclosures made by the Prosecutor, Your Honour.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I answer also -- contribute to the answer of Judge Short's question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, what the witness has said exactly in the will-say statement that was given to us this weekend is that he wrote a letter asking to meet ICTR investigators to reveal what he knew about Mathieu Ngirumpatse's acts in preparation for the genocide, while he was in prison.  So we contend certainly that if it's not a statement under Rule 66(A)2, which the Trial Chamber has ruled that other correspondence from witnesses to the Prosecution about the content of their testimony should be disclosed under that rule, and if it's not material to the preparation of the Defence under Rule 66(B), which it certainly seems as fodder for cross-examination, it's disclosable under Rule 68, as affecting the credibility of that witness because it shows his motivation for coming here today and accusing Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So as to the letter, we believe that it's something that should have been disclosed.  

I would also like to take this opportunity, Judge Byron, to address the situation that you're trying to remedy, that is, having adequate time and facilities to deal with the material that's in Kinyarwanda.  I appreciate the efforts that you're trying to make, but, again, I think we'll only be partially successful by translating the material because the other component of preparation for cross-examination is investigation.  And what we have to do when we take this material is work with it and investigate.  

For example, among the eight pages that are translated already, there are statements of the Accused that he disassociated himself from the MRND party; that most of his relatives were Tutsi; that he purchased a grenade to protect himself from the Interahamwe; that he launched this grenade during the events of 1994.  And he denied the accusations against him that he participated in the murder of several families; that he raped a girl named Louise; and that he had participated in crisis committee meetings in his sector that were held to promote the killings.  Many potential witnesses are mentioned in these pages -- the councillor of the sector, the witnesses who accused GFG (sic).  These are all people that we would have talked to if the disclosure had been given to us in time.  And we believe there's probably additional investigation that would be revealed when we get the contents of the rest of this document.  So we don't believe that simply receiving a translation of this document will adequately allow us to be in a position to cross-examine this witness, and we would ask that the Court take the remedy, either of excluding the testimony, or of requiring that this witness be called in another session.  And, again, I point out that we're in this position not because the Defence isn't doing their job but because the Prosecutor has not adequately disclosed the material sufficiently in advance of the testimony and has chosen to call this witness first, knowing these disclosure failures.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May I respond briefly?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not yet.  I would like to see if Karemera has anything to say first.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Your Honour, we didn't want to say anything since what we wanted to say was properly said by our learned friends.  We simply wanted to add that so far as the letter is concerned, the letter of January 2001, if the Prosecutor wants to bring in Witness GFJ, who says, "It was myself was (sic) in prison in Kigali, wrote to us to ask to meet the ICTR investigators."  I'll not read it all.  He also asked that there are explanations as far as the MRND youth is concerned.  So he wanted to explain some things in the letter that he wrote to the Prosecutor in January 2001.  We want to know why he wants to make these explanations, and the best way to do that is that the letter be disclosed.  On Rule 66, this is glaringly clear, Your Honour.  This is why we are demanding the disclosure of this letter, sir.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I'd like to begin with the issue of the letter.  I am not aware of any letter that this witness has written to the Office of the Prosecutor prior to 2001.  The witness made that comment when he was being interviewed to -- in preparation for his testimony, and we provided it to the Defence because we're committed to the broadest possible disclosure.  And we've endeavoured to place the Defence on notice as best we can, and we do that consistently.  There is no letter as far as I know.  Everything in our database in relation to this witness has been disclosed to the parties.  Disclosure has been so extensive in this case that we can't even keep track of what we have disclosed.  Even with respect to the judicial records, I'm informed that the records themselves had been disclosed sometime in July.  Now, we cannot locate a forwarding memorandum, so I'm reluctantly conceding or assuming that it may not have gone out, but within our team, our recollection is that it went out sometime in July.  

So in respect of disclosure, we have gone far overboard.  We -- no one can keep track of the disclosure in this case.  We've made best efforts to do that.  We've documented as best we can, but the volume of materials that have been disclosed is too -- too overwhelming to note everything.  With -- concerning the judicial records themselves -- and I'm specifically responding to Mr. Robinson's comments -- these materials shouldn't have been disclosed in the first place.  We're disclosing them because the Court has encouraged us to -- to provide these judicial records, but in most juris- -- well, I shouldn't say "most jurisdictions," but in a number of jurisdictions in the world, including the United States, when someone is acquitted of a crime, the records are sealed.  (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) was acquitted of four of the charges in the -- in his trial in -- in Rwanda, the charges that -- for which the -- Mr. Nzirorera made reference to the factual underpinnings.  We've attempted -- we've attempted to go through the records.  We've only located 17 pages at best that make any reference whatsoever to the witness.  And even -- yes, I noticed my mistake, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Registrar, would you put the name mentioned by Mr. Webster under seal, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Even with respect to the witness, Mr. GFJ, mention of him is sparse in the judgment precisely because he was acquitted.  We received these records after strenuous efforts in Rwanda.  It took us over a year to obtain them.  I have an email traffic that goes back well over a year.  So we've made repeated, consistent efforts to obtain these materials, and they arrived in Arusha sometime in June, I believe.  And we thought that they had been disclosed a week or two later in July.  In fact, they were re-disclosed, and we can document the disclosure on the 8th of September, and that's when Mr. Robinson claims that he received them for the first time.  But we made consistent efforts; we make diligent efforts; and this should not prevent us from calling this witness.  If, in the course of this cross-examination, it comes to light that there are additional aspects of his -- of his testimony that need to be subject to cross-examination, the witness can be called back.  So on that basis, I would recommend that we proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, how much time was it anticipated this witness would take?  
MR. WEBSTER:
My direct examination will probably take a full day.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A full day.  All right.  

Now, I do not think that it is a sensible approach to start the cross-examination, knowing that problems might arise, with a view to recalling the witness at a later stage.  Now, if the witness were to start his testimony, could his cross-examination be deferred to give reasonable time to the Defence to prepare for cross-examination?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't think that's a reasonable approach, from the Prosecution perspective.  The witness is here.  Many of the issues that the Defence wants to explore on the cross-examination, in relation to his records, can be -- can -- excuse me -- let me begin again.  I would prefer not to make that arrangement.  I think it's more appropriate to have the witness testify in direct, then continue with his cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have noted that it was on the 16th of May that notice was given that 
Witness GFG (sic) would be called in the first trial session, so that you should be generally prepared for his cross-examination.  Now, you've indicated that you need approximately four hours to go through the material just disclosed.  What we are thinking might be an appropriate way to approach this is to allow the evidence in-chief to be given and start the cross-examination tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 -- at 2:00.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, that would give us time to identify to the language section the pages that need to be translated, but that's certainly not enough time to actually produce a translation for use in cross-examination.  

In addition, as I've mentioned, I think that the understanding of the document is only the beginning of preparation for cross-examination, not the end, and we need time to investigate as well.  I think that -- I appreciate the efforts that you're trying to make, but I think that the cross-examination of this witness should not be -- take place at least during this trial session, so that we have an adequate opportunity both to understand and investigate, which is the basic requirements of adequate facilities for the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, were you trying to say something?  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I simply wanted to indicate that I embrace Mr. Robinson's arguments, and I'd like to indicate to the Chamber that -- to be ready, the Prosecutor, on 16th May, said that GFG (sic) would appear during this session.  We would have had to have more information.  The Prosecutor should have disclosed before the 16th of May the information, before indicating that GFJ was going to testify.  If they indicated on 16th of May, they should have been ready on that date so that we could have been prepared, as they were.  Disclosure on 8th September does not equate to disclosure on 16th May.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we think that it would be speculative to make the assumption at this stage that there is material that requires further investigation.  So we don't want to make an order based on that -- on that assumption at this point in time.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I don't know what more you would like me to make do to make a showing of actual concrete need for investigation than what I've already said, but I -- for example, I've told you that within the eight pages, he talks about how he participated in crisis committee meetings in his sector and gives the name of the councillor and other people who are -- he was accused of that.  And there's the name of the councillor and other people who attended, that -- the names of witnesses who accused him of crimes which he denied, that go directly to his credibility.  It seems basic that these are people who already, from the one-twentieth of the document that we know of, need to be contacted to give evidence -- or to be interviewed so we can determine whether or not we can use that in cross-examination.  That's basic preparation for a burglary case, let alone a genocide case.  

And so I'm happy to give you any further information you require.  I've studied these eight pages in detail.  I know there are witnesses that need to be contacted based on what's contained in those eight pages.  So I understand you feel it's speculative, but from my point of view, it's very concrete that there are investigations that need to be commenced based on even the eight pages that we've reviewed.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If the Court will permit it, I'd like to make a further response to -- on -- My Honour (sic), my submission is that it's not appropriate to turn this trial into a mini-trial on the witness, which is what Mr. Robinson seems to -- to want to do.  Even if he conducted investigations in Rwanda now of witnesses that were mentioned in this judgement, those witnesses cannot be called to testify against GFJ in these proceedings.  The issue would be wholly collateral.  There's enough information in the judgement itself to form the basis of questions to be put to the witness in cross-examination, and the witness's answers to those questions would have to remain on the record.  It would not be appropriate for Defence counsel to start bringing in witnesses before this Court during the Defence case simply to explore issues of credibility of the witness.  It's a collateral issue.  

So my submission to the Court is that Mr. Robinson's application be denied.  The materials that we have disclosed that is now provoking this long -- this debate, are things that would -- are things that are not statements within the meaning of Rule 66.  If we were simply applying the rules and not going beyond them, this is the type of material that would never even arise in the context of this trial.  We have no objection to disclosing these types of materials to the Defence because we're interested in fundamental fairness.  But because we go overboard in our disclosure should not be an opportunity for the Defence to turn this trial against Joseph Nzirorera and Édouard Karemera and Ngirumpatse into a trial of the witnesses that are being brought to testify.  We're going to go too far afield.  This is a large case.  It's a complex case.  My submission is -- to the Court is that we should focus on the issues.  The issue is not whether the witness attended certain meetings in Kigali, as Mr. Robinson is suggesting.  There's enough material in the judgement to form the basis of a -- of a competent cross-examination.  And this is fundamentally a matter of discretion for the Court, and I'm asking -- or submitting to the Court that it should exercise its discretion in favour of fairness to the -- to both parties and to expediency.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may I respond?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, the fact that Mr. Webster may very well be right that material in-chief of the Defence, to impeach the credibility of a witness in general, may very well be collateral, which is why it's even more important and, in fact, critical that this investigation be done before the cross-examination of the witness because that is likely to be our only opportunity to show to the Chamber the lack of credibility of the witness, through attack on his credibility.  And if it was only a matter of bringing Defence witnesses, yes, we could investigate after the witness testifies, but it's a matter of putting to the witness the results of our investigation, and it's our only opportunity to so challenge his credibility in that way, and that makes the cross-examination more critical that it be done at a time when disclosure and investigation has -- adequate time has been allowed for those things.  Thank you.

1015H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 We've considered the various submissions made to us.  And in our view, the testimony of this witness should commence.  We are prepared to have a break between the conclusion of his examination-in-chief and the commencement of his cross-examination to enable Defence familiarisation with the documents about which were in discussion.  We are going to require the Prosecutor to give an undertaken to recall the witness for further cross-examination if subsequently to the conclusion of his testimony; the Defence comes across material which it considers may insist to impeaching in the witness's credibility.  Within the interests of the Court as well as of the par certification including the Accused could be adequately addressed we then can do it that way. 

Mr. Prosecutor, do we have your undertaking? 
MR. WEBSTER:   
Yes, Your Honour, that's fine, that's what we had placed in our response to the written motion.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, are you ready to call the witness?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, the witness is ready. The witness is here and we are ready to proceed.  There is another matter that I need to bring to the Court's attention, and to the attention of the parties.  I am wondering whether it - - I think it would be more appropriate to do so in closed session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But in perhaps you have to mention that to us.  If the matter in your opinion requires a closed session hearing, what is the subject matter?
MR. WEBSTER: 
Oh, it concerns the witness's request to have the Court's protective order modified with respect to him.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, that is a closed session issue.  How long will that discussion take? Would it be ten minutes? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
 I was hoping not more than ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. Well for the benefit of the waiting gallery, we will go into closed session now for about ten minutes.  Immediately after that, we will take a short break and the Court will resume in open session at approximately 1045H. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 13 to14] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)

(Court resumed at 1116)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	We are resuming in open session at this stage.  We have taken into account what has been said before.  We have asked WVSS to be represented here in case there are any issues.  And do we have any representative in Court, please, WVSS?  Would you please identify yourself for the record?
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, our section here is represented by two individuals;              Mr. Charles Kalumo who is in charge of security and the movement of witnesses.  My designation of him -- his title that wasn't very good, and there is myself, Essombe-Edimo.  Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 

Mr. Webster, we think you should call the witness now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me. Mr. President. I have one oral application with respect to this witness that I would like to make that will take less than five minutes.  May I do that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like to move pursuant to Rule 72(B) -- Rule 73(B) for certification to appeal your decision denying my motion to exclude the testimony of Witness JF -- GFJ.  I would simply like to state that the legal issue that was decided by the Trial Chamber in its oral decision today, that of              Rule 66(A)(ii) does not apply to Rwandan statements, is in conflict with the decision of             Prosecutor versus Ndayambaje, decision on the Defence motion seeking documents relating to detained witnesses for leave of the Chamber to contact protected, detained witness of                         15 November 2001; Prosecution versus Kajelijeli, decision on Juvénal Kajelijeli's motion requesting the recalling of Prosecution Witness GAO of 2 November 2001; Prosecution versus Nyiramasuhuko decision on the Defence motion for the disclosure of the declarations of the Prosecution witnesses detained in Rwanda, and all of documents and information pertaining to the judicial proceedings and their respect, date is December 18, 2001.  

Rule 72(B) has two criteria for certification:  One, an issue that would involve, and significantly affect the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or the outcome of the trial; and second, in the opinion of the Trial Chamber an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.

It is our submission that the ruling that the Trial Chamber has made with respect to Witness GFJ will apply to at least 11 witnesses during this trial that we have already identified on the Prosecution's witness list for whom Rwandan witness statements have not been provided.  So, we believe this would affect, significantly, the fair conduct of these proceedings and may well affect the outcome of the trial, because the decision of this Trial Chamber is in conflict with the established jurisprudence of other Trial Chambers.  We believe that an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber would materially advance the proceedings.  If it turns out that the Trial Chamber is wrong, and that these statements are, in fact, covered by Rule 66(A)(ii), it may well disrupt the continuation of these proceedings, or the finality of any judgment rendered in these proceedings unless that is remedied before the final judgment in this case.  So, for those reasons we are asking the Trial Chamber to grant us certification to appeal its decision.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, of course, the Prosecutor opposes that application, Your Honour.  I don't have those decisions in front of me so I cannot respond directly to the authorities cited by Mr. Robinson.  But my recollection of the issue in Kajelijeli was not that these were statements, but that the Court thought it was fair that the Prosecutor provide or make best efforts to obtain his judicial records in order -- and recall him for cross-examination.  But issues in these cases come exactly, you know, repose on the arguments I made earlier in relation to these statements, whether they can be qualified as statements and were within the purview of Rule 66(A)(ii).  In this instance an immediate resolution by the Appeals Chamber is not practicable.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If we allowed you until after lunch, would you be in a position to respond to these submissions?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will schedule your response at 2 o'clock this afternoon. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is fine. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Webster said he was not legally prepared to respond to your submission.  We have given him until 2 o'clock to respond.  We will continue the adjudication of your matter after his response. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think that your application should result in a stay of these proceedings, so we will proceed.

Call the witness.

Witness -- sorry.  Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, good morning to you. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber had made a protection order on the 10th of December 2004 providing for the concealment of your identity as a witness in this case.  Now, we have been informed by the Prosecutor that you wish to have your identity -- you wish to waive the protective orders in relation to the concealment of your identity during your testimony in this trial.  And so in relation to that, we are going to remove all of the provisions which relate to the concealment of your identity while you are giving testimony in this trial.  We would leave in force the provisions which forbid making or publicizing photographs and electronic recordings without the leave of our Chamber.  And we leave in place the provision requiring the Defence to make arrangements through the Prosecution if they should wish to interview you.

Now, we have been informed that the relationship that normally attends all witnesses between the Tribunal, through WVSS, will remain in force in relation to you, all of those provisions that do not relate to the concealment of your identity.  We just would like to get your confirmation on this so that we could make the order and proceed with your testimony.  
THE WITNESS:
I do not know whether I am authorised to speak, Mr. President.

Mr. President, Your Honours --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are authorised to speak.  As of now, nothing has been said which has revealed your identity, so in your response you can also adopt the same method of speech.  But I wanted to just hear from you that you have consented to testify under your name, without the concealment of your identity, while you are a witness in these proceedings.   
THE WITNESS:
I confirm the same, Mr. President.  I wish to testify with my identity revealed, that is the decision I have come to.  However, Mr. President, Your Honours, I would have one request to make of your Chamber.  This is something which has as yet not been mentioned. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a request that can be made without revealing your identity, or is it something that is private?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, the request that I wish to make is connected to my protection, and I would wish that I do not necessarily have to live in the safe house.  I want to -- I do not -- I want my identity revealed because I am not afraid of speaking the truth, but there are certain aspects which need to be maintained regarding my protection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you explain to what you refer, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wish to inform you that for the time being I am accommodated in what is known as a safe house, but I believe that the conditions under which I am living are not appropriate for my          well-being.  I do not know how to explain this to you.  I wish to continue from protection -- I wish to continue to benefit from the protection provided once I return to Rwanda, but the WVSS informed me that once I will have renounced my ability to live in the safe house, all of my protection measures would also be removed.  This is what disturbed me somewhat.  Otherwise, I would wish to come out of the safe house in which I am accommodated at the present moment and testify as a free individual. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, if I understand you that you are asking the Court to permit you to make your own arrangements for your accommodation while you are in Arusha; but you want to know whether WVSS will maintain a relationship with you on your return to Rwanda.  And you need to know the nature of the relationship.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed, you are quite right, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I wanted to clarify something for the record, Your Honours, because I'm not sure if I understood the witness correctly, because we have gotten beyond the point of addressing the issue of his accommodation.  The witness has already waived the protections of the safe house.  He is no longer in the safe house, so that is not an issue that this Court needs to address.  

My understanding is that the witness's concern is that he doesn't lose any benefit or support that WVSS could provide him when he returns to Rwanda.  It was explained to the witness previously that the matter of staying in the safe house and being supported in Rwanda and testifying anonymously were all linked.  And what we were hoping to do is to distinguish those two for the witness.  He is no longer in the safe house.  He has waived his right to be in the safe house.  He is trying to waive his right to testify anonymously.  And his only concern is that if there is any support that WVSS would offer when he returned to Rwanda, that would remain intact. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why is that a matter -- why is that a matter for a Court order at this stage?  May I enquire from WVSS -- who is speaking on behalf of -- my question has to do -- yes, Mr. WVSS representative, you'll forgive me if I don't articulate your name properly.  Would you assist me again, please?  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm not quite sure I heard your question correctly because I had some problems with my headphones. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question at this stage was just for assistance in annunciating your name. 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Mr. President, Your Honours, my name is Joseph Essombe-Edimo. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Essombe-Edimo, yes my question is a very simple one because I don't understand, I don't understand to what extent an order from this Court is required to respond to the concern which the witness has expressed.  As far as I understand it, WVSS is established under Rule 34 of the Rules to provide services for all witnesses and victims relate -- connected to these trial proceedings.  And my question is, would the relationship of WVSS and this witness continue even if the protective order is removed?  I'm not asking for details of what you do, at this stage.  But I just want to know whether or not if he -- if the assistance that is provided to witnesses is applicable to a witness who is not under a protection order?
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
	Mr. President, Your Honours I am just as perplexed as you are and I do not need to hide anything from you.  I have some difficulty in understanding exactly what this witness is after, what he wants.  I have the impression, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do apologise for being as frank as I am, but I am somewhat going about this blind because while the witness is setting aside his protective measures but at the same time wishes that WVSS ensures his protection, I don't know exactly what he means.  He ought to tell us exactly what he has in mind, otherwise we cannot respond to his request, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Essombe-Edimo, I don't think any further explanation is needed from the witness.  What I am interested in finding out is what is the policy with regard to your division with regard to witnesses, if you can say simply that you have a policy regarding all witnesses whether they are protected or not.  That is really what my question is.  Do you have a policy with regard to witnesses who are not subject to a protection order?  You see, I don't need to know at this stage what the details are, but I need to know whether a policy is in place for addressing witnesses who are not the beneficiary of a protection order. 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Mr. President, in fact, the answer to your question is very simple.  We look at the witnesses, whether they are protected or not, we look at them the same way.  Now, if a witness has a particular demand, vis-à-vis his previous -- because your question takes us to some where, some time in the future; if a witness has a particular demand, vis-à-vis he has been a witness before this Tribunal, and if this demand falls between -- I mean, within the framework of our action, of course, we are going to react to that demand.  

We have a policy concerning all of the witnesses protected or not protected.  Now, our interaction with the witnesses depends also on the demands we receive from the witnesses. 

Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 

Now, Mr. Witness, you have heard what the representative of WVSS has said.  You have not disclosed to me -- or to the Court what are your particular demands.  But my question is, having heard what has been stated, does that answer the concern that you expressed to this Court?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I am satisfied with the fact that Mr. Essombe, the representative of WVSS, has just given me reassurance by promising me that I will always be protected by the said section.  And that if ever I were to encounter any difficulties, I would still be able to refer to the same section.

Now, as for my specific requests, in fact, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not have any specific or special requests for the time being.  WVSS is only required to apply the rules that it normally applies with regard to protected or unprotected witnesses.  I had already come to a decision.  I requested that I do not be accommodated in a safe house; but one week later, and this was surprising to me, I was told that they were renouncing all protective measures that I benefited from.  But just a moment ago, I am hearing that I'm still under protection while I'm here in Arusha.  Consequently, that was what I had to ask of the Chamber, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Essombe, I think that in order -- that it is necessary for you just once more to clarify the position of WVSS with regard to this witness, in relation to the provision of services in Arusha that are not incidental to his accommodation in a safe house; and whether or not the services provided to witnesses in Rwanda would apply to him if he is not a protected witness?  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Mr. President, Your Honours, we are really touching on the issue that the witness didn't want to bring out.  This is why I was saying a moment ago that I was navigating blind.  I thought that it was necessary to have it explained to the witness that all relationships between a witness and WVSS, despite or irrespective of their status, are in place as far as he is concerned.  But now if he is asking this Chamber that WVSS guarantee him assistance in case he has any problems, I think he was talking in the conditional because he doesn't have any specific problem at the moment to which he may be referring, but he wants guarantee that in the event of difficulties in the future that our section intervene.  It is sort of as if he is asking for life insurance.  And even in that instance when you are asking for life insurance, you need to specify what kind of insurance you are asking for because how can we sign and insure a life insurance contract without knowing the details, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Essombe, I do not know if you have particular information that you are skirting around, but my question has to do with normal services provided to witnesses.  You see, if there are exceptional situations, I don't expect to get an answer about that and particularly when I don't know what those exceptional circumstances are or may be.  But my question has to do with the provision of services within the established policy of WVSS.  And the question that seems to have arisen is whether this witness will have access to those services if we withdraw the protection of identity concealment?  That is what my question is. 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
In that case, Mr. President, I don't want to repeat the same answer.  Yes, it is a very simple answer, yes; but there is a but.  If the request comes from the witness and it is in line with the rules, it doesn't go outside of the rules, then there is absolutely no problem.  But, Mr. President, for the purposes of the record and for informational purposes, I would like to point out that WVSS is a bit surprised at this stage that there are some things that are not being said.  We, for this reason, don't want to give any guarantees, blanket guarantees, without knowing exactly what we are dealing with here.  But as regards the normal functioning with relationships between the WVSS and witnesses, nothing has changed.  We cannot go beyond what our rules authorise us to do, and the rules of this Tribunal authorise us to do.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.

Now, Mr. Witness, you have heard the discussion between myself and the representative of WVSS.  Has that answered your concern?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you for letting me speak. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I wasn't merely asking for a speech, sir, I was asking for an answer to my question. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  I was going to raise another issue; perhaps this should be reserved for later as you have just advised me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I cannot advise you because I do not know what the issue is.  If it is not related to what we are talking about now, perhaps it could be dealt with later.  I want, at this stage, to make an order to modify the protective measures in relation to you by deleting the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 6, and      paragraphs 9 to 12.  And leaving in place only those two provisions that I mentioned to you, dealing with photographic and other electronic publications and the requirement for the Defence to notify the Prosecution of their intention to interview you.

I think the Chamber is satisfied that it would be appropriate to make that order, to permit you to give testimony in public; and the order is now made.  So your testimony will continue without any provision for the concealment of your identity.

Could you swear the witness, please?  

Thank you, representative from WVSS.

Yes, I think I should formally declare that the witness is giving evidence in public.  
MR. MJUI:
Please stand up.
(Declaration made by Ahmed Napoléon Mbonyunkiza in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  

You will now be examined by the Prosecutor.

AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Could you begin by telling us --  
A.	My name is Ahmed Napoléon Mbonyunkiza.
Q.	Would you kindly tell us the year of your birth, please? 
A.	I was born on the 15th of July 1968. 
Q.	Can you tell us how old you were in 1991, because that is the year that I would like to start asking you questions about? 
A.	In 1991, I was 23 years old. 
Q.	Can you tell us the city and the country that you were living in at that time? 
A.	Yes, I lived in the city of Kigali, in Rwanda. 
Q.	Can you tell us your ethnicity, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Hutu. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us the ethnicity of your parents? 
A.	My father is Hutu; however, my mother is Tutsi. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you a member of a political party in 1991? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	Tell us what led you to become a member of the MRND? 
A.	I joined the MRND party because of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, later the party's ideology seemed acceptable to me and I chose to remain a member of the party. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, when you say that you became a member because of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, can you explain that to us please?  What do you mean by that? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse was an intellectual.  He wrote a book, which was a school book for the 6th year, a grammar book.  Many different points were dealt with in the book, but I won't go into them in detail before the Chamber.  At the time, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a visionary, and for that reason I joined the party.  I wanted to develop in his wake and so I decided to join the MRND party.  

At that time the MRND bureau was located in a building that belonged to Mr. Rubangura.  It was located near the APO School where I had studied, where I had finished my studies in 1991.  And so I joined the party in the hopes that the party could perhaps find me a job.  I should point out that the office located in the building belonging to Mr. Rubangura was called the regional building for           Kigali town.  In that building Mathieu Ngirumpatse had his own offices.  I began as an volunteer, and so I wasn't paid for anything that I did.  During that work I met Mr. Ngirumpatse and was able to assess the ideology of the MRND party. 
Q.	Thank you for your response.  I'm just trying to get a bit more detail from you.  When you say the bureau was located in the Vedaste building, could you explain that?  I'm not sure I follow you.  Tell us exactly what you mean in relation to the Rubangura Vedaste building? 
A.	Vedaste Rubangura was a businessman.  He had several properties in Kigali town.  The building I am talking about is located in Muhima, near Kigali prison in a place where there is also a military camp.  That building was rented out by the MRND, which had set up its regional offices there.  Early on, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was chairman of the regional bureau of the MRND in Kigali before he accepted a different post, that, perhaps, we will discuss later. 
Q.	And how did it come to past that you started to do voluntary work at that building? 
A.	When I went to that bureau I was looking for work.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse advised me to begin as a volunteer, waiting for a paid job.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse gave me that job, and he talked to the minister of justice.  And I obtained the job after working as a volunteer for some time at the MRND. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, at the time that this was transpiring, were there other political parties, or was this during the period when there was only one political party? 
A.	As far as I was concerned, there was the MRND when I was still a secondary student.  But then multi-party politics was introduced to Rwanda.  At that time I remained in the party I had joined prior to that, in other words, the MRND.  On the 1st of June 1991, multi-party politics was introduced.  And on that date I decided to remain in the MRND because I considered that the party had experienced politicians.  But I do know that there was also the PSD, the PDC, the PL and other political parties whose names I no longer remember, but other parties were, indeed, created. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to direct your attention to the MRND party as it existed in the context of multi-partyism with respect to the party.  At that stage of its development, can you tell us a bit about how it was organised? 
A.	Let me try to clarify for you, and I may use a few French terms.  There is a national committee, a political committee and the prefectural committees; after that communal committee, and then in the secteurs there were committees.  However, I cannot remember all of the details of the organisational chart; but, in general, what I have just told you, those different committees made up the MRND party at the time. 
Q.	Well, how was the leadership of the party organised? 
A.	As regards the party leadership, you first had the chairman of the party, then vice chairman.  I don't know if you want me to give you general explanations, because the party structure was modified during a national congress of the party.  During that national congress the organisational structure of the party was changed and I don't know if you want me to talk about the party prior to that congress or after that congress, because there were some changes that were made. 
Q.	Do you recall when that congress took place, if you could give us an approximate year? 
A.	I believe that the congress took place in 1992. 
Q.	Well, tell us -- describe to us how the party was organised before 1992 and then when you have that explanation, tell us how it was organised after that congress in 1992, so that we have a full understanding of how the party developed? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Prior to 1992, I would say that there was interim leadership of the party.  President Habyarimana continued to be chairman of the party and president of the republic.  Then there was a secretary general of the party.  At that time Édouard Karemera was that person.  He was also called Rukusanya, that was his nickname.  He was the person who had gathered all of the ideas together to come up with a draft programme for the party in 1991. Then in each prefecture there was a chairman of the party, but they were also working on an interim basis.  Then you had interim chairman at the communal level.  

	Then after the national congress, a request was made.  The request was that President Habyarimana be appointed to the head of the party.  Then there were two vice chairmen.  The first vice chairman was Édouard Karemera, and the other was Kabagema.  And then there was the national secretary.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was elected to the post of national secretary at that time.  After that, you had party representatives on the prefectural and on the communal level.  Personally, I was elected as one of the ten members to represent Nyarugenge commune.  

Those elections took place in 1992.  I believe that is how the MRND was organised at that time.  
Q.	With respect -- excuse me, with respect to the organisation of the party after 1992, could you tell us which office holder held the most influence in regulating party affairs? 
A.	I would like to correct what you just said.  It is not after 1992 but, in fact, after 1991.  If we look at the period after 1992, we will have to talk about 1993.  

Now, I did not personally hold an influential position, but I had two positions.  I was also chairman of the JMRND in Kigali prefecture, and I was elected to that post in 1991 prior to the national congress that I referred to earlier.  Now, with regard to the post in Nyarugenge, I was elected to my position in 1992. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We will get into the structure of the party at the local level in a bit, but I would still like to discuss the party on the national level.  So, accepting your correction that I should couch the question post 1991, just think about the national leadership, the structure of national leadership and explain to us how the national leaders functioned, and which office holder was the most influential in regulating the party? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Let me explain, I would say the national secretary was influential.  He was the person who followed the daily activities of the party.  He was the person who was paid, who had a paid position, the party rules called for that.  There is no need to hide the name.  It is, indeed, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He was the person who coordinated all of the party's activities at the time in question.

Later on, he was appointed to a different position, and perhaps we will have an opportunity to speak about that later.  
Q.	Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse the national secretary of the party when you had your first conversation with him, when you yourself decided to join? 
A.	At that time, Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the MRND representative for the city of Kigali.  But after that, he was appointed to the position of national secretary.  And after that appointment we continued to have conversations and we met on a regular basis. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when you say you met on a regular basis, can you give us an idea of what you mean; how often would you meet and what would be the basis of your meeting, what did you talk about?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  He was chairman of the Kigali committee.  I was chairman of the JMRND, although later on I was appointed -- or elected to the Nyarugenge communal committee.  Together we had to participate in meetings.  We were often together at the office; even after he was a minister he continued to call weekly meetings.  Those meetings assembled the members of the communal committee in Kigali.  There were at least 30 participants in such meetings.  

During those meetings, there were also MRND leaders who were present.  They participated based on the different topics that were up for debate.  So we would see each other during the week, during those meetings; but he often came to the office to coordinate MRND activities within Kigali prefecture.  So, he would come by the office either to draft or sign documents.  It is in that context that we would meet one another.  Later on, he offered me a job within the ministry of justice.  After that, we continued to meet one another and we talked about party affairs.

In the end, and I will explain this in detail, I was disappointed.  He did not meet my expectations.  I thought that he was an intellectual with constructive ideas.  In the end, in the final analysis, I learned, in fact, it was quite the contrary. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness.  Can you describe Mr. Ngirumpatse to us, physically?  Tell us what he looks like, as you remember him? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse is of average height.  I don't know if he has gained any weight since the last time I have seen him.  He was -- he had a fair complexion.  He often spoke with his hands in his pocket, that is one detail that I remember, I remember that very well.  He was also quite eloquent.  You could notice that before he would speak he took the time to think about it.  That is what I can tell you about Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, if you were to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse again today, do you think you would be able to recognise him? 
A.	Without any doubt I would be able to recognise him. 
Q.	I will invite you to take a look around the courtroom today, Mr. Witness, and tell us if you see              Mr. Ngirumpatse anywhere in the courtroom? 
A.	I don't know if the Presiding Judge will allow me to stand to be able to indicate to you the person whose on the other side of the room. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have to walk over there. 
THE WITNESS:
He is seated, he is between a white person and a lady who I can see in the last row; he is wearing glasses. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you see how he is dressed from where you are? 
A.	No, I can't see very quickly, but I have seen he has taken off his glasses, earlier he was wearing them but now he is not.  He has his one finger on his cheek. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I have the record indicate that the witness has identified Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
THE WITNESS:
May I have a seat, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

It is now 12:35. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We can break if -- we can break now, Your Honours, and return after lunch if that is the Court --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we published a scheduling order where we were going to have lunch from 12:30 to 2:00.  So, we will take the luncheon adjournment now.

Mr. Witness, we are going to break for lunch.  Now, during this, as on any other adjournment while you are a witness in this trial, you are not to discuss the case with anybody, or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I think we had discussed this in one of our pre-trial conferences, but maybe this is a good time to make this explicit.  We had asked for a practice direction that the witness -- once the witness commenced testimony he was to have no contact whatsoever with either party, absent leave of the Court, regardless of whether they are discussing the content of the testimony or not.  So, I would ask that you make this order for this witness, as well as all other witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well I thought I just told him that he is not to speak to anybody about the case or his testimony. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, you did, Mr. President.  But I believe what has been requested is that he not speak with any member of either party, period; not limited to this case or testimony, but period. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The usual practice in our office, Your Honour, is to refrain from any contact with any witness while they are testifying.  So, of course, that is what I expect to do.  I don't think the Court needs to make an order to that effect, it is implicit, it is understood.  I will not have any contact with this witness while he is on the stand.  I will go through WVSS to arrange for his appearance and appearances in the morning.  The witness understands where he has to be, I'm sure he can follow the Court's instruction concerning what time he has to be here and what time he has to come back. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, is that note taken in court sufficient for you?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That has the same effect as an order, I would think.  Thank you.  

We will take the luncheon adjournment.

(Court resumed at 1412H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  We can now resume.  

We had invited the Prosecutor to respond to the motion for certification at 2 o'clock.  Are you ready, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, but the response is going to be made by my colleague, Gregory Lombardi, so I will past floor to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. LOMBARDI: 
Very briefly, Your Honour.  

As this Chamber held in its decision on 26th May of 2005, interlocutory appeal from the certification process is discretionary for very limited circumstances.  The Defence needs to meet two conditions, and it needs to meet both of those conditions with a specific demonstration.  Furthermore, in the decision by the Appeals Chamber in the Prosecutor v. Nyiramasuhuko on 4 October 2004, the Appeals Chamber underscored that certification of an appeal has to be the absolute exception when deciding on the admissibility of evidence.  That's at paragraph 5.  

The Prosecutor submits that the Defence for Nzirorera has not met the standard in this particular case.  The issue was whether the Trial Chamber should exclude the testimony of GFJ.  It denied that motion.  The Prosecutor submits that the approach the Trial Chamber adopted is, in fact, consistent with the jurisprudence of this Tribunal.  We refer the Chamber to Prosecutor v. Simba, the decision of 
28th October 2004, in which a similar motion was denied, and the Chamber allowed for the -- exactly the same relief that the Chamber has provided in this instance.  That's at paragraph 6.  

And, further, in decision of Nyiramasuhuko, decision on the 11 June 2002, at paragraph 16, again the Chamber provided for exactly the same relief, even though there were in that case some Rwandan PDs that had not yet come into the possession of the Defence.  So the Prosecutor submits that Nzirorera's submission that the decision is out of step with jurisprudence is incorrect, and that there is no basis for granting certification to appeal.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  We'll take time to consider the decision.  Hopefully we will be able to deliberate as soon as possible.  

Can the witness be called to resume his testimony.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, your testimony resumes.  You are still on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony commenced.  Do you understand that?  Now, The Prosecutor will continue --  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Mr. President, I do understand that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Prosecutor will continue his examination.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Prosecutor. 
Q.	Before we proceed with further questions of substance, I'd like to ask you, do you know Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I know Édouard Karemera, alias Rukusanya. 
Q.	Can you describe his appearance to us, please, as you remember him from 1994? 
A.	Édouard Karemera, that we used to call Rukusanya, was a man that used to wear dark or black glasses.  That was at the time I was a member of the MRND.  Most of the time, I used to see him wear an MRND cap during the meetings.  He is of average height, neither fat nor thin. I don't know whether in the meantime he has changed in any manner physically or any characteristics of his body, but this is the description I can make of him at this time. 
Q.	Do you think you'd be able to recognise him if you saw him today? 
A.	Yes, of course.  Yes, absolutely, I can recognise him. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'd like you to take a look around the courtroom this afternoon and tell us if you see Édouard Karemera anywhere in the courtroom? 
A.	May I ask leave from the president to stand?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under what circumstances did you know him?  
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you very much.  Mr. President, I knew Karemera during the period of multipartism.  First of all, while I was still at school I heard talk of Karemera.  That is when there was talk about the draft constitution of June 1991, that was at the meeting in which all the opinions were brought together and merged.  And then later I knew him as MRND secretary, and then later on he was first vice-president -- first vice-president of the party, that is, the MRND.  I do not know whether I have made a mistake about any office designation, but this is what I knew about Édouard Karemera at the time.  I may have the opportunity of talking about other aspects concerning that gentleman, but I am sure in the rest of my testimony I will be given opportunity to discuss Karemera more.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, you may stand.  
THE WITNESS:  
Sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may stand.  
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you.  

It's that gentleman over there.  He is wearing a yellow tie and a pair of glasses, and a suit.  I believe the suit is blackish in colour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you indicate what row he is sitting in, please? 
A.	That is row 2.  There is a lady first, and he is sitting behind Joseph Nzirorera. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I have the record indicate that the witness has just identified Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think this is now the time of our -- for me to bring up my motion to exclude identification that was filed in the pre-trial stage and to which you had deferred considerations until the trial.  I would ask that the witness be excused so that we could now take that up.  
THE WITNESS:  
May I have a seat?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I may, can I make a suggestion that we address this motion at a later time?  We can proceed with the testimony and still come back to the issue.  If the Court rules in Mr. Robinson's favour, then the witness's identification of his client can be excised from the record.  But I think it would be expedient if we proceed, and we can revisit this issue when we don't have a witness on the stand.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have sent to get a copy of our decision on this matter, but -- so, before we comment on it, just for clarification, what is your objection?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm asking that in-court identifications be excluded as not probative under Rule 89(C) and as an unreliable method of evidence under Rule 95.  These were spelt out in my written motion of 
13 July, and to recall in your decision, you simply said that it was speculative at that time and it should be addressed during the trial.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we said a little more than that. That's why we have sent for the decision.  But we don't have -- I don't need to hear you on it right now for we will discuss it a little later this afternoon.  So your application now is not as regard to any particular aspect of the testimony that has been adduced, but just to the principle of in-court identification?
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, although we have just had an in-court identification and I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so issue is as to the principle.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, then, in that case, right, we will permit the testimony to continue, and as soon as the judgment comes down, we will -- we will hear you more fully on the matter.  

Mr. Webster, you can continue.  What will happen is that in a few minutes we will -- we will decide the matter when we are ready to hear it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've mentioned the name of Joseph Nzirorera.  Can you tell us where you know him from? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do something else in the meantime.  We will come to the discussion of this matter as soon as the decision comes into court.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, earlier this morning we talked a bit about the MRND party before 1992 and after 1992, and at a certain point you made a distinction regarding the year 1991, and I'm trying to clarify that issue this afternoon.  Can you explain to us -- or can you go into more detail in explaining the transition of the MRND party from the single -- from the period of the party state to the period of the multipartyism? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  As regards the structure of the parties during the transition, I think I spoke about this.  However, I'll come back to this issue, given your request.  During the transition period, President Habyarimana was the chairman -- I'm referring to Juvènal Habyarimana obviously -- and then there was the secretary-general.  At the time, that position was filled by Édouard Karemera, alias Rukusanya.  Then came the interim representatives of the party in the préfectures and communes.  These were the individuals responsible for the distribution of cards to members of the MRND.  With regard to my area in Kigali town, at the time, the minister of justice was also chairman of the MRND in Kigali, and his name was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  In Nyarugenge commune, the chairman of the MRND party was known as Gaspard Munyandinda.  He later left the MRND and became a member of UDPER party.  I later on learnt that he was killed during the war because of his ethnicity.  I believe, in brief, that was what the structure of the party was during the transition period.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record the name Gaspard is number 5 on the spelling list that was handed out.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  What I'm trying to understand, though, is the nature of the MRND before multipartyism when there was only one party, and the nature of the party afterwards, when there were several political parties in Rwanda.  Was there any difference in the way the country itself was governed? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  One can refer to the administrative and territorial administration -- transition at the national level.  There was a transition which came about within the MRND itself.  Maybe the transition you're referring -- you are referring to is that concerning the power-sharing between the various parties.  I would like you to be a bit clearer in your question so that I can understand exactly what it is that you require.  You have spoken about the structure of the MRND, but I do not know whether you want me to speak about transition, bearing in mind the political pluralism. 
Q.	Let me put it to you this way, Mr. Witness.  How many préfectures are in Rwanda in April 1994? 
A.	Ten préfectures, over and above the préfecture of Kigali ville.  So all together there were 11 préfectures. 
Q.	Administratively, in terms of how the government was set up in Rwanda before 1991, was there any role that the MRND party itself would play in relation to the administration of the préfectures? 
A.	I think that it would be the politicians of the time who could respond to that question.  At the time I was a student, and I followed politics closely.  There was a single party which was at the helm.  There were no other parties in the country.  Therefore, it had all liberty to appoint and dismiss the various administrators.  I think that it is quite well known that when it's a single party that you have it's the leaders of that party who take decisions regarding administration of the country.  I think at the time it was the MRND which was responsible for the administration of the various préfectures in the country. 
Q.	Would you know how the préfets were nominated during the period of the single party?  In other words, were they elected, or were they appointed?  What was the mechanism in order for someone to be appointed as préfet of one of the préfectures? 
A.	The préfets were appointed by the president of the republic.  I think this is the answer I can give to your question.  These decisions were taken at the level of the council of ministers, and I am relying on my memory.  It was the president of the republic who appointed the préfet, but this was through the assistance of the government. 
Q.	And after 1992, was that also the case, that the president would appoint them? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you are asking me many questions which are very detailed and which would be better answered by Ngirumpatse and Karemera.  Those were the advisors of the president of the republic.  I do not know whether I can answer in their stead, but I did make certain observations during that period of time.  I can, therefore, refer to that in order to respond.  Some préfets were appointed by the parties; others were appointed by the president himself. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, let's look at your own involvement in the party.  Can you remind us of when you, yourself, joined the party? 
A.	Yes, I recall.  I do remember, Mr. President -- Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Tell me the month and the year, please, if you recall.  
A.	I became a member of the party, the MRND party, in September 1991.  Later on I became chairman of the JMRND on the 19th of February -- 19th December 1991.  Later on, the members of the MRND committee in Nyarugenge commune -- that was in 1992 in January.  If I'm not mistaken, it was the 5th of January.  It was a long time ago, so I may be wrong with one of the dates given. 
Q.	Tell us how you came to be elected chairman of JMRND? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am going to try and give you a detailed response because your questions -- your question so requires.  

As far as I'm concerned, before I was elected chairman of the JMRND, I was first of all a member of the Muhima secteur committee.  Afterwards when JMRND was established in Kigali, there were elections which took place in a building known as Eden Garden which belonged to Matierre (phonetic).  At the time, the person who was elected was Robert Simba.  Subsequently, Joanita Ngirumpatse, Mathieu's daughter, was elected, and then there was also Robert Simba's fiancé as treasurer.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter was responsible for the secretariat within the JMRND.  Later on -- we were young at the time, and we observed that there were certain preferences in relation to the candidates, and my colleagues urged me to submit my application.  There were meetings that we boycotted, and later on we required that elections take place, but the youths thought that they wanted to be represented within these committees.  Since the positions I held without -- within JMRND were known, they chose me as chairman of JMRND.  
I realise that you wanted to ask me a question in this direction, and I think in total five people were elected during those elections.  I don't know whether you want me to proceed -- continue further, Mr. Prosecutor.
Q.	Yes, but let me ask you first to tell us what exactly does that mean JMRND; is that a shortened form something?  Explain to the Court exactly what the name of the organisation was. 
A.	JMRND means the youth of the Mouvement Revolutionnaire National pour la Democratie.  Concerning the circumstances under which it was established, I would indicate that when the JDR was established by the MDR, and when the PSD established its own youth wing, the PL also established its own youth wing, JL, the MRND decided to follow suit.  So it's an awareness which came about amongst the local administrative authorities.  So it is under such circumstances that the JMRND was established.  Initially, mention was made of JMRND, and later on it became JMRNDT -- DD -- JMRNDD. 
Q.	What was the purpose of the organisation?  And I'm referring to the JMRND.  
A.	Normally, the JMRND was responsible for building awareness amongst the youth regarding the ideals of the MRND.  It was a kind of body for recruitment of the youth, and I do believe that our sensitisation efforts was to recruit youths who belonged to other parties, especially the JL (sic).  So the objective of the establishment of the MRND -- JMRND was that at the time.  But, initially, the MRND had other connected association, particularly WAMA SESTRA (phonetic), the worker's union, which had been established by bodies of the MRND, in accordance with the statute of the MRND as a party.  At that time, there were no provisions for the establishment of JMRND when the single party, MRND, was at the helm of matters of government. 
Q.	But you have mentioned quite a few different acronyms: JD, J -- explain to the Court a bit what you mean when you say PSD, PL, the various words that you've used to describe the other organisations.  Explain what all of that is so that we get a clear understanding of what these organisations were and what they were doing.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Let's begin with JDR.  I do not know whether this was the movement -- Mouvement Republicain -- this was the -- JDR was the youth of the MRND party in Rwanda.  As for JL, this was a youth wing was which affiliated to the parti libèrale, Liberal Party.  As for JSD, this was youth wing associated to the PSD party.  However, there were other names used to refer to the various youth wings.  JDR was Inkuba and JSD was known as is Abakombozi.  We'll come back to these names a little later, I presume, because, as you will see, these various associations adopted another stand or position as events progressed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, when you come to an appropriate moment, we are ready to come back to the issue of the -- raised by Mr. Robinson.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
So when you think it's convenient you can just give us a signal and we'll raise it then.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you explained that you were responsible for recruitment.  How did you manage that?  What did you do to recruit?  Tell us what you, yourself, did and how that related to the activities of the party.  
A.	Personally, and in conformity with the programme assigned to us, although the MRND did not provide details, we were asked to ensure that we bring back the various youths who had joined other parties back to the MRND.  I would consult with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in order to work out strategies.  And we created income-generating activities in order to bring together the youths so as to enable them to obtain income.  We were thinking that that strategy would attract the youths, and we would use that opportunity to sensitise them to the ideals of the party, MRND.  Let me give you an example.  In Muhima, where I started off, we had established an association which would manufacture 
	khaki-coloured envelopes.  This was the recycling of empty bags which normally contained cement and we made envelopes.  Mathieu had promised us a funding for this.  And for the establishment of such associations, we brought together the largest number of youths possible within these associations.  I'm speaking to you about my own initiative when it comes to organisation of the JMRND.  Mathieu made promises to me in this regard, but as you will see later on, he had other projects in mind.  

I think I can stop on this point, but I had forgotten an important aspect.  There was peaceful and close collaboration with the other political parties to the extent that during our cooperation with other youths, we thought that the MRND was one of the active parties regarding multipartyism.  We were to work towards the building of the nation, together with other parties.  Those were my objectives at the time.  I had to meet various personalities, including Bernard Ndeyishimye (phonetic).  I believe he now occupies a post.  I think he is the deputy ombudsman.  I met him frequently in order to try and think about our working relationships.  

During our meetings, I realised that my objective -- my objectives could not be attained because the organisation of these associations took a turn, as we shall see further on -- later on. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you refer to Mathieu, are you referring Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I do apologise.  Each time I refer to Mathieu, I'm intending Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and if I happen to mention only his first name, please understand that I am referring to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	Please try to say the full name of the persons that you're -- you are referring.  

Mr. Witness, did you report to anybody else in the party in your capacity as the chairman of JMRND? 
A.	Actually, at that time I worked closely with Mathieu Ngirumpatse because he was in the office of the Kigali préfecture -- Kigali town préfecture, and the reports of the JMRND were given directly to Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who was one of the founders of -- well, the main ideas behind the establishment of that institution.  And he was also responsible for the establishment of Interahamwe as an organisation, but we'll come to that later.  So it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was to help us, and it was to him we made all our reports and he was also the one responsible for the coordination of all the MRND préfectural activities during this period of time, which I would call the transition period. 
Q.	And during that period, how -- what was the -- what was the membership of JMRND, number-wise?  You, as chairman, presided over how many other members of your organisation at your level? 
A.	The members were not that many at the time.  They were about 100 or so because these were early days.  Yet for the existence of that structure -- and we were still in the recruitment drive, and we were based mostly in the three communes of Kigali ville at the préfecture, because when the positions were established it's as if the MRND had not followed, and the MR -- the other parties had drained all the youths available, and the MRND came about much later.  But, later on, the MRND wanted to catch up by the establishment of the Interahamwe organisation, but as I said earlier, we'll come to that later. 
Q.	You mentioned also that you were the -- you were lucky to be elected to the comité communal of the MRND. Tell us what your responsibilities were in that position. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  If I was elected in the communal committee of the MRND, it's because I was in the structure of the JMRND.  Amongst the members of the commune committee, it was necessary to have somebody who represented the youth within the Nyarugenge communal committee.  And that's how I came to be elected to that position.  At the time, the chairman was Jacques Rusirari and there was Angeline Mukandutiye, and I believe that I will speak about her later on.  But as we shall see, the plan changed, and within this communal committee, I was the representative of the MRND youth.  And since Mathieu brought us together every week, together with officials of the party in Kigali town and the three communes, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge and Kacyiru, we needed to continue to work as a group.  At that time, we did not have a particular policy to follow with regard to MRND's activities, but otherwise the ten members of the communal committee were called upon to work together as a team. 
Q.	And what was the objective of your work, what did you have to do as a committee?  What were your responsibilities?  What was the purpose of the communal committee? 
A.	Just like all the other parties had a structure, maybe it's difficult to express that reality in Kinyarwanda, but each party had its operational modes.  And in the MRND there was a defined structure, and the MRND was well organised, administratively speaking, from top to bottom.  We wanted, therefore, to recruit members, and in that process, everyone contacted their friends and encouraged them to join the party.  This is how the MRND itself operated.  It is, therefore, within that framework that we needed to try and recruit new members and ensure that there was an awareness building so that new members would join the party. 
Q.	But could you describe the hierarchy to us?  Who was at the top, and how did it make its way down to the bottom, within the MRND I'm saying? 
A.	Thank you.  Regarding the organisation of the MRND, during the multipartyism period after the elections, it was the national congress which was to take decisions at national level and decision, which were taken during such a congress were binding.  After the congress, there was the national bureau, and it was the national bureau which decided on national policy for the party.  Within the political bureau -- it was, rather, the political bureau, not national bureau, I'm sorry -- there was the chairman of the MRND and the two vice-presidents, then there was a national secretary, and then there were representatives of the party at préfecture levels.  Amongst the préfecture representatives, there were also members of préfectural committees, and then we would have the communal committees represented.  

But now coming back to your question, Mr. Prosecutor, which concerned the organisation of the MRND as a party and its various structure, I should also add that there was -- there were structures of the party at secteural level, but the MRND did not abandon power because even when multipartyism came about, the MRND maintained their members who had been appointed to the various administrative positions, and it's these same individuals or personalities who carried out the various activities within the party.  So you could have a conseiller de secteur who was also a chairman of the MRND at the secteur level, or a bourgmestre who was also at the same time chairman of the party at commune level.  And this was always decried by members of the opposition parties because during the Arusha Accords, it had been said that you cannot be a president and a member of the party, and reference was being made to the president, Habyarimana, at the time.  

Within the MRND, the administrative functions in the country were maintained at the same time as positions within the party, and this is what led to the genocide which ruined our country, and we can come back to that later. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe we can pause here, Your Honour, and take the application that you had suggested.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Pages 29 to 38 by Gifty C. Harding)










1515H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  I've got access to the decision to which you referred, and I think that the decision did not defer adjudication but ruled on your motion.  What we said was that when evidence is being adduced, if you wanted to object to its admissibility, you could do so at the time, and we would rule on it.  So the motion, per se, it has been ruled on, but if you have any objection to the admissibility of any evidence that has been led, then we could hear you on that and rule on it.  Now, that's why I had asked you to formulate exactly what it was you were objecting to, but I don't think we need to hear you on the motion you filed because we ruled on it completely.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, Mr. President.  So I'm prepared now to make a motion to exclude the identification of Mr. Nzirorera, to object to that identification and be heard on that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes.  Well, there are two issues here.  Do you object to what the witness said, or do you object to Mr. Webster's statement?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I object to the testimony of the witness identifying Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Mr. Witness, it is usual when we have legal discussions about the testimony of a witness, that the witness does not hear those legal discussions.  So I am going to ask you to leave the court for a short time while this matter is being discussed.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, pursuant to Rule 89(C) and Rule 95, I move to strike the identification of Mr. Nzirorera by this witness which has been made in court.  Rule 89(C) provides that a Chamber may permit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But Mr. -- Mr. Robinson, what the witness -- the witness was being asked to identify somebody other than your client, and he simply said that that person was sitting behind Mr. Nzirorera.  What do you want us to strike from the record?  

MR. ROBINSON:
The reference to Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, you see, what happened afterwards was that Mr. Webster said, "Let the record show the witness has identified (unintelligible)," but that's not what the witness said.  The witness was locating somebody's position in court.  I think that's really a matter for weight at a later stage of our deliberations.  I don't see how that could be ruled inadmissible.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think this is a very fine point, Mr. President, that you're trying to raise here, and maybe I'm not appreciating it so well.  But the testimony that is now on the record is that the witness has identified my client.  Maybe it was incidental to identifying someone else, but nevertheless, that is the testimony that is now on the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's my position that such testimony is inadmissible.  Therefore, we don't get to the issue of weight because this should not be admitted in the first place.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but we have ruled on that already.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't see where you have.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We said that if you objected to the -- you see, I think paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 of our decision address this very issue.  You see, what we see, what we think has happened is that the witness has given testimony.  Whether that testimony amounts to an identification or not is a matter for this Court to determine after considering this evidence and other evidence and we have assessed the value -- the probative value of the testimony.  The mere fact that a witness has pointed out somebody in court does not indicate what the finding of the Court is going to be.  That's evidence which the Court will consider in due course.  

Now, in this particular case, we -- the witness was not asked to identify Mr. Nzirorera.  He was pointing out somebody else's position in the court and said, "That person is sitting behind Nzirorera."  We don't think that that is evidence which should be excluded from the record.  It's a matter which we will take into account when we come to make assessment.  We -- we have specifically said that we did not think that the concept of in-court identification should be outlawed but that the admissibility of testimony will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  We didn't think that that testimony offended the rules of relevance or admissibility in any way.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, looking at your decision, you've indicated that the Chamber holds that excluding in-court identification at this stage is premature.  If the identification is proffered as evidence, the Chamber will then decide if it's admissible pursuant to Rule 89(C) and Rule 95.  Now, my question is, premature to what?  Because what we have just had in this courtroom is an -- is a testimony that the witness has recognised my client, Joseph Nzirorera.  So it seems to me that what you said was premature has now come to pass, and therefore it is time for you to rule on my objection to his identification.  Now, am I missing something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I thought I had just ruled.  I said we have ruled that it is not -- well, I said it was not inadmissible.  I can't say that we ruled it admissible, that it didn't seem to offend the rules of admissibility to us.  Your motion called for a general motion that in-court identification, per se, is inadmissible.  We didn't think that that was an appropriate way to approach the matter.  We explained that, in our view, that when testimony is given dealing with the identification of a witness, the Court will evaluate its admissibility on a case-by-case basis, and if the evidence is admitted, the Court will determine what weight, if any, to give to the identification after it has heard all the necessary information and testimony.  

So what we -- what we intended to do -- and we thought we'd explained it quite clearly -- that if testimony was proffered by a witness which you thought ought not to be admitted, you'd object to the admissibility of that testimony, and we would rule on it.  Ruling on it does not indicate a finding that the identification has been made.  We ruled on the admissibility of testimony.  And in due course, we will decide whether or not there has been a proper identification of the witness.  But we thought that the testimony from this witness was relevant.  It was a spontaneous statement, and we thought that it did not offend the rules of admissibility.  So that's the ruling that we made, that this evidence was admissible.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr. President, just so I'm clear and, perhaps, the record is clear for appeal, the grounds that an in-court identification is not admissible pursuant to Rule 89(C) and Rule 95, has been disposed of in your decision?  Is that correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I thought the decision was very clear.  It says -- it concludes, "For the above reasons, the Chamber denies the motion in its entirety."  I mean, there's no ambiguity there.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, the ambiguity comes in the paragraph before that which indicates that the excluding identification at this stage is premature. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You wanted us to rule in advance before any evidence was proffered.  It didn't seem appropriate to make a ruling before evidence is tendered.  The Prosecutor tenders evidence.  When he tenders the evidence, we will decide whether it is admissible or not.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, evidence was just tendered here.  You made an objection, and we have ruled that that evidence is admissible.  There might be other occasions when we rule the other way, but we -- our decision required you to object to the admissibility of evidence when it is tendered.  Now, that is what happened just now.  So I thought this is consistent with the ruling that we made.  But it is just that in this case we thought that the evidence given was admissible.  So that's the ruling that we made.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President, I understand.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry if it was not clear before, but we -- okay.  Thank you.  

The witness can be -- 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President?  Pardon me for interrupting you, Mr. President.  I would like more information regarding the decision you have before you that you and Mr. Robinson are dealing with.  I would like to know the specific date of that decision, not necessarily -- I'm not necessarily looking for the content but just more references with regard to that decision.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can do better than that.  I can give you my copy, and I'll ask the court officer to bring it for you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Mr. President.  I was wondering whether or not it was a decision that was drafted in English.  You and Mr. Robinson were able to have an exchange, and as we've seen, this is a very important issue for these proceedings.  As you will have noticed, the Defence team for Karemera has been completely excluded from this discussion.  I just wanted to point this out because I've just realised how important, in fact, this issue is.  This helps us to move forward in the proceedings on a daily basis, and we are not in a position to give our opinion on these issues, and, once again, Mr. President, I wanted simply to point this out because it is quite problematic for the Defence for Karemera.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, this particular motion was filed by counsel for Nzirorera, and the decision related to his motion.  We think that these motions affect all of the Accused and that the information is available to everybody.  You had not raised any objection to the testimony, so we didn't have to rule upon any -- any matter relating to your client, but Mr. Robinson's objection has, in my view, raised the question.  We have ruled on it, and I am not certain that there's anything else that's required, but if you have -- it's open to you at any stage to raise an objection if you wish.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, if Mr. Robinson's motion is important for all of the Accused persons, your decision is all the more important.  It is fundamental for the Accused.  It is on that basis that we, on the Defence side, will decide how to proceed.  And Mr. Robinson's motion is just one example of a very important one, and your decisions are very important for us, and that is why we need to have them in a language which we understand.  And this will help all of us move forward in these proceedings.  When we have simultaneous translation in court, there are no problems, but when we are referring to issues that are written documents and we don't have the translation, it is much more difficult.  And it is difficult for me to follow this type of debate when the decision hasn't yet been translated.  Why is it important to us?  And at times, I might even lose track of the conversation because you have decided a few days or months before on certain issues.  Even decisions that you have taken months ago sometimes are not translated.  I simply wanted to bring this to the Court's attention, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that.  You see, we have thought -- I'm sorry if you are in difficulty, but the decision was published in the usual way.  It's available to all of the Accused persons.  And there's the standing matter of your bilingual, legal assistant whose participation in your programme would assist in alleviating some of these difficulties.  We feel pretty strongly that in a case of this nature, that you should take advantage of the facilities that are provided to assist in these areas.  I don't know what other assistance we can give at this time, but I will inquire as to what's happening on this issue and see if there's any further assistance we can give.  But if there are any particular decisions that have not been translated, which you think are important to you, I invite you, once again, to liaise with the trial coordinator in our case who will provide what assistance can be done to smooth out administrative issues if there are any.  

Call the witness.  We are going to take a recess at quarter to four.  
(Witness re-enters courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, we have completed our discussions, and your examination will now continue.  The Prosecutor will continue to ask you questions.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, earlier this afternoon you called the name "Joseph Nzirorera."  Will you tell us how you come to know Joseph Nzirorera?  
A.	As a Rwandan who was 23 years old at the time, I was interested in politics.  Joseph Nzirorera was always a member of the government.  I think that he would acknowledge as much today.  Joseph Nzirorera at the time was minister of public works.  He was well known.  It would have been impossible for me not to know who he was, especially since he was someone who always had the trust of President Habyarimana.  His name appeared in all of the newspapers.  

Moreover, Joseph Nzirorera was part of the central committee for the party.  He also worked in Ruhengeri.  He had many activities and found jobs for people from the northern part of the country.  When I speak about his activities, I mean his activities as minister of public works.  

I should underscore that I did not come here to tell lies.  Everything I've said is the truth, and if ever I haven't spoken the truth, he can always contradict me.  For those same reasons, I have asked to testify freely, and I wanted to speak about everything that happened.  This is how I knew Joseph Nzirorera.  

Now, with regard to the massacres that were perpetrated, I never saw Nzirorera in my area.  Questions should be put to him on that subject but in a different context.  Personally, I don't know how much or if he was involved in the massacres.  I only know that he was a minister and that he was very close to Habyarimana.  This was reported in all of the newspapers.  Otherwise, I know nothing more in particular about Nzirorera.  The people I know most about are Ngirumpatse and Karemera.  I was always close to them, even if Édouard Karemera might not remember me.  Perhaps he only knew of me through documents that came to him, but I should say that I was always around Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and perhaps I will have an opportunity to explain more about that.  

There's one other thing that I forgot to mention -- and this is for counsel for Nzirorera specifically -- they wanted to meet me.  And there was a request made to the Tribunal in Kigali, but I did not agree to the meeting because I figured that I didn't have anything to discuss with the Defence.  I remember signing a document to that effect.  They asked me if I agreed to meet with them.  I said that, no, I was not ready to meet them.  Later on, I asked the Prosecutor if he was aware of what was going on, and the Prosecutor said, no, he was not informed of that.  And that is why I started to wonder about my own security.  It was with regard to that specific incident.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's try to stay focussed on the scope of the questions that I'm putting to you.  So I thank you for your response.  It was very detailed, and I appreciate it, but let's move on a bit.  We'll put the issues from this year to the side and just focus on 1991, 1992, and 1993.  Can you tell us -- earlier this afternoon when you were asked to identify Édouard Karemera, you mentioned the name of Joseph Nzirorera here in the courtroom this afternoon.  Can you now describe to us what Mr. Nzirorera is wearing in the courtroom as we speak?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Mr. Nzirorera is wearing a khaki-coloured suit with a sky-blue shirt, and he's also wearing a chocolate-covered (sic) tie.  He is seated between a white man on one side and a black man on the other.  There is no way for me to be mistaken about who he is.  His image appeared in all of the newspapers in Rwanda.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you start to tell us now about the beginnings of the Interahamwe organisation.  You mentioned that word as well in one of your previous responses.  How did the -- how were the Interahamwe formed, and what does that mean, the word "Interahamwe"?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I've already explained this.  The MRND was created, was well structured, and gave the impression that it was ready to collaborate with other opposition parties.  But over time, the situation changed.  I remember in February, the first two weeks of February, Mathieu Ngirumpatse participated in a meeting, as he often did.  I believe that this one was on a Wednesday.  When he arrived to the meeting, which gathered the usual participants of this type of meeting, he arrived with the following people:  Robert Kajuga; Pheneas Ruhumuliza; Georges Rutaganda; Ephreim, who worked in a bank, but I don't remember his last name, Nzanzuwera, perhaps; Eugene Mbarushimana.  He arrived also with Bernard Maniragaba and other people who came with him.  He announced that he was arriving with the Interahamwe leadership.  

If I had to give you a literal translation of the word "Interahamwe," it means people who share a single objective, a common objective.  That is what "Interahamwe" means.  At that time Mathieu Ngirumpatse told us that he brought Interahamwe with him, that he created Interahamwe so that they could work on behalf of the MRND to increase awareness.  There was a Désiré Murenzi who introduced him to us on that occasion.  He said that he was creating that organisation to increase awareness about the MRND.  He personally was there -- or, rather, is here, and he can always contradict what I am saying.  

In the meantime, Désiré Murenzi took the floor at that meeting and said that the Interahamwe were people who were in charge of increasing awareness about the MRND.  So it seemed Murenzi understood the mission of the Interahamwe.  Désiré Murenzi was the director-general of Petrorwanda.  He was a member of the central committee of the MRND.  He was one of the persons who represented the MRND on the préfectural level.  At that time there was a person called Jacques Rusirare.  Sefara was another person who represented Kicukiro commune, if I'm not mistaken.  There was also someone representing Kacyiru commune, and another for Nyarugenge commune.  Jacques Rusirare, who is today head of a company, represented Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	We're going to take things bit by bit a bit --  
A.	They spoke about the creation of the Interahamwe.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's quarter to four now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was a company name the interpreters omitted called "Ameki Colour."  We'd just like to add that, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, this meeting you've been describing, could you tell us the year in which the meeting took place?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.  That meeting took place in February 1992.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short recess now, about 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1548H)
(Pages 39 to 46 by Wendy Molnar)





























(Court resumed at 1615H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  There is a brief matter which we need to address which needs to be done in the absence of the witness. So, once more, I am afraid I am going to have to ask you to leave the courtroom for a short while.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I have a decision on the application brought by Joseph Nzirorera to seek a certification to appeal.  

The Defence for Nzirorera requests the Chamber to grant certification to appeal the Chamber's decision rejection the exclusion, regarding the rejection of the exclusion of Witness GFJ's testimony.  

It argues that the decision erred by adjudicating on the matter contrary to other Trial Chambers under same issue.  

The Prosecution opposes the motion.  Certification to appeal maybe granted if both conditions set by Rule 73B of the Rules are satisfied.

The applicant is required to show how the impugned decision involves an issue that would significantly affect a fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or the outcome of the trial, and that an immediate resolution by the Appeal Chamber may materially advance the proceedings.  Both of these conditions require a specific demonstration and are not determined on the merits of the appeal against the impugned decision.  

Having reviewed the motion, the Chamber considers that the Defence has failed to show that these requirements are met.  It may be admitted that the issue of the admission of Witness GFJ's testimony is related to the fairness and expeditious conduct of the proceedings, but the impugned decision doesn't involve an issue that would effect but significantly affect a fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or the outcome of the trial.  

It must be recalled that in the impugned decision, the Chamber noted that validity into account, the fair trial issue and where appropriate, grant times and facilities to the Defence to get prepared. The first requirement set out by Rule 73B of the Rules is therefore not met.

In addition the intervention of the Appeals Chamber at this stage is not going to materially advance the proceedings.  The certification to appeal must remain exceptional to avoid unfair delays of the proceedings and certainly, it should not be granted only for obtaining a general ruling of the 
Appeals Chamber in the scope of Rule 66 applications.
The second requirement set out by Rule 73(B) of the Rules is also not met.

For those reasons the Chamber denies the motion.

Yes, you can call the witness, please. 
(Witness re-entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
     Mr. Witness, your testimony will now continue.  The Prosecutor will continue to ask the questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness we will pick up where we left off.  You were talking about a meeting that took place in February and you gave the year 1992. How were you invited to this meeting? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  As I have explained to you, there were, was - - there were weekly meetings which were chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse and, I was working in that office as a volunteer within that building and there was also the conference hall and this is how I attended that meeting.  Furthermore, I lived close by the venue of the meeting.  Those who are officers of the Bureau communal needed to attend meetings convened by Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was chairmen of MRND in Kigali-ville.  It is in that context that I attended that meeting.  It was a weekly meeting which was an ordinary weekly meeting.
Q.	So, let me understand you; this was not --, this was in the context of the regular meetings that took place for JMRND or what was the nature of the weekly meeting?  
A.	Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, as I have said to you, there were-- there was a weekly meeting which would be held in Kigali-ville, and it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was to chair that meeting.  So there were members who attended these meetings and as far as I am concerned, I worked in that office and being a member of the commune committee of the MRND, I was attending that meeting in that capacity.  I had a double role. 
Q.	--number of names, are those all persons that attended these meetings on a regular basis?  You have given us names of at least five or six different people.  You mentioned a certain Efrem, a Manuel Gaba, and Kajuga.  Were these all persons that regularly attended those meetings where you were working? 
A.	Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, what I am saying is that it was not only five people who attended that meeting.  I am speaking about the day of the establishment of the Interahamwe.  There were special guests who came who were to direct the activities of the MRND at secteurial and national levels.  They were people coming from those two levels, in other words, the national level and the secteur level.  Now these people were to work together with the other members who represented the MRND at 
	préfectural level.  I am going to explain this later to you because I can't explain everything at the same time.  I will go about this step by step.  If I am too general, I might get all mixed up and this is why I am going to go about this step by step because if we go about these matters too fast, we may skip some of the steps.  So let's follow slowly.  Please allow me enough time and I will remember the various details involved, and I shall give you a listing. 
Q.	Okay.  For this particular meeting that you are describing, approximately how many persons were present, if you can remember? 
A.	At that meeting, apart from the representatives of the MRND at commune level, and in Kigali-ville, I would say we were between 60 and 70 in number.  There were many people.  If you compare the numbers of those who attended other meetings, the participants at this meeting were many in number.  Let me go about this step by step.  I do not want to skip any of the steps involved.  It is important that we are all able to understand the facts because these events brought a tragedy to our country and this is why I want to explain everything.  
Q.	All right.  When you gave the number 60 to 70, I still don't understand if there were 60 to 70 additional participants in the meeting or if the meeting was 60, between 60 to 70 altogether.  If we think about the regular meetings that were going on before this meeting in February, how many people usually attended the regular meetings? 
A.	I was in fact speaking of the number of participants in general because otherwise 30 to 40 people were given assignments or positions.  The number of participants increased gradually.  I am sorry I am mixing my languages, but you will excuse me.  There were several stages, but with regard to this particular meeting we are talking about, I would say that initially there were 30 people who regularly attended the weekly meetings and added to that would be some 30 or so other people that the latter were supposed to be appointed to position. 
Q.	Do you know the agenda of this meeting before it took place? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  Normally, we   would be told of the agenda of meetings and it was the minister of justice who would give us the agenda and he was the representative of the MRND in Kigali-ville.  As for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, he spoke to us about the status of the party. 
Q.	You have mentioned the minister of justice and the chairman of the party, but persons that occupy that office change over time.  So I am going to ask you to try and identify the person you are speaking about by name and say the last name, please. 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I spoke of Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Who presided the meeting? 
A.	It was Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Do you remember what he said to introduce the meeting, given its expanded size?  Was there anything particular that he said? 
A.	You had asked me a question about the agenda on that day; we were not informed of the agenda. Earlier he told us that there were new people and he said that the Interahamwe had been established. He spoke about the members of the Interahamwe organization.  He spoke about their objectives and he introduced each of the participants and the role they played within the party.
Q.	Tell us what he said about the objectives of the organization? 
A.	He told us that the Interahamwe were responsible for awareness building and this was during the first meeting.  Later on, I am going to speak of other meetings which followed.  He said that he had brought the Interahamwe who were to carry out awareness building campaigns for the MRND at national level and he said that the MRND was not very active and that was why he was bringing in these Interahamwe.  I am not telling lies about him.  He is here and he knows about this.
Q.	When you say he introduced national figures, specifically, tell us who he introduced and how he introduced them to the extent that you remember?  Give us the names if you can and their attributions, if you remember them? 
A.	Thank you.  First of all, he introduced Robert Kajuga who was president -- chairman.  He introduced the first vice-president and if I am not mistaken, it was Pheneas Ruhumuliza.  The second vice president was George Rutaganda.  He introduced the secretary general of the Interahamwe who was Ephrem, I don't remember his family name, but he was working with BCR.  He introduced the treasurer, Mbarushimana who was working at the coffee board.  He introduced one Bernard Maniragaba who represented the Interahamwe in Gitega.  In fact, at that location, there was a prosperous bar. As for Muhima, I don't know whether I should continue with the names of persons.  He introduced one Habyarimye.  All these individuals were present. Habyarimye is the son of one Budaraza. I am mixing the names of the people according to the secteurs from where they came.  He also introduced 
	Angeline Mukandutiye.  This lady, Mukandutiye was the head mistress of the primary school of the 
	Holy Family and she was a member of the MRND committee in Nyarugenge commune.  The latter was given the responsibility of leading the Interahamwe in Rugege secteur. 

Mr. Prosecutor, it seems to me that you want to speak; I don't know whether I should go into further detail regarding the establishment of the Interahamwe as an organization. 
Q.	Maybe you can begin by telling us how many secteurs there were in Kigali and describe, explain to the Court what a secteur is in the context of the organization of a commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor. I do not know whether I should start by giving you the names of the secteurs or whether I should explain what happens in the secteurs.  Regarding the territorial administration of the country, the stages were as follows:  First of all, there was the cellule and then the secteur of the commune.  And finally the préfecture came at the top.
Q.	What is the smallest in the area? 
A.	The smallest was - - thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  This is the first time that I am appearing before the Chamber and they are things to which I am not accustomed.    With regard to the grassroots administrative unit, there was first of all what is known as nyumba kumi or ten households.  And then there was the cellule.  The next, the highest level is the presidency and the least or the smallest unit is the nyumba kumi, ten households.
Q.	But tell us of all the intermediate steps, I mean it may be a bit repetitive, but I am trying to understand how it is.  Start from the bottom and then move to the top. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  At the time, the smallest unit because things have changed since the last smallest unit was the nyumba kumi and then came the cellule, then came the secteur and then the commune and then the sous préfecture, the préfecture itself and then the presidency, at least with regard to the territorial administration of the time.
Q.	Now when you mentioned these various names of persons at the secteur level, did those persons have administrative responsibilities with the government or are you only taking about party? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  As I have explained, the MRND accumulated responsibility because it was a single party which was in control of everything.  During the multi-party era the MRND wanted to appoint its representatives in these --at these levels, but the MRND was making an attempt at decentralization and they were leaders within the party and there were also political leaders.  Now, with regard to the persons whose names I mentioned, I had mentioned those who were conseiller de secteur.  So it is within that framework that the MRND cooperated or worked with these people.  I do not know whether I have answered our question properly because I do believe I am still standing ready to provide you with further explanation if need be.
Q.	Okay. Do you remember how may secteurs were represented during that meeting in the meeting? 
A.	During that meeting, there was a representative of Muhima, Chahafi representatives, Gitega, Rugenge, Nyakabanda, Nyamirambo, Getsata, Kimirasagara.   I think there was the representative of Nyarugenge secteur because there were 10 representatives in all.  The others who attended that meeting came from other communes.  I do not remember any secteur representative or I do not remember any secteur representative from other communes.  So I attended the meeting in my capacity as MRND representatives in the commune.
Q.	Besides Mathieu Ngirumpatse, did anybody else speak during the course of this meeting? 
A.	As I have explained, Desire Murenzi took the floor and he said that the Interahamwe were going to carry out an awareness building campaign for the MRND.  Robert Kajuga also took the floor and he said that he had nothing further to add given what his predecessors had said and he said that these fools, he said that he was going to see to those fools who wanted to attack the party.  When he said fools, he meant the members of the other parties in particular PL, PSD, especially the youth wings of those parties.  

Then Mathieu Ngirumpatse closed the meeting and he reminded the attendants that the objectetive of the Interahamwe was the awareness building on behalf of the party. People understood him thus, and as I am going to explain during meetings which followed, things changed.
Q.	When was the next meeting that transpired? 
A.	Another meeting took place two weeks after the first.  These meetings were weekly.  They were meeting held every week.  One week later, a meeting took place and another week later again, another meeting took place. 
Q.	All right, tell us about the second meeting, did anything different happen during the second meeting? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  During the second meeting, Mathieu Ngirumpatse presided over the meeting.  He was the one presiding over the meetings of the Interahamwe and members of the MRND.  He would give the floor to the Interahamwe.  That was the objective of the establishment of the Interahamwe.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke during that meeting and he said that the Inkotanyi were continuing to provoke him. He also spoke of members of the opposition group, in other words those who did not have the same ideology as the MRND and the Interahamwe in general.  He we said we needed to pursue the Inkotanyi, we know members of the Inkotanyi and he said there were Tutsis who are members of the Inkotanyi as well as members of the opposition.  He said that it was necessary that they be pursued and killed.  After having said those words, he went on to add that that people needed to do all in their power in order to do the work. It was that context that one, Barnard who had a shipping company talked about Cyangugu.    That individual had the MRND emblem and during the single party regime, the colours of the MRND were red, yellow, and green and there was an objective which he brought which contained the MRND flag.   He also showed the tie that should be worn.  And he also brought the kitenge firebric of the super like kind which were to be used by the Interahamwe and other members.  The members of the Interahamwe especially received the firebric free of charge whereas the members of the party were to buy cloth for 500 francs.    It seems to me you want to speak,
	Mr. Prosecutor?

1645H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yes, I would like to ask you what you mean by the Inkotanyi, or what did that refer to, what did that term refer to in the context of that meeting? 
A.	At the time, Inkotanyi meant -- I would say that I know that outside of country there were people who called themselves Inkotanyi, but within the country, people like Mathieu Ngirumpatse said Inkotanyi meaning that you were the enemy of the country, or meaning that you were Tutsi or also meaning that you were a member of the opposition.  When one said Inkotanyi, one meant that the Tutsi should be exterminated.  Inkotanyi was disparaging as a word, was not a good word at all, it was disparaging and described the Tutsi.  The Hutu were sensitised, thus for the purpose of getting the Tutsi killed.  I will give you more explanation in proportion as we go on, Mr. Prosecutor and Mr. President.  
Q.	What was the situation with the war when this meeting was going on? 
A.	Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  At the beginning of the war, that was in 1990,  the war erupted on the 1st of October 1990, but let me tell you what happened on the 4th or            5th of October.  On the 4th of October, in the night, you asked me to explain the situation that prevailed during the war, let me begin then by saying something about the events of 1990 -- I thought you wanted to speak, sir. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  I am trying to understand, what was the situation of the war in relation to this meeting of 1992?  So I understand that you may want to begin in 1990, but I am trying to focus you specifically on February 1992.  So, was the country at war at that moment when these meetings were taking place? 
A.	At the 1992 meeting, during that period, the war was rife in the north of the country.  There was intense fighting in the north of the country.  And I do remember that the Inkotanyi attacked and captured Butaro, they even went to open the Ruhengeri prison doors.  I do remember, as well, the Inkotanyi at a certain time got very near Gironji and the fighting was raging.  I probably should stop there because you seem to want to take the floor, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	In relation to what you've just described, the fighting in the north, the breaking of the prison, were these events that were taking place in 1991, 1992, 1993, because you described the war as raging in 1992.  And I am asking you to re-examine that and tell me if that is accurate? 
A.	Your Honours, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, if I were to explain what happened during the war, that would be very difficult for me.  I wouldn't be able to pinpoint the various events as compared to the various dates.  What I am trying to do is tell you what I do remember.  It was a long time ago.  I do remember only certain aspects, but I think that during that period, war was raging.  Those that were inside of country -- when I say the country I mean Rwanda, during that period, war was rife.  The war only ceased with the Arusha Accords.  As proportioned, as the negotiations went on, the war was slowing down.  I do remember one army in the north that was working to stop the war.  So that there were the Arusha peace talks, and in the course of the Arusha peace talks, the war subsided.  But during that period of calm, the Interahamwe intensified their attacks.  

Now, let me go with you through this stage by stage; however, Judges, Mr. Prosecutor, if I may say so, you may get the facts from those people that led the fighting.  They would be in a better position to give you details about the dates.  
Q.	All right, let's move on to the next meeting that you attended in relation to the Interahamwe.  Was there another meeting? 
A.	Let me explain this very clearly, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, you talked about the meeting of the Interahamwe; it was not the meeting of the Interahamwe, it was a meeting of the MRND party.  It was that meeting that was called to introduce the Interahamwe.  So we shouldn't make a mistake; we should distinguish the two.  It is not a meeting of the Interahamwe that we are talking about, because if you say so that would be tantamount to you saying that I was an Interahamwe and that all MRND members were Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe had their own characteristics.  They should not be mingled with the other groups.  But gradually, all of the killers were called Interahamwe.  

So now, let me take you through this stage by stage.  Now, I should tell you how the Hutu were involved in massacres; how the Hutus joined the power wing.  Now, as far as that second meeting concerning the creation of the Interahamwe was concerned, let us review what was said during that meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we will take it stage by stage, but you started with one meeting, the first meeting when Mathieu Ngirumpatse introduced the number of leaders.  You mentioned the second meeting where the word Inkotanyi was used.  Was there a subsequent meeting where the Interahamwe met, whether it was under the auspices of the MRND or not.  Was there a third meeting with the same group? 
A.	Thank you most infinitively, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, regarding the second meeting the participants were the people I have already mentioned, but apart from them there were -- there was Gaspard Ukwizagira, there was also Benoît and Augustin Ngirabatware who was minister of economic planning at the time.  
Q.	And this was in relation to the second meeting, which you have just described? 
A.	Let me perhaps repeat, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, at one time -- you interrupted me, I was trying to enumerate the names of people that I remember in conjunction with the first meeting.  

Now, at the second meeting the people I mentioned were there, they attended.  There were people who were given specific assignments, for example the insignia or the Interahamwe material or the equipment, et cetera.  So let me enumerate the names of people that participated in the first meeting, probably not exhaustively, because a long time has gone by.  But please allow me to mention Gaspard Ukwizagira, and Benoît, who had a shipping agency in Kigali town.  These were some of the people who were responsible for gathering the equipment to be used by the Interahamwe in the shortest possible time.  This is why I was saying that if you allow me, Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor; you would kindly give me time to explain all of the various aspects of the first meeting that was as regards the participants, the names of the 30 persons that I can remember.  

It was those people that were deployed into the various secteurs.  But I should also mention the other within the institute of MRND at prefecture level, those people who were given specific assignments for MRND.  Perhaps we should also mention the various meetings or rallies that were organised.  But, please, let us go through this stage by stage, because if not, the picture is not going to be very clear. 
Q.	We are moving ahead, and we can always come back.  You have described the first meeting.  You've described the second meeting.  Let's move on to the next and we can still come back.  Was there another meeting that you attended where the Interahamwe were represented or were meeting with the party? 
A.	Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, regarding the utterances made at the second meeting, it was those utterances that I deemed important before moving on to the third meeting, specifically what was said by Bikindi and what was said by Sukari at the time.  If we were to talk about what took place at the third meeting, without talking about what was said it would not be consistent.  We would not be doing what we want to do properly.  

I would like us to talk about the third meeting after having discussed what happened at the second meeting.  And that was what kind the country -- the situation it was in.  I think this is what you wanted to say (unintelligible), if we are to hasten through the process, then we wouldn't see the truth.  So, I would like to pray that the Chamber allows me to discuss this at length and to expatiate upon it so that the picture is clear. 
Q.	You mentioned Bikindi, tell us who that person was?
A.	Simone Bikindi was somebody with considerable experience in music.  He was the owner of a       dance -- or performance group IRAGIRA (phonetic), it was called.  And these were young people that transmitted MRND messages to the Interahamwe.  And they transmitted messages through songs, and the purpose was to eliminate the Tutsi and a certain category of the Rwandan population.  There was within the Interahamwe in the Gikondo area, as such, a responsibility, that is, for the elimination of the Tutsi. 
Q.	You mentioned Bikindi saying something at the second meeting, tell us what he said? 
A.	Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor.  As far as Simone Bikindi's concerned, I do not want to put words in his mouth.  I know that he is not here in this courtroom, but I am not saying anything that he did not say.  It was Simone Bikindi and Sukari that introduced the song known as Tubatsembe, Let us Eliminate.  And that means, that all of the Tutsi were to be killed, and that included the enemies of Rwanda and the enemies -- I mean, the enemies of Rwanda were the Tutsi.  And those were the songs that were sang in rallies and other gatherings.  And people supported that type of orginisation and approach.  So that the Interahamwe who killed the Rwandans must be known, I'm telling you about the whys and wherefores of the creation of that organisation. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Witness, you said you wanted to take your testimony step by step.  Counsel is trying to focus on the second meeting.  Now you are talking about songs that were song in rallies subsequently?  Can you complete your testimony on the second meeting?  Did Bikindi say anything at the second meeting, and if so, what did he say?  And then complete your testimony of the second meeting.  Then we can move to something else. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much.  Bikindi introduced a song, entitled Tabatsembe, Let us exterminate them, or kill them all.  And it is Bikindi that introduced the song that I am referring to.  I think I covered that particular issue, Mr. Prosecutor.  

I would apologise if I have spoken at length or gone overboard, but there are many things that I would like to say to this august Court, that is probably why I am a little bit too enthusiastic. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	How long did that second meeting last? 
A.	That meeting lasted between 1:00 and 1:30, between one hour, one and a half hours, one hour and one and a half hours.  And that was to organise the collection of the equipment to be used by the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Were there any decisions taken at that meeting? 
A.	Well, at that second meeting, it was decided that the equipment they gathered for the use of the Interahamwe, especially the small axes that were used to kill people, Rwandans, it was             Gaspard Ukwizagira who was entrusted with that mission.  And the MRND was to deliver these were small axes.  They showed us a sample.  These axes were very sharp.  Those that have had the opportunity of seeing, saw people holding axes and riding buses or outside -- or on top of buses with these axes around their belts.  They also were to produce super wax type fabric clothing or uniforms, and were responsible for the sewing of the uniforms. 
Q.	Are you saying that the decision making was made to acquire these things during the second meeting, or were these things actually brought into the second meeting?  Were these things -- 
A.	The axes were just samples.  I do not know how to explain this in Kinyarwanda.  We were shown samples or a sample.  And then later one had to go and get the uniforms sewn up and gather such equipment in great quantity for distribution to the Interahamwe in general. 
Q.	How did the persons at the meeting respond to these suggestions?  In other words, you, for example, when you saw the axe and you heard this talk of the Inkotanyi, what did you think at the time?  What was your response to the type of conversation that was taken place? 
A.	Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, Your Honours so far as my reaction was concerned in the face of the utterances that I heard, I was terribly shocked.  And I decided to resign from the MRND party.  I'm sure we will have time to talk about this later.  Mr. President, Mr. Prosecutor, I was shocked by what was said.  I did not think that a man like Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who had encouraged my decision to join the MRND party, could stand there and speak in that manner.  When Mathieu Ngirumpatse created the Interahamwe organisation, I was very shocked in the light of the atmosphere that obtained there. 
Q.	Can you describe the reaction that you observed among the other participants in the meeting? 
A.	As a participant at that meeting, there was a category of persons that I could call Hutus extremist, they were happy.  I saw that they were very happy about that, happy, showing it.  

Kajuga Robert, for instance, was a Tutsi.  He was somebody who was a sell out.  He was given money.  He was a stooge.  I hope the interpreter will give you the meaning of what I am saying.  He was just a stooge.  He was there just for the show.  Now, as far as the other participants were concerned at the meeting, they applauded and then they went to work.  This is what I could say by way of giving you a picture about the reaction of the participants at the meeting. 
Q.	When you use the word "extremist", what do you mean by that?  When you describe them as being extremists, explain to the Court what you mean what you use the word "extremist"? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Prosecutor, when we use the word "extremist" according to my understanding within that context at that time, I believe -- I hope that the interpreter -- I believe that the interpreter that is interpreting me now does remember the context.  During the genocide, radio stations were set up, for example, the RTLM.  The people I'm calling extremists were selected.  And they were enrolled into the Interahamwe for the purpose of exterminating the Tutsi.  That was the apparent objective, apparent purpose of the organisation, to kill all of the Tutsi and the members of the opposition.  

That is the reason why I decided on what I decided.  And I said to myself that those people who didn't have the courage to resign from the organisation were extremists.  And that is why the whole of the extermination exercise started.  We should talk about this later, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	You mentioned various items that were -- that were discussed at that meeting.  You talked about the fabric.  You talked about an axe.  Was there any discussion of an ID card?  Was there such a thing as a party ID card, or an Interahamwe ID card? 
A.	Thank you Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Prosecutor, at that time also we were shown a card, a membership card, an Interahamwe membership card, which was different from the MRND membership card.  I knew the MRND membership card, but we were shown a different card that was for Interahamwe members, which shows -- which goes to show that there was a plan that was had. 
Q.	Describe the card to us.  What did it look like? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President --  
Q.	Before you answer, any time I ask a question just respond directly to that question.  I understand that are you thanking me and you are thanking the Court.  That portion of your answer extends it unnecessarily.  Just focus on the answer, answer the question directly and wait for the next question, okay.  

So let's take the issue of the ID card again.  Tell us what it looked like? 
A.	Thank you.  Now, as far as that card was concerned, it was white in colour.  In the right corner, there was a space for the photograph of the member or the card holder.  There was also the MRND flag.  And then lower down, there was space reserved for the name of the card holder.  And then, there was a number, the card number, the serial number of the card.  On the back of the card, I believe, there was something written, but I can't remember it.  And this is the card as I saw it. 
Q.	With respect to the material, the fabric that you described, describe that fabric to us.  Tell us about the colours and the patterns on the fabric? 
A.	The fabric, the dominant colour was green on the fabric.  And in the green colour the letters MRND was written in a circle, in a circle, MRND in a circle.  And then there were red dots on the fabric.  And it was also in Holland super wax, or super wax Holland, which is the quality of the fabric. 
Q.	Describe the axe to us.  You described an axe to us; describe what it looked like in size? 
A.	It was a small axe, actually if I had a blackboard I probably could have drawn you one, the hatchet or the axe.  But it was different from the one pictured in the MRND insignia, it had a holder.  And if you remembered the red Indians' carving, like small axes.  They usually hang them around their waist or their belt. 
Q.	Were there any other items that were discussed or displayed during that second meeting? 
A.	At the second meeting, Mathieu Ngirumpatse said that the Interahamwe must ensure the security of the MRND flag, the flags that were at the various secteur offices, the flag flying there.  

Now the second assignment was, of course, the protection of the members of the party.  And, thirdly, they should go after the Inkotanyi.  I have talked about the Inkotanyi, so I shall not come back to that.  Also at that meeting --

1715H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse have anything to say?  What did he say in relation to any of the things that you've described? 
A.	He was the main leader who created the Interahamwe.  I will go on, Mr. Prosecutor.  

What I remember is that he said that he was going to do some fundraising for the Interahamwe.  He would look for funds with businessmen and try to go to the commercial bank, and that also an account at the bank of Kigali needed to be opened, and the funds raised would be deposited into that account.  That money was to be used to buy materials for the Interahamwe.  There was also Felicien Kabuga who was involved in this.  I forgot to mention Kabuga's daughter, Uwine (phonetic).  She later married Eugene Mbarushimana.  
Q.	With respect to Felicien Kabuga, was he present during this second meeting?  Did he attend the meeting himself, or are you just mentioning his name as someone that was somehow involved? 
A.	I did not hear -- I am not here to accuse people of things they did not do.  Kabuga was not there, but with regard to the funds that was raised to buy materials -- 
Q.	Let's move to the next meeting now, the meeting that you attended which was a meeting that could be called a meeting of the Interahamwe or a meeting that the Interahamwe organisation was present.  Tell us who called that meeting. 
A.	Pardon me, I was again going to thank everyone as you told me I should avoid.  

At the end of each week, Mathieu Ngirumpatse said that a meeting had to be held.  You asked me who called the meeting.  I would tell you that there were weekly meetings always called in the same fashion, just like the others.  During the third meeting, there were Interahamwe meetings.  The participants had Interahamwe membership cards.  Those who did not have the cards could not participate in that type of meeting, and this began as of the third meeting.  That is when they started to put together a project. 
Q.	Who was present during this third meeting? 
A.	Besides Désiré Murenzi, who noticed that things were taking a different turn, the others were there.  He was quickly replaced by Ngirabatware, Augustine.  He was minister of planning, who became the honourary president of the Interahamwe.  That was the situation which prevailed at that time.  His nickname was Byumbu (sic).  He said that everything had to be implemented to move forward with the planned activities. 
Q.	With respect to that third meeting, did the number increase from the week before, or did it decrease?  I'm trying to get a sense of the number of the people that attended that third meeting.  
A.	I am telling you the truth, the number of participants increased a great deal, but I am in no position to tell you exactly how many participants there were at that time.  The people participated in the meeting, they were standing.  It was standing room only; there weren't enough seats. 
Q.	Do you recall what Mathieu Ngirumpatse had said during the course of this third meeting?  Can you think -- can you remember anything that he, himself, said during the course of that third meeting? 
A.	He is here to contradict me, but he said the time had come to implement the project, in other words, hunt down the Inyenzi -- pardon me.  I have said what was said in French.  This is what I remembered: Mathieu Ngirumpatse said that the project was now to be implemented.  That project was to look for the Inyenzi and Inkotanyi, and hunt down the members of the opposition, in other words, parties in opposition to the MRND.  And I will explain this referring to events that took place after the third meeting.  They moved forward in that same direction. 
Q.	Did anybody else take the floor to address the crowd or address the attendees during that third meeting? 
A.	Besides Mathieu, Augustine Ngirabatware spoke.  He said that funds were going to be raised to finance the new organisation that had just been created, in other words, the Interahamwe.  Furthermore, I remember during previous meetings -- pardon me, but there are things that are coming back to me now.  There were previous meetings.  There were events concerning earlier meetings, and I remember one of the Honourable Judges asked me to respond to a question as -- respond, rather, to questions that are put to me rather than elaborate.  And that's why I'd stop there. 
Q.	What was the difference between JMRND and the Interahamwe, as you understood them in February of 1992? 
A.	Pardon me, JMRND is the youth wing affiliated to the MRND. The Interahamwe is a different organisation created by the MRND, which was created with a goal of committing killings.  That was my conception of it in that month of February.  That is why I gave myself some time to observe.  And up until the 28th of May, there were demonstrations.  Pardon me, I think that we are moving forward chronologically, and I have already jumped to the month of May.  We were talking about February.  I was able to start talking about events in May. 
Q.	After that third meeting that you've just described, did you attend any other meetings of the Interahamwe or -- that were organised in the same way? 
A.	I'm telling you the truth, as I have already explained, there were people who became members of the Interahamwe, and they received membership cards.  They held secret meetings.  Only those people who had the membership cards could go to the Interahamwe meetings.  I remember at one point in time members of the Presidential Guard had taken part.  

I forgot to mention Warrant Officer Urimubenshi, who was in charge of President Habyarimana's fighting forces.  Those people had secret meetings during that period.  It was a big deal.  Today, we can speak about it calmly, but at the time, this was very, very serious. 
Q.	But just sticking to the three meetings that you've just described, did you observe soldiers at any of those three meetings? 
A.	As I said, during the second and third meetings, members of the Presidential Guard took part in the meetings.  Some of them were bodyguards for Habyarimana's children.  They showed up to the meeting -- or, rather, meetings, and introduced themselves, because all participants had to identify themselves and explain the purpose for which they were there.  I made a sign to you, Mr. Prosecutor, I will stop there. 
Q.	When you refer to these Presidential Guard, were they in uniform or in civilian attire? 
A.	Some of them had military uniforms; others were dressed as civilians.  Those who had the military uniforms were bodyguards for Habyarimana's children.  Those who were in civilian dress were people who were meant to train Interahamwe members.  They even mentioned Agabiro, the place where the training was to be held in Mutara.  Later on that did, indeed, take place.  This was said during the secret meeting, and later on it indeed materialised. 
Q.	When you say "the secret meeting," are you talking about the meeting that you, yourself, attended or is it something else? 
A.	Those meetings were organised after the third meeting.  After the third meeting, all subsequent meetings were secret, and the only participants had to have membership cards to the Interahamwe.  It was at that time that I decided to resign from the MRND because I quickly understood what their objectives were, and so I decided to leave.  
Q.	When was it that you decided to leave the MRND? 
A.	I decided to leave the MRND on the 9th of June 1992.  On that date, I officially left the MRND.  But after those first three meetings, I took the time to analyse what I had seen, and I tried to determine in which direction Mathieu Ngirumpatse was taking the party.  I realised that he was leading it down the path of disaster, and I didn't want to be any part of that.  I could not accept that.  That is why I decided to leave the party.  It was only after those three meetings that I began to reflect upon the situation, and I made my final decision on the 9th of June.  In fact, I even have the official copy of the letter that I wrote resigning from the MRND.  I don't know if you want me to show it to the Chamber.  You can even look at the copy yourself.  This document is old, but I've always kept it with me.  I believe that you have a copy of this letter which, furthermore, was published in different newspapers.  

I was attacked on that day, and I would even survive a grenade attack against me.  My objective here is to make the truth come out so that those who took part in the genocide be punished for what they've done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our scheduling order suggested that we'd close around 5:30.  How much more time do you have?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
With the witness, Your Honour, for today or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we published a scheduling order which, as far as I can recall, declared our intention to sit from 8:45 to 12:30 and from 2:00 to 5:30 each day.  Now, if it's not convenient, we'll go on just a little bit to allow you to come to a convenient time to stop.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, we can stop now, but I didn't understand the first question whether you were asking me for today or for -- with the witness and the entirety of the direct examination, but we can stop now because I was about to sit because Mr. Weyl was on his feet, so I assume he wants to make an objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you'd give an indication of how long you intended you'd be with the witness that would be very helpful for our future planning.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would hope to be finished by lunchtime tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
By lunchtime tomorrow.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  

The reason I am standing can be explained by the surprise that I am experiencing before the fact that the witness has documents with him.  I don't know what the nature of the document is, how it relates to his testimony.  And for the purposes of the record, I just wanted to object to the fact that a witness brings a document with him for his testimony before this Court.  This is why I'm standing, Mr. President, and I know that the record will reflect my objection to that.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This is an awkward situation because I'm used to Mr. Robinson asking me to have witnesses bring documents before them, and here we have a witness that has brought documents with him, and now Mr. Weyl doesn't want them.  In any case, this is a document -- the witness was referring to a document that's already been copied and distributed to the parties.  So I don't believe the witness has anything that the Defence has not been served with previously.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, is there something new you want to say, or you just want to repeat and emphasise what you've said before?  
MR. WEYL: 
I wanted to reply to the Prosecutor by saying that I don't see any contradiction between the Defence wanting to have documents relating to the witness's testimony and be -- and my surprise at how a witness can show a document that was disclosed to the Defence that he has with him and has had with him during his entire testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  May I be heard on this issue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I don't think it's necessary.  I don't think that the mention of your name was really relevant.  We haven't taken any special account of it.  As far as I can see, there are two situations; 
Mr. Weyl is not new.  It's completely two different situations.  

As far as I can see, the document to which the witness has referred is not a part of our court record.  He has said he has it in his pocket.  There is no indication that he has been referring to it or reading it, or using it in any way.  There's been no application for it to be admitted into evidence up to now.  And in any event, the Prosecutor has indicated -- I understood his intervention to mean that he has disclosed that document and may be intending to introduce it in a more formal way during the course of his testimony.  If he makes that application to introduce, well, at that stage we will adjudicate on its admissibility, if there is an objection.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think, Mr. President, you are anticipating my comments were a little different than what I intended.  I hope I'm a little more mature lawyer than worry that I have to stand up whenever my name is mentioned in court.  I think I'm beyond that.  

What I wanted to do is make an application for -- to be able to inspect the documents that the witness has with him.  And I would ask that, first of all, that it's okay with the witness if he would show me these documents, and I'm interested in seeing the original of that letter, even though we've only received copies, as well as anything else that he's brought with him.  So I'm making an application at this time.  I seek the permission of the witness and hope that it would (inaudible) to him.  But in any event, I'm asking the Trial Chamber to allow me to inspect the documents that the witness has brought to court.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I simply want to go on record as opposing that application, Your Honour.  This is not an inquisition.  The witness -- that's the witness's personal property.  It is not appropriate to even make the application to inspect his personal belongings.  The document that the witness held up is something that has already been disclosed to the parties, so I had simply wanted to state -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, nobody knows yet what document the witness held up.
MR. WEBSTER: 
The witness identified the document when he held it up.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he made a statement about it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we don't know if his statement is accurate.  You see, what we think is appropriate is to let the witness know that it is not usual or expected that he should bring material into court for use in his testimony.  

You are not allowed to refresh your memory from documents or from any other material, unless there is a special application made to the Court and we authorise you to do that.  Now you have referred to a particular document.  We -- also, Mr. Robinson, don't think that we should invade the witness's privacy and have an official search of his person to find out what documents he has.  But in relation to the document that he has spoken of and is relevant to the case, and the fact that the Prosecutor has said that he has exhibited a copy of it, we would like to see it and decide whether we should show it to the Defence counsel.  And we would also ask you if there are any other documents that you have which you would like us to see so we can show it to Defence counsel before they come to cross-examine you.  But we think you should show us the document to which you'd already referred and any other thing that you want to show.  We are not compelling you to show anything else.  

Yes, Mr. Registrar.

1745H
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have a document which I have already disclosed to the Prosecutor, and I'm willing and ready to show it to you, but I brought this document with me because it is a document which I normally carry with me whenever I move about.  It's almost like a Bible for a Christian.  As you can see, it's a document which is quite old, and you will also realise that I didn't even read this document during my testimony.  Furthermore, I didn't know that it was prohibited to come before the Trial Chamber with documents of my own, but I do have other documents which I have kept on my person, which I have not disclosed to the Prosecutor.  And following your request, maybe I can show you those documents as well because they are relevant, given the events which took place during the period under discussion.  But as for this specific document, it is a letter, a copy of which you have received, but I request that this document be returned to me because I always keep it with me.  It's somewhat like my own personal Bible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we have seen this document, and we think that it is appropriate for Defence to inspect it.  It is the witness's personal property, and it is to be returned to him this afternoon.  Now, what we are going to do, we are going to ask the registrar to supervise the inspection and to return the document to the witness before he leaves the premises this afternoon.  We don't think that it's necessary for the Court to be sitting while this inspection takes place, and so we are going to take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am perfectly satisfied with that arrangement, but at the same time, after the Court adjourns, may we also have the opportunity to inspect, in the presence of the witness and the registrar, the other documents which he has brought, which he said he was willing to show?  We have a witness here -- I've been asking witnesses to bring records, and finally I have a witness who brought records.  And now you seem to be standing in the way of my looking at these records when the witness is willing to show them to us.  So can we please simply have that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not willing to make an order for the witness to disclose the documents.  If the witness voluntarily exhibits them for inspection, we allow that.  So we permit the witness to show the documents in his possession if he wishes to do so.  So I hope that is clear.  So he has permission to show if he wishes to do so.  We don't make an order compelling him to disclose.  

Do you understand this, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, Your Honours, in the same manner as I disclosed the letter mentioned to the Prosecutor, and as he, himself, admitted he gave a copy of that letter to the various parties, I cannot, of my own accord, show these documents to Defence counsel because I do not know how the Tribunal operates.  But as the Prosecutor was explaining a moment ago, he has disclosed a copy of this letter to all Defence counsel, and I do not see the need of showing to them the documents which I mentioned -- which I showed you just now, because the Prosecutor has accepted that he disclosed this to the Defence.  

As for the other documents in my possession, I do not intend to use them during my testimony, but if the Chamber were to ask me to produce documents which support my testimony, I'm willing and ready to show you those documents.  But, personally, I would submit that I should not have to show the original of the letter to Defence counsel, especially given the fact that the Prosecutor has given them a copy.  Had the Prosecutor not given copies of this letter to the Defence counsel, I would be ready and willing to show them that document.  But since that is not -- is not the case, I do not see the need for me to show them this copy, a copy of which -- this letter, a copy of which they have already received from the Prosecutor.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Witness, you have to remember your role here.  You're here as a witness and not as a lawyer.  It's our duty to manage the session, and we take decisions on what the rules of practice and procedure require and permit.  Now, we have decided that the document which you held up during your testimony, and which we have inspected, should be exhibited to the Defence counsel for them to inspect.  It will be returned to you before you leave the premises this afternoon.  We have read it.  We have seen what it is, and we think they should see it.  We have not ordered you to disclose any other document, but we have permitted you to do so if you wish.  So if there are other documents that you wish to show, you show it to the registrar, and he will show it to the Defence counsel and return them to you this afternoon.  That's a matter, a voluntary matter, which we allow you to do.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
You will excuse me, Mr. President.  I hadn't understood you initially because I thought that the first document was also involved, but I am ready to place at the disposal of their -- of Defence counsel the other documents that I have because I know that there are some which have not been handed over to the Prosecutor.  But if they wish to inspect the original of the letter which we were speaking about, I am ready to place them -- place it at their disposal for inspection, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that this is probably an appropriate time for us to take the adjournment.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Things are still not clear to me because the witness's response does not seem to follow from what the Trial Chamber just -- it is not clear to me that the witness understands that if he shows -- that he has the right to refuse the inspection, and that if he grants the inspection, the next step will be to provide copies of the same documents to the Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  Who said anything about copies?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sure, without a doubt, that if there's anything, as the witness says, that he has already made an assessment that it's relevant to the proceedings, that Mr. Robinson's next request will be to have a copy of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Webster, if it is relevant to the proceedings, the Defence should have a copy of it.  Now, I can't make the judgment, but if it turns out that that is so, it will be revealed sooner or later, either in examination-in-chief or in cross-examination.  And if it is relevant, the Defence should have a copy.  So that's not a reason for me to tell the witness not to show documents if he's willing to do so.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not asking the Court to tell the witness not to show his documents, but I'm asking the Court to give the witness a full understanding of what the implications are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness has -- I will ask him again, but I think the witness is a very intelligent person, and I think he understands fully what I have said.  

Mr. Witness, do you understand that you are not being compelled by court order to exhibit anything, but that what we have done is given you permission to show, if you wish to do so?  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understood you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
THE WITNESS:
Because I have to comply with the Chamber's decisions.  But I did understand that there is no pressure which is being exerted upon me, and there is no reason for me to refrain from showing this document to anybody who wants to inspect them.  The Prosecutor must excuse me, but I think that it is my right to be able to show these documents.  If there's anyone who is interested in inspecting these documents, I'm ready and willing to show these documents because I don't want to hide anything.  The Prosecutor maybe wouldn't want me to show these documents, but I am willing and ready to show them to the Defence if they wish to inspect them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, there's one caveat.  You're not permitted to speak to the lawyers in this matter -- on this matter.  Your communication has to be with the registrar only.  You understand that?
I think we can take the --   
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, do we need to give any direction as to how you'll manage this?  We think that both the Prosecutor and the Defence should see any documents that the witness wishes to exhibit and that you'll be obligated to be responsible for the documents and to make certain that he gets them back before he leaves the premises this afternoon.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, is there any time limit on the inspection?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it must be done with a reasonable dispatch.  I don't think I can say more than that at this stage, but we don't expect an unreasonable exercise of the privileges which are being extended now.  
MR. FRY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We'll take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I have to remind you, as I told you at lunch time, that while you are -- during this or any adjournment, you remain a witness of the Tribunal in these proceedings, and that means that you are not to discuss this case, your testimony, with anybody.  You heard the Prosecutor mention today, earlier today, that he has undertaken that his team will refrain from having any discussion with you as well.  And that, I think, seems also to have been indicated by the Defence on this side.  Do you understand the obligations to us in this regard?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, but I would request that no copy of the various documents which will be inspected be made.  Later on, if ever a further explanation is required, maybe I would provide such explanation to the various parties who will have examined the documents.  That is my request with regard to the documents which will be inspected by the two parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we've permitted this afternoon does not involve making any copies.  It may be possible that at some further date, there might be an application, but that's something which the Court will supervise.  If a request is made, it will come through us, and we will adjudicate on this issue.  But I -- I -- okay.  We'll take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1804H)
