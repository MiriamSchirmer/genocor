MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Madam registrar, can you open the proceedings, please?  
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of                             Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 9th of November 2006 for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President; actually I would like to introduce a new intern who has joined our       Defence team.  Her name is Junie Sainte Fleur.  She is from Montreal, and she will be here for the rest of the session.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome, Ms. Sainte Fleur, to our trial session.

Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you remain under the same solemn declaration to tell the truth that you gave when your testimony commenced.  Mr. Webster will continue his examination.  

Mr. Webster, the Chamber has been advised of your -- of your position with regard to the objections raised yesterday.  We may just need a little assistance in the formulation of our order, and we will make that during the course of the day.  
WITNESS HH,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	I would like for us to go back briefly to the events of 1993 and just for a few minutes, then we will take off where we -- we will resume where we left off yesterday.  You had mentioned that you attended a number of rallies organised by the MRND.  Did you attend or in any way participate in a rally that was held in Gisenyi at the Umuganda stadium in 1993? 
A.	Yes, I was there. 
Q.	How did you participate in that rally?  Did you have any organisational responsibilities? 
A.	As I had told you at an earlier stage during such rallies,********************************************. 
Q.	Was that rally attended by the Interahamwe?  Did the Interahamwe participate in that specific rally? 
A.	Yes, there were very many of them participating.  In fact Interahamwe had come from Kigali. 
Q.	Did Interahamwe from other parts of the country also go to Gisenyi for that rally? 
A.	There were Interahamwe who had come from Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and also from certain parts of   Kibuye préfecture. 
Q.	With respect to the Interahamwe that you worked with directly from Kigali, how were they transported to Gisenyi for that rally? 
A.	Whenever there was a rally attended by senior party leaders, the party leadership would avail us with vehicles; we were given buses, mini-buses and pickup trucks to go to the various préfectures.  We were always given such vehicles. 
Q.	When you refer to "buses", do you have in mind those ONATRACOM buses that were owned by the ministry? 
A.	Quite, sir.  Indeed, I have in mind ONATRACOM buses and ordinary buses owned by individuals.  We were given mini-buses because there were very many Interahamwe as well as other militants of the MRND who had to go and support their fellow militants in the location being visited. 
Q.	Do you know how many buses left Kigali to go to Gisenyi with Interahamwe aboard? 
A.	Lots of buses.  There were ONATRACOM buses.  There were mini-buses which were usually used as taxis and were owned by private individuals.  There were many buses, very many of them.  I would estimate, with regard, 100. 
Q.	Can you describe your approach to Gisenyi on that day, the day that this rally in Gisenyi took place.  I would like to Court to have a clear image of how you -- what you saw on the road as you approached Gisenyi in relation to that rally? 
A.	Personally, I would say that before arriving at Gisenyi, since there were very many vehicles returning from the rally, we crossed many other vehicles which were going towards the meeting place, whereas we had already ended our rally.  We still came across those vehicles on their way to the rally grounds. 
Q.	When you compare this particular rally in Gisenyi to others that you participated in in other parts of the country, was this -- did this appear to you to be a more important rally or was this typical of the rallies that were held by the MRND at that time? 
A.	The Gisenyi rally was the most significant of any other rallies which had been organised. 
Q.	Why do you say so, Mr. Witness?  What is it about the Gisenyi rally -- 
A.	There was a huge number of participants at that rally, in fact.  There were some people who could not get to the rally grounds because of the huge number of attendees.  People had come from everywhere. 
Q.	Can you tell us the names of some of the persons that spoke at that rally?  Who were the authorities that publicly addressed the rally? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, before the witness answers that question I would like to ask Mr. Webster to determine from the witness what time or what part of the year in 1993 this rally took place, so we can determine whether or not this is a rally that is included in the indictment.  So maybe -- I know the witness doesn't know dates, the exact dates, but perhaps either with reference to the RPF attack in February of '93 or in reference to the MRND congress in July of '93, we can find out if it was before or around those events so we can get some idea whether this is, indeed, a meeting that is charged in the indictment. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you think about this rally in Gisenyi can you tell us if this rally occurred before or after the death of President Ndadaye in Burundi?  If that is a significant -- 
A.	I think, even though I am not very certain because it all happened a long time ago, I still think the rally took place before the Burundian president's demise, but I'm not very certain because it all happened a long time ago.  All what I know is that the rally took place, and I participated. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall if the rally took place after the RPF attack of February 1993?  Was it before then or after then? 
A.	I think the rally took place after that Ruhengeri attack. 
Q.	Is there any other incident that comes to mind for you that would help you situate this Gisenyi rally in time, between February of '93 and October of '93? 
A.	I don't remember any other significant event which would help me to remember the date of that rally.  What I know is that we had gone to Gisenyi to confront the Abakombozi of Gisenyi.  We were ready to take them on when we went to Gisenyi.  Otherwise, there is no other event which can help me remember the date of that rally. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, thank you very much.  When you say you "were ready to take them on," referring to the Abakombozi, tell us what you mean, please? 
A.	When I talk about the confrontation between us and the Abakombozi, I mean as follows; the Gisenyi Interahamwe leader had reported to Turatsinze that the Abakombozi of Gisenyi were constantly provoking them.  So those PSD militants were provoking our militants in Gisenyi.  So to sum up, we thought that those Abakombozi were going to sabotage our rally. 
Q.	When you use the word "Abakombozi", are you referring to the youth wing of another opposition party? 
A.	I am actually referring to the youth wing of the PSD who were the opposite members of the Interahamwe being the youth wing of the MRND. 
Q.	Returning to the issue of who addressed this particular rally, can you mention the names of some of the authorities that addressed the rally? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I want to object because this meeting is not included in the indictment.  There is in a paragraph 25.2 of the indictment a description of a meeting.  And actually before I go any further, I would ask that the witness be instructed to take his headphones off. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, it is normal that you would not listen to the legal discussions surrounding admission of evidence.  So please take your headphones off. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, there is a meeting in Gisenyi that is charged in the indictment on the 27th of October 1993.  It is in paragraph 25.2 of the indictment.  And it is our position that this is a different meeting, that that meeting was described by Witness XBM as taking place, he was sure it was at the end of October after the death of President Ndadaye.  And this is a different meeting that is being discussed, which does not appear in the indictment.  So, I would ask that evidence of this meeting be excluded. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, my understanding is that this witness is addressing the same meeting that was discussed in previous testimony.  And I think if we allow him to answer the question of who addressed the rally that will come to light.  This was a very special meeting in Gisenyi.  This is a meeting where military authorities were also in attendance, and Bagosora and other military authorities were in the crowd and addressed the rally.  And when the witness mentions those names or refers to that incident, I think it will become clear that we are talking about the same event.  

Even when the meeting was pleaded in the indictment, we had indicated that we were not sure of the exact date.  And the other witness -- it is not -- I would have to check the transcripts, but I'm not sure if the other witness gave us a specific date.  But we are talking about a meeting towards the end of 1993, around October.  It is not clear whether it was before the death of Ndadaye or after the death of Ndadaye.  But our contention is that it took place towards the latter half of 1993.  

So I think we are talking about the same events.  And I would like to proceed with the questions to establish that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, hearing the evidence will assist us in determining whether it is the same rally.  If it is not, it will obviously have to be excluded from our consideration. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, are your headphones back on now?  Can you hear me?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue now, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's continue.  I would like you to think back to this rally in Gisenyi.  And tell us who you recall being present among the authorities of the country at that time. 
A.	Amongst others I remember the person who welcomed us, that is Wellars Banzi, the MRND president for Gisenyi prefecture.  In attendance were also some ministers of the MRND party.  Furthermore, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera were in attendance.  I cannot give you a complete list of all of the figures that attended that rally. 
Q.	Do you recall if any military authorities were in attendance at that rally? 
A.	I was able to make out Anatole Nsengiyumva, and Bagosora, I believe, was also present. 
Q.	Do you recall if Nsengiyumva addressed the rally at any point? 
A.	As I told you earlier on, *************************************************, so I did not closely follow the meeting from start to finish.  **************************************. 
Q.	I understand that, Mr. Witness.  And I'm not asking you to tell me what Nsengiyumva said, but do you recall if he addressed the rally at all; did he speak? 
A.	You have to bear with me, Counsel, it was a very long time ago but I think he spoke. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when you say that***********************************, can you think back and tell us were there any security problems in regard to that rally? 
A.	Personally, wherever I went, there was security; there were no incidents to provoke disorder of one type or another.  I would say that security was very good. 
Q.	I'm not sure if I understood that last response.  Could you repeat it for me, please? 
A.	I have just said that, in general, security prevailed.  There were from time to time some minor provocations; people might assault each other verbally.  But I do not attach any importance to that.  But, in general, at that meeting it was quite security, quite safe. 
Q.	And by your response, I assume that you are talking about the way that the Interahamwe interacted with each other, that there were no provocations among the Interahamwe?  Is that what you meant or would you like to clarify that? 
A.	I'm speaking of the verbal exchanges between the Interahamwe and the youth wings of other political parties, or between MRND militants and the militants of other parties.  That is what I meant. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, I would like to go back to the issue of Jean Pierre Turatsinze.  Yesterday you told us that there came a time that he disappeared, and I believe you put it some time in February of 1994.  Do you know why he disappeared? 
A.	Yes, I know very well why.  In point of fact, I did not say that he disappeared in 1993; I said that one point he went to Mwanza in Tanzania and then came back.  However, in 1994 before the month of April he had left and one would not see him.  And one could say, therefore, at that point he disappeared.  But in 1993, he went to Mwanza in Tanzania and he came back. 
Q.	Well, let's just think about 1994, before April of 1994 when Turatsinze disappeared at that time, and, I believe, yesterday you said it was sometime in February or March.  Do you know why it was that he went away and was not seen again? 
A.	To my knowledge, before leaving he told us that he was leaving but that he would soon be back.  He told me that myself when I was at his home, his place.  And I was with Assumani Kavura and another man by the name of Claude Nshimiye.  Turatsinze told us that he was going to Mwanza to collect some things belonging to him.  He left.  And we did not see him for some time. 
Q.	Was there ever a problem between Turatsinze and Joseph Nzirorera when Joseph Nzirorera was national secretary of the MRND? 
A.	According to what Turatsinze told me during the course of our usual conversations, there were problems between the two men. 
Q.	What was the nature of the problem; do you know? 
A.	There were two men who wanted to eject him from his position, Seraphin Twahirwa and Ngirabatware.  Those two gentlemen made accusations against Turatsinze and took their accusations to Nzirorera.  But, in fact, it was because of those two men's jealousy, because Turatsinze had a good position and was well paid.  

I remember that at one point he had received a notice of being sacked for some vague reason.  It is obvious that Nzirorera wasn't pleased with Turatsinze.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, the names mentioned are at 108 and 75 on our list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you remember when this conflict, or when this incident of jealousy arose?  Is there anything that could suggest a month to you in 1994? 
A.	In fact, it began as soon as he began to lead the standing bureau of the MRND, those two men started to make trouble for him. 
Q.	Do you recall if there was ever any conflict between Turatsinze and Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No, not as far as I know.  Moreover, in the course of our conversations he would -- was in the habit of saying to me that had it not been for Mathieu's intervention, Nzirorera would have sacked him. 
Q.	From what you were able to observe was the issue of Jean Pierre Turatsinze ever a point of contention between Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera? 
A.	I couldn't be of -- informed of any contention between the two men, but Turatsinze had told me if he stayed in his position it was thanks to the intervention of Ngirumpatse with Nzirorera.  And if it only depended on the two men that I mentioned who came from the same region as Nzirorera, that's to say Rukiga, Turatsinze would have been sacked a long time before.  As to whether there was a problem between Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, I could not be informed of that. 
Q.	And when you refer to the "two men" I assume you are talking with Twahirwa and Ngirabatware; that is correct?
A.	That is correct, absolutely. 
Q.	And when you refer to Rukiga, I assume you are talking about the north of the country; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, quite. 
Q.	Did you ever come to learn of accusations against Turatsinze, that he had disclosed a secret to UNAMIR? 
A.	The first time I heard about that was in 1994 after Habyarimana was sworn in.  In those days there was talk of arms that Turatsinze had given to the president of the Interahamwe.  And then he took them back to sell them to the FRODEBU party in Burundi.  And, therefore, one could not trust him because he was someone who divulged the party's secrets.  And what I have told you I heard from the mouth of Turatsinze who informed me of that in the course of our conversations. 
Q.	Well, putting aside the issue of the arms that was sold to FRODEBU, and let's think about the issue of Turatsinze telling the secrets or the secret to UNAMIR, if you think about that one issue, did you come to learn that Turatsinze was accused of revealing a secret to UNAMIR?
A.	Yes, I did hear of that.  It was said that UNAMIR had searched the party headquarters looking for firearms, but I was not an eyewitness of that incident, but I heard it spoken of. 
Q.	Do you recall when it was that you heard that spoken of? 
A.	I think it was during the first months of '94, 1994. 
Q.	Well, you stated a moment ago that UNAMIR was looking for weapons at the MRND headquarters.  Do you know if weapons were, indeed, kept at the MRND headquarters or not?
A.	I knew there were arms at party headquarters, because shortly after the death of the president one Georges Rutaganda handed over weapons to some Interahamwe to go and loot Amgerwa.  And I had understood that the arms, the firearms given to the Interahamwe had been stored at party headquarters.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Amgerwa, A-M-G-E-R-W-A. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, thinking back to January of 1994, were you aware of any attempts on the part of the MRND to hide weapons after the secret had been revealed?  
A.	As to the MRND's efforts to hide weapons, I was not informed of that.  I merely learned that UNAMIR had searched the MRND headquarters, but that the search was -- did not bear fruit. 
Q.	When Turatsinze left, or disappeared, who took over his responsibilities?  You had mentioned earlier that he was responsible for coordination.  Was anybody else made responsible for coordination after Turatsinze left? 
A.	Yes, the position was given to Seraphin Twahirwa. 
Q.	I believe that is Twahirwa at number 108 on our list.  Is this the same person you had said was jealous of Turatsinze? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you describe his activities?  How did you interact with him during the period when he was responsible for coordination? 
A.	I had no problems with him.  I worked together with him as I had with his predecessor.  Of course, he was constantly in front of me criticising Turatsinze's work, the way he did things. 
Q.	What did he criticise about Turatsinze's work?  Be a little bit more -- explain to us a bit more, please. 
A.	In fact, it was said that Turatsinze stole but was not prosecuted for stealing; he was the boss's -- the apple of the boss's eye.  And so he could get things to -- intended for the Interahamwe to disappear, and be a bit arrogant in relation to other Interahamwe, showing them that he was above them, of -- one rank above them. 
Q.	Now, you had mentioned previously that when Turatsinze instructed you to do something he did so on behalf of the leadership of the MRND party, either Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera who you have described as being the national secretaries.  If you think about Twahirwa -- 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	-- would you say the same thing?  In other words, did Twahirwa -- 
A.	Yes, it was the same thing; neither one nor the other could take any initiative -- could take -- they could take no initiative at all without invoking the authorities that you mentioned. 
Q.	Why do you say that, Mr. Witness?  Can you explain that to us, please? 
A.	I said that, and I shall explain it.  When there were unfortunate consequences as a result of the activities of an MRND party member, MRND leaders would have to intervene, for example, to get him released if he had been arrested.  I remember that Twahirwa and Nzabahirgwa (phonetic) were arrested at one point.  And the MRND intervened through a lawyer -- a member of the CDR party, to get them released.  So it was the MRND's intervention using that lawyer that obtained the release of those two people who had been imprisoned as a result of -- detained as a result of their activities.  I don't remember the name of the lawyer in question who had been sent by Mathieu to intervene to obtain the release, to try and obtain the release of those party members. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  When -- can you recall any specific instruction, or can you give us an example of instructions that you received from Twahirwa that came directly from one of the national secretaries? 
A.	On the eve of a swearing-in ceremony to be held by Habyarimana, President Habyarimana, in January, Twahirwa called us together to party headquarters and told us of the activities to take place.  Nzirorera left his office and came to join us.  We were in a meeting room in the rear of the main building.  And he told us the same thing that Twahirwa had just told us. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, I'm going to direct your attention to the 6th of April 1994; that was the day that President Habyarimana's plane had been shot down.  Do you -- do you recall that day, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I remember the 6th. 
Q.	How did you come to learn of the death of the president? 
A.	I learnt of the president's death on the 7th at about 5 a.m. when -- when I turned on the radio. 
Q.	What did you do after you heard of the president's death? 
A.	I was astounded at the death of the president because I realised that other things might ensue, and we might risk our own -- losing our own lives in subsequent events. 
Q.	Did there come a time that you had any contact with the leadership of the MRND party or the leadership of the Interahamwe following the death of the president? 
A.	Yes, on the 8th the national president of the Interahamwe, that is Robert Kajuga, in the company of Maniragaba, Seraphin Twahirwa and Aloys Ngirabatware came to my place in (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate cover).  I was at *********when they came.  And they asked me to give me (sic) news of our area, which I did.  That was Ngirabatware.  And at that time, Robert Kajuga took a piece of paper out of his pocket and gave it to Lieutenant Miruho, Miruho, Lieutenant Miruho, who was in charge of the platoon in our area and said that the Interahamwe should work with the soldiers to flush out the enemy.  Robert said that he had that paper from Mathieu, Mathieu had given him the paper.  But he wasn't speaking to me; he was speaking to the lieutenant, the soldier to whom he handed that piece of paper. 
Q.	All right.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	For the record, Maniragaba is at number 55 on our list.  Miruho is at 59 on our list.  And the other two names are already familiar to us, Twahirwa and Ngirabatware.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- 
A.	I'm listening, Counsel.  
Q.	Did you yourself examine the piece of paper that Robert Kajuga had held? 
A.	I saw him hand the piece of paper to that gentleman, but I was not able to read what was written on the piece of paper; but we were in the same bar, so I saw what happened. 
Q.	How do you know it came from -- 
A.	I was at the counter of that drinking place. 
Q.	How do you know that it came from Ngirumpatse?  Did you see the signature on the paper? 
A.	Yes, indeed, I saw the signature.  So, I understood that the message was from Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	Am I to understand that you saw the signature but that you did not read the contents or, perhaps, you can explain that to us, please? 
A.	That is right.  I did not read the content of the paper because the paper was not given to me; it was given to the lieutenant.  I have already talked about, that is Miruho. 
Q.	Do you recall if Miruho or Kajuga or anyone who was with you discussed the contents of the paper or any other message from the MRND party leaders? 
A.	I understood that he told us that we had to work together with those people, so as to flush out the enemy in connection with the security enforcement.  I did not read the content of that letter or document.  What I saw is that he handed a letter or document to the person concerned.  I saw the signature, but I did not read the contents. 
Q.	Was there a specific instruction for the Interahamwe to mount or to participate in roadblocks? 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I object.  I think the witness has answered.  And the new question put by Mr. Webster does not have any basis because the witness said he did not read the letter. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I can go into that again, Your Honours. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, although you did not read the contents of the letter, can you tell us what was discussed among the parties that were among the various individuals?  You mentioned Maniragaba, you mentioned Kajuga, you mentioned Twahirwa and you mentioned a Lieutenant Miruho.  Tell us what they were saying to each other and to you in relation to what you were supposed to do? 
A.	They discussed about everything.  They discussed about the proliferation of roadblocks because there was only one roadblock when they arrived there which roadblock had been set up by gendarmes.  So those people went out to look at the other areas where roadblocks could be set up.  They are the ones who instructed us to set up the roadblocks.  Maniragaba, Kajuga, in the presence of that commanding officer gave us the instruction to set up those roadblocks. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, when you say "us", when your answer is "they instructed us to set up the roadblocks" who are you referring to, besides yourself personally who was to set up these roadblocks? 
A.	As a matter of fact it was Kajuga who spoke.  Then Maniragaba also talked in the same terms.  But I was not alone, I was accompanied by*****************. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Was that the first time -- well, what was your responsibility -- did you assume responsibility for managing any roadblocks as a response to what Kajuga said? 
A.	Yes.  After receiving the instructions I felt empowered to supervise and work out roadblocks, apart from the fact that we had been requested to collaborate with Lieutenant Miruho and comply with any instructions he would give us. 
Q.	When you were told that you were "to flush out the enemy" who did you understand the enemy to be? 
A.	Firstly, RPF soldiers; and also the accomplices, namely the Tutsi. 
Q.	What was it about what was said to you that led you to believe that the accomplices should also be flushed out? 
A.	That had been known way before.  People knew that the accomplices of the RPF were the Tutsi.  They were the ones accommodating them and supporting them.  So, it was our responsibility to flush them out.  We had known that a long time. 
Q.	Did anyone from the MRND party leadership tell you that? 
A.	Are you referring to that specific point in time or prior to that point in time, because at that specific point in time nobody told us.  But before then we had been told already to check the homes of Tutsis and observe those who visited Tutsi homes; and Ngirumpatse, Mathieu knew that. 
Q.	What I am trying to understand, Mr. Witness, is what did Ngirumpatse or Nzirorera or anyone from the party leadership tell you prior -- before the 8th of April that made you believe that the enemy to be flushed out after the 8th of April were the Tutsi accomplices? 
A.	Yes, we were being told that during meetings organised at party headquarters. 
Q.	Were the meetings that were organised at party headquarters taking place during 1994?  In other words, the meetings where you understood that the objective was to flush out Tutsi accomplices, were they held in the year 1994? 
A.	No, as early as 1993, even before then.  From late 1992, we were already being told to actually flush out Tutsi parents who had sent their children to the RPF.  MRND opponents also, were always being told that during meetings. 
Q.	Did those meetings continue in 1994? 
A.	There were, perhaps, only three meetings in 1994. 
Q.	If we think again about your conversations with Kajuga on the 8th of April did he tell you to get other Interahamwe to mount or to participate in these roadblocks? 
A.	Yes, we had such a discussion.  We were accompanied by Lieutenant Miruho.  He told us to look for other able-bodied young men to go and be trained in weapons handling.  That was discussed on the 8th of April. 
Q.	From what Kajuga said to you, did you know if roadblocks were being set up in other parts of the city in the same way? 
A.	Yes.  I am positive about the fact that what he said to me is what he said in other neighbourhoods around town.  He said the same thing to the other leaders and to the other people manning the other roadblocks in other neighbourhoods around town. 
Q.	What gives you that impression?  Is it something that he said to you in particular or is it on the basis of seeing the roadblocks yourself? 
A.	There were roadblocks in other parts of the town. 
Q.	Did you see these other roadblocks in other parts of the town? 
A.	Yes, I saw some roadblocks.  For instance, there was a roadblock on the bridge at Gatete, at Nyabugogo the traffic lights in front of the home of the Kimisagara conseiller, Rose Karushara.  There were other roadblocks at Nyamirambo.  To sum up, I would say that there were lots of roadblocks in the other neighbourhoods and the towns. 
Q.	Were those roadblocks mounted by soldiers, Interahamwe, by local citizens, or a combination of those?  To the extent that you can, describe who was on these other roadblocks? 
A.	Excepting three roadblocks, that is the one at Nyabugogo, the one at Kimisagara, and the one at the Kabuga building, from what one could see there was a mixture of Interahamwe and soldiers.  Regarding the other roadblocks, they were manned by Interahamwe and civilian members of the public.  I referred to those three roadblocks exceptionally because those manning them had weapons, and there were also soldiers at those roadblocks. 
Q.	With respect to the roadblocks in your area, we are not going to mention the name of your area, but if you think to the area where you lived and worked, was it one roadblock or more than one? 
A.	When Robert Kajuga came to our neighbourhood there was only one roadblock.  But after receiving the instructions, the number of roadblocks increased to five. 
Q.	Did you have any responsibility in regard to those five roadblocks? 
A.	I had to superintend those roadblocks and know what was going on there. 
Q.	Were those -- did Interahamwe -- were Interahamwe -- did you get other Interahamwe to mount or to participate in the roadblocks that you supervised?
A.	Yes, there were other Interahamwe. 
Q.	Did they have arms?
A.	Yes, some of them were armed, others were unarmed; but those who were initially unarmed subsequently secured weapons such that we ended up with many people who had weapons. 
Q.	Where did the weapons come from? 
A.	They were part of the consignment which had been received from Turatsinze. 
Q.	Were these weapons that had been distributed to the Interahamwe before the 6th of April, or did weapons -- were the weapons distributed after the death of the president? 
A.	The weapons had been handed to the Interahamwe president, but the distribution of the weapons to the Interahamwe took place after the president's death. 
Q.	Did the leadership of the MRND party have anything to do with the distribution of those weapons after the 8th of April? 
A.	My assertion is that after the president's death the Interahamwe leaders were aware of the distribution. 
Q.	What about the MRND party leaders, did they instruct arms to be distributed or were they informed that arms had been distributed? 
A.	Perhaps I will talk about the period before the president's death.  They are the ones who gave the instruction for the weapons to be distributed.  But after the president's death, given that some of them had taken up cabinet positions, obviously, they were aware of the distribution. 
Q.	What happened at the roadblocks to those persons that you have described as accomplices of the enemy? 
A.	When passers-by arrived at the roadblock they each had to show their identity papers.  When it was observed that the passer-by was a Tutsi he would be killed.  If he was not a Tutsi then he would be allowed to go through.  That is how many Tutsi were killed at roadblocks. 
Q.	Do you know if the leaders of the MRND party were aware that Tutsis were being killed at the roadblocks in this way? 
A.	They were aware of that.  They were aware of that.  There is no way you could be living in that town and such things would be happening in the town and you would be unaware. 
Q.	You had stated earlier that you had received instructions to flush out the accomplices of the enemy and that you understood that those instructions came from the MRND leadership.  Can you explain to us -- 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	-- how -- 
A.	I believe I said that already today.  Those instructions came from higher up.  That was known.  Even lists had been drawn up containing the names of wanted people.  And those were the people who were flushed out and killed. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did there come a time that you went to the Hôtel Diplomat after the             8th of April? 
A.	Yes, we went to the Hôtel Diplomat at some point in time in the month of April.  We had been invited there for a meeting.  When we arrived there we saw Bagosora, Maniragaba, as well as other Interahamwe presidents.  The language of the meeting was French because Dallaire's representatives were there.  We were told that it was Dallaire who had to chair the meeting, but it was his deputy who came to hold the meeting.  We were told that it was necessary to dismantle the roadblocks and allow for the passage of the orphans at Gisimba orphanage.  There was some discussion.  People said, if you want to evacuate the orphans at the Gisimba orphanage, then you should also do the same regarding other orphanages.  So Dallaire's representatives left the meeting room and said they would go and take the appropriate measures before returning to the meeting place.  So after they left, weapons were distributed to the Interahamwe secteur presidents.  
Q.	Do you recall if this meeting took place before the interim government left Kigali or after the interim government left Kigali? 
A.	All what I can remember is that the interim government was already in place. 
Q.	How did you receive the message that you were to attend this meeting? 
A.	There had reportedly been another meeting at the Diplomat Hotel on the eve of that day and, seemingly, Nzirorera attended that meeting from what my deputy told me.  So they had been asked to come back the following day.  ********************, told me that there would be a meeting the following day. 
Q.	Can you think back and tell us how soon after the arrival of Kajuga, on the 8th of April, did this other meeting take place?  So if you think to the 8th of April when Kajuga and Maniragaba and others came to your area, how soon after that event did these other meetings take place at the Hôtel Diplomat? 
A.	That meeting took place just a few days after Kajuga had come to my place.  This all happened a long time ago, but it was at most three days afterwards.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think we can take the break now, and then I will resume. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 1 to 13 by Donna M. Lewis)

(Court resumed at 1055H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can continue now, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going to continue with your testimony about the Hôtel des Diplomates meetings.  You mentioned going to a meeting where you had expected Dallaire, or someone from UNAMIR, to be present, but that there was a meeting the day before.  Concerning the meeting or the events of the day before, what is it that your deputy told you?  What had happened the day before you actually went to the Hôtel des Diplomates?
A.	************told me that in the course of a meeting they had discussed the security situation in various neighbourhoods and that the people should arise and denounce the enemy wherever they were hiding and cooperate with the Rwandan army and that there would be a larger meeting where the Power parties would also be invited, which was a meeting which was held the next day and which was due to be headed by Dallaire, and I attended it.
Q.	With respect to the events of the day before, do you know if any weapons had been distributed during the course of that meeting, the one that you did not attend?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Based on what **************told you, who was it that was coordinating -- or, calling the meeting of the day before, the one that you did not attend?
A.	He told me Nzirorera, Kajuga, Sèraphin Twahirwa and Manuraho -- Maniragaba, rather, were present.
Q.	Did he tell you who the other participants were, in other words, maybe not by name?  But you mentioned leaders of the party or the Interahamwe; I'm trying to find out who these leaders were addressing.
A.	He told me some secteur presidents were there and he further said that there were also certain authorities, including those whose names I just mentioned.
Q.	When ******************reported to you that he or the participants had been instructed to denounce the enemy, as you put it, or as I heard it through the microphone, what did you understand that to mean?
A.	Up until that day, the term "enemy" meant the Tutsi.
Q.	Now, let's think about the meeting that you, yourself, attended.  This was the following day.  Do you recall where in the Hôtel des Diplomates this meeting took place?
A.	The meeting had taken place in the meeting room of the hotel, which is on the ground floor.  It's the first room which you meet when you enter the hotel premises.
Q.	While you were present on the premises of the Hôtel des Diplomates, did you see any members of the interim government?
A.	I saw someone.  I'm referring to someone who I used to see pass near the place where I was, and it was the youth minister, Callixte Nzabonimana.  There was also one Gahigi, who was an employee of the RTLM radio.  Those were the two people I saw constantly when I was in a meeting place.
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, Nzabonimana is No. 87 on our list, and Gahigi is No. 17 on the list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, did you see Joseph Nzirorera or Mathieu Ngirumpatse on that day?
A.	Obviously, they did not participate in a meeting, but when we were outside the hotel building, I saw Nzirorera in one of the upper floors, and Maniragaba told us that Ngirumpatse and the other members of government were in the hotel, even though they did not participate in the meeting.
(Fire drill audio interruption)
MR. WEBSTER:
Do we have that on the record?
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I apologise for the interruption, Mr. Witness.  I'm sorry to have to ask you to repeat your last answer, because I don't think we got it.  I had asked if you had seen Nzirorera or Ngirumpatse while you were on the premises of the Hôtel des Diplomates, and I'm not sure if we received your response on the record.
A.	Regarding those two gentlemen, when we went out of the meeting room and we were outside where weapons -- or, firearms were being distributed we saw Nzirorera upstairs.  He was standing with other cabinet members.
(Fire drill audio interruption)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what I heard from your last response is that you saw Nzirorera on a balcony with other cabinet members.  Am I to understand that this meeting took place at a time when the interim government was still in Kigali at the Hôtel des Diplomates?
A.	Yes, I think that is how it can be understood.
Q.	Do you remember when it was that the interim government actually left Kigali?  Do you have -- can you recall that day in your mind?  I'm not asking you for the date necessarily, but do you recall the day that the interim government left Kigali?
A.	Yes.  I remember that on the 12th many people left the town and the Inkotanyi took over control of Gasata secteur.  That day many people left for Gitarama, and it is on the strength of this that I think it was on that date that the interim government moved out of the town.
Q.	Can you think back to the day that you attended this meeting at the Hôtel des Diplomates?  How many days passed between your being present at the Hôtel des Diplomates for the meeting and the day that the interim government left Kigali?
A.	In my opinion, it may have been the day following our meeting that the interim government moved out of the capital.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, in one of your earlier responses, the translation I heard of your response was that you said obviously Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera couldn't be present in the meeting that you attended.  And I am wondering what you mean by "obviously they couldn't be there", if that is what you said.  Can you explain that to us, please?
A.	No, I said they were not present at that meeting.  I did not say that it was obvious that they did not have to attend the meeting.
Q.	You also said that Bagosora was present at the meeting.  What role did Bagosora play during that meeting?
A.	The meeting was conducted in a language which I cannot understand, so I am unable to tell you what Bagosora said.  All what I can say to you is that UNAMIR's request for authorisation to evacuate orphans from the Gisimbi orphanage was turned down.
Q.	Well, with respect to what UNAMIR was saying, how did you know what they were saying if the -- judging by your last response, you didn't understand Bagosora because it was in French.  Was -- the portion of the meeting where UNAMIR spokesmen addressed those that were present, was that in a language that you understood?
A.	Maniragaba and other attendees, who understood French, explained to us all what was said during the meeting. 
Q.	In one of your previous responses you mentioned that guns were distributed after the meeting.  Do you know if UNAMIR was aware that guns were going to be distributed at that time?
A.	No, UNAMIR was not aware of that.  That was the reason why the distribution took place outside the building.  Now, if UNAMIR had been aware of the distribution, then the distribution would have taken place inside the meeting room, rather than outside.
Q.	Who distributed the guns?
A.	There were soldiers what had been ferried in, in a truck, the same truck which had ferried in the weapons, and one of those soldiers working in the truck would hand the weapons to Robert Kajuga who, in turn, will give them to the persons concerned after reading their names from the list.
Q.	Well, with regard to this list and the names of the persons who received guns, how was that list compiled and who did the gun -- who were the guns distributed to?
A.	That list had been drawn up when Kajuga, Maniragaba and Ngirabatware went round all the roadblocks to assess the weapons in the possession of those manning those roadblocks, so it was during their roadblock trips that the list was drawn up.
Q.	Are you referring to the roadblock trips on the 8th of April?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And the names of the persons on the list that you saw receiving guns on the 10th -- on the 11th, were they members of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, they were members of the Interahamwe.
Q.	Do you know if Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera were aware that guns were being distributed at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the day that you were there?
A.	They could not have been unaware of it, given that they were present at the place of the distribution and also given that one of the cabinet members, namely, Callixte Nzabonimana, was closely following the distribution.  There was also the journalist, Gahigi, who was monitoring the distribution.  Here, I am referring to people who came down through the distribution place, that come from upstairs of that building.  Besides, let me also tell you that from time to time Maniragaba would go upstairs, and I imagine he was going to make some reports.
Q.	Do you know how many guns were distributed that day?
A.	No.
Q.	Would you be able to estimate?  Was it a few or was it very many, and do you -- or, do you have a basis to estimate how many guns were distributed at that time?
A.	The guns or firearms were in huge crates and there were 10-odd crates.
Q.	Do you have any idea of how many guns were in each crate, to the extent that you can approximate?  I know that you can't give us an exact figure, but I'm just trying to imagine how many guns were distributed at that time.
A.	I cannot venture any estimate because I risk telling a lie.  What I know is that those firearms were in crates.  Some of the crates contained guns, whereas others contained ammunition.  As I said, there were 10-odd crates, but perhaps it would be better for me to say there were more, because it seemed to me as if there were more than 10 crates.
Q.	Were you told what the distribution of the guns was intended for?  Were you explicitly told how the guns were to be used?
A.	The reason for the distribution of the weapons is that a long time before, there had been problems among the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe had complained that they were being requested to conduct night patrols and they ran the risk of being victims of night attacks by armed people, whereas they were unarmed.  So, they had requested to be issued with weapons so that they could defend themselves in the eventuality of an attack.  It was against that backdrop that the weapons were distributed.
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, I'm talking about the weapons that were given out on the 11th of April, or the day that you were at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  As the distribution was being made or during the meeting beforehand, did the authorities that were present give you any idea of how they intended you to use those guns?
A.	Yes, that was obvious.  The secteur Interahamwe presidents had been instructed to consult with conseillers of secteurs so as to see how to distribute the guns at the various roadblocks within the secteurs.  So, the distribution had to be on the basis of a number of roadblocks per secteur, and the secteur conseillers had to be associated in the distribution drive.
Q.	When you think back to the day that these guns were being distributed, had the killing of the accomplices already started in Kigali?
A.	Yes.
Q.	What evidence of the killings are you able to observe by the time we get to the 11th of April when you received -- when these guns were being distributed; in other words, when you think back to that time, what had you seen prior to arriving at the Hôtel des Diplomates in order to attend this meeting in regard to the killings?
A.	I would refer you to the surrounding areas of the town, and in this connection let me talk about the death of one of the Interahamwe members, called Pierre Kibishyanzira.  In my neighbourhood there were already four casualties.  That person called Kibishyanzira hailed from Shyorongi.  Let me also add that the Nyaribogogo river was already flowing with the number of dead bodies floating on it.  Also, at Kimisagara, Nyakabanda and everywhere along the road, corpses could be observed.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you think back to the times that you were present on the roadblocks********************, do you recall any other time during that period when Bernard Maniragaba or members of the Interahamwe leadership came to your roadblock to deliver messages on behalf of the MRND authorities?  In other words, think back to the same period of time --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, if we appear now to be leaving the meetings at the Hôtel des Diplomates, I just wanted to repeat for the record my request that those meetings be excluded from evidence because they are not in the indictment, although they are in the pre-trial brief, so I didn't think that you would require any more written material since you've already ruled on the exact same objection with the previous witness, but for the record, for the appeal purposes, I would like it noted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So noted.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, returning to our question, if you think about the period before the interim government left Kigali, which you have told us is the 12th of April, up until this time, do you recall any other incident that took place at the roadblocks ************************************where members of the Interahamwe leadership, once again, delivered messages on the part -- on behalf of authorities?
A.	What I remember is that on the 9th, I believe it was on the Saturday, one Claver Kanama, an influential party figure who hailed from Runda commune, called me on the phone; he was phoning me from Kiyovu, where he lived.  He told me that almost all the Interahamwe of Runda had been thrown into the commune gaol so he wanted me to intervene to secure their release, so I told him that I could not take my Interahamwe and move to another préfecture to intervene without the go-ahead of our authorities.  So, he told me he would first raise the matter with our party president, Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Claver Kanama was a trusted fellow within the party, and we were close to him as an Interahamwe.  So, I left and at the level of the Nyabarongo river, where -- there was a roadblock with soldiers protecting the bridge over the Nyabarongo.  So, I spoke to the officer commanding the troops.  He sent two soldiers to accompany us and he gave us a machine gun.  We went to Runda.  We sought the bourgmestre who had arrested those people.  It was not easy for us to locate him, but when we saw him, we convinced him to free the Interahamwe, and that was done.  That was the incident I wanted to inform you of.
Q.	Well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  Do you recall any incident where Bernard Maniragaba, along with other Interahamwe leaders, came to you at your roadblock to deliver a message on behalf of the authorities?
A.	I have given you an account of the incident on the 8th; it was a Friday.  Now, after what had happened on the 8th, the Interahamwe leaders often passed by our neighbourhood and they often came to get supplies of drinks and food *********************************************************************************** ****************************************************************************************************************** ***********************
Q.	Do you recall any incident where Bernard Maniragaba, or Robert Kajuga, or any member of the national Interahamwe leadership instructed you at your level to stop killings on your roadblock?  Was there any such message that you received on behalf of the interim government, through the Interahamwe leadership, before the departure of the interim government from Kigali?
A.	Apart from what I've told you concerning the 8th, Maniragaba gave me no other message from the higher authorities before the interim government left the city.
Q.	What about Ephrem; do you recall Ephrem as leader of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, I remember.  I remember him, and he was always very often with the three or four people I've already mentioned and I'd meet him in Gitega where there was a bar, and I would find that man always in the company of Pecos and Maniragaba.  Pecos was the Interahamwe leader in Gitega.
Q.	Do you recall any incident prior to the 12th of April, prior to the departure of the interim government, where Ephrem or anyone that would accompany him asked persons -- or, asked you -- on your roadblock to stop killing?
A.	No.  We were never asked to stop the massacres.  UNAMIR, of course, wanted us to stop killing during the meeting at the Diplomates hotel, but whether in the newspapers or over the radio, I never heard any message to the effect that we should stop the killings, the massacring.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  May I just ask that the witness take off his headphones?

I would like to make a brief motion at this time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The witness has removed his headphones, Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will be very brief.  I want to make a motion for a mistrial at this time because the Prosecution has lead evidence which is completely contradictory to other evidence led by its own witness and which is contradictory to the paragraph in the indictment which describes the pacification meeting.  It cannot be, Mr. President, that a prosecutor can present to an accused a case which is so inconsistent, contradictory and baffling as the case that the Prosecutor is presenting here, to bring two witnesses, Witnesses G and T, to testify they went to this man's very roadblock, they gave -- delivered to him personally this very message which he resisted, and then to have witnesses like this one come and tell us that there was no such message, that he never received a message, and to try to use this witness's testimony to show that our clients were, in fact, encouraging the killing.  There has to be some kind of level of integrity in the Prosecution's case in order for this Trial Chamber to have the tools which it needs to adjudicate a case fairly and for the Accused to know the case which he is going to meet.  I think that this witness has shown that the Prosecution's case has so broken down, is so ill prepared that it's impossible to defend and impossible to sort out the credibility of Prosecution's own case, and as a result of that, I ask that you declare a mistrial.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, you easily understand that we fully associate ourselves with what has just been said.  It's becoming difficult to follow the Prosecution that has difficulty in following its own witnesses in their variations.  Everything is maintained and it's opposite.  It's become very difficult to argue against a prosecution that's seeking itself.  I think that since the arrest of Mr. Ngirumpatse there have been, at least, five indictments that attempts are made to refine through notification and will-says that say the opposite of what was said before.  We are now facing witnesses that have nothing in common with those that were announced in 2002.  We are juggling with theories, the incoherent theories, of the Prosecution and it's becoming very difficult to answer to what is not a strategy, but a blow-by-blow accusation, which is why I fully associate myself with the motion raised by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson.  Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, for the record, I fully associate myself with Mr. Peter Robinson's motion.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think if I were allowed to ask the witness one or two more questions, it would become clear what the logic of his examination is on that point.  When I look to paragraph 38 of the indictment where this issue is discussed and when one reads the entire paragraph, I think it will become apparently obvious that there's no contradiction in the Prosecution case.  That paragraph -- and I'll read it since Mr. Robinson has made this motion for a mistrial: "On or about the 10th of April 1994, Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera convened a meeting with the national leadership of the Interahamwe at Hôtel des Diplomates that included participation from the recently appointed interim government ministers."  There's no argument there.  It goes on: "Mathieu Ngirumpatse ordered and instigated the Interahamwe leaders to control their men and to invoke the authority of the interim government to organise the removal of corpses from the streets.  The campaign was deemed as one on pacification, though essentially and practically it was a means of exerting control and direction over Interahamwe militias, so that the killings would be focussed on the most important targets first, the Tutsi intellectuals, and so that the killings would proceed with greater discretion and, in fact, was a means to aid and abet the killing."

So, when one reads the entire paragraph, the entire -- the whole of paragraph 38, I don't see how one can reasonably argue that the Prosecution case is confused on that point.  We have never maintained that the so-called pacification tour was a genuine attempt to stop killings in Kigali or in Rwanda.  It was a means, essentially, to organise the removal of corpses and to direct killings while the international community and, particularly -- the journalists were still present in Kigali and were reporting on the massive killings that were going on.  So there's no contradiction.  And I think if we take additional evidence from this witness, that will become apparent through his own testimony.  So, I think the motion is actually a bit more dramatic than it turns out to be.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I can just reply very briefly, I know you don't want to hear extended arguments; I'll keep it brief, but the Prosecution's own evidence, from Witnesses G and T, is in direct contradiction to this witness's testimony about those same events.  I don't think Mr. Webster can escape that, and that is the basis for our motion for mistrial, that the Prosecution is presenting inconsistent, irreconcilable and incoherent theory and evidence, for which we cannot defend and you cannot decide reliably.  Thank you.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, perhaps it's a problem of translation.  I would also like to come back to this.  The Prosecution cannot call several witnesses to say exactly the contrary -- exactly the contrary.  They have already called two witnesses who, under examination-in-chief, asserted that there were pacification tours, whatever their purpose was.  There might be an assessment of the tenor of the rounds, but there were rounds.  And, now, we were told today there were not rounds, there were not pacification tours.  So, this is a factual contradiction of what witnesses testified on matters, to which witnesses testified exactly the contrary.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have decided, after brief consultation in court, to disallow your application for a mistrial.  The view that we have -- in our view, it is not important at this stage whether there is, in fact, the contradiction that you have advanced -- and I must say that we do recall the testimony which is contradictory to what the witness has just said -- or whether the Prosecutor is able in further questions to demonstrate that it is not as contradictory as it appears at this moment in time.  That is, what we think is that if there are contradictions between various Prosecution witnesses, that is a factor which will assist us in determining the reliability of the testimony, the credibility of the witnesses, and whether the Prosecutor has discharged its burden of proving the guilt of the Accused.  We're saying that it is premature to make an evaluation at this stage as to whether the inconsistencies, which have appeared up to now, are sufficient to say that the case cannot be made out or that there is unfairness to the Defence.  The Defence has an indictment which it has to deal with, and we will have to assess whether the Prosecutor has proven its case or not.  But we think that it is premature to consider the application you've made, and we dismiss it on that ground.

Mr. Webster, you may continue.
MR. WEBSTER:
And in the event that the court is going to come back to this issue at some point, I'd like to direct you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have dismissed this application.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this does not prevent the Defence from raising it again if there is a further factual justification for doing it, but this application is dismissed, so we will not be coming back to it.
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, coming back to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Has he put on his earphones yet?
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the period up to the 12th of April --
A.	I'm listening.
Q.	-- did Bernard Maniragaba, or Ephrem, or anyone else associated with the leadership of the Interahamwe ever ask you to clean up the corpses that were on the roadways near the roadblocks?  Do you recall an incident of that nature?
A.	No.  What you say was not said or done before the date you mentioned.  The message was transmitted, but after the date in question, in Kimisagara, Nyakabanda and Cyahafi secteurs.
Q.	How was the message delivered at that time; was it the Interahamwe leadership or was there another way of communicating the message?
A.	The message was transmitted through the Interahamwe presidents at secteural levels of the secteurs concerned.
Q.	Who communicated that information to them?
A.	More often than not, it was Maniragaba or Sèraphin Twahirwa who would transmit that sort of message.
Q.	Was there no incident where Maniragaba and Ephrem came to the roadblock that you were responsible for to deliver a similar message?
A.	Regarding my roadblock, we never had any problem with corpses.
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did you understand -- excuse me, let me withdraw that.  We are going move to a different issue now, Mr. Witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, before we do, I just want to note that the contradiction that Mr. Webster predicted would be cleared up was not cleared up and, if anything, our position was reinforced by this most recent answer of the witness.
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps, if we could ask the witness to remove his headphones, I will make a further comment, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry; this was not part of the reason for our decision.
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera received reports from the Interahamwe in Kigali about what was transpiring in Kigali?
A.	Yes, and more than once, mainly, regarding Maniragaba, who apparently was closely following everything happening in Kigali, regarding -- in respect of the roadblocks, and that also concerns Sèraphin and Twahirwa who were doing the same thing.
Q.	How did you become aware of the reports that were being made to the MRND leaders?
A.	I knew it well before, well before the 6th, but I knew it more particularly after the government set up in Gitarama because I have proof of it.  One day I accompanied Rutaganda, Sèraphin, Ngirabatware and Maniragaba --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he will have to give those names again --
THE WITNESS:
-- who went to see the three men you see on the benches of the Accused.  The delegation went to meet them in Gitara -- in Murambi in Gitarama.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know if you want the list of people again.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to repeat the names you've just stated and you tell me if that's correct or not, because we are having a problem getting it on the record.  Did you say Bernard Maniragaba?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Sèraphin Twahirwa?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Aloys Ngirabatware?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you mention anyone else?
A.	Georges Rutaganda, I've mentioned him, too.
Q.	Okay.  Now, tell us what happened, again, in relation to these individuals.
A.	They arrived at (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under separate coverl) and were going to the Gitarama to the government's seat.  It was Robert Kajuga who gave me that information and even asked me, while we were standing together, to accompany him to Gitarama so that I might follow what was being said.  In fact, on the way I was listening to the conversation because -- between Twahirwa and -- he asked me to follow the conversation with Twahirwa and -- and the other one, so -- what they were thinking about him.  And I met Mathieu and Nzirorera and also Karemera in Gitarama.
Q.	Simply for the clarity of the record, I'm going to say the names again because I think we are speaking a bit too quickly.  You mentioned Twahirwa, Maniragaba, Ngirabatware; those are the persons whose conversation you overheard on the way to Murambi; is that correct, Mr. Witness?
A.	Yes -- no, I didn't follow what you just said.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness says.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm trying -- we had a bit of difficulty recording your answers on the trial transcripts.  I think we have to -- or, that you should speak a little bit more slowly so that the interpreters can keep up with you, and they missed the last portion of your answer.  You were telling us about the conversations you had with the persons that you accompanied to Murambi.  Can you tell us who you spoke to and what was being discussed on your way to Murambi?
A.	When we went to the Murambi, I spoke of the meeting with the three defendants here and a delegation, including Maniragaba, Twahirwa and Georges Rutaganda; however, Ngirabatware did not enter the room where the meeting took place with those three men.  After the meeting it was necessary for me to go and greet those gentlemen and I personally greeted Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He asked me what was happening back home, and I told him.  I narrated the incident of the death of the MP, Kabageni, who died at Butamwa.  As to what they said between themselves, I don't know because it wasn't necessary for them to report to me as to what had been said in the course of the meeting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are going to have to ask you to try and speak a bit slower.  It's a bit difficult for the interpreters to translate everything you are saying when you speak so quickly.
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, focusing on this meeting with the three MRND leaders, were you present during the conversations that they had with Maniragaba and Kajuga; were you there --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, there is no evidence that Kajuga came to Gitarama.
THE WITNESS:
I did not overhear the conversation between these two leaders.  They were my superiors, so I could not listen in their conversation.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Just to clarify a point, Mr. Witness, was Kajuga with you in Murambi at that time?
A.	Yes, he was with us at Murambi.
Q.	Did you come to learn what these MRND party leaders had discussed with the leaders of the Interahamwe after the meeting?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.

Excuse me, Mr. Witness.

Mr. President, I would like to object to any evidence of this meeting which, again, is not in the indictment, not in the pre-trial brief, not in the witness summary, but I will concede that it is in a notice provided to us in March of 2006, at paragraphs 40 to 42.  But I do not believe that, first of all, you should allow the continued accumulation of events outside of the indictment and I also do not believe that this provides the clear and consistent notice that would excuse a matter from being not included in the indictment of this nature.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I direct the Court's attention to paragraph 129 in the pre-trial brief, and the witness summary for Mr. HH.  Both make reference to reporting-back mechanisms from Murambi where Kajuga -- in fact, I can read paragraph -- the beginning of paragraph 129 for the Court.  It states: "Witness HH" -- and this is in the body of the body of the pre-trial brief.  "Witness HH will testify that Kajuga and other members of the national committee of the Interahamwe regularly went to Murambi to report to the MRND leadership who instructed them to obey the instructions of the soldiers.  HH will testify that groups of Interahamwe and soldiers attacked Tutsi upon orders from Kajuga", and it goes on.  It's a lengthy paragraph.  But this is clearly stated in the pre-trial brief, also in the witness summary, also in the witness statements.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just reply briefly, I do agree that, in general, the fact there was communication between the Interahamwe and the MRND leaders was alleged, I think, even in the indictment, but the point is that those are not necessarily material facts, but when you are describing a particular meeting, convened by MRND leaders with the leaders of the Interahamwe that's a material fact that should have been in indictment.  It was not pled either in the indictment, the pre-trial brief or the witness summary, and the only notice we had of this specific meeting was in the notice provided in 2006.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think the Court has to make a distinction between the notice of the allegation and the evidence of the Prosecution is going to use to prove it, and this is one example of that.  The indictment states that there were reporting-back mechanisms that informed the MRND leadership of what the Interahamwe were doing.  The pre-trial brief elaborates on that by stating specifically in more than one location the Interahamwe leadership, itself, reported directly to Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera.  That's explicitly stated in paragraph 129.  It's also explicitly stated in the witness summary of this witness.  In fact, in at least three locations in the pre-trial brief, it's clearly stated that this particular point of information is going to be provided by this particular witness, so I don't see how there can be any ambiguity on these points.  The Defence were sufficiently placed on notice.  It was pled in the indictment, albeit in the most general terms, but there's no way that the Defence can say that they have not been notified that the case they would have to meet would include evidence that the Interahamwe leadership regularly reported to the MRND leadership.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, at this stage of proceedings, and for the record, I would like to say that I still do not know what meeting is being discussed here because the Prosecutor did not take time to ask the witness to say the date of each meeting, so we are still in a hazy situation.  We cannot defend ourselves against charges which are not specified on the basis of the questions Prosecution counsel is putting to the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, in this case, we think that the material fact has been pleaded.  We accept Mr. Webster's contention that this is evidence to elucidate a fact that had been pleaded and of which due notice has been given, so the objection is overruled.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are going to continue.  Thinking back to this first encounter, let's not call it a meeting, this first incident whereby you accompanied Kajuga and other members of the Interahamwe leadership to Murambi, did you learn afterwards what they had discussed with the three MRND party leaders, Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera?
A.	While there, I could not know what they discussed during the meeting, but I was able to know subsequently through instructions we had received.  Now, if I look at the instructions which were received subsequently, then I would say that those instructions ensued from the instructions they had during their meeting.
Q.	Do you recall any of those instructions?
A.	Item: we were encouraged to keep on denouncing and flushing out enemies and also to support the Rwandan army at the war front as it was fighting the Inkotanyi.  They encouraged us to continue along those lines.
Q.	When you say "denounce and flush out the enemy", Mr. Witness, can you be a bit more explicit in what you mean?  What did you understand by "flush out" and who were you referring to -- or, who did you understand to be the "enemy"? 
A.	Firstly, our enemy was the RPF soldiers, but it was also said that those soldiers were being accommodated at Tutsi homes, that they were training Tutsi within Kigali and in surrounding areas.
Q.	So, in light of that, what were you instructed to do in order flush them out?
A.	We implemented orders which we received.  We chased and hunted down Tutsis in their hiding places, and Tutsis were killed.  That is eloquent testimony that we implemented the instructions we received.
Q.	Were there other occasions where you accompanied other high-level Interahamwe leaders to Murambi to meet with the MRND party leaders?
A.	I accompanied them on another occasion and, then, the third time I went alone.
Q.	With respect to the first time that we've already discussed, would you have any way of telling us when that took place?  How soon after the departure of the interim government from Kigali did that first meeting take place?
A.	Before elaborating in this respect, I am going to ask you to bear with me because I will not be in a position to give you specific dates; however, I remember that those two instances were in the month of April.
Q.	Concerning the first one that you just told us about, can you remember how many days had passed since the interim government left Kigali, just as a means of approximating the time?
A.	Just a few days; in any case, less than a week after the interim government had left Kigali.
Q.	You mentioned another meeting where you also accompanied the Interahamwe leadership to Murambi.  Begin by telling us which leaders, which Interahamwe leaders, did you accompany on that second trip to Murambi.
A.	I accompanied the same group of people I mentioned earlier on.  But from what I noticed, they met with Mathieu only.  When I looked into the room where they met, I did not see the two other defendants; I saw only Mathieu.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, for the clarity of the record, I'm going to go through the names that you've already mentioned.  So, with respect to the second meeting, where they only met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, was Bernard Maniragaba present?
A.	Yes, I had even forgotten a name, which name comes to mind now.  There was also Ephrem Nkezabera.
Q.	What about Robert Kajuga; was he present?
A.	Yes, sir.
Q.	You also mentioned Twahirwa, Sèraphin; was that person present?
A.	Of course.
Q.	What about Ngirabatware, Aloys?
A.	He was present, but when those men were meeting he did not get into the room where they were meeting.
Q.	For the first meeting, you also mentioned the name of Georges Rutaganda.  Was Rutaganda present for the second meeting?
A.	Yes, he was.
Q.	Mr. Witness, how much time passed between the first meeting and the second meeting?
A.	Just a short time.  What I remember is that all those things happened in April.
Q.	Well, do you recall the day that President Sindikubwabo made a speech in Butare?
A.	Yes, I remember the day he made a speech, but I can't remember the date.  In any case, it was in the course of the month of April.
Q.	Well, when you think about the second meeting of the Interahamwe leadership with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, did that event take place after Sindikubwabo's speech or before Sindikubwabo's speech, to the extent that you can remember?
A.	I think that meeting took place before the speech.  I don't have the specific dates in mind, but I believe the meeting took place a short while before Sindikubwabo's speech.
Q.	After this second meeting, did you also receive instructions that you understood to come from Mathieu Ngirumpatse?
A.	I think some actions implemented were on the basis of the instructions we received from those party leaders.
Q.	Well, what actions would those be, Mr. Witness?
A.	Acts of killings, for instance.
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know of other occasions when the Interahamwe leadership met with the MRND party leaders in Murambi when you were not in attendance; in other words, were there other meetings with the Interahamwe leader and Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera or Edouard Karemera that you heard about that you did not attend yourself?
A.	What I know is that Bernard Maniragaba very often went to Murambi, and he went alone without Sèraphin and his other companions.  Because Maniragaba was a more important figure than his two other companions, he very often went to Murambi.
Q.	How did you know that, Mr. Witness?
A.	I'm aware of this because we could see Maniragaba giving them instructions, ordering them on how to conduct themselves.  He spoke to Kajuga and to Georges as if he was ordering them.  We could see that those other Interahamwe had issues with Maniragaba.  It's as if he was the one who had taken command of things.
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, what made you think that Maniragaba was passing on information or instructions that he had received from the MRND party leaders?  What about the way he was going about passing on those messages made that clear to you?
A.	Like any Rwandan who is reasonable, one can see when someone gives orders to his companions.  We could notice that he had some sort of authority over the others.  For instance, when he made certain comments; when those men were moving about with women, he would threaten that he would report them to the senior authorities.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I understand that you are saying that Maniragaba exercised authority.  What I'm trying to do understand is why you think Maniragaba authority was backed up by the MRND party leaders.  What was it that made you think that his authority came from them?
A.	I'm saying this because from what you could notice, his orders were complied with and when he asked them to refrain from certain things, they always obeyed, and in order for them to do certain things, they had to do those things in hiding so that he wouldn't be aware.

1230H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, you made a reference in your previous response about Maniragaba commenting on the way Interahamwe used women -- or, there was a reference to women and I would like you to explain what you mean there, please. 
A.	Regarding your question about the presence of women, in the midst of Interahamwe, when Kajuga was lodged at the place called Photo Moussa at the city centre, there were women there who would spend a day with him and his companions.  They were Tutsi women, and Robert was with Sèraphin Twahirwa and others whose names I can't remember.  The impression one had was that those women spent the day with them.  And one could observe that their conduct was not appropriate, and when Maniragaba arrived at that place he said it was not normal for someone to spend his time with women in a situation of war, one cannot win a war if one spends his time with women, and he added that "Those were Tutsi women, whereas we are fighting the Tutsi.  You are actually have a nice time with Tutsi women".  He said, "This is not something I can bear, so I am going to report this matter to the senior authorities".  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm in the middle of a -- at the beginnings of a substantial area of questioning and perhaps we could break now and I will take up when we resume.  I'd intended to be completed by now.  Unfortunately, we've fallen behind because of the motions and so on and so forth, but I can give the Court my assurance that we will definitely finish before the mid-afternoon break, if not before then. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our luncheon adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, as I have previously told you, during this or any adjournment you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
(Court recessed from 1231H to 1412H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

We can resume now.  Mr. Webster, you can continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President; I just want to make a note that -- I understand the Trial Chamber is granting leave to the Prosecution to exceed the time estimates that you've given. I don't have any objection to that, but I just want it noted so that when the need for reciprocation arises it might be looked upon favourably.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My colleague is suggesting that I -- I take the time that she says from last -- saved last week and then it would balance itself out somehow. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no, no.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think we all understand that things went a bit more slowly than anticipated this morning.  So will try to be brief, and I will try to complete my examination before we get to the mid-afternoon break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want to come back to the issue that we left off on before lunch, but let me ask you about the same thing in a slightly different way.  Were you aware of rapes of Tutsi women being committed by Interahamwe over the course of events from April to July of 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I was aware of that fact. 
Q.	Can you give us examples of the rapes that you yourself became aware of; in other words, where they took place, what period, what time during the period of April to July, any details that come to mind that would illustrate to the Trial Chamber your observations of rape by Interahamwe during that period? 
A.	With regards to what I was able to observe, an Interahamwe by the name of Mutongano, ********** ********************************************************************************, raped the daughter of a man called Muyango (phonetic).  I do not remember the name of the girl, but there was also the incident with somebody called Kavamahanga, who raped the wife of a man who was killed on the 7th.  When I noted all of that, I talked to Sèraphin Twahirwa, even if I was under the impression that he did not want to understand.  And then I talked to Maniragaba about it, too, who said to me that he was under the impression that the Interahamwe had, as a mission, to commit that type of act.  He said even Sèraphin and Kajuga committed acts of that type, and he said that he found them in the company of four women.  And when I noted that, I understood that those people had made concubines of those girls or women, and Maniragaba told me that he could not tolerate that that kind of incident continues and that he would report to the authorities on the matter.  I forgot to mention that Georges Rutaganda who lived Amgar, and one day I found him in the company of two girls of Tutsi origin and he asked me to help those girls to cross the Nyabarongo river, where he would join him them at Ruyenzi afterwards.  And I said to him that it would not be an easy thing to do because I would need to go through the roadblocks with those girls before getting to Nyabarongo river.  

He gave me 100,000 francs that I was to give to the different people manning the roadblocks, with a view to helping those girls to pass through the roadblocks.  However, in view of the fact that I did not know the conflict between him and Kajuga, I did not understand why -- I did not understand why Kajuga forbade me to help those girls.  But in view of the fact that Rutaganda had given me a sum of money and that I could see that there was a material incentive, I accepted to help those girls.  And when I got to the prisoners -- the central prison of Kigali, there were Interahamwe there and there were young people there, also, who were members of the Power faction.  And those young people understood that the -- I was trying to help Tutsi girls.  I tried to plea -- I tried to plead in their favour, but they said to me that I could not get them through and I said, then, that it was Rutaganda who had told me to take those girls with me.  They tried to pull them out of the car.  I refused, and I then asked them to allow me to take those girls back to Georges Rutaganda.  They accepted that second proposal, and they allowed me to leave the roadblock and take the girls back to Georges Rutaganda, and that's what I did.  And I handed over the sum of money that he had given to me to help those girls.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  There's a portion of your -- in the early part of your response that I'm not quite clear on.  It is when you described Maniragaba's reaction to seeing Tutsi women in the location that Robert Kajuga was occupying or was living in, the Chez Photo Moussa.  You seem to suggest that Maniragaba did not approve of the women being there.  I would like you to explain that to us a little more: Was it that Maniragaba had sympathy for those women or did he disapprove of the way in which Kajuga was living with them? 
A.	To my mind, he did not have pity for those women.  He, rather, felt something about the Interahamwe who were in the company of the girls, or women, and he said that those Interahamwe would be at a risk of catching AIDS and that that might even -- and so he felt pity towards the Interahamwe rather than towards the girls. 
Q.	What was your understanding of what Maniragaba wanted to happen to those girls? 
A.	For him, the girls that were with the Interahamwe should not have been there, in view of the fact that we were fighting their brothers and their relatives. 
Q.	Well, when you say "should not have been there", do you mean that they should have been able to return to their homes, or do you mean something else? 
A.	Well, those girls should not have been there.  They should not have been brought to live with the Interahamwe and have such close links with them, because they were there, after all, to have sexual encounters with the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Was it your impression that the girls were there against their will? 
A.	I cannot provide evidence of that and say that those girls were constrained and forced to be there, because none of those girls actually spoke to me and said that they were either there of their own volition or kept their forcibly.  But if you want my personal opinion, I believe that they were there under force in view of the circumstances. 
Q.	At the time that you became aware of these girls at Robert Kajuga's home or at his residence, were Tutsi women being killed by Interahamwe?   
A.	Yes.  They were being killed. 
Q.	During an earlier part of your response you also stated that Maniragaba said that raping Tutsi women was something that the Interahamwe should do.  Can you explain that to us, please, can you elaborate on that or clarify your meaning? 
A.	No.  I did not present things in such a manner.  What I did say was that for many -- Maniragaba, those people should not be spending time with Tutsi women -- or, they should not have sexual intercourse with those women, but I did not state that they -- that he had given an order for things to happen in such a way.  
Q.	You had mentioned that in talking to Maniragaba, he told you that he was going to report the incident or provide this information to the MRND party leaders.  Do you know if he did that? 
A.	I know that he uttered those words and I can confirm that subsequently he did report on those events.  And if I base myself on the conversation that I had at a certain moment in time, with Pecos, his brother-in-law, I can confirm that he did, indeed, provide a report of that nature. 
Q.	Well, can you explain how you confirmed that?  Mr. Witness, tell us what it is that convinces you that Maniragaba actually did report this information to the MRND party leaders. 
A.	I confirm that as a little later -- a few days later, I no longer saw the girls with the Interahamwe, whether it be in Amgar or Photo Moussa, so I understood that if those girls were no longer there, it was because that report had been made. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I don't mean to -- to keep asking the same question, but bear with me one more time.  The fact that the girls were no longer there, doesn't necessarily mean that the information was given to the MRND party leadership.  Is there any other way or any other information that you can give to us today to explain why you think that the MRND leaders, themselves, were aware of these rapes or these -- these relationships between Tutsi women and the Interahamwe leaders in Kigali?  Is there anything else, any other conversation or any other way that this information arrived with you? 
A.	The proof I can show you is that there were reports made.  I, personally, made a report and other reports were made by my colleagues, and those reports were sent to Maniragaba.  I don't -- I have no reason to suppose that Maniragaba sat on the reports and did not convey their tenor to a higher authority, which is why I maintain that the authorities were informed. 
Q.	When you say that you made reports to Maniragaba, are these reports that you would make orally or in writing? 
A.	Written reports; they were in writing. 
Q.	Aside from those written reports, did you also discuss -- or, did you ever discuss the contents of those reports with Maniragaba? 
A.	Yes.  We did touch upon the contents of the reports, and, in his eyes, he said he was transmitting all the reports submitted to him, whether the reports on the killings or reports on rapes.  He said he transmitted them to the national secretary of our party. 
Q.	In one of your earlier responses you mentioned a bar in Gitega.  Can you go back to that thought, please: Is there a particular location where you would meet either Maniragaba or other Interahamwe leaders in Kigali? 
A.	After the government's departure for Gitarama we were -- used to -- had the custom of meeting in a bar in Gitega.  However, I don't know if that bar belonged to Maniragaba or to Bernard.  The women, that is to say Maniragaba's wife and Bernard's wife, were there, and Maniragaba and Bernard were brothers-in-law, because, in fact, their wives were sisters.  So, it was hard to know whom that bar belonged to, whether it was Pecos or Maniragaba, because we had the impression that it was a joint enterprise. 
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness.  Thank you for your response.  I'm going to go over it a bit because I think we had a bit of a problem with -- with the interpretation.  You mentioned two individuals; can you state those names again for us please?  One of them was Maniragaba, but I also heard a Bernard and a Pecos, and I need to clarify something for the record.  When you refer to Bernard, are you referring -- is that the same person as Maniragaba? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then the name Pecos was also mentioned.  Is that a separate individual? 
A.	Pecos is someone else.  He was the president of the Interahamwe in Gitega.  
Q.	You said something about a joint enterprise.  Can you clarify what you mean, please? 
A.	The bar -- in fact the women, the wives of those two men were sisters, and at the bar sometimes you would see Pecos's wife and at other times you would see Bernard's wife.  And on other occasions, also, you could see Bernard or Pecos in the evening, and that is the source of the confusion, so much so that we couldn't know to whom the bar belonged, whether it was Bernard or if it was Pecos. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Did you have occasion to -- how often did you go to that bar during the course of April and May of 1994? 
A.	I might go to that bar two or three times a week.  But I went there most frequently when Pecos called me ************************************************************************************************************** ******************************************************************************************************************* *********************************So, I would go there two or three times per week. 
Q.	When you went to that bar did you have an opportunity to meet with other Interahamwe leaders? 
A.	Yes, most of the time there were numerous at the bar -- there were many of them at the bar. 
Q.	Would you ever see any of the authorities, any of the higher level MRND party leaders at that bar? 
A.	Most of the leading authorities were no longer in Kigali town. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you learn anything in relation to the attacks against Bisesero that were launched by other Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes.  Once Sèraphin Twahirwa spoke to me about it.  He was coming back from Gitarama, and told me that it was necessary to find Interahamwe to go and help the Interahamwe in Bisesero, because he said the Tutsi in Bisesero had killed the guards there and had put up a stiff resistance to the Interahamwe of the region.  I asked him in what context we would go there.  He said that he had discussed it with Nzirorera who had asked him to find people to send there, because, he said, that where we were the situation was not too critical so we had to find people to send there.  Subsequently, when I was looking for such people, he told me it was no longer necessary because Joseph Munyakazi's Interahamwe had come from Cyangugu to go and help the Bisesero Interahamwe -- the Interahamwe from the Bisesero area, so it was no longer necessary to send other people.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, it seems as if you have mentioned two separate conversations with Twahirwa; the first when he told you that Nzirorera wanted Interahamwe to be sent to Bisesero, and the second when he told you that it would no longer be necessary.  How much time elapsed between the first conversation and the second? 
A.	It was the next day that he came and told me that it was no longer necessary to send the Interahamwe. 
Q.	When you say "he came and told me", should we understand that he came and told you in the area where you lived or somewhere else? 
A.	He came to find me where I lived.  On the first occasion he called me by telephone, when he was in Gitega, but couldn't get me on the phone.  So, he came to seek me out where I lived.  
Q.	We will have to clarify something: I thought that you had mentioned that the first conversations -- first conversation actually took place in the bar in Gitega, is that not accurate or explain yourself a bit, please?
A.	With regard to the drinking place in Gitega I said when he called me, on the phone, he was there but he could not get me, because when I arrived home I heard that he had been looking for me and, subsequently, he came to my place and found me at home.  And then I went with him to Gitega when I was taking beer there.  
Q.	So, in other words, for the first conversation it took place by phone at your home, and, at Gitega, when you went to back there with him with beer, is that -- am I understanding you correctly?
A.	When I was taking the beer I discussed the problem with Pecos.  We were wondering as to how we would go about it.  So, it was with Pecos that I talked, but the person concerned was also present.  
Q.	And the person concerned is Twahirwa, if I understand you correctly; is that what you're saying? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then the following day Twahirwa came and visited you in your home and told you that the arrangements were no longer necessary.  Is that an accurate summary of what you have just said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the course of April -- over the course of the month of April, would you say that the numbers of militiamen increased or decreased or stayed the same; in other words, before the death of the president, if you compare the period before the death of the president to after the death of the president, did the number of Interahamwe militia increase, decrease, stay the same?  Perhaps you can comment on that issue.  
A.	After the death of President Habyarimana their number increased. 
Q.	Why was that, Mr. Witness; how did that occur? 
A.	The reason for that is that after the president's death, the youth wing of the MDR and of the PSD and some members of the CDR joined the Interahamwe. 
Q.	When these other youth wings joined the Interahamwe, was it your impression that the control or the authority of people at the level of Bernard Maniragaba, Sèraphin Twahirwa, Aloys Ngirabatware, some of the Interahamwe leaders that you have mentioned to us previously -- did their control over the militia get stronger or weaker? 
A.	Their influence over the Interahamwe did not diminish.  That never happened.  The only difference was that we could see that there were roadblocks set up at places -- were not official, and at those roadblocks the Interahamwe there indulged in barbaric acts, whereas we were not informed of it, so we no longer could control them and know everything they did. 
Q.	But did the youth wings of the other parties that joined the Interahamwe, did they also follow directions or orders that were given to them by Maniragaba and Twahirwa and Ngirabatware and the other Interahamwe members -- leaders that you have mentioned previously? 
A.	Yes, they would implement the orders given to them.  At the time of the meeting at diplomat hotel (sic), the officials from those parties were present, and it was agreed that their youth wings would follow the instructions given to them by the Interahamwe leaders.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, how would you describe the responsibility of someone like Joseph Nzirorera in regard to how the Interahamwe conducted themselves after the president was killed on the 6th of April? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to object to this question.  This is not an expert witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MR. WEBSTER:
I will reformulate the question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, reflecting on your testimony today, because we're approaching the end of my direct examination -- this is my last series of questions to you.  When you think about everything you have said, how would you respond to the suggestion that your testimony is an attempt to shift the blame for the events of 1994 from yourself and persons -- Interahamwe persons at your level to the party leadership? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I continue to object.  Maybe he can ask that in re-examination, if he feels the issue has comes up.  It is just another way of getting to the same answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  My point -- that is really cross-examination, because you are putting a suggestion to him and asking him to respond to it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, has your testimony today been truthful to the best of your ability? 
A.	Yes, I have spoken to truth.  I have narrated the events of which I was an eyewitness.  
Q.	Is your testimony motivated by any dislike for any of the three accused persons?  
A.	No, nothing makes me opposed to any of the three defendants -- any of the three Accused.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I will conclude there.  There is an exhibit that I wanted to admit through the witness.  Perhaps I could just lay the foundation for that exhibit and then I will conclude the examination now.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on a separate matter, you had mentioned before that you -- you had mentioned the particular dress that you associated with the Interahamwe.  And at the time of your testimony you described at being tache-tache.  Can you go back to that description, and remind us of what you said in relation to how the Interahamwe sometimes dressed? 
A.	When you say that it was tache-tache, garb, that's what the opposition parties said, who thought we were military soldiers.  But it wasn't really tache-tache clothes, garb, because that is what soldiers wear.  It is sort of camouflage.  So, it was especially opposition parties would say that sort of thing; "tache-tache" means "spot" "spot". 
Q.	Well, when Robert Kajuga came to the roadblock in front of your home on the 8th of April, was he wearing that type of tache-tache uniform? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have an objection.  

I think that the Prosecutor's question is incorrect.  It was never said that the Robert Kajuga arrived at a roadblock on the 8th of April.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will rephrase the question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can you describe Robert Kajuga, what he was wearing and how he appeared to you on the day he came to your bar bearing a document that you've identified as having been signed by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	He was wearing a military uniform I'd say, but it was half and half.  His trousers were civilian trousers, jeans, but, his shirt was a military shirt.  But on that occasion, he told me that no one should any longer wear the uniform characteristic of the Interahamwe.  As of that day, no one dared to wear the Interahamwe clothes, and even those who did wear them were obliged not to wear them anymore. 
Q.	And this was after the 8th of April, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.  It was after that date, the 8th. 
Q.	Well, was Kajuga the only member of the Interahamwe who dressed in military attire, or were there others? 
A.	There were other Interahamwe who wore that type of uniform, especially I saw the Interahamwe that accompanied him on that occasion were similarly dressed, and there were among them who wore complete military attire.  But as far as Kajuga was concerned, it was half-and-half. 
Q.	Do you know if over the course of April, such uniforms were made available to anyone else?  
A.	Yes, even one was given to me.  Sometimes it was on a basis of personal relations.  If you knew a soldier, he would give you one, or soldiers were killed in the battlefield, one could easily obtain that sort of uniform. 
Q.	Right, Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask my colleague to play a video clip for you and to make sure that the sound does not come through, and, then, I am going to ask you if you recognise anything -- if anything about what you see is familiar to you.  
	(Video recording played) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.       On my screen it is not very good; I do not know if it is any better for you, Mr. Witness. 
A.	The person that you can see wearing a military shirt and a military cap is Robert Kajuga.  Yes, it is indeed Robert Kajuga.  
Q.	Is that how he was dressed the day that you saw him on the 8th of April? 
A.	Yes, he was wearing that type of clothing. 
Q.	If you look in the background, is there any way for you to tell, or can you tell where he is standing -- where this is being recorded, if you recognise it? 
A.	No.  It is difficult for me to identify the place.  Maybe if I had been able to recognise the people in his company, I might have known what occasion this was.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd offer this into evidence as Prosecution 37.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 37 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
And I have completed my exam.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Before we commence on the cross-examination, we would just like to deliver the decision on the Defence objections made on the 8th of November.  On the 8th of November 2006, the Defence made three objections during the course of the examination in-chief of Witness HH.  The objections were to the Prosecution leading evidence on events that it claimed were material facts not pleaded in the indictment.  

The events related to killings in Shyorongi commune on the 6th of November 1992; a purported meeting of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Interahamwe leaders to avenge the killing of an Interahamwe leader in Rugenge secteur; and a purported meeting of Joseph Nzirorera and Interahamwe leaders on 4th January 1994, concerning the swearing-in ceremony for President Habyarimana.  
The Prosecution informed the Chamber that although it believes that adequate notice was presented to the Accused on these events, in the interests of judicial economy, it will not pursue these lines of questioning and agrees that the evidence led on these events should be excluded from the record.  

The Chamber, therefore, orders that the following portions of the provisional draft transcript be excluded from the record: a), for the objection to the events in Shyorongi commune, page 48, lines 8 to 23, in the English version, and I don't have the corresponding page and line numbers for the French version, but the corresponding portions are also excluded.  Here, let me just repeat that: For the objections to the events in Shyorongi commune, page 44, lines 8 to 23, in the English version, and the corresponding page and lines in the French version.  For the objection on the purported meeting between Ngirumpatse and the Interahamwe, regarding the killing of an Interahamwe leader in Rugenge secteur, page 46, line 36, to page 47, line 20, and page 48, lines 8 to line 19, in the English version, and the corresponding pages and lines of the French version.  

For the objection on a purported meeting of Nzirorera and Interahamwe leaders on 4th January 1994, concerning the swearing-in ceremony for President Habyarimana, page 67 lines 19 to 36.  

Now, the Chamber also wishes to clarify it's order made at the beginning of the session of 8th November 2006, regarding the evidence adduced in closed session which should be made public.  The Chamber, therefore, orders that page 7, line 17, to page 11, line 33, of the closed session provisional transcript be made public.  

Now, regarding the procedure previously outlined for submissions concerning objections that arise in court, the Chamber finds that it is appropriate for all submissions to be filed formally through CMS, but also, to be sent by e-mail to CMS, the parties and the Trial Chamber coordinator for expeditious treatment.  

And, lastly, as a result of the comments made on 6th November 2006 by Mr. Robinson, and Mr. Webster, about having exhibits only existing in a Kinyarwanda version, the Chamber now informs the parties that necessary arrangements will be made in liaison with the Registry in order to ensure that exhibits already admitted in this trial are going to be translated to English and French.  

My colleague has drawn to my attention that I did not give -- say specifically in relation to each of the transcripts that it should be the corresponding version in the French translation.  All of my page lineations were from the English version, and they have to be applied to the corresponding portions of the French transcripts.  Thank you.    
Now, Mr. Witness, after that brief interlude, the time has come for you to be examined by another lawyer.  On this occasion, you will have to answer questions put to you by counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  The examination will be conducted by Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I think I shall have to adjust my strategy somewhat with a view to making a line of questioning possible in the next quarter of an hour before the mid-afternoon break.  I shall try to do so, but remain structured at the same time in my cross-examination, Mr. President.  

Now, before addressing the witness, I would like to come back to what you said about the record and the documents in Kinyarwanda that had to be -- or, should be available for the parties in French and English.  And I would like to say at this moment in time, when beginning my cross-examination, I do not have at my disposal all of the elements that were disclosed in Kinyarwanda with reference to Witness HH, nor with reference to Rule 66 or Rule 68.  So, with that reserve, I will commence my cross-examination.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness HH.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness HH, I shall introduce myself.  My name is Frédéric Weyl, and I am a lawyer with the French Bar in Paris, and I'm one of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's counsel.  

The Prosecutor has now finished his examination in-chief and it is now my turn to put questions to you in the context of my cross-examination.  Now, so that you may understand what is the nature of my mission and how I understand my mission, I shall summarise it to you.  I shall be putting to you questions on your situation, on your character, in order to ascertain your credibility.  Have you understood me on that point? 
A.	I understand.  
Q.	I shall also put questions to you on the statements that you have made before this Trial Chamber, in order to evaluate the events that you have recounted, but, of course, I shall only do so in appreciating or assessing your credibility.  And, of course, if I believe that you are not, then, of course, my cross-examination will reveal that.  
A.	I understand you, Counsel. 
Q.	In order to avoid difficulties that we have come across with other witnesses, I would ask you to please listen attentively to my questions before responding, and to make sure that you have understood them correctly, with a view to answering my questions and not answering questions that I have not put to you.  If you provide a response that is not in keeping with my question, then, I will, as Mr. President has suggested, interrupt your responses to questions that I have not put.  Do you understand me? 
A.	Yes.  I understand.  
Q.	Witness HH, do you remember the oath that you took before this Trial Chamber to tell the truth, and the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Do you remember this at every moment in time? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	You will, of course, remember that oath when I put questions to you and before you answer those questions, will you not? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	Witness HH, did you understand -- or, have you understood that at least four people see their futures as depending upon the responses that you will provide and the sincerity therein? 
A.	Yes, I understand what you are saying, even if you have not yet given me the chance to express myself at any length. 
Q.	Do you realise who those four people are that I mentioned, i.e., the ones that I say have their futures that are reliant or depending upon the responses that you shall provide? 
A.	You are talking about four people, but I don't know who the fourth person is.  I know of three people. 
Q.	The three people that you are thinking of are Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, Édouard Karemera, do we agree on that point or not? 
A.	Yes, we do. 
Q.	Now, the fourth person, whose fate depends upon the statements that you will make before this Trial Chamber, will that not be Witness HH, himself, Witness HH? 
A.	I don't quite grasp your question, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness HH, would it not be true to say that your future depends on the responses that you will provide to this Trial Chamber? 
A.	I don't understand it the same way as you do. 
Q.	For you, and according to you, would you say that your future does not depend on the responses you provide before this Trial Chamber? 
A.	I understand that you are, in fact, warning me as to the consequences that my answers might have here with reference to my future.  That is what I have understood. 
Q.	Witness, at this stage it is not my role -- the role of Defence counsel, to warn you.  My role has been to remind you of the oath that you have taken to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing about the truth before this Trial Chamber.  And, then, I asked you whether saying the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this Trial Chamber, could, "yes" or "no", have an effect on your future, and it is up to you to respond to that. 
A.	For me, if I tell the truth, I will not have to live any ill consequences.  
Q.	Witness, I shall register that first part of your response, and I shall ask you the question from a slightly different angle.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover) -- or, that is what you said during the closed session at the beginning of your testimony; is that correct? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, although his religion may not be sensitive, the phrase that you have just used cannot be permitted.  To describe what a witness said in closed session during open session is not permitted.  So, we have to redact that from the record.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, I understand you perfectly, Mr. President.  

I shall rephrase my question, Mr. Witness. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, are you a Christian? 
A.	I am, indeed. 
Q.	Do you have the conscience of a Christian? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	What you will say before this Trial Chamber commits you and your conscience; does it not? 
A.	Yes.  What I say before this Trial Chamber, I am saying it in full awareness because I am a fully aware human being. 
Q.	Witness, saying something that is inexact or incorrect before a Trial Chamber that will lead to an unjust sentencing of an accused, would have an effect on your future, would it not? 
A.	I'm very much aware of that. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to thank you for your response to that second part of the question, when I asked you whether your testimony before this Trial Chamber does not also involve your future.  

Now, before moving to the mid-afternoon break, I would like to ask you a couple of brief questions for you to tell us a little bit about yourself, and I would like to remind you that you are a protected witness and I presume that you know what that means; do you not? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	So you should not do anything that might reveal your identity. 
A.	Yes.  That has been repeated to me on a number of occasions.  
Q.	And you should not give the names of places, of people, or use possessive pronouns that might establish who you are through close relations that you might mention; for example, you should not say "*************", when talking about somebody whose name has been given that would then reveal your identity.  Do we agree on that point? 
A.	I have understood, Counsel.  
Q.	I say that, because I believe that the record might have to be cleaned up and rid of a number of personal pronouns that might identify you through your statements.  Now, Witness I wanted to ask you, are you really bent on being protected?  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Weyl, are you trying to run down the clock -- or, when are you going to get to the crux of your cross-examination?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Short, I am in the crux of my cross-examination, in the sense that I am now starting out.  And I think that you will be convinced as I move forward in my cross-examination.  I believe that we are in the heart of the debate, and I do not believe that in asking those questions I am cutting away, at all, from the question of identity and protection of identity that we talked about for at least a quarter of an hour yesterday morning.  

So, I put the question to the witness and I have asked him whether he really finds his protection important, and after that, once he has responded, I will ask him a further question on that subject. 
THE WITNESS:
In order to answer your question, as Your Honour has just said, I believe that I have expressed myself lengthily on that subject already, and I believe that you should come to the crux or the salient points of your cross-examination. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness HH, I might understand that Mr. Short puts that question to me, but I would request you not to suggest to me how to lead my cross-examination.  So I shall put the question to you once again:  Do you find your status as a protected witness important? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
(Pages 30 to 43 by Eleanor Bastian)















1530H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	And why is it so important for you to testify as a protected witness and with hidden identity? 
A.	I would not be able to answer that question.  I am not the one who put in place those legal provisions with reference to the protection of witnesses.  
Q.	Witness, I will be satisfied with that response, whilst asking you, nonetheless, to remember what I said to you at the outset:  Try to answer my questions as I put them to you.  
MR. WEYL: 
I see that we're looking at the watch.  I will then stop and resume after the pause, if that is your wish. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I just wanted to call to your attention a translation issue.  I think my colleague refers to Judge Short as "Judge Short", but I think in the English version it comes across as "Mr. Short".  I don't think that any disrespect is intended by that, but I wanted to make sure that somehow we're all on the same page on that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Mr. Weyl, is this a convenient time for you?  
MR. WEYL: 
If that is your wish, Mr. President, I am at your service, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can't resist the temptation to say that that was not exactly responsive to my question, but nonetheless, we will take the break now.  
(Court recessed from 1534H to 1600H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, you can continue.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness HH, you are, at present, in prison; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	How long have you been detained, Witness HH?  
A.	Since 1997. 
Q.	Do you remember the date of your arrest? 
A.	I was arrested on the******************. 
Q.	So that was just over -- you have just spent over nine years in prison; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Are you counting the days since you were arrested?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness HH, you are not a free man today; we would agree on that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	So, as such, you are not testifying as a free man before this Trial Chamber, are you, Witness HH?  
A.	Yes, that is the situation. 
Q.	Witness HH, living conditions in Rwandan prisons are difficult, are they not? 
A.	Yes.  You know that when one is in prison, one is in prison.  One is not a free man, and living conditions are indeed very difficult. 
Q.	So one is wary of everybody when one is in prison; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, what are you getting at when you say that one is wary of everything?  I don't quite understand what you mean. 
Q.	I shall put my question in a different manner.  When one has spent nine years in prison, one has one wish, one aspiration, and that is freedom, is it not? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	When one has spent nine years in prison, one is trying to find any legal means of being a free man again; is that true?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, if I were to summarise, you have come here to testify as a detainee who aspires to freedom; would we agree on that? 
A.	Counsel, I can't quite grasp what you mean by that.  I am going to tell you why I say that I don't understand what you're saying.  I came here to testify before this Trial Chamber, and I do not believe that the mere fact of testifying before this Trial Chamber will help me become a free man. 
Q.	Witness HH, the fact that you are testifying before this Trial Chamber, or the way in which you might testify before this Trial Chamber, could that come in the way of your freedom?  
A.	No, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness HH, the aim that you have in testifying before this Trial Chamber, is it the search for truth, for your country, for pardon, for reconciliation? 
A.	That's right, Counsel. 
Q.	In your testimony under oath, there is no calculation on your part?  
A.	It is in my interest, quite simply, to tell the truth on what I know on the subject of the events to which I was a witness or that have been recounted to me.  
Q.	Witness HH, so you are telling the truth before the Trial Chamber, and you are also telling the truth before the Rwandan jurisdictions, are you not, or Rwandan courts? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	So it would not be possible to tell the truth before this Trial Chamber and lie before a Gacaca court, would it, now?  
A.	Yes, we agree on that point, Counsel. 
Q.	So I shall put the question to you that I put to you earlier.  Why did you ask for confidentiality to be respected and for the guarantee of the Trial Chamber and the Prosecutor if the truth that is told here has no effect on your situation in Rwanda? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I'm going to object to that question.  There's a difference between the witness being concerned about his security and the witness telling the truth because he wants the truth to be heard and not expecting any adverse consequences to his -- his own judicial status.  And I think there is a distinction between the two and they have been conflated by Mr. Weyl and his questions, so I would object. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would rather the witness were the one to respond to me than the Prosecutor coming to the aid of the witness.  My question was a clear one and did not require the assistance of Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness, you've requested confidentiality with respect to the responses that you will provide before this Trial Chamber.  Was that for your own security or was it for your judicial future in Rwanda? 
A.	I believe that the Trial Chamber should take measures.  I believe that this was a decision that was taken by the Trial Chamber and not by myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this is the second -- Mr. Weyl, sorry, this is the second time the witness has said that, and I think he's quite right.  We have, in fact, made a legal ruling on this matter already.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you made a ruling on the subject of protection, and I was talking about the confidentiality of the answers provided before this Trial Chamber, and the witness has requested for the confidentiality to be respected, and that is quite a different subject to protection.  So that was quite -- a question that really fell outside of the scope of your ruling, but I might have misunderstood your ruling. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, then I don't understand your question either.  To what are you referring when you said the witness requested confidentiality?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am referring to the transcript where it is said that "There are elements, indeed, that might harm me in my trial, but I think that you will respect confidentiality and that subsequently it should not be an issue."  So I am thinking here of the questions and answers that might pose a problem for the witness in his trial and with respect to which he requested for confidentiality to be respected.  So that's quite a different matter to that of protection, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I do not recall that the witness requested confidentiality.  The witness was advised of his rights against self-incrimination -- or informed of his rights.  He has not requested -- or refused to answer any questions on that basis up to now, so the issue does not arise yet.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, we agree on that point, Mr. President, but I believe that that could be a problem in my cross-examination.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness HH, you have not yet been sentenced in Rwanda, have you? 
A.	That's correct, Counsel, I have not yet been sentenced. 
Q.	So, will you be appearing before a court? 
A.	Yes, I shall.  
Q.	And you do not know when? 
A.	No, the date has not yet been given to me for my trial. 
Q.	And you do not know what you have been accused of? 
A.	I am accused of having perpetrated killings.  I am aware of that much.  
Q.	Witness, do you know the organic law of 1996 that organised the procedure of confession and pleading of guilt at the time that you were arrested?  
A.	That organic law was mentioned to me, but when it was mentioned to me for the first time, I did not believe that it was possible, that it was true. 
Q.	Witness, do you know what the main provisions of that law were and whether there were advantages for those who pleaded guilty and who entered into a confession in 1996? 
A.	I heard talk of that, yes. 
Q.	Witness, if you were given the law of 1996, and articles 5, 9 and 15, would that refresh your memory in any way?  
A.	I do not believe that it is necessary to present me with those articles, because at one moment in time, I did notice that it was useful, and I did decide to follow or enter into the exercise that the government offered us. 
Q.	I'm not talking about the same thing here, Witness.  I'm talking about the organic law of the year 1996 that was in force when you were arrested.  Would it be of any use for me to ask Mr. Issa to hand you the text in Kinyarwanda of the provisions of that law with a view to refreshing your memory?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it is amongst the documents disclosed under number 3, and these are documents that are in French, English and Kinyarwanda, and the Kinyarwanda version has the number KO317681.  Could Mr. Issa please show that to the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the point of this?  The witness is not a lawyer.  You heard the evidence he gave of his education levels.  What -- what are you doing by asking him to comment on a -- on a law, on legislation?  We are not a jury.  If you want to -- we can read the law ourselves.  We don't need a witness like this to explain the law to us.  If you want to put to him certain things, you can put it to him, but he can't really be expected to comment on legislation.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, well, if the law has been entered into evidence on my request, then I believe that I can make comments on it, and I could also ask the witness to provide clarification with reference to my questions.  But if this is not part of the debate and if it is not entered into evidence, then I might be up against some difficulty.  If there is an objection to this being admitted into evidence, then I would request, however, Mr. President, for it, indeed, to be entered and admitted into evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If it's the current law of Rwanda, it doesn't need to be in evidence.  I think the Court can -- can acknowledge it without it getting an exhibit number.  That's -- I don't think the record needs it, but I'll leave it to the Court to decide.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to say that this is not the law that is currently in force, it was the law that was in force.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you pass your script up so we can see it, what it is?  Do you have the law itself or just extracts of the two sections that you're referring to?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have the extracts that are published at the top of the list and its update, and this was a document that was disclosed to us by the Office of the Prosecutor.  Mr. President, this is in the electronic version that we disclosed, and it is the document that was disclosed by the Prosecutor under the number 1999-12-23, list of first category of -- under KO0166 to 7801. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreter is not certain of the numbers because they were so rapidly spoken.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, any objection?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm not objecting, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Admitted.  

Registrar, what is the number?
MS. KOUO: 
D. NG39, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG39 admitted) 

MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to clarify that in the form that it was disclosed in, it is in a trilingual form, because the publication of the official journal prescribes that everything be produced in three languages, so we do not need to give different numbers according to the language of reference. 

Now, could I ask for Mr. Issa to help me to give to the witness the last page that is stapled to our copy.  It is, in fact, a list of names figuring in this very document. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't think this is really going to assist us.  This is information that the witness has already admitted in the closed session.  So I'm wondering how productive we're being with this.  In fact, when -- when I took the witness through his identifying information form, I had to read everything in order for it to be clarified on the record, so I don't know how far we're going to get with placing legislation and attached documents in front of him.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I do not believe that this has been entered into evidence, nor do I believe that the Prosecutor referred to it in his examination-in-chief.  I would like this document to be placed before the witness so that he can tell us, without giving his name, whether he finds his name included in said document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, you wish to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
With reference to the document shown to me by Defence counsel, I do not have an issue with what he says.  Indeed, in the year 1996, this had been talked about, but I saw no advantage for me in pleading guilty and in confessing.  But subsequently, I noted that most of the people who were on that list, a list of first category genocidaire, pleaded guilty and were released.  And once I had noted that fact, I decided to plead guilty and to confess, with a view to being released, because I had noted that some people had been released.  And I do not see that there is anything strange about my name appearing on this list, because some of the people who appear on the same list were released.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I would like to thank you for that response, but you're moving forward a little bit too fast for me.  
MR. WEYL:
And I would like to reassure the Trial Chamber that this part of my cross-examination is coherent and consistent, and I will not be adjusting my time in view of the fact that the Prosecutor went over his.  I am within the time limit of my cross-examination.  I would like to reassure you on that fact, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness, could you please circle your name on that list.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...we have not attempted to restrict anybody's cross-examination up to now.  We have not expressed an opinion as to whether we think you're taking too long to deal with the matters that you're dealing with.  We've made no comments about it at all, so why do you have to make remarks which could be interpreted as threatening the Court?  I take exception to those remarks.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am sorry that I was misunderstood, because I did not want to threaten the 
Trial Chamber at all, but I wanted to reassure the Trial Chamber as to using time in the best manner possible, and I am sorry that I was misunderstood. 

Now, could the witness please circle his name on the piece of paper that he has before him?  

Has the witness accomplished the task?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Counsel, I have. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, could this document please be entered into evidence under seal as Exhibit NG40, with your leave?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG40 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, would it not be true to say that you were under the law of 1996 -- under that law you were placed in the first category? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, would not -- it not be true to say that under the law of 1996, article 5 said that people entering into category 1 cannot benefit from a reduction in sentence as under article 15 in the document? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  That was how it was at the time. 
Q.	Now, Witness, when did the situation change?  
A.	I could not give you the precise date the change was operated, because I'm not a legal expert, but I know that some of the people on the list in question did benefit from a reduction of sentence and were subsequently released, benefitted from a release. 
Q.	Witness, we agree that it was after the month of June 2004? 
A.	No, that is not true.  
Q.	Witness, on the*******************************, did you sign a statement, a confession, and a request for pardon?  
A.	Yes, did do so.  
Q.	Witness, did you sign a record of reception of a plea of guilty of repentance and request for pardon? 
A.	Absolutely, Counsel.  
MR. WEYL: 
Could we, with the help of Mr. Issa, show the witness the Kinyarwanda version of the procès-verbal of receipt of confession, bearing the number K035-6069 to 6076?  It is also included in what we disclosed as a CD, apart from the copies we have provided.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, perhaps you can tell us which number in the bundle, then. 

The French booth is asking counsel if he can indicate the number in the bundle. 
MR. WEYL: 
Document 13, which is 13A, English (sic), 13B English, and 13C Kinyarwanda.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you acknowledge or recognise this document?  Witness, do you recognise this document?  
A.	Yes, I have seen this document.  I haven't finished my reading of it, but I note that my signature is there, and, thereby, I do recognise this document. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, could I ask for this document to be entered as Exhibit NG41, A for the French, B for the English, C for the Rwandese -- or Kinyarwanda?  And, of course, this request is for it to be kept -- also to be entered and kept under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, a witness's prior consistent statement is not evidence.  You have not shown that this confession, as yet, contradicts something he said in his testimony, and that is the basis upon which it would be admitted as showing an inconsistency with his testimony in this court.  So we would expect that you show some foundation for admitting it.  If it's consistent with his testimony in trial, there's no point in admitting it, and there's no legal basis for admitting it.  So you will have to show that there's some contradiction with his testimony.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, were the witness to remove his headset, earphones, I would be happy to explain what purpose I am pursuing and which are the contradictions I see. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's just the point.  If you use -- if there are contradictions, you put it to him, and it appears on the -- on the evidence record and we admit it as an inconsistent statement.  I think those are the basic rules.  So if you have contradictions that you see, you put them to him.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, before I confront the witness with the contradictions, I wanted to be sure that he agreed to the fact that he had entered a confession on the *************************and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's identified the document by signature.  
MR. WEYL: 
Therefore, Mr. President, I wanted to ask whether the witness can tell us what he reads on page 1, on the first page, after the title underlined in the middle of the page where it says "Inyandiko-Muugo" and tell us whether indeed -- 
JUDGE KAM: 
Mr. Weyl, the witness had removed his earphones, so you'd better start again.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I should like the witness to tell us whether he sees in the middle of the page a reference to the Organic Law number 16 of 2004. 
THE WITNESS:
I do not see that reference. 
(Pages 44 to 52 by Sherri Knox)
























1644H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In Kinyarwanda -- forgive my accent -- it begins by saying, "Yitege kodashnu genga (phonetic)," which means organic law -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth.  
THE WITNESS:
I think Defence counsel should read this and ask -- put questions to me.  We went through all this when I appeared, and it seems to me that the contents of this document is different from the tenor of the confession I personally made.  So let him put questions to me so that I can explain.
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Witness -- Witness, you said that you do not remember whether your confession and guilty plea was after the new law.  I wanted to confront you with a document that you've signed, and we note that you are taking good note of the documents shown to you.  I suppose that you signed your confession under the law of 2004.  Is that correct or not?  
MR. WEYL:
And I will, moreover, with the aid of the transcript, show that my question was, "Witness, we agree that it was after the month of June 2004 that you signed your confession."  And the witness answered, "No."
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Witness, now that you have your confession before you, can you confirm that it was after 
	June 2004 that you signed your confession? 
A.	In order that I might understand all that, I have a copy of my confession and guilty plea at my residence here.  And if you'll allow me, I will bring my copy tomorrow so that you can scrutinise it and determine whether it is in conformity with the -- your documents that you've subjected to me.  Otherwise, I have no -- I don't understand at all what you're asking me. 
Q.	Witness, is that to say that what you have before you is not the record of your confession and guilty plea, where you said that you had recognised your signature? 
A.	Yes, I did see that the document bears my signature, but things are not as clear as all that to me, to my eyes.  And I would like to be allowed to bring my own copy tomorrow so that we can compare my copy to this document we've got here.  
Q.	I'm sorry, Witness.  Please don't take the question I'm going to put to you wrong, but do you know how to read? 
A.	I did explain that I know how to read, but I did not study very much, so I can't read very fluently or easily.  And I certainly can't understand all that stuff I have in front of me. 
Q.	Witness, you cannot read this document.  Is that what you're confirming to me? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  
Q.	Witness, do you know how to write? 
A.	Yes, but I don't write very quickly.  
Q.	Witness, you know how to write long, long, long statement structures whilst not knowing how to read? 
A.	I must tell you that the documents you have before you are documents from the present Gacaca proceedings, and they have nothing to do with my confession and plea of guilty.  So you must distinguish between the confession and guilty plea by a prisoner and the documents you have which are taken from the Gacaca proceedings.  Those are two entirely different things. 
Q.	Witness, was it you who wrote the documents ascribed to you in the Gacaca proceedings, or do you not know how to write, much as you don't know how to read? 
A.	I want to tell you that the documents I have before me are different from my confession.  And I told you I have a copy of my confession.  You think I'm inventing a legal instrument and that I want to show you a fake?  If you want, we can send someone to the witness's residence and I'll show him where the document is and they can bring the document here without myself being obliged to go there. 
Q.	Witness, we have here your written statement.  I will ask Mr. Issa to show it to you.  It is my -- 11 in my bundle, K0367137.  I request that it be shown to you with the President's permission, please.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, in the meantime, while the witness take -- peruses, scrutinises the document, I think there's no objection to the document that I'd asked to be entered to be entered as D. NG41. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you have this document before you? 
A.	Yes, I do indeed have this document before me, which I recognise.  And there's another document which is testimony that I recognise, and I acknowledge that they are both documents in respect of my confession. 
Q.	Witness, is that your handwriting? 
A.	No, no, no.  It is not my handwriting.  This document was written by someone whose task it was to write such things on behalf of detainees.  But I do acknowledge, or recognise, the contents. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to read this document? 
A.	But I tell you I recognise the contents.  I don't see why I'd have to read the document. 
Q.	Witness, can you see what's written on the top right-hand corner, the first line in the top right-hand corner of the document?  Can you read that?  

Witness, I will help you.  You know the contents of this document, you said.  I see above on the right that it's -- it said the document was drafted on the***********************************.  Do you agree? 
A.	Yes, I agree. 
Q.	Witness, you have said that you recognise this document and it is not in your handwriting.  Can you tell us who wrote the document? 
A.	At the prison, there are chaps tasked with drafting confessions for detainees.  And after the drafting, they reread the document to the detainees, and they're drafted on the basis of what the detainees have said or written for the people entrusted with drafting.  I had myself on another date written out a confession, which is different from the one we have here, and then this document here was drafted on the basis of the document that I had written, which wasn't very legible.  And if this document that you have and I have and which has the date on it which is there, it's because that was the date on which the document was conveyed to the prison administrators. 
Q.	Nonetheless, that means, Witness, that for drafting your confession and your plea of guilty, you were assisted by someone.  
A.	Yes, that is the procedure.  
Q.	And you were assisted by somebody who was so used to doing this work that he knew only too well the conditions that were necessary for a confession to be admissible.  Do we agree on that point? 
A.	No.  The only criterion was somebody who could write well and who had better handwriting.  And the contents comes from the detainee.  Documents -- the documents are then taken to a typing pool and recorded by date of arrival, or submission.  Now, I provided my confession in the month of********, but this document was transmitted to the legal department in the month of************.  
Q.	Witness, we would agree, therefore, that your confession was entered after the month of June 2004, was it not? 
A.	Are you saying the 19th?  Why do you say the 19th?  
Q.	I repeat that you saw on the document a date that was confirmed to you.  You confirmed to me that your confession was dated the*********************, and we both agree that that was after the 19th of June 2004, was it not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you entered your confession in the month of *******************because the Gacaca laws had changed, had they not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know the main provisions of the law on Gacaca courts and the interest that it had for you from the year 2004? 
A.	I would like to repeat to you what I said before:  I recognise that in order to make the decision to confess I had understood the interest that wasn't mine in confessing.  I understood that I had to do so when I saw that co-detainees had been released in the year 2003 after having entered a confession.  So I understood that I needed to go through the same procedure myself.  And I do not believe that you need to waste any time in asking me whether I had understood the interest that such a procedure represented for me. 
Q.	Witness, you do know, nevertheless, that the law of the year 2004 allows those who have confessed to benefit from a reduction of sentence, do you not? 
A.	Yes, I know that that is how it works.  
Q.	Do you know that somebody who is considered to be in the first category and who has used the confession procedure will see his sentence reduced from 25 or 30 years and -- reduced to 25 or 30 years and that if he has not entered a confession, he risks life sentence, does he not? 
A.	I know that if somebody confesses and if his confession is sincere, he will benefit from a reduction of sentence.  
Q.	So I will come back to your response from another angle.  So were he not to confess, he would not benefit from a reduction of sentence, would he, now? 
A.	If you do not confess to a crime and if you are guilty, you cannot benefit from a reduction of sentence.  However, you can confess, and once the court has completed its investigations on the substance of your confession and confirmed the sincerity of said confession, then you will be granted a reduction of sentence.  However, if the tribunal comes to the conclusion that your confession is not sincere, you will not benefit from a reduction of sentence. 
Q.	Witness, you have understood the law of the year 2004 perfectly because, if your confession is not considered to be sincere, then you will not benefit from a reduction of sentence, will you, now, or even a suspended sentence? 
A.	We agree entirely, Counsel.  
Q.	Now, for your confession to be sincere, it has to be complete, detailed, and precise, does it not? 
A.	Indeed.  
Q.	And if your confession is not complete, then you will forgo the benefit of a reduction of sentence, will you not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, if things are said here that were not said before the Rwandan courts, then you might forgo the benefit of your confession, might you not? 
A.	Of course. 
Q.	Witness, when I asked you the question earlier as to the interests you had in the confidentiality of what was said here, it is because that you are frightened that what you might say here could compromise your situation in Rwanda.  Is that not the case? 
A.	No, that is not the case.  What you are saying commits no one else but yourself.  I am of the contrary opinion. 
Q.	Now, for the time being, it only commits me, true.  However, Witness, I would like to say that you are totally aware of the content of my questions to come.  Would you like to continue, or would you like to ask the Trial Chamber for a break in order to consult counsel? 
A.	To answer your question, I would like to say the following:  With reference to my confession and my guilty plea in Rwanda, it was on my own initiative.  And, also, appearing here before this Trial Chamber is a personal decision.  I do not need to request the opinion of the Prosecutor before answering your questions or testifying before this Trial Chamber.  So I do not give much importance over to what you've just said. 
Q.	Witness, because I am entirely loyal and I wish for there to be no misunderstanding whatsoever, I believe that I should call your attention to the provisions of the law on Gacaca courts dated the year 2004 that say that if your confession is not complete it is not admissible; that if your confession is posterior to your being put on the list of the cellule Gacaca, it does not have any effect on the reduction of sentence; and if elements appear that you hid in your initial statements, then you will lose the benefits of the Gacaca law.  So before continuing my cross-examination, I would like to renew this request.  

And it has nothing to do with seeking advice from the Prosecutor.  It would be to seek advice from somebody else, possibly, because it is not my role.  Do you wish me to carry on putting questions to you, or do you request confidentiality because you cannot tell the truth before this Trial Chamber? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I'm not going to allow the witness to respond to that.  The witness's testimony has already commenced, and he will be obliged to answer the questions put to you -- put by you, unless we decide otherwise.  So he's already in the position where he has no right to tell you you can't carry on questioning him.  So please proceed with your examination.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, at this juncture do you persist in saying that your answers before this Trial Chamber do not have any incidence or consequences with regard to your judicial situation in Rwanda? 
A.	Counsel, I do not see why you are trying to show that you have pity for me.  What I shall say here will have no incidence upon my trial.  It is my own business, and I do not see why you are endeavouring to provide me with advice as if you were to pity me. 
Q.	Witness, do you remember the events or facts that you confessed to before the Gacaca? 
A.	Yes, I do remember.  
Q.	Witness, could you please remind us of them.  
A.	Up to now, the first confession that I made was that members of the Tutsi ethnic group were killed by people *********************************and I was not able to save those people, and I requested for forgiveness.  I also confessed in another document, that I do not have with me here, but it is at my disposal, and in that confession document, I pleaded guilty for other events, or facts.  I do not believe that it is necessary for me to go into detail here because I have not come to explain my confession. 
Q.	Now, Witness, in the Gacaca proceedings, did you admit to having taken part, personally, in massacres? 
A.	Counsel, I can see that you're still trying to lead me down the path of saying whether, yes or no, I killed people.  So I'm basing myself on what counsel for Nzirorera said yesterday, who said that everything that was said before this Trial Chamber will be made known in Rwanda.  Because he said that people in Rwanda speak to prisoners and give him information, then I think that, with Mr. President's leave, I would like not to respond to the question that you just put to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Leave is granted.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness, you do not want us to discuss the whole truth before this Trial Chamber? 
A.	I am of the opinion that you should put questions to me on the subject of what I said as to the Interahamwe leaders.  That is the kind of question that I was expecting, rather than being asked questions on my judicial record.  
Q.	Now, as I said earlier, Witness, the first part of my cross-examination would be to assess your credibility.  That is what I am undertaking now, and I would like to pursue this exercise and conclude it. 

Now, at an earlier stage, Mr. Witness, you said to the Trial Chamber that coming to testify here you had but one goal in mind, which was to establish the truth and contribute to historical truth, reconciliation, and forgiveness.  Do you remember having said that? 
A.	Yes, I did say that, but there is nothing in what I said that would lead you to believe that you need to mention my case file.  I came here in order to show the role that the Accused played.  And as Mr. President just said, I do not believe that we should talk about my case file, but, rather, I will tell you the whole truth on the subject of the events associated with the Accused. 
MR. WEYL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Witness, there's something I need to tell you.  The leave I granted to you a few minutes ago was not intended to imply that your judicial record is not relevant to the trial.  We, at the end of the day, have to assess whether to believe the evidence that is given by people who give testimony before us, and one of the factors that -- that we take into account in deciding what reliability, or how much we could believe what a witness says, is sometimes affected by their judicial record in their home country.  

So I didn't want you to have the impression that we consider that your judicial record is completely irrelevant because we will be interested in some aspects of it to assist us in determining to what extent we can believe what you're saying.  I hope you understand me.  

There was a specific question that we gave you permission not to answer, but that is not to say that we think your judicial record is irrelevant to the proceedings.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you, Mr. President, and I shall follow your instructions. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, historical truth is something that cannot be divided, can it? 
A.	Yes, I understand what you're saying, Counsel. 
Q.	And the historical truth that has relevance to you is also relevant to this Tribunal, is it not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, you said at an earlier stage that you were coming here in order to establish historical truth and that this was bereft of any personal interest.  Now, do you confirm that after these developments? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is as it is.  
Q.	So we could talk about your judicial record in Rwanda, could we not, and you would be in agreement with that? 
A.	Counsel, we may talk about it.  And when I note that such-and-such a point might be harmful for me, then I will point it out.  
Q.	Witness, the statements that you have made to the investigators of this Tribunal before**************** *********, do you now reject them and do you claim that they do not contain the truth? 
A.	Yes.  I do not think that these statements should be taken in -- into consideration. 
Q.	Witness, on the contrary, the statements that you gave to the investigators of this Tribunal from the date of the **************************are, in fact, correct, are they not? 
A.	Yes.  Because when I made -- or, gave those statements, I was conscious of what I was doing.  I had decided to tell the truth. 
Q.	Witness, do you remember having met with the Prosecutor during the month of March 2006 and having given him a further statement, for which he took down precise notes? 
A.	I told you that all the statements that I made after the ********************until now I can indeed confirm that they contain the truth, that they are truthful. 
Q.	Witness, in the year 2003, when you met with Counsel Webster, were you wary of him? 
A.	Counsel, I do not know the man to whom you have just referred. 
Q.	I would say that Counsel Webster is sitting on the side of the Prosecution and that he is the gentleman who led your examination-in-chief.  
A.	I do not know whether that is indeed the gentleman, but I said that all the statements that I gave before the ***************************were not truthful.  I only now recognise as truthful the statements that I gave after that date.  So those statements before that date should not be considered reliable.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you met with Counsel Webster in the month of March 2006, did you not? 
A.	Are you referring to the month of March, Counsel?  And what year are you referring to?  
Q.	I'm referring to March of the year 2006, that is, of the current year.  
A.	Counsel, I've already responded to that question in the affirmative, and I said to you that all the statements that I gave after the month of *****************are truthful in content, and I have recognised that fact.  
Q.	Witness, I have nearly finished for this evening.  Now, this is what Counsel Webster wrote as a summary of your statements of March 2006.  "I gave a statement to the investigators in 1998," you said, "but I would like for it to no longer be taken into account.  Because, aside from the fact that I did not trust them, I was under considerable moral and psychological pressure at that moment in time, and it was the subsequent statements of the year 2004 and 2005 that I gave of my own volition and in pure conscience of the situation."  

And that is what you said to Counsel Webster, did you not? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that fact, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, in reminding you of the oath that you have taken, if your statements of the year of 2004 are not the same as the ones you gave previously, is it because you now trust the Office of the Prosecutor today more than you did yesterday, or is it because, in the meantime, the Gacaca law changed, i.e., on the 19th of June of the year 2004? 
A.	Once again, Counsel, I shall repeat to you what I said before, and I would like to say that the statements that I gave in 1997 and 1998 and until the year 2000, and up to the date that I provided you with, in those statements I did not tell the truth because I saw no interest in telling the truth.  So I would like to ask you to consider as reliable only the statements that I have mentioned to you subsequent to the date that I gave you. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this evening, if you would like to take the adjournment.  

I just had a question.  Would the Trial Chamber like me for -- like me to request to be entered into evidence the law of June 2004, or does the Trial Chamber consider that it is something that is already within the debate?  If the Trial Chamber requests for it to be entered into evidence, then, of course, I can provide you with the English and French versions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I hope that you are not usurping the judicial powers of the Court.  We don't request anything to be entered into evidence.  If you request, then we will adjudicate it.  

But perhaps we can come to that tomorrow morning.  We will take the adjournment now. 

Sorry?  Tomorrow morning.  We'll lead with the evidence tomorrow morning, submissions.  

Mr. Witness, we take our adjournment now.  I remind you, as I've done on previous adjournments, that you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during any adjournments of the Court.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1734H)
