MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everyone.  Sorry about that.  Our computer was not properly connected.  

Good morning, everyone.

Could we have the introduction of the parties before we resume our work for today.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is the same.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.

Defence, Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Today we have Philippe Larochelle, Mr. Nzabonimana, and myself.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.

Witness CNAF; am I correct, Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
That is correct.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Witness CNAF, you cannot hear us?  Would you assist him, please.

Yes, Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
I can hear you very well now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  We would just like to remind you that the oath which you took to tell the truth still obtains.  And we are now in open session.  

Defence counsel, you could advise the Trial Chamber whether we should be in open or closed session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
The questions I'm going to ask may likely lead to the identification of the witness, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
Registry, could we go into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 59] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in closed session
