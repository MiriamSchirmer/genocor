MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 22nd of April 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your testimony will continue.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began.  Mr. Webster will continue his cross-examination. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me begin by wishing everyone a good morning.
FERDINAND NAHIMANA, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And a good morning to you, Mr. Nahimana.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Nahimana, we left off yesterday with you making some reference to the book by 
	James Gasana, and I'm wondering if you had a chance to review it last night and if we could discuss it a bit now.  
A.	Yes.  Let me say that last night I did not read the document, but I have the reference for the quotation I gave yesterday.  The book is Rwanda:  Du parti-État à l'État-garnison, L'Harmattan, April (sic) 2002.  The page number is 133. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  Because I also took the time yesterday to find the book and reread portions of it, and I also found the same passage, pages 132 to 134.  And I actually have the book here with me.  

And quite frankly, I find it surprising that you call upon Gasana to support your testimony since so much of his book is critical of the MRND.  Wouldn't you agree with me that this book, which is approximately 350 pages, discusses the MRND party state -- Rwanda, the MRND party state, through Rwanda, the garrison state.  And he is -- when he refers to the party state, he's referring to the MRND.  And when he refers to the garrison state, he's talking about the government of Rwanda after July of 1994 when the RPF took power.  That's basically -- basically what he's referring to.  Can we agree on that much?  
A.	I agree with you on one point, namely, that it is a critical analysis.  But I am somewhat surprised that you are surprised that I quote this book as being a critical book even in respect of the MRND.  I am a scientist, so to speak, and even though I am in prison -- but there are parts of this book I agree with and others with which I disagree.  And so there are things that are correct and some that are incorrect.  For example, an incorrect part is where he mentions my name as being one of those who attempted to kill him.  

	I am sorry, but I'm answering the question you put to me. 
Q.	I don't think you're answering the question.  I asked you one question, and I expect one answer in response to the question.  Now, you have all the time you need to explain your position.  You can do that in redirect with Mr. Nimy.  But the way we're going to proceed is I'm going to ask you a question, and your -- your responses should respond to the content of the question.  

Now, you've done so at this point.  We'll get to what he says about you.  Rest assured, we will get to his comments about you.  

But the first point I wanted to establish through you is that the book is about the MRND state on the 
one hand and the RPF garrison state on the other hand; right?  That's all you need to respond to now. 
A.	Yes.  I told you that I agree with you, but I was surprised that -- 

Mr. President -- Mr. President, I would like to -- I would like to request that when a prosecute -- the Prosecutor puts a question to me, I should be able to answer.  He started his question by stating that he was surprised that I referred to Gasana's book which criticises the MRND.  And I told him that I cannot refer -- I cannot fail to refer to a document which contains parts of material that I agree with.  Because I am an academic, and I, therefore, do not see why he stops me from answering; whereas, he is the one who raised the point.  I thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I think that on this point the witness should be given the opportunity to provide a full answer because he was answering to the very proposition put by the Prosecutor to the extent that the book by Gasana is very critical of the MRND and that he was surprised to see the witness refer to that book.  So the -- the witness was answering that point and -- and said what he thought.  And I think that we should -- he should be given the answer (sic) to complete his question rather than interrupt him.  He is stopping the witness from -- from -- from providing a full answer. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think -- I think we all understand each other.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And let me apologise to you, Mr. Nahimana, if you thought I was being rude a moment ago.  I simply want us to establish certain ground rules for your examination.  And the ground rule that's most important is that I will try to be as clear as possible in my questions, and I would appreciate it if you could be as clear and as responsive as possible in your answers and direct your answer to the substance of the question.  So that's my only concern.  

Now, I have a lot of stamina.  I'm willing to listen to you all day.  But I think the Court wants us to keep on schedule.  But rest assured, every question that I have for you will be asked.  So if it takes two days to do that as opposed to one morning, that's what I'll -- we'll proceed on that basis.  

I want this to be an efficient examination.  So please just listen to the question and answer it.  Okay?  And I will try not to be rude.  And if you would glance over to me, if you see my hand going up, just pause for a moment, I'll explain myself, and then we can proceed.  All right?  
A.	Don't worry.  I am a man of great discipline.  And I want to obey the instructions, so please don't be afraid. 
Q.	All right.  Getting back to the book by James Gasana, up to page 288, he's talking about the MRND party and what led up to it in its demise, and from page 288 to the end is when he's talking about the RPF.  So basically, this is a book about the MRND.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	It is a book that deals in part with the MRND and in part with the RPF. 
Q.	The only sustained discussion that he has about the Interahamwe is on pages 132 to 134.  He mentions the Interahamwe here and there, but in terms of a sustained continuous discussion, that's really only three pages of this 350-page book.  Can we agree on -- on that much?  Or do you need to look at the book in order to agree with me? 
A.	If I had a copy, that would be useful. 
Q.	Well, let me get through a few questions, and I'll hand up this copy to you.  This is my only copy.  So you'll have an opportunity to thumb through it.  We can even come back to it later this morning after the break if there's something that you need to bring to our attention.  All right? 
In his discussion of the Interahamwe on those three or four pages, from pages 132 to 134, essentially he is continuing his analysis of the MRND party.  Can we agree on that much, that simple proposition?  
A.	You have the book in your hand.  And if such is the case, I really cannot deny that assertion. 
Q.	And I believe you brought it to our attention, because you claim that Gasana is suggesting that the MRND -- excuse me -- the Interahamwe was never part of the MRND party.  That's why you brought this book to our attention in the first place; right? 
A.	I do not claim -- 

Mr. President, Your Honours, intellectual honesty simply requires that we refer to those two or three lines on page 133 which enables the Trial Chamber to be familiar with the exact content of that quotation. 
Q.	I'm not quite sure if you've answered my question, but we'll move on.  What -- what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Nahimana, is that in the three or four pages that -- in which Gasana discusses the Interahamwe, essentially he's making -- he's continuing his analysis of the MRND, because he identifies progressive persons or renovators within the MRND party and opposes them to Habyarimana and the Akazu and the old guard of the MRND.  Basically, he's trying to suggest that the MRND was not monolithic, that there was a progressive wing, that he puts Ngirumpatse within the progressive camp and Habyarimana at the other end as among the MRND old guard, which was dominated by the Akazu.  

And in discussing the Interahamwe, he suggests that Habyarimana did not want any formal recognition of the Interahamwe within the MRND party because to do so would strengthen the hand of Ngirumpatse, who he viewed as his competitor, because once it became formal, quote, part of the party, it would be under the authority of the national secretary, who was Ngirumpatse at the time.  Isn't that what he says in pages 132 to 133? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, yes.  I know that your paraphrase is correct.  It reflects the content of those pages.  However, I would like to take you to the crux of the matter.  

Yesterday you read or you referred to a communiqué that was read by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And you told me that the MRND congress integrated a committee -- or rather, that it integrated the Interahamwe za MRND into the MRND at that congress.  And my answer was no.  And I supported my answer with the quotation which you do not want to read.  

And I understand how the author can be critical.  I do not say that what you have said is not contained in the book.  But we have shifted from the initial question on which you predicated your question yesterday. 
Q.	Let me assure you, we'll get back to that.  But we're going to finish my discussion -- or our -- our discussion of Gasana first.  

Now, you know that Gasana, while he was still minister of defence, resigned and fled the country.  Or actually, he fled the country first and then submitted his resignation back in July of 1993; isn't that so?  
A.	Yes.  I know that, and it is true. 
Q.	And he fled the country because he felt that his life and the life of his family was threatened even though he was the minister of defence of Rwanda.  That's so, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  That is what he says. 
Q.	And, in fact, he accuses you personally of being among those who were threatening to him at page 172.  That's what you were referring to earlier, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  That is what he says. 
Q.	In fact, in that portion he's discussing the infamous speech of Mugesera in Gisenyi in 
	November of 1992.  And he accuses certain allies of Mugesera, including you, of being so angry about the criticism of Mugesera that you plotted to eliminate him.  

And he refers to an article from Isibo.  And I'll only read the bottom portion of it.  And in his book he's quoting the Isibo article and he -- and giving it his support.  And I'll read it in French. 

"We have just learnt that a plan is being plotted to assassinate Minister Gasana and some of the officers mentioned below.  Some sources have it that the preparation involved civilians, such as Uwilingiyimana, F. Nahimana, Kadahwema, and Nzirorera." 

You wanted to respond to that allegation?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have already stated that I have already read this book, and I have also said that I agree with some of its content and I disagree with other parts of its content.  What he has read is an excerpt of an Isibo article.  And yesterday in my testimony I said that if we are to understand issues we must put them in proper context.  

Now, Isibo -- unfortunately, I don't have all my sources here with me.  So allow me to speak extemporaneously.  Isibo is a pro-RPF newspaper which was headed by Sixbert and -- Musangamfura, I believe.  Sixbert became the head of the intelligence service of the government headed by Mr. Twagiramungu after the 17th of July.  And this was under the RPF regime.  

Some have argued -- and he will say so -- upon his exile after he left the country, I believe in 1995 -- some have said that Isibo already at that time was an instrument at the service of the RPF as much as the Kangura newspaper.  Kangura for some time was also such an instrument.  Therefore, all the articles that were published and which Mr. Gasana referred to were intended for destabilisation purposes.  

Now, let me speak to the issue that concerns me personally and which also refers to Mr. Nzirorera, who is present in this trial.  My counsel went to see Mr. Gasana in Switzerland and asked him whether the content of his book was based on reliable sources.  Mr. James Gasana told him that he had simply learnt of these things but that he could not state that he was working on the basis of reliable data.  

Now, Mr. Prosecutor, I hope that during this trial we will be able to use two documents on which Mr. James Gasana relied to flee the country.  And these documents include one, the Machiavellian plan; and secondly, another document dealing with what was referred to as Amasasu.  According to Mr. Gasana, Amasasu was the very reason for which he fled.  

Now, what do we know today?  It is no longer a secret -- and you should not rely on this anymore.  Gasana himself has dismissed all of this matter.  He is even sorry that he lent them an ear.  Amasasu was an -- an issue that was plotted by the head of the intelligence service and others.  And it is Amasasu who claimed that there was a hard wing -- or a wing of hardliners who had decided to assassinate -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We missed the name mentioned by the witness.  If the witness would kindly repeat the name of the person who was to be assassinated. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the name was Gasana. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what was the last name that you mentioned in your response? 
A.	Well, that is it.  That -- that is the last word I mentioned.  I said that is it. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  The interpreters were having some problems, but I'm sure we'll cover it again.  

In any case, fundamentally, whether that information initially appeared in Isibo or not, James Gasana in his book points the reader to that article in order to give it credence.  In other words, he is relying on the information and supporting or endorsing the reporting of Isibo in relation to the threats against him; right?  

That -- that only requires a yes or no.  So start with yes or no, and then we'll move on.  Okay.  
A.	I am not accustomed to answer yes or no, because your question doesn't require a yes or no answer.  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, start by answering yes or no.  And then I will ask you a follow-up question, and you can bring your thoughts to light through my follow-up question.  All right?  

So my only suggestion to you is that in his book Gasana refers to that article in Isibo and credits it or endorses the information that Isibo was providing in that article.  That's the only thing I'm asking you.  Is that what Gasana did in his book?  
A.	Gasana espouses the Isibo allegations.  That I agree with. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And if I could have Mr. Issa put this document in front of the witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
-- and show it to the Chamber.  Mr. Witness can read it while it's being shown to the Chamber and the other parties.  It's the exact same thing. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. -- Mr. Witness, the -- the system here is not designed to be unfair to the witnesses.  So if you're patient, I think the questions will be asked which will allow you to express yourself. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you claimed in your direct examination that you were the member of -- excuse me -- that you were not a member of a death squad.  You were asked specifically about Network Zero.  Is it your testimony that such death -- death squads existed but that you were not -- never associated with them or that no such phenomenon existed in Rwanda?  And here I'm talking about the existence of death squads, such as Network Zero.  
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  Let me tell you once again -- this is what I said yesterday -- that the Zero Network was being talked about but I am not aware of that organisation, neither am I aware of its members. 
Q.	What about death squads in general?  Is it your contention that there was no such thing in Rwanda back in 1992 and 1993? 
A.	Death squads were talked about.  And it all depends on what side you were on, because the 
	death squads -- the existence of which I know -- and there are two members of the RPF who claim that they were members of the death squads in the years you are mentioning.  And this comes from Mr. Ruzibiza himself, who was a member of the death squads or the member -- a member of the RPF network within Rwanda. 
Q.	Okay.  Because you've already -- you've already mentioned Amasasu.  And what I've placed before you is James Gasana's letter of resignation, which is dated the 20th of July 1993.  You see his signature at the bottom.  You see the stamp on it.  

And I'm going to read it in French.  It's addressed to the president of the republic.  And he says, "Your Excellency, Mr. President, I regret to resign from my position as minister of defence.  I feel obliged to take this decision because of the persistent threats and actions of sabotage directed against me in the course of my present duties.  These threats, which place my family and myself in a situation of permanent insecurity, is the work of a political and military group which is anonymous and which has given itself the name Amasasu and whose aims remain obscure.  

"Yours sincerely, Dr. James Gasana, minister of defence.  Copied to your excellency, the chairman of the CND, the prime minister, and all ministers in Kigali for information." 

So you were telling us before about the Amasasu.  I think -- I'm assuming you've exhausted the topic.  But in any case, this is what Gasana submitted officially back in July 1993 when he fled the country because he thought that he was being targeted by death squads. 
A.	Mr. President, I -- I'm sorry to realise that what the Prosecutor has just read does not make any mention of death squads.  If you are talking about Amasasu, Amasasu is not equal to death squad.  And he does not even say what Amasasu comprises.  It is not mentioned anywhere.  And there's nothing that makes us say now that Amasasu means death squad.  

And before you read the text, I was saying that Gasana had indeed fled the country, claiming that it was Amasasu that wanted to cause problems in his life.  But in this text I do not see where you come up with death squad, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We have your response on the record.  The Chamber can make its own assessment of whether there was any -- anything improper about me characterising Amasasu as a death squad.  

Now, you wanted to look at the MRND party resolution from the congress that was held on the 28th of April 1992.  And it's in evidence in our case as D. NZ006.  And I did make a copy of the specific resolution that I wanted to -- I wanted us to discuss.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could place this in front of the witness.  It's page 2 in the French text of D. NZ006.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I'll read it in English.  And then you can actually look at the text in writing.  But this is what Mathieu Ngirumpatse read out to the assembly, which apparently included you, back on the 28th of April 9 -- 1992. 

"Number 4, the members of the national congress commended the founders of the Interahamwe organisation and requested that this organisation should be established in all préfectures and even communes and, if possible, affiliated to the MRND party." 

And I'll give you a chance to actually read the French text to yourself.  And then I'll ask my question.  So taking note of this specific resolution, wouldn't you agree that, in fact, the MRND party congress encouraged the expansion of the Interahamwe organisation nationwide?  
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  I think that today we are better placed to understand, as compared to yesterday.  Precisely, the congress asked that Interahamwe za MRND, at the stage they were in at the time of the congress, did not directly deserve to be an organisation that would be integrated into MRND.  The members of the congress expressed the wish that they should change their structure and then in that case they would be propagated throughout the country.  

There is no difference between what is written and what I said.  The only thing is that yesterday -- and this is a piece of truth -- I said that the congress did not approve the organisation Interahamwe za MRND as an organisation that could be integrated into the MRND, either during or at the end of the 1992 congress.  That is what I said, and that is what the situation is. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, the Chamber will have an opportunity to compare your testimony and your analysis to the exact words spoken by Ngirumpatse in the context of what was transpiring in 1992.  But in any case, you would agree with me that, when Ngirumpatse announced this resolution, the Interahamwe had already come into existence in Kigali; right?  This -- this -- this announcement in April didn't create the Interahamwe; the Interahamwe were already existing.  Can we agree on that much? 
A.	Absolutely.  They were existing in Kigali indeed. 
Q.	And we have testimony in this trial from avowed members of the Interahamwe that the organisation took form sometime in late 1991 and that by early January or February of 1992 this organisation was meeting regularly in the MRND secretariat.  You agree with that information? 
A.	If that's what he said, I cannot challenge what he said.  But be that as it may, I do not know if it was at the central bureau of the MRND, the executive bureau, or whether it was the MRND at the 
	préfectoral level.  What precisely did he say?  Because those two bureau offices are in Kigali. 
Q.	In fact, Désiré Murenzi, whom you've already identified as a leader of the Interahamwe, claims that by late December 1991 or early January 1992 the MRND party leadership had already recuperated the Interahamwe -- Interahamwe organisation for its own purposes.  Do you have any reason to dispute that information? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
MR. NIMY: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I think that on two occasions the interpreter has talked about "1982" because -- would that be an error?  Because I think we're referring to 1992.  But on two occasions I have heard "'82". 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Let me intervene and -- and suggest that I'm talking about 1992, 1-9-9-2.  

THE WITNESS:
Your question concerns the existence of Interahamwe in that year.  I think that you have to be clear about the matter.  It is undeniable that at that time the Interahamwe did indeed exist in the capital, Kigali, and in its environs, that is, Kigali-rural.  That is a truth that cannot be challenged. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And the -- 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Oh, I'm sorry.  I --
A.	Now, for Mr. Désiré to say that at the end of that year MRND leaders had recuperated the Interahamwe za MRND movement, you should be able to make a distinction between the MRND leaders at the préfectoral level and the MRND leaders at the national level.  We should be clear.  I am not denying that at the préfectoral level the Interahamwe were recognised perhaps by the 
	préfectoral committee of MRND in Kigali.  

But now, at the national level, the Interahamwe za MRND movement was not recognised -- or rather, it was not approved.  We were well aware that it did exist, but as an organisation it was not officially accepted.  Were -- if that had been the case, we would not have been discussing the issue in the congress and then arrive at the resolution that was read at the end thereof. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Nahimana, what I would suggest to you is that, by the time Mathieu Ngirumpatse was making that announcement in April 1992, the Interahamwe were up and running and he was just acknowledging what had already happened, which is that the MRND party had adopted the Interahamwe and were using it for its own purposes under the leadership of Mathieu Ngirumpatse as national -- first as the préfectoral head in Kigali and then as national secretary.  

But let me put the question to you a different way.  Document number 11 in my bundle, which I had distributed for a previous witness, is a set of photographs.  And a number of these were taken on the 4th of January 1992.  And this is in relation to a demonstration that was organised in Kigali to support the government of Nsanzimana.  And there are photographs of Georges Rutaganda of the MRND -- excuse me -- of Interahamwe in uniform of the motards, which is Interahamwe performing on motorcycles, signs in the photographs saying "Interahamwe za MRND".  And according to the book in which this was published, which is the book by Jean-Pierre Chrétien, Rwanda:  Les médias du génocide, these were all taken on the 4th of January 1992.  

So let me ask Mr. Issa to hand this up to you.  Everyone else has it as document number 11.  And you look at the photographs and you tell us if you can tell whether these are Interahamwe at the 
préfectoral level or the national level or what you think of these photographs, because it seems to suggest that on the 4th of January 1992 the Interahamwe were not just a discussion group but this 
was on its way to becoming a -- a mass movement. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me -- let me make a correction to what you said.  It is not Jean-Paul Chrétien but Jean-Pierre Chrétien.  

Secondly, these demonstrations took place in the capital, Kigali.  And as you yourself said -- and as I admitted, and nobody can deny that -- the Interahamwe existed in Kigali.  They existed in Kigali.  And sometimes even the Kigali group went out to animate meetings which were being held outside Kigali.  That is a reality.  

But to try to get the Chamber to understand from that that the Interahamwe movement was set up throughout the country, that is false.  That is my position.  And that is the reality in my native préfecture, Ruhengeri, for example. 
Q.	Well, wouldn't you agree that the MRND had a regional base in the northern préfectures of Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, and Byumba? 
A.	Yes.  The MRND was well implanted in those préfectures. 
Q.	So doesn't it stand to reason that the Interahamwe youth wing would take root in those regions where the MRND was strongest before any other regions in Rwanda? 
A.	Once again, that is leaving aside the context of the moment.  This was in 1992.  Ruhengeri, as I said -- and this is a reality.  And if you want, I can list the names of communes, and I will tell you there was war going on in this or that commune.  The -- the entire Byumba was at war.  Now, Gisenyi was the only commune remaining.  

Now, to say that the Interahamwe za MRND was going to be set up in Ruhengeri and Byumba is not to be aware of certain realities.  Those of us who were in the field and who were following things up closely at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture, we asked that that movement, Interahamwe za MRND, should not be set up solely, as I said yesterday, because the young people in Ruhengeri were mostly people who had been displaced from their own hills.  And they were just setting up there for the time being.  

So yes.  The Ruhengeri population had joined -- most of them had joined MRND.  But because of the war, it was people who were on the move.  Not even only MRND -- if you take MDR, which had the youth wing called Inkuba, I do not think that they were set up in that region because of this war -- because of this reality of war.  

So, Prosecutor, please place yourself within the context of the moment.  Do not generalise.  The Interahamwe was set up around the country but not in that zone which was at war. 
Q.	Didn't you yourself testify back in September of 2002 in your own trial, specifically on the 19th of September, that there were Interahamwe in Vunga, which I believe you said was in Gisenyi, but that the bourgmestre of Gatonde, which was an adjoining commune in Ruhengeri préfecture, had also formed Interahamwe.  And you went into a -- a lengthy discussion of some violence committed by the Interahamwe in Gatonde.  

And this is referred to in document number 59 of my bundle, which is your trial transcript from the 19th of September 2002, at page 64 in the English text and starting at page 118 of the French text.  Don't you remember that testimony, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	Yes, of course, I do, and it rather corroborates what I'm saying to the Chamber today.  On the 
	one hand, you yourself are asserting -- and at that time I did mention that an Interahamwe group had come from Gisenyi préfecture, a neighbouring commune to ours.  Now, you are -- you are asserting and corroborating what I stated yesterday.  There we are. 
Q.	Well, I don't believe that's what I said.  Perhaps I wasn't as clear as I should be.  You were talking about Interahamwe in Gatonde, which is in Ruhengeri, that the complaints were coming, I believe, from Gisenyi, because Interahamwe in Gatonde were being violent and committing various crimes.  

And here I'm referring to page 65 in the English text where you say -- and I'll read it in English -- "I was saying this movement came from the locality I've just mentioned, Vunga, and according to the reports that we had later, they came from Ruhengeri préfecture, because there were complaints.  This was at the instigation of the chairman of the MRND of Gatonde commune, one Jean-Pierre Nizeyimana, spelt N-I-Z-E-Y-I-M-A-N-A, whose residence is at the border of Gatonde commune with Giciye commune."  Giciye is G-I-C-I-Y-E.  

That was your testimony as it was reported back in September of 2002. 
A.	Absolutely, Mr. President, Your Honours.  That is correct.  First of all, I will pardon the Prosecutor because he's -- he is showing his lack of knowledge of the area.  Vunga is not in Gatonde.  Vunga is in Giciye commune in Gisenyi préfecture.  And precisely, as we are saying, in my commune the chairman of the MRND who had no Interahamwe in his commune -- because Gatonde commune is in Ruhengeri and our préfectoral committee had refused, that Interahamwe should not be set up.  Since he had problems with neighbours and people in opposition to MRND, what did he do?  He crossed the river and went into Giciye commune in Vunga locality, to be precise.  And Vunga is found in Gisenyi préfecture.  So, Prosecutor, here you have confirmation of the fact that the Interahamwe was not set up in Ruhengeri préfecture.  

And as I said, there were some people who could resort to young people -- in fact, I do not know if these were young people of the Interahamwe group, as such.  In any case, as far as I know, the founders did not create a group of thugs, because there were -- there was no violence there.  If he went to Vunga, he definitely picked up a certain number of vagabonds that he calls Interahamwe and then took them over to destroy property in Gatonde commune.  That is what the text says.  So, Prosecutor, Vunga is in Gisenyi and not in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Nahimama -- Mr. Nahimana, I don't want to argue with you.  I'm just reading what was recorded from you back on the 19th of September.  And as I read this transcript, what it seems to suggest is that the Interahamwe were coming from Gatonde, which is in Ruhengeri préfecture, which is your home commune.  

And on page 66, you say, "Subsequently, the chairman of the MRND in Gatonde commune was imprisoned at Ruhengeri."  And then at the bottom of that same response -- and here you're responding to accusations that you were congratulating the Interahamwe -- you are denying that you congratulated them.  But you do so by saying, "But now talking about Nahimana congratulating the Interahamwe, whom we had refused to set up in our préfecture, even if there had been initiatives of the sort by the chairman of the MRND in Gatonde" -- and then you go on.  

So in this response you are acknowledging that the chairman of the MRND party in Gatonde had set up Interahamwe in his commune.  Now, the Chamber can review this transcript in relation to your testimony today and make its own decision.  But if you have anything else to say, you can go ahead. 
A.	Thank you, Prosecutor.  I do not want you to just pass over it and leave any doubt in the mind of the Chamber; whereas, it is clear.  First of all, you are what I -- mischaracterising my testimony.  I did not say anywhere that I congratulated the chairman of -- the MRND chairman of the commune.  And then you are going straight to the fact that the MRND chairman in Gakonda -- Gatonde commune was punished.  And that is correct.  Why?  Because the communal authorities did something about it, because he crossed the river and brought thugs from the other side of the river to destroy the property in Gatonde commune.  The person was punished, and he was imprisoned.  And those of us at the level of the préfectoral committee in Ruhengeri, we removed him from the list of chairman of 
	communal committees in Ruhengeri préfecture.  

So just don't ask that the record of that court session should be read.  But please try to read what I said clearly.  And if you look at what I said and what I am saying, there is no contradiction. 
Q.	Now, Casimir Bizimungu was also a member of the Ruhengeri préfectoral council.  He was indeed the president of that MRND Ruhengeri préfectoral council; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  He was the president of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	Are you suggesting that he agreed with you that the Interahamwe should not be created in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I am not suggesting.  I am simply stating a fact relying on the resolution of our préfectoral committee which he chaired. 
Q.	So he agreed with you and voted for the resolution that the Interahamwe should not be created in Ruhengeri; is that your testimony? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I am -- well, the person whom I saw in front of me was the president of the MRND.  And he was party to that resolution at the time it was passed.  So referring to that specific movement, that is all I see.  And I thank you. 
Q.	And you mentioned Hategekimana as the secretary who was also present for that meeting; right? 
A.	Yes.  He was present as the secretary, but he was not a member of the préfectoral council.  I can confirm that. 
Q.	But clearly he observed and heard the discussions and would have recorded that resolution.  
A.	I would think so.  Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us when that meeting and resolution took place.  
A.	Yesterday I mentioned this to the Court.  But I'm sorry that I don't have a specific date in mind.  Yesterday, in answer to Mr. Nimy's question, I stated that it was necessary to refer to the first letters by Mr. Hategekimana in which reference is made to the Interahamwe.  And in so doing, our meeting can be placed in the dates following.  

So if you have copies of the letters by Mr. Hategekimana in which reference is made to the Interahamwe, that could help us determine a date.  But I cannot be very specific as to the exact date on which that meeting held.  As I told you previously, we held préfectoral council committees -- meetings virtually on a monthly basis. 
Q.	Well, I may have misunderstood your testimony from yesterday.  Because when we were discussing the dates of your meeting with the préfectoral council, we were asking you if you remembered the date of the meeting where you sanctioned and criticised Hategekimana for not complying with the resolution.  And you suggested that that meeting took place after the first letter, the first violating letter, had gone out.  

But now I'm asking you about, when was the initial meeting wherein you decided that the Interahamwe should not be created in Ruhengeri?  Which would have established the policy that Hategekimana violated by sending out that first letter. 
A.	Except you want me to repeat my answer, this is exactly what I have just told you. 
Q.	Well, based on your testimony, I think there should be two meetings:  One in which you set a policy that the Interahamwe should not be created in Ruhengeri and the other when you sanctioned Hategekimana for violating that policy.  So I'm asking you about the first meeting.  When was it first decided that the Interahamwe should not be set up in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Well, first of all, the préfectoral council was set up, as I mentioned yesterday, in February, on the 12th of February 1992.  The congress you refer to held in April, and it was prior to the April 
	MRND congress -- April 1992.  
Q.	So sometime between February 1992 and April 1992 is when your meeting in Ruhengeri decided that the Interahamwe should not be set up; is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  I believe that it was during that period. 
Q.	And you suggest -- or let me ask you if Nzirorera was also present at that meeting and agreed with that decision.  
A.	Sometimes Nzirorera was or was not present.  In fact, all members were not always present.  But I -- I dare -- I dare say that he was present. 
Q.	Well, isn't it a bit counter-intuitive to suggest that prior to the MRND congress in April, which recommended that the Interahamwe be set up nationwide, that your préfectoral committee decided independently that this organisation should not be set up in Ruhengeri?  It seems like we have things out of order, but if I'm mistaken, you can correct me.  
A.	Well, I think that you need to understand that there was extensive discussion of the Interahamwe za MRND issue at the congress.  Some called for its integration into the MRND, while others were opposed to it.  And yet others still called for a postponement.  And some of us, like those from Byumba and Ruhengeri, were of the opinion, along with other préfectures, that it should not be integrated.  

So I do not see how that would be counter-intuitive in respect of the position of the party on this very specific issue.  I do not think so. 
Q.	Well, let me rephrase what I understand your evidence to be, which is that sometime in early 1992 you and Joseph Nzirorera and Casimir Bizimungu and other members of the Ruhengeri préfectoral committee became aware of the existence of the Interahamwe in Kigali and then independently decided that that organisation should not be set up in Ruhengeri.  And this took place before the issue of the Interahamwe was even raised by the MRND congress in April of 1992.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	First of all, there is a proposition which is incorrect.  It was not the Interahamwe congress in 1992.  That is not what it was.  

Correction from the interpreter.  So I'm sorry. 

Well, in any event, you yourself have put the date on which the Interahamwe za MRND was born at early 19 -- or late 1991, early 1992.  We are aware of the existence of the Interahamwe.  And, therefore, as responsible leaders, it was our position that the youth wing of the Interahamwe should not be set up in that way, because we had an experience of what other youth wings had done.  

Maybe it was not mentioned in this trial, but the Interahamwe was not the first youth wing of the MRND or -- because there was the MDR youth wing as well.  So because of our experience, we anticipated on this point and stated that the youth of our area should not be brought together in a movement known as Interahamwe za MRND.  And on that specific point, there is no contradiction between the position of the Ruhengeri préfectoral council and the national policy of the MRND. 
Q.	Well, I still find it difficult to follow what you're saying.  But maybe it's just me.  Because my understanding -- and this is from Ngirumpatse's resolution of the 28th of April 1992 -- was that was the first time that the party was taking any sort of notice of the Interahamwe organisation, April of 1992.  And my understanding from your testimony yesterday was that it was after the national party had recognised in some -- in some form the Interahamwe that your Ruhengeri préfectoral council decided that it should not extend to Ruhengeri.  

But now you're telling us that, even before Ngirumpatse made his resolution or announced the congress resolution in April of 1992, you and Joseph Nzirorera and Casimir Bizimungu and other members of the Ruhengeri préfectoral council decided that this thing called the Interahamwe should not be created in Ruhengeri.  So by your chronology you're making your decision before there's any acknowledgment by the MRND congress of the existence of the Interahamwe. 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I think the Prosecutor has some problems, as he has confessed himself.  You see, the Interahamwe za MRND is a group that was created, and it did not wait for the -- the national congress of the MRND to meet in April 1992, because already in late '91, early '92, Interahamwe za MRND was already in existence at Kigali-ville préfecture at that level.  That is the chronology of events.  So those of us who were in charge, we knew of the existence of that group.  

And as I said yesterday, there were people, young persons and others like Hategekimana, who wanted that movement which had been created in Kigali to expand to other areas, including ours.  And we anticipated on this issue.  And it would have been dishonest and unfortunate for those groups to exist at the préfectoral level and then subsequently we say, "No.  We have to dissolve this group."  

Now -- so in terms of chronology, yes.  We foresaw the creation of the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri préfecture.  So in April -- and I hope that we have a clear view of the chronology of events.  In April -- since the Interahamwe movement had been created in Kigali and was now beginning to be known across the country, we talked about it in April 1992 in our préfecture -- or rather, we talked about it in April 1992, and the congress took its stance.  And that is what was reflected in Mr. Ngirumpatse's resolution as he read it.  

So in what we read there is no statement that as at now the congress authorises the Interahamwe za MRND to be integrated to the MRND.  And I don't want to belabour this point.  However, the Interahamwe was free to spread out to any areas that it was able to. 
Q.	All right.  I think your testimony is a -- is a bit clearer, at least to me.  You asked when was the first letter that went out to Interahamwe presidents that was sent out by Charles Hategekimana.  And I'll indicate to you that in terms of what we have in evidence the date is the 23rd of September 1992.  How soon after that letter went out did you have your meeting with the Ruhengeri préfectoral council to sanction Hategekimana? 
A.	As I have already testified, the council met basically on a monthly basis.  But what -- what date did you mention, Mr. Prosecutor, for -- for the letter?  
Q.	The 23rd of September 1992.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  In -- as I already mentioned, the first sanctions were meted out almost immediately after people became aware of the existence of those letters.  But I am not in a position to give you exact dates. 
Q.	Well, when were your meetings generally held?  Did you have a standing date each month for meetings of the Ruhengeri préfectoral council? 
A.	No.  No.  There was no specific date, for example, the last Saturday of the week -- of the month, rather.  The position was that it would be depending on the nature of the problems that arose.  We had many problems, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Your Honours, we had many problems in Ruhengeri préfecture.  And whenever problems arose, we would meet and generally deal with problems relating to the war.  

So we had agreed, however, that we would meet at least once each month but without mentioning any specific date.  It all depended on the availability of the president, who was a minister, as well as availability of other members of the préfectoral council who held high offices in the country.  So whenever meetings held, it was when a majority of members were available. 
Q.	Well, if you can remember -- and you're not obligated to remember, but if you can -- when in October was the meeting that you held in response to this letter of 23rd of September?  Was it towards the beginning of the month?  The end of the month?  The middle of the month? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I know that prior to my departure for Europe towards the end of October -- and as I have told you, the first two weeks of November I was in Europe.  So prior to my departure for Europe, I remember attending a MRND préfectoral council meeting in Ruhengeri.  And then the other meeting which I attended took place when I returned from Europe between the 20th and the 25th of November 1992, I believe. 
Q.	And your testimony yesterday was that as a result of your meeting to sanction Hategekimana he was suspended for two weeks or something along those lines.  Could you clarify that point for us, please.  
A.	Well, let's -- let's be careful.  We probably need to understand a few more things.  I told you that, at the level of the préfectoral council, we made the recommendation to the president of the MRND -- that is, as a préfectoral council, we recommended that two types of sanctions be taken:  One, to withdraw or withhold one quarter of his salary, or proceed with a 15-day suspension.  As far as I recall, he received those two sanctions together.  

But to be more specific -- the president might be able to provide more details, and maybe you have details on our préfectoral council.  And I see you have many of them.  Through those documents we may be able to note that these were the measures that were taken following the recommendations.  The measures were taken by the president.  Why do I make this assertion?  It is because in the month of -- when I returned from my mission to Europe, during one of the meetings, the president of the 
party -- and this is normal practice -- reported to the préfectoral council on his activities in respect of the implementation of the decisions of the préfectoral council. 
Q.	And here when you're talking about the president, you're talking about Casimir Bizimungu; right? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  That is correct. 
Q.	And this meeting that took place in October before you left for Europe, did it also include Nzirorera? 
A.	Once again, let me tell you that, had we been having annual meetings, such might have been the case.  But to say that Nzirorera was in attendance at such-and-such or such other meeting would amount to my misleading the Trial Chamber, if I attempted to say that he was present at this meeting and not at the other.  If I attempted to be that specific, I might be misleading the Trial Chamber.  

And as I have already stated, the activities and duties of the various members were such that some of the members were present at some meetings and yet absent from others.  So it is possible that he may have been present at the October meeting, but I cannot be more specific than that. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Well, what concerns me -- and I'm assuming that -- well, let me clarify this first.  The -- the -- the sanction that was meted out to Hategekimana was meted out during that October meeting.  That's what I understood from your response earlier.  Am I correct? 
A.	I -- I believe that you are not mistaken.  In any event, it was during that period, namely, after the 23rd of September. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Tanya West)














1030H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Because the letter that you -- that we've been discussing from the 
23rd of February -- excuse me, the 23rd of September 1992, is not the only letter that we have in evidence which went out to Interahamwe presidents at the level of the -- of the commune.  There's the letter of the 23rd of September 1992, which is P. 369 in evidence; there's also the letter of the 5th of October 1992, also signed by Hategekimana on behalf of Casimir Bizimungu, which may have been before your meeting to sanction him; but then there's also the letter of the 28th of October 1992, which is after you left for Europe.  And we still have letters going out signed by Hategekimana for Casimir Bizimungu, your president, copied to Interahamwe president -- presidents at the level of the commune, and this would have been after he gave up two weeks of salary and was suspended for 
two weeks.  

Are you suggesting that he was so obstinate that even though he was sanctioned, and even though this was the subject of a meeting, he was still sending out letters on the 28th of October? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor -- well, it would seem that you have a lot of trouble with the chronology of events.  
We did not withdraw one quarter of the salary and proceed with his suspension at the same time.  
They -- these were consecutive measures, one happening after the other once one has been sanctioned by a withdrawal of one quarter of their salary.  Then, if the event occurs again, that individual is suspended.  
This is exactly how things happened, and it is this persistent error that led to his being suspended.  
This is how things happened.  That is the chronology of events.  
Q.	Well, thank you for clearing that up because, I thought, based on your own testimony of just ten minutes ago, that you were saying that the penalty of surrendering salary and the suspension were happening at the same time.  But now that we understand you, we can proceed.  

But you will recall that on the 15th of November 1992, there was a rally in Ruhengeri where Casimir Bizimungu addressed the people that were assembled.  And you weren't there because you were travelling, but the transcript and the video of that rally is in evidence in our case.  It's P. 011.  

And we have an excerpt from Casimir Bizimungu's introductory remarks, which is independently admitted as P. 354.  And if we look at the bottom paragraph on P. 354 in the English text, we have Casimir Bizimungu welcoming the chairman of the MRND, the national secretary of the MRND and fellow members.  And he says:  

"I ask you to join me in commending all those who have helped us organise today's ceremonies.  
Some of them have made contributions in order to raise the necessary funds:  I wish to thank 
Mr. Télesphore Munyaruyenzi...for organising this event, the MRND Committee for 
Ruhengeri préfecture, the Inkeragutabara-Urusengo troupe from Nkuba..." and..."the Interahamwe and all of you who have come from all corners of Ruhengeri préfecture, as well as the other préfectures in Rwanda to attend this rally." 

So what I'd suggest to you is that it sounds rather odd that you claim Casimir Bizimungu joined in a resolution to forbid the Interahamwe from being set up in Ruhengeri sometime before April of 1992, sanctioned his secretary sometime during the first half of October, and then here we have him on the 15th of November thanking those Interahamwe for helping him to prepare the rally for President Habyarimana.  Doesn't that all sound a bit illogical to you? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, in the Prosecutor's question there are many errors.  You first talked about a videotape.  Please be kind and honest enough to say that I was not there.  You said that I appear in the videotape talking about my presence in Ruhengeri.  I am saying to you that that is false, and I referred you to an exhibit that was made in my trial.  I am talking about my passport.  That for one.  

Now, secondly, you go on rapidly to create confusion as you put an allegation against me.  I do not want to interpret Casimir's words because I was not there.  Because what you have just read, I have never read; I am just hearing it for the first time.  But I am surprised that you are saying that he congratulated the Interahamwe president in Ruhengeri préfecture.  

What I know is that in that rally, there were Interahamwe who had come especially from Kigali.  That I know.  I got to know that.  But it would surprise me if Casimir talked about young people of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture.  Yes, we had young militants in Ruhengeri, but those young members were not there.  And so you can't say that members of the Interahamwe za MRND were not there.  There should be no confusion.  
Q.	Let me clarify one thing:  I never suggested that you were present at that rally on the 
15th of November 1992.  What I suggested was that consistent with your own testimony -- that you were out of the country -- or, I'm accepting your statement that you were out of the country, but I'm informing you that on the videotape, we have Casimir Bizimungu welcoming and thanking the Interahamwe -- apparently, the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri.  And I'm suggesting to you that he is specifically referring to the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri because the letter that went out on the 
28th of October 1992 that we just referred to is a letter inviting the Interahamwe to assist in the preparations for the upcoming meeting on the 15th of November 1992.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could hand this document up to the witness, this is P. 368C, the original document, the Kinyarwanda text, and Mr. Nahimana can examine it for himself.  

And with that, Your Honour, perhaps we could allow the witness to look at the text over the break, and then we can come back afterwards and address the substance of issues.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It's time for our mid-morning recess now.  And we will take it now.  The witness could have a chance to look at it during the recess. 
(Court recessed from 1037H to 1112H)
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin by clarifying something on the record, and I do this for the accuracy of the trial record.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And for your benefit, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And as a courtesy to Madam Hounkpatin, who brought it my attention that when I referred to Ngirumpatse's resolutions at the congress of -- the MRND congress on the 28th of April 1992, I was not being completely accurate.  That instead I should -- or what should be understood is that these are the resolutions of the national congress that were read by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who had just become its national secretary.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So now that you understand it, Mr. Witness, and it's clear for the record, I don't think there's any response that's needed.  But as a courtesy to the Defence, I simply wanted to acknowledge that and put it on the record.  

But turning to you, Mr. Witness, now that you've had a look at P. 368, let's read it together, and 
I'll read in English.  It's -- the subject is the MRND meeting held in Ruhengeri préfecture on the 
15th of November 1992.  The letter is dated the 28th of October 1992.  It's addressed to the 
MRND chairman of the communes, all of them.  And it's copied to the MRND secretary general in Kigali, to the Ruhengeri préfet, the Ruhengeri sous-préfet, the bourgmestres of the communes in Ruhengeri and Interahamwe presidents in all of the communes of Ruhengeri, signed by Hategekimana for Casimir Bizimungu.  But the content is what is important for us now.  And it starts by saying:

"Militant, I hereby wish to inform you that the important decisions taken at the meeting held on 
Sunday, the 18th of October 1992, bringing together members of the Ruhengeri préfectoral 
MRND committee, and MRND commune chairman, including the holding of a broad-based meeting in 
Ruhengeri préfecture on Sunday, the 15th of November 1992.  

"This meeting will take place in Ruhengeri" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the benefit of the interpreters, if counsel would slow down.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	"This meeting will take place at the Ruhengeri regional stadium starting at 9 a.m. sharp."

But what concerns me, Mr. Witness, is the first sentence where it's clarifying that the meeting of the préfectoral council was held on the 18th of October.  So that must be the meeting that you're referring to.  So now we have the date, if you agree.  
A.	Yes, we have a date, indeed, a specific date. 
Q.	And this is the meeting where Hategekimana was sanctioned; he was either fined or suspended for 
two weeks.  But still on the 28th of October, he sends out another letter directed to Interahamwe -- or copied, rather, to Interahamwe presidents at the commune level.  Right? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have looked at this exhibit carefully, which the Prosecutor is attempting to introduce as an exhibit for the existence of the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri préfecture.  

I do not know whether your copy is the same as mine.  From my copy, I notice that there is always a standard letterhead, and then there is the end of the document.  But this document before me -- and contrary to what the Prosecutor is attempting to do, there is no name of the president of the Interahamwe.  

It would appear -- it would appear on this document that there is at the secretariat a form with a letterhead, and then the conclusions, and that the secretary uses that document for whatever purposes.  
But on this copy here, we have the bourgmestre of Nyakinama commune mentioned.  But we also have a handwritten scribble or something in Hategekimana's hand.  Now, where we would have had the name of the president of the Interahamwe in the commune, there is nothing.  So what is the Prosecutor attempting to -- to do here?  What is he demonstrating?  

We have a document before us which he wants -- from which he wants to extract a number of items to claim that the Interahamwe movement existed in Ruhengeri préfecture.  But my point is, therefore, 
Mr. President, Your Honours, that this is not a reliable document.  

It would have been better, I would have preferred -- and I know that he will not be able to find a document which bears a name to the effect that Mr. So-and-so was president of the Interahamwe za MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture.  I do not see any such document.  And, therefore, I wonder why we want to use a document which has not even been filled out properly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could retrieve the document for me, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, the Chamber will have an opportunity to review the document itself.  Its authenticity has never been questioned before.  But I will point out that it bears a stamp.  There's the seal of the MRND; there's a signature which is consistent with the other letters that we have by -- signed by Hategekimana.  

There was a statement from the Prosecution that it was recovered in a préfecture office in Ruhengeri in a place where it was expected to be.  

So I don't think on the issue of authenticity you have much ground, Mr. Nahimana.  But we have your response on the record.  But in any case so it's clear, go ahead and respond if you think it's appropriate.  
A.	Yes.  Now, what you have said does assist the Trial Chamber and assists me as well because it tallies with what I have just said myself.  The general outlay of the letter tallies with the other letters that you have.  I'm -- I'm -- I'm not saying that the letter is not authentic.  But when you look at the copy -- the persons to whom they copy -- the letter was copied, you claim that there was the president of the Interahamwe za MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture.  In -- on the letter, there is no name mentioned in that position, and that is what I want to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to, that there is no name mentioned in the position of chairman of the Interahamwe za MRND in Ruhengeri commune -- in Ruhengeri préfecture.  
Q.	Well, perhaps I misunderstood you, Mr. Witness.  But as I understood your testimony, it was -- you were not questioning the existence of individuals who identified themselves as Interahamwe.  In fact, what you told us just 20 minutes ago was that these people were there.  And what you were questioning is whether the MRND party in Ruhengeri should be sending correspondence to the person that identified as the president at the level of the commune.  

So I didn't get from your earlier responses that there was any dispute about the existence of these groups.  My understanding of what you were contesting was that the groups were recognised -- were set in motion by the MRND party.  Now, if I've misunderstood you, you can clarify it.  
A.	I am not able to answer the -- what you have just -- answer to what you have just said.  

Maybe, Mr. President, it would be proper to ask the Prosecutor to repeat his question.  I don't want to be unclear in my answer.  
Q.	I think you do understand what I said, but I'll find a way of rephrasing it or addressing the issue in another way.  Because let me make my position clear, Mr. Nahimana, it would appear that you're just making this up as you go along.  Based on your responses from this morning and now in relation to what you said yesterday, you're just weaving things together to try and justify an answer that you gave, perhaps unthinkingly, at the beginning of your testimony.  That's what it seems like to me.  

But what I'm suggesting to you, based on my review of your transcripts, is that you said there was a group identifying themselves as Interahamwe, just as they had in Kigali, but that you complained to Hategekimana that he should not write to them on behalf of the party and the party should not take a role in organising them. 

That was my understanding of your evidence.  So if I've misunderstood you, now you have your opportunity to clarify it.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, first of all, it is unfortunate.  From the very beginning of my testimony, I never answered any question without thinking through the issue.  Maybe you can say that I made a mistake here or there, but I have been thoughtful throughout my entire testimony.  

What I seemed to understand is that you do not want to look at the obvious truth.  Mr. Prosecutor, the fact of the matter is that at Ruhengeri préfecture -- in Ruhengeri préfecture, we decided that there will be no Interahamwe group or Interahamwe za MRND.  

Secondly, you do not also want to accept what is obvious; namely, that this document that you are trying to use as an exhibit does not enable you to make the assertion that there was an Interahamwe za MRND group in our area.  

Now, the document says that there are a number of things that happened.  But at the bottom of that document, there is no reference whatsoever to anybody who would have been the head of such a group in -- in our area in Nyakinama.  So if we are to look at the evidence of the Prosecution, then 
we -- we must come to the conclusion that, somehow, we went on the wrong path, rather than waste so much time by attempting to prove that which did not exist.  

What I want to say is that the truth is absolute.  There are no two truths.  Either Nahimana is here and present now or not.  Nobody can now claim that at this very moment Nahimana is at the UNDF, on this day at this very moment.  So the truth is there.  And it is obvious, and it is single. 
Q.	Well, let's look at how you address this issue when you testified back on the 19th of September 2002.  And this isn't my interpretation of what you said.  I'm going to read from the transcripts.  And this is document number 55 in my bundle.  The English text is at document -- is numbered number 55.  And the French text is also numbered 55, but it's in the place where you would expect to see number 60.  And I'll hand up to you the French text so you can follow it with me, Mr. Nahimana.  
And you're being asked by your counsel, Biju-Duval:

"Could you tell us whether, at any given time, you were involved or consulted in respect of the establishment of the Interahamwe?"  And your answer is:  "I was not consulted at any time in respect of the establishment of the movement Interahamwes za MRND.

"Question:  When were you informed of its establishment?  Answer:  In reality this movement was gradually known, became to be known gradually, and it was due to the rallies organised by the MRND that the Interahamwe movement came to be known.  But I cannot situate exactly when I started knowing about the existence of that movement, but what I remember is that in the beginning, if not it was the end of 1992.  In any event, it should have been in the beginning of 1993, what I know is that we had a discussion at the level of the Ruhengeri préfectoral committee, because we were told that the Interahamwe movement was structured.  

"It is true we had -- chairman, we had a committee, and so on and so forth, but it was in July 1993.  
And I'll say why I'm saying July 1993, that movement was an informal movement and within the 
Ruhengeri structural committee..." it "...spoke out against that kind of thing, against such kind of conduct, and action within the MRND party."  

Now, I may be misunderstanding you -- now you have an opportunity to clarify matters, but it would seem to me that you are implying that prior to January of 1993 there was an informal group, but starting in July of 1993 -- or the beginning of 1993 -- there was an Interahamwe committee and chairman.  That's how it reads in English.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I think the Prosecutor does really have some problems understanding.  Maybe the problem is with the translation from the French to the English.  What is said here is in relation to the Interahamwe at the national level.  

Specifically -- specifically, what I can say is that the Interahamwe -- and I'm not referring here to the Ruhengeri -- the Interahamwe, in general terms, were gradually known -- one moment, please.  

And when a meeting took place in Ruhengeri préfecture -- by the way, I think Defence counsel put the question to me as to the speeches that were made.  Yes, indeed, at that specific time, the president of the republic was in attendance and delivered a speech in which he referred to the Interahamwe.  

That speech was broadcast at the national level.  However, it is a good thing that you have referred to these transcripts because they -- they -- they do, indeed, indicate that I stated that at the level of Ruhengeri, the préfectoral committee in Ruhengeri spoke out against the establishment of the Interahamwe in our préfecture.  That is correct.  That is what I have said consistently, both in 2002, yesterday and even today.  That has been my consistent position.  I have not budged from that position.  
Q.	And just so it's clear to you, Mr. Witness, as I read these transcripts, it would appear to me that you're making a distinction between an informal organisation that then became formalised sometime in 1993.  And while you may have complained about it initially -- or that's what you -- that was the substance of your testimony back in 2002.  I'm not assuming that it's true.  While you may have complained about it initially in response to this question from your counsel, you're suggesting that there is something formal that's taking place in early 1993 or July of 1993.  

But the Court will have its opportunity to review these transcripts more slowly in relation to your responses today, and then it can decide on whether it wants to rely on you or not.  

So I have finished with the subject -- this particular subject.  We can move on.  If there's anything that you would like to say as a final word, you may go ahead.  
A.	I have a small thing to say.  It is true that what is contained herein is correct.  After -- after the congress, what had been informal and was unknown became known, even if it were only by virtue of the fact that it was on the agenda of the MRND congress.  So there is no inconsistency between my statement in 1992, yesterday and today.  Thank you.  
Q.	Between 2002 -- the 19th of September 2002, and yesterday and today.  But I've been referring to Ruhengeri.  I am not being ambiguous about that point.  This is your testimony in relation to Interahamwe in Ruhengeri and your relationship with them as the member of the 
Ruhengeri préfectoral council.  
A.	No.  Prosecutor, do not mislead the Chamber because now you are slippery -- going down a road, and it will be difficult for you to climb back up.  At the level of Ruhengeri préfecture, it is clear.  And you might be able to read that.  If you look at page 89 of the transcript of the 19th of September 2002, it is written that at the level of the Ruhengeri préfectoral committee, we were against this kind of conduct, this kind of behaviour within the MRND party.  

So there, on the one hand, bear in mind the fact that they're -- these Interahamwe were being set up somewhere -- in Kigali, it's known.  But in our own area, we said "No, we did not want it."  

So do not try to mislead the Chamber.  That is clear -- that at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture, we refused it.  But what I said before was in general.  I think that should be clear now.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, you had mentioned in your testimony yesterday that Joseph Nzirorera had nothing to do with the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri and that you knew that from your visits with him.  
A.	Not only that, because my visits were a sort of supplement.  I said -- and I'm saying again -- that as a member of the préfectoral committee and as vice-chairman of that committee, he could not have Interahamwe.  And then, indeed, I never saw Nzirorera in the company of a group of 
Interahamwe za MRND because, once again, you should make a distinction between the young Interahamwe and the Interahamwe za MRND.  

There is a confusion that the Prosecutor is trying to take from one trial or matter to another, and I think you should put an end to that.  You should be courageous enough to make a distinction between the young people who became members of the Interahamwe and the organisation referred to as Interahamwe za MRND.  It would make things easier for you and for the Judges of this Tribunal.  
Q.	And the visits with Nzirorera that you're referring to, these are visits to him -- to his home in Ruhengeri? 
A.	It's not only one visit, Prosecutor.  I told you that this is my childhood friend, and we have been friends up till this day, and I hope that we'll continue to be friends even tomorrow.  And I did not pay him only one visit.  
Q.	I can appreciate that, Mr. Nahimana.  What I'm asking you -- or what I'd like some clarity on is whether these are visits to his home in Ruhengeri when you talk about visiting him on the weekends.  
A.	Not in Ruhengeri.  In -- in Busogo, and Busogo is in Mukingo commune.  He had a residence there.  
Q.	Are you referring to his mother's residence in Busogo or to his home which, I thought, was in 
Rukuru or Rukara or something along those lines? 
A.	When I say I used to pay him visits or I paid him visits, I am not talking about his mother.  I am talking about his home in the Busogo locality in Rukara, if you please -- if that is the reality.  Between Mr. Nzirorera's home and -- and his mother's, there's a distance of at least 2 kilometres.  
Q.	And you said that these were weekend visits.  Are we referring to 1991 or 1992 or both? 
A.	From 1991 to 1994, before the 6th of April, I paid him visits regularly, even in his commune.  
Q.	And if we limit ourselves to 1994, could you give us an estimate of how many times you visited him in his home in Ruhengeri prefecture. 
A.	The last time I was at his -- in Busogo, I had just given lectures at the Ruhengeri campus of the National University of Rwanda.  And if my memory serves me correctly, it was around the 
18th or 19th of March.  And on that occasion, I did not even find him.  I found his wife and children at home.  
Q.	Well, my question is really very simple.  If you think about 1994, roughly how many times did you visit Joseph Nzirorera himself in his home in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I was at his in March.  Let's say once.  
Q.	Listen to the question --
A.	Once, Prosecutor --  
Q.	How many times did you visit with Nzirorera, the person, in Ruhengeri -- in his home in Ruhengeri? 
Not just a visit to the house, but visiting with him in 1994 in Ruhengeri.  
A.	I met Mr. Nzirorera in Ruhengeri in his home.  I remember well.  And, in the month of February -- please do not ask me the specific date -- in the year 1994, that is the only time I met him.  The second time when I attempted to go to his house, I did not find him.  It was the 18th or 19th of March.  That date I remember because that is the last lecture I gave in the University of Rwanda.  The rest of it is 
well known because of what happened.  
Q.	All right.  Thinking about 1993, just give us an estimate of how many times you visited him in his home in Ruhengeri in the year 1993.  You don't have to give us specific dates.  Just give us a number to the best of your ability.  
A.	Just a moment, please.  After the 8th of February 1993, from -- or -- or, rather, in January, on the 22nd of January 1993, I met him in his home.  In fact, we discussed the Busengo rally.  And after the 
5th -- or, rather, the 8th of February, it wasn't easy to get to Ruhengeri préfecture.  So it was not until around November after the arrival of UNAMIR in Rwanda.  It was at that point that one could ply the roads to Ruhengeri.  So I would say January once; and then perhaps November, January, two times.  So in 1993 I can say three times in Ruhengeri.  I repeat:  In Ruhengeri and not Kigali.  
Q.	And what about 1992? 
A.	For 1992, the 12th of February, that date I retain.  After the congress -- the MRND congress in Ruhengeri préfecture, I accompanied him to his home in Ruhengeri.  That is a very specific date.  And after that -- I'm trying to look at it.  Roughly, it would not be more than four times in addition to February 1992.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  So I would assume that you two could not have been meeting as regularly as you suggest in the Ruhengeri préfectoral council, if that's the case, is it?  Or would you like to clarify?  Maybe you were seeing him in the préfectoral council in addition to the four times you saw him at his home in February '92, and the three times you saw him in -- or, roughly three times you saw him in '93.  
A.	Of course, I met him when I was present at the meeting because I did not take part in all the préfectoral meetings.  But it's not at the end of all the préfectoral meetings that we went to his home either.  So we met, and after the meetings, we returned to Kigali.  So there should be no link between the number of meetings and the number of visits which were supposed to have been made in Mr. Nzirorera's home.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  I just wanted us to clarify that, in addition to the occasions that you saw him in his home which you've enumerated for us, there were other times that you saw him in Ruhengeri, but that was in the context of these Ruhengeri MRND préfectoral meetings.  
A.	Tout à fait.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.
A.	Absolutely.  
Q.	Now, when you met Nzirorera in his home, on those occasions you didn't by chance meet any of his young relatives?  I don't know if you're familiar with other members of his family:  Noeli Ndayisabe (sic), Muhombo, Dusabimana, Musafiri. 
A.	Yes, sometimes -- not all of them at the same time.  They knew me; I knew them.  They were not always with Mr. Nzirorera.  They had their own business to attend.  So I met one member of the family or another and even Nzirorera's extended family.  
Q.	Well, there's testimony on this trial record that those individuals were members of the Interahamwe in Mukingo.  
A.	What do you want me to tell you now? 
Q.	Well, do you agree with that proposition or with the information that other witnesses have offered, that these relatives of Nzirorera were also members of the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune? 
A.	At the risk of repeating myself, Prosecutor, I do not know -- and I have said that again.  I do not know any Interahamwe in Mukingo commune.  You're trying to push things when you say that members of the family were members of Interahamwe za MRND in Mukingo commune.  They were probably.  I never asked each of them what political party they belonged to.  They were probably members of the MRND party, the youth wing of that party, and that does not mean -- I have told you that, and I've repeated that.  That does not mean that they were Interahamwe za MRND in Mukingo commune.  
Q.	Well, what is it that you observed that makes you think that they were probably members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	May it please the Chamber, I am saying that I did not state positively that these young people were members of the MRND.  I said that I did not ask and I do not know whether one or other amongst them did not belong to another party.  But if they were members of the MRND, they would be young members of the MRND youth wing and not, necessarily, the Interahamwe za MRND.  I am trying 
to get you to make a distinction between young Interahamwe -- young members of the 
Interahamwe movement and Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	All right.  I think your answer is clear.  Didn't you suggest that the Interahamwe should be incorporated in the civil defence in Ruhengeri?  And here, I'm referring to your previous trial testimony back in September of 2002.  
A.	How? 
Q.	Well, answer the question first.  Did you ever suggest that the Interahamwe or the young people -- the MRND youth wing in Ruhengeri should be incorporated in the civil defence in Ruhengeri? 
A.	The MRND youth wing or the Interahamwe za MRND?  I want this to be clear.  Let the Chamber not think that I'm being evasive.  In February 1993 I prepared a document in which I suggested -- or I proposed the organisation of the youth -- that they should be prepared to become part of civil defence, but civil defence under public authorities, if that is what you are talking about.  Young people, whether they're MRND or not, yes, I did so.  Not Interahamwe za MRND.  
Q.	Anyway, let me read to you what you said back on the 19th of September 2002 at page 59 to 60 in the English text, pages 110 to 113 in the French text.   And this is document number 61 in my bundle, and then you can explain to us fully what you mean.  But looking at the top of page 59 in the English text, and I apologise.  I'm not going to read the whole thing.  What I'll do is hand up to you, Mr. Nahimana, the transcripts so that you can follow along and bring to our attention anything that you think I'm mischaracterising.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa would hand up this document, which is document number 61, to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You say, "My principle was that I was against the Interahamwe and I said this.  I said that right from the beginning, at the Ruhengeri préfecture committee, we said no way.  Our country was at war."

That's along the lines of what you were telling us earlier.  

Then at the bottom of the page -- on 59 again -- this is you speaking, Mr. Nahimana:  

"We said that it was unacceptable that there be youths, such as those in the Interahamwe and Inkuba in communes in Ruhengeri who were facing problems, because these youths were known...to be in conflict each time they met.  So I was against such a principle."

And on the following page comes your suggestion, and you say:  

"I proposed that, instead, the youths should be adopted by the state, as it were, so that they form a 
civil defence, which will be working for the interest of the population and, basically, in the areas which had been infiltrated by the RPF.  And I had said that for this civil defence, which I had in mind, for it to be successful it should have, as its members, all the components of the population.  That was my idea.  Maybe this can be accepted or not by the government."

And then you go on.  So I'll repeat my question to you:  Didn't you suggest that the youth in Ruhengeri where you called this informal Interahamwe the youth wing of the MRND, didn't you suggest that they be incorporated in the civil defence? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, all what he has just read is in line precisely with what I just said, which is that I proposed that young unemployed people should be under the public authorities.  And I realise, Prosecutor -- I realise that you stop just at the point where what you would have read after that would eliminate the Chamber.  And let me read that sentence.  The public authorities could accept my proposal or not.  It is different from what is referred to as Interahamwe or the militia.  

So --
Q.	And the following sentence, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	The militias were from the party.  The civil defence can only be civil defence if it is under the 
public authorities or the government and if it concerns members of the population as a whole.  That is what I answered.  
When I talked about the militia being for the parties, what did I mean?  I was referring, for example, to Inkuba.  I was referring to the young members of the PL.  I was referring to the Interahamwe za MRND in Kigali préfecture.  But these youth organisations, as such, are a matter that the various parties should address.  

So do not suggest to me or to the Chamber that I, at one point in time, did suggest that the -- the Interahamwe za MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture should be part of the civil defence.  To perhaps not waste the Judges's time, let me draw their attention and yours, Prosecutor, to the fact that as far as 
civil defence is concerned, Trial Chamber I here accepted my point of view as far as the organisation of 
civil defence is concerned.  Once it is under the government, it is acceptable.  That is in paragraph 632 in my judgement -- my Trial Chamber judgement.  

So my vision was accepted by the Judges of Trial Chamber I in 2003 in their judgement.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We've just been discussing your proposal for Ruhengeri.  Didn't you also propose the same thing nationally, that there should be a civil defence programme nationally which would include the youth? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Involving the youth, and that is what I have just read from the transcript.  
Q.	And, in fact, you wrote an article back in February of 1993 -- I believe it was the 
21st of February 1993 -- that was entered in evidence in your own trial, which you had re-circulated on the 28th of March 1994, isn't that so?  These are all things that you discussed at great length in your own trial.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I wrote an essay entitled, Rwanda: Current Problems and Solutions.  
Q.	Suggesting that the minister of defence and the minister of interior incorporate youth in a nationally organised civil defence programme? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You also acknowledged that that civil defence programme was operational.  That it had been instituted initially in 1990, and continued in various forms through 1994.  Again, this is testimony from your own trial.  If you doubt what you said or how I'm characterising it, I'd be quite happy to read the transcripts to you.  
A.	No, no.  I -- I -- I agree.  I agree, yes.  The civil defence was set up by the government at the 
national level and at commune level.  Yes, the civil defence was in place.  That is correct, what you have said.  
Q.	And didn't you also testify that the Interahamwe had been incorporated in the civil defence after 6th of April 1994 with regrettable consequences?  Those aren't your exact words, but wasn't your testimony at great length on that issue accurately summarised by how I've just put it? 
A.	I would like to know the exact words used in my statement.  Your paraphrase does not appear to reflect exactly what I said.  
Q.	Why don't you -- why don't you tell us what your understanding is.  We'll begin that way.  Was the Interahamwe incorporated in the civil defence with unfortunate consequences back in 
April to May of 1994? 
A.	What I said I believe, once again, is the same thing that I can say today; namely, that after the 6th of April 1994 -- yes, after the 6th of April 1994 with the dysfunctioning of the structures of the 
party -- the MRND and of the country, the youth who belonged to the Interahamwe in Kigali as well as other youth, all those youth became known as the Interahamwe.  And from that point on, the 
slippages came into place, and you are familiar with that.  You know it, and I know it, and I support that view.  
(Pages 19 to 32 by Jean Baigent)




























1200H
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	Well, let me read exactly what you said.  It's not very different from what you've just said, but, to be fair to you and to have it accurately reflected on the trial record, I'd direct us to page 82 of the English text and page 156 of the French text.  And this is document number 62 of my bundle, which is the transcripts of the 19th of September 2002.  

And you're actually involved in a long exchange with Judge Gunawardana, so you're responding to his questions, and it goes on for quite some time.  But the core of what you say is as follows:  

"I believe that today -- and I'm talking about today with hindsight -- we could allow ourselves to say that the Interahamwe -- if the civil defence had been established, then the Interahamwe could have been placed in the civil defence.  I would describe such a possibility as a deviation, and I would call this actually as something undesirable, and this is what happened."  

And then you go on, on the following page in English on page 83.  

"So I'd say yes, there was an undesired direction which could occur and if -- because we did not have a civil defence which was well structured and established, I mean we did not have a structured 
civil defence --" and then you go on.  

Perhaps I'm not doing -- did I hand up to you a copy of the transcript, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	No, you did not.  But I follow you and I have no difficulty because it tallies with my position by which I stand even today. 
Q.	Let me give you the transcript, because I want to be absolutely fair to you because it's hard to encapsulate the issue in simple questions.  But this is a rather extended discussion.  But the 
bottom line, my reading of it is that you concede that the Interahamwe were incorporated in the 
civil defence.  It was unfortunate because it was a deviation from how things should have been, and that was what resulted in a lot of the killings.  Do you disagree with how I've just summarised -- 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, would the Prosecutor be kind enough to provide me with the exact reference?  I'm not able to follow from the transcript he has just read out.  Do we have a French copy of the transcript?  I am not able to follow.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I've just handed up my copy of the French transcript to the witness.  It's included as 
document number 62 in the bundle.  And there are an extended series of questions and answers between Judge Gunawardana and this witness.  And I have not -- I have summarised what I understood to be Mr. Nahimana's testimony.  Now he has an opportunity to tell us if my summary is accurate or not.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you.  Did you say page 62F, Mr. Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I said document number 62, E for English F for French.  I can't tell you where in 
document number 62 because I've just given my copy to the witness, but it's document 62F, which is the French transcript.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you very much, Mr. Prosecutor.  I am there now.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So back to you, Mr. Witness.  Isn't that what you were saying to Judge Gunawardana back on the 
19th of September 2002? 
A.	Yes.  Essentially that is -- this is what happened:  This is the question, the way he put it to me in French.  What you gave as a summary in English is incorrect.  

Question:  "Within the context of the civil defence strategy did the Interahamwe movement not find its place -- its due place?"  

And my answer was the following:  "I believe that today -- and I am referring to today in hindsight -- one can effectively say that the Interahamwe, if the civil defence had been in place, could have slipped into the civil defence, and I would refer to that as a deviation.  And I would refer to it as a drift or slippage.  And by the way, this is what happened."  And that was my answer, and I stand by that answer. 
Q.	And the conclusion of that is that this is what happened, that the Interahamwe slipped into the 
civil defence during the period April to July of 1994.
A.	As I had said a short while ago, with the resumption of the war there was a dysfunctioning.  You see, the problem for the Prosecutor is that they take things out of context.  Because of the war, all the structures in place were simply dysfunctional, whether it is government or the state as a whole.  So those youth which you -- since a short while ago you said we referred to as the Interahamwe, those youth no longer belonged to the Interahamwe za MRND.  They were youths -- and this was observed all over -- who wore uniforms that resembled those of the Interahamwe before the 6th of April, and they claimed to be Interahamwe.  Even people belonging to the RPF put on the attires of the former Interahamwe, that is, the Interahamwe before the 6th of April, and claimed to be Interahamwe.  So this is the type of drift that occurred.  And everybody claimed to be Interahamwe at that time.  

So, Mr. President, Your Honours, I pray this Tribunal to pay very close attention to this point.  The youth who were involved in the killings should not be considered to have been the Interahamwe za MRND, because that would be an extraordinary mistake on the part of the Tribunal.  And this is what the Prosecution is pushing for, and that would be unfortunate as far as international justice is concerned.  
These were hoodlums.  These were people who wanted to acquire property.  These are people who had scores to settle.  Whether they were Tutsi or Hutu, they all got involved in the killing.  And you as the Prosecutor, you lumped them all together and you called them Interahamwe.  And this is what I refer to as the drift or the deviation.

Yes, indeed, there was a drift, there was a deviation, because people used the name Interahamwe and killed under the guise of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	All right.  We have your evidence on the record, Mr. Witness.  The Chamber will be able to go through it and decide what it shall rely on.  

So I have another question for you.  Didn't RTLM embrace the Interahamwe in particular?  Didn't RTLM support the Interahamwe during April to July of 1994?
A.	As I have already testified during my own trial and yesterday in answer to Defence counsel, things were not regular in April to July in Rwanda.  It would be lying if I said that I heard journalists over 
Radio RTLM supporting the Interahamwe.  What I know -- and by the way, relying on the cassettes that you made available to me, it is true that journalists talked about youth, they talked about roadblocks, and they encouraged the youth to check or stop infiltrations by the RPF.  

Now, from that to claiming that the RTLM supported the youth is a difficult proposition for me to support.  
Q.	Well, this very issue was discussed in your own trial back on the 26th of November -- excuse me, 
26th of September 2002, so it's -- the proposition is not unfamiliar to you.  And you were directed to a specific RTLM broadcast that was emblematic.  You can't have forgotten that portion of your examination back in September 2002, can you?  I think it was even played in court at some point.  And here I am referring to -- I think it was P. 25 in your case, and we have it in this trial as P. 253.  Only a small snippet was discussed back on the 26th of September.  But I'd direct everyone to 
document number 65 in my bundle, E for English, F for French.  

And at the bottom of page 6 on the English text it says, "And when RTLM broadcasts on the 
21st of June", a broadcast that we have as P. 101 and that we played out in court a particular excerpt, P. 101D, that broadcast in which RTLM said, and quoting now, 'We know at RTLM, the radio loved by the Interahamwe, the radio that supports the Interahamwe, the radio that supports the youth of all republican parties, these youth united under the umbrella of a single group called the Interahamwe --" 
A.	Who is speaking?
Q.	This is Anani Nkurunziza.  So taking that excerpt from your previous testimony -- and that was a question.  There was a response from you where you say you don't approve of that sort of message.  But the point that I'm making through this question is that this was the attitude of RTLM and the Interahamwe back on the 21st of June when that transcript -- when that broadcast aired.
A.	I stand by my position, and I think we are saying the same thing.  You are referring to the period after or from June 1994.  Yes, indeed.  That journalist was saying something for which he is entirely responsible.  Well, I say that those types of statements are unfortunate, but I do not see what else I could say in furtherance or in addition to my position.  

In other words, I am no longer with you as to the development in your cross-examination.  Maybe you want to put me in the proper context and that will enable me to provide you with a more specific answer. 
Q.	Well, my suggestion -- and you can react to it -- is that RTLM supported the Interahamwe, and they didn't make any distinction between the Interahamwe za MRND and the informal Interahamwe.  They supported the Interahamwe, period.  And they were talking about the Interahamwe that were linked to the MRND party, because when we read the entire broadcast and not restrict ourselves to the little snippet that formed a part of your examination back in September of 2002, the announcer is clearly linking the Interahamwe to the MRND party.  

And I can hand up a longer portion of the broadcast.  This is from Exhibit P. 253.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could show this to the witness.  First show it to the Chamber and the parties, since I hadn't circulated it earlier.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But what I've done is simply retyped in larger print what is difficult to read in our original exhibit, and there you have the French text.  And I have highlighted in yellow the portions of that broadcast that I think merits some attention.  And I will read some of those portions now, and then you can look at the document itself when it gets to you.  

This is Anani Nkurunziza.  He says, "People are talking about youths who are committing various types of atrocities:  Killing, raping and looting.  I don't know if most of our young listeners know what rape is.  Rape means having girls by force.  People continue talking about the young people who are killing, raping and looting.  What is sad is that they call themselves Interahamwe.  

"What we at the RTLM -- a radio station which is loved by the Interahamwe and which supports them and the youths of all republican parties -- know is that those youths are in the same group which is commonly known as the Interahamwe, who, as General Bizimungu said, are at the front.  That is what we know about those youths, above reproach, who are at the war front in Nyamirambo and Kimisange.  They are on the front line everywhere, in Muhima, in Rugenge.  

"I have just met many of those youths.  They were going to fight in Gikondo.  However, we have to cast suspicion on all the people who are involved in looting, carrying out illegal attacks, raping women and who bear the name Interahamwe, because, as a matter of fact, they exist and we see them.  Since we see them and they call themselves Interahamwe, I think that we should refer this problem to leaders of the Interahamwe."  And then it goes on.  

It's not worth reading the entire thing, but if there are portions that you think need to be brought to the Court's attention, you have the text in front of you and you can do that.  

But it goes on towards the bottom where it identifies the Interahamwe as "which is a branch of the MRND.  Remember that at the beginning of the fighting international radio stations protested against MRND's Interahamwe and the Presidential Guards.  The Inyenzi protest against those who they know are youthful."  

So what I am suggesting to you, Mr. Nahimana, is that the RTLM, when it was under your authority and responsibility, was taking the position that I have just outlined by reading bits and pieces of a broadcast from Anani Nkurunziza.  So wouldn't you agree with me that the RTLM was supporting the Interahamwe back in June of 1994?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I'm very sorry because, quite sincerely, the Prosecutor has got it all wrong.  He does not understand a thing.  If I look at the excerpts of the broadcast that he is presenting to the Court, the journalist has made a distinction between the Interahamwe whom we know, the Interahamwe za MRND whom we support.  These are the people who are not involved in the killings.  Please, read carefully.  

But as you can see, he goes on to say, "Those thugs, those people who are raping women and who call themselves -- who have adopted the name Interahamwe, I believe that this issue must be raised with the head of the Interahamwe."

Now, once again, that I have been saying consistently, Your Honours, that we have to be very careful when dealing with this issue around youth or youth wings and any reference that is made to the international press, because the international press was misled during the events from April to July.  It was misled because it considered all the youth to be Interahamwe.  

You see, the RTLM journalists in June, July -- or April, June, early July, stated that they support the Interahamwe, those Interahamwe who are fighting the RPF.  That does not mean that -- anyways, he goes on to say that we do not support these other youth who claim to be Interahamwe but who are involved in rapes.  
So this is the position.  Please, do not mislead the Trial Chamber.  And in this situation there is nothing wrong with the journalist making that statement.  But allow me to draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to what you have said about me.  

Mr. Prosecutor, I refer you to the Appeals Chamber judgement, paragraph 574 and subsequent, which states that Nahimana played no active role between July and April 1994.  And yet today you dare claim that the journalists, or the RTLM, which I led -- well, again, once again, that is another mistake.  I was never the director of that radio station.  

But going by the document from the journalist, this is what the journalist's position is.  So you will not find any document anywhere before the 6th of April which states that the journalists were supportive of the Interahamwe.  Never.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time.  We are maybe a minute or two before 12:30.  I had hoped to have finished by now, but I think I have around another 20 or 30 minutes to go, so I'd like to simply adjourn now and pick up in the afternoon, and I'll do my best to finish expeditiously.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can take our luncheon adjournment now. 
(Court recessed from 1225H to 1400H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon everyone.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Nahimana, you were removed as the head of ORINFOR in November of 1992.  Isn't that so? 
A.	No, it was not in November of 1992. 
Q.	When was it? 
A.	It was 28 April 1992.  28 April 1992. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  But in any case, you were removed because of a -- well, let me clarify for the Chamber that ORINFOR is the Rwandese or Rwandan national office of information which governs mass media in Rwanda.  Is that an accurate description or would you like to improve upon it for me, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I'm not improving on it.  I would simply refer to the decree which created ORINFOR, the Rwandan information authority.  It is not that authority which is at the head of the 
mass media.  It is the Rwandan information authority which is at the head of the public media, as at then. 
Q.	Thank you.  In any case, you were removed as the head of ORINFOR because of an editorial indiscretion in causing Radio Rwanda to publish an unsubstantiated tract which was characterised as false information or disinformation.  And the reason you were removed was because that tract incited the violence that occurred, the anti-Tutsi violence that occurred in Bugesera in 1992.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I think every day I am disappointed by this Tribunal.  This is what I mean:    I thought that at least the Office of the Prosecutor is one -- and I'm surprised that what was done in 2002, right up to 2003 and 2007, with the Appeals Chamber, today the Prosecutor is revisiting this issue and he's attempting to say that I was dismissed from ORINFOR because of the events of Bugesera.  

Yesterday I clearly explained the reason.  It was not because of Bugesera that made we leave ORINFOR.  It is not that editorial indiscretion which you talked about, which was not an indiscretion as such.  An editorial policy is not an indiscretion.  It was a public broadcast, a public programme.  

But I left ORINFOR following the request by the prime minister who complained that I allegedly censored the final communiqué that was produced following his meeting with the Rwandan -- rather, the Burundian ambassador in Kigali.  

You seem to be referring to the various communiqués issued by human rights associations, communiqués issued by various political parties, but I gave explanations yesterday that all of this is part of the propaganda of the FDC and the FPR. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Nahimana, we have your response.  I put the question to you based on the information that we have in the OTP, and I don't think you have dissuaded me, but it's not really a decisive issue for this Chamber so we don't need to dwell on it for a long time.  

But, in any case, after -- as a follow-up, even after you were removed from ORINFOR, you tried to get a post as -- in the Rwandan embassy in Bonn, but your accreditation was refused by the 
German national authority.  Isn't that so?  And for that reason you could not join the Rwandan embassy in Bonn because of the Germans' perception of you.  Is that true or not? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, that is not true.  We asked the authority -- to begin with, I did not ask to be appointed ambassador.  I was to be -- it is a cabinet meeting which appointed me as first counsellor to the embassy in Bonn.  That is the first point.  

	Secondly, when I heard that news, I immediately asked -- or sought audience with the minister of foreign affairs to tell him that I was not interested in that position.  

Thirdly, I directly requested to return on a full-time basis to the University of Rwanda as a professor.  And point number four, during my trial we asked the German authority whether, on the one hand, my name was sent to the Rwandan authority for accreditation and, secondly, whether my name 
or -- whether my name was turned down.  

Here in the Tribunal, in your office, the Office of the Prosecutor, you have the official document issued by the German authority.  According to that document, that request was never made, and the 
German authority never turned down my appointment because of the reasons you are advancing today.  Therefore, what you are saying is wrong. 
Q.	All right.  We have your response.  

But getting back to the substantive issue of the tract that you authorised to be read on Radio Rwanda, that tract was not true and it led to widespread violence against Tutsi in Bugesera in March of 1992.  Isn't that true? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is in error or he's seeking to mislead the Court.  There's no single tract which was read over Radio Rwanda.  Please.  Words, words, words have a meaning.  It was not a tract.  There was no single tract that was read over that radio.  

What was read over Radio Rwanda was the editorial.  I repeat to you, you would not see anywhere, be it in your tapes, your audiotapes or elsewhere, you will not see in the editorial the words "Bugesera" or "Tutsi".  Yesterday I said that at the request of Mr. Mugenzi that editorial was distorted.  I am surprised that you are continuing along this line, a line which seeks to be more in tune with propaganda than the quest for truth. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Nahimana, you offered the same explanation when you were questioned about this in your own trial, and Trial Chamber I roundly dismissed it and said that you were making -- said that the distinctions that you were trying to make were untenable.  

And if we look at the Chamber's factual findings -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
And here I refer the parties to document number 57 in my bundle.  There's English E and the French F.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	At paragraph 691 of the Trial Chamber I judgement of the 3rd of December 2003, I'll read for you what the Chamber says.  And I'll pass up to you the French text so that we can follow what the Chamber is saying together.  Just give me one second and Mr. Issa can collect this for me.  

So if we look at document 57, paragraph 691, "The Chamber finds that Ferdinand Nahimana, as director of ORINFOR, ordered the broadcast on Radio Rwanda of the contents of a communiqué based on a fax from Nairobi, a false document stating that the PL was the internal arm of the RPF and was planning to assassinate Hutu leaders.  This broadcast took place within a few days of a PL meeting in Bugesera on the 1st of March 1992 resulting in the killing of hundreds of Tutsi civilians.  

"It was repeated four or five times over the course of the 3rd and 4th of March 1992.  As director of ORINFOR, Nahimana reversed a decision of the editorial team not to broadcast the communiqué because of their inability to confirm its authenticity.  Nahimana did not make an effort to ascertain the accuracy of the Radio Rwanda broadcast, which spread fear and provoked violence against the 
Tutsi population by Hutu who were falsely led to believe that they faced imminent attack."  

Now, that's a finding that was made by the Trial Chamber after hearing evidence on this issue and your testimony on this issue, and this is a paragraph that was not reversed on appeal, so it still stands as a finding of fact.  Isn't that so?  
A.	Since you are a specialist in law -- I'm a layman, but even as a layman I try to understand how various courts take over one another.  You are making reference to a trial judgement, and you want -- or you seek confirmation that the Appeals Chamber did not reverse that finding.  In the Appeal Chamber's judgement, do you have a paragraph which says that the Judges of the Appeals Chamber confirmed the decision or finding of the Trial Chamber?  That is the first point.  

The second point, I would like to tell you that the text that you read, I have discussed it.  On the other hand, it is beyond the competence of this Chamber.  You are making reference to that text, and you arrived at the conclusion that it was not reversed by the Appeals Chamber.  You, as Prosecution, presented your allegations to show that since 1990 and right up to 1994 I participated in a conspiracy in incitement for the purpose of committing genocide.  That was your aim.  But the Appeals Chamber indeed reversed all of that by finding me not guilty of the crime of genocide and not guilty of the 
crime of public and direct incitement.  How then can you say that this finding by the Trial Chamber still stands?  It has been reversed ipso facto by the Appeals Chamber judgement.  In any case, that is my understanding.
(Pages 33 to 41 by Claudette Ask)









1420H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Nahimana, I can assure you that you have an incorrect understanding of the law.  But that's not an issue for us.  The Chamber -- this Chamber can review that paragraph of the appeal -- of the Trial Chamber's judgement, and it can review the Appeals Chamber judgement and make it's own assessment.  But by my assessment, that paragraph stands as a fact -- a finding of fact that was not disturbed by the Appeals Chamber.  But it's -- that's a side issue. 

You realise, of course, that your co-detainee, Justin Mugenzi, views the events of March 1992 differently than you do; right? 
A.	It is his right to have a different view, but I would like to remind you that his vice-president -- the vice-president of the PL party, who was a Tutsi, interprets the Bugesera events in the same way as I presented them.  Mugenzi is presented as being the cause of those events, the events of Bugesera.  He held the rally that you referred to, which even the Appeals Chamber referred to, and that is why the confusion -- that there are many confusions in the trial judgement.  

The vice-president, Mr. Ndasingwa -- you have the exhibit -- they have the exhibit which was admitted by the Trial Chamber.  Mr. Ndasingwa publicly declared that the Bugesera events were caused by the
PL party rally which held on the 1st of March 1992 and which was led by Mr. Mugenzi.  I am not the one saying so.  It is Mr. Ndasingwa who says so in the broadcast, if my memory serves me right, of 30 October 1993.  You have that exhibit with you.  Therefore -- 
Q.	Okay.  In any case, Mr. Nahimana, my concern is with what Justin Mugenzi says about that incident.  And I wish to put to you what he says about it because I'm sure you would agree that Justin Mugenzi has no reason to fabricate evidence or offer evidence simply to favour the Prosecution.  

In his own trial back on the 2nd of November 2005, he was asked by his own attorney about the events of March 1992 in Bugesera.  And I would like to share with you his account if you're not currently aware of it.  And this is document number 54 in my bundle.  We have the E for English, the F for French.  And I'll make a copy available to you, Mr. Nahimana, if you just give me one second.  

And I'm just going to read through selected portions of it very quickly to bring out the gist of his evidence.  But he is asked on page 1 of the English text by Mr. Gumpert, his Defence counsel, 
"Mr. Mugenzi, I think we broke off at a time when you had begun describing some events which took place in a region of Rwanda called the Bugesera in March of 1992.  What was the initiating event, as you call it, to the consequence of those happenings?"

And his answer: "The initiating event was a PL rally which was held on the 1st of March, a rally which was viewed by observers and by myself as a very satisfactory rally.  It gathered a good number of people, and it showed that the PL had gained ground.  

"Question:  What happened the next day?  Answer:  The next day, that is, the 2nd of March, we heard over the radio a broadcast Radio Rwanda on the 2nd of March issued a communiqué purportedly from Nairobi from an organisation that called itself an organisation against violence or something like that."  

And then he goes on -- and I'm going to the following page in English, page 3 -- "And what you have told us is that there was a broadcast on the 2nd of March from an organisation purporting to come from Nairobi.  What was the broadcast?"  

And he then goes on to read from a document.  It's called the letter from the inter-African commission for non-violence from Nairobi to the executive committee of the supporters of non-violence in Rwanda.  I'm not going to read the entire text.  It's there for you to see, Mr. Nahimana, and you're already familiar with it.  But the text talks about assassinations of key figures that are prominently Hutu that is going to take place and alleges that somehow members of the PL would be responsible for that.  

And then we can go to the next page, 4, "Mr. Mugenzi, to your knowledge, how often did this receive an airing over the radio?" 

His answer:  "It was broadcast and rebroadcast at least three times in the three languages that were used over Radio Rwanda -- that is, Kinyarwanda, French and Swahili."  

Then it talks about the person that was identified.  And Mugenzi explains that the person was fictitious.  

But what interests me is what's coming up now.  And if we go to page 6 in the English text:  "What was the effect of the broadcast?"  

And Mugenzi's answer:  "The effect of this broadcast was that from the evening of the 4th of March, there was widespread violence in the Bugesera, the place where I held my rally.  PL members had their homes burnt down or destroyed.  A number of people were beaten up.  It was even reported that people were killed.  I know a number of victims, including an Italian missionary who had been working in that region for some time."  

Then he is asked, "How long did the violence go on?"  According to him it went on for around a week or so.  

And then when we continue on the next page, he is asked about the origin of the tract or of the communiqué, and according to him, the fax that transmitted that particular communiqué came from the headquarters of the MRND party.  

The question: "So far as you're concerned, Mr. Mugenzi, who was the true author of this communiqué and broadcast?"  And his answer:  "Well, I'm not in a position to supply any name because all of the investigation that I could do led me to the headquarters of the MRND.  But I was led to the headquarters of the MRND because the document which was found at Radio Rwanda was a fax, and when we tried to identify the origin of the fax, we found that the sending fax machine was from the MRND office."  

Do you have any comment on that, Mr. Nahimana?  
A.	Yes, indeed, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Well, first of all, I'm pleased to note that Mugenzi himself accuses himself and accepts that the -- the element that triggered -- that sparked off the
	Bugesera massacres is indeed the PL rally in Bugesera.  That is the first sentence of his answer.  The rest is just words, words, words.  

Two -- or secondly, reference is made, and you have also made reference to a letter, tracts, communiqués, that came from Nairobi which allegedly were read over Radio Rwanda.  

Once more, be it in 2002 or now, you have never, never mentioned the precise broadcast made on Radio Rwanda at the time in question, namely, the 3rd and the 4th, dates that you have given which are not correct.  

For my part, during my trial, I produced that editorial.  Secondly, I made reference I believe to page 610, if my memory serves me right.  I made reference to the book, the book written by your expert, Mr. Guichaoua.  Mr. Guichaoua quotes the editorial, the text of the editorial, and when he produces that text, it is indeed the text that was read on Radio Rwanda.  And all that you have said or Mr. Mugenzi says is not relevant.  He accepted that he was the one who was the initiator, and he goes back to the propaganda which he broadcast, and which, as I said yesterday, thanks to Des Forges, thanks to Mr. Gasana Ndoba in Belgium, thanks to the entire RPF network place at the disposal of the PL, 
the -- the press or the media and you at present -- you were thinking that we broadcast a tract.  But, unfortunately, the Chamber also -- the trial -- the Trial Chamber did not want to be critical, analytical.  

It made a confusion.  If you read well the judgement of the Appeals Chamber, it is a fact the
media trial -- which was totally reversed.  Now that I have been convicted, I wonder whether the Judges who tried me and who wrote the trial judgement feel comfortable.  The Appeals Chamber judgement is a total disavowal of the trial judgement.  

Therefore, Mr. Prosecutor -- or, Counsel for the Prosecutor, rather, I think you should limit yourself to the first sentence, the first sentence made by Mr. Mugenzi, which reads, "Yes, the event that sparked off -- that triggered the Bugesera massacres is indeed the rally of my party, the PL party, on the
1st of March 1992."  Beyond that -- beyond that it's just verbiage. 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Nahimana, I thought it was clear to you that I didn't read the entirety of Mr. Mugenzi's testimony.  He does in fact read the entire text for that communiqué.  It appears on pages 3 to 4 of his testimony of the 2nd of November 2005 and should also be included in the French text at approximately the same page numbers, which is a document that I passed up to you.  But we don't need to get into the substance since the Trial Chamber, your Trial Chamber, has already characterised the content of that communiqué.  And it's paragraph 691 of your judgement, your Trial Chamber judgement.  

But moving forward, weren't national government authorities in Rwanda at that time implicated in these attacks against the Tutsi in Bugesera? 
A.	First of all, let me ask a question aloud, a question for which I don't need an answer.  Why were the Trial Chamber judgments appealed?  Because from my point of view, there was an error, error in judgement, error in the interpretation of the facts and so on and so forth.  I appealed against that judgement in its -- globally, and that that is why I am telling you that these Bugesera events were advanced.  And if you read the judgement carefully, you will see that it was in the context of the crime of genocide.  And I appealed.  

Secondly, I would like to draw the Chamber's attention to what you are saying.  You continue to talk about a communiqué.  But please.  Radio Rwanda did not issue a communiqué.  It aired an editorial.  You continue as Mugenzi did in 1992.  You continued talking about a communiqué.  There was no communiqué, and it is precisely why this confusion appears again in the judgement.  And it is for that reason that I appealed. 
Q.	Okay.  We all understand that you rely on the Appeals Chamber judgement to dispute the factual findings of the Trial Chamber.  So let's leave that issue alone for now.  The Chamber I'm sure understands the point you're making, and they can examine both judgments and make their own assessment.  

Let's move on to my next question, which you still have not answered.  So I'll ask it again.  Weren't national authorities in Rwanda implicated in these attacks against the Tutsi in Bugesera in
March of 1992? 
A.	When you talk about national authorities, you are speaking in general terms.  Are you saying that the entire administration of the country was involved in the massacres, or do you have any specific authorities you want to mention so that I can give you what my position is? 
Q.	Territorial authorities, in other words, conseillers de secteur, bourgmestres.  
A.	Yes.  At the level -- at the level of Kanzenze commune and following investigations which were carried out by the public prosecutor's office in Kigali, there were local authorities who were considered to be responsible for those massacres.  And it is said that, for example, the bourgmestre of Kanzenze allegedly had some responsibility in the massacres.  I told you about the chairman of PL, Mr. Ndahimana, and a number of other people.  And the list I think you ought to have.  And
	40 people or so who were arrested by Mr. Nsanzuwera, François-Xavier Nsanzuwera.  So as far as that is concerned, yes.  Local -- there were people who were in the administration in political parties who were implicated or involved in those massacres. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that response, because that's also consistent with the findings of fact made by the international commission of enquiry that were investigating human rights abuses in Rwanda in the early part of 1993.  

You are familiar, aren't you, with a consortium of human rights organisations, including
Human Rights Watch and FIDH, that investigated human rights abuses in Rwanda after which they issued a report that was published sometime in March of 1993, I believe, which we have in evidence in this case as P. 393.  

So my question to you, to -- to sum up, Mr. Nahimana, is:  Didn't that report also condemn government authorities in Rwanda for organising the killings against the Tutsi in Bugesera? 
A.	You mentioned a number of facts.  First of all, the report of the international commission on the violation of human rights in Rwanda from the 1st of October 1990 does indeed mention local authorities.  Let me avail myself of this opportunity to say that nowhere in that report is any mention made of the responsibility of Radio Rwanda.  Please check again.  You will see that that is the case. 

And, secondly, as far as the various reports from the different associations of the defence of
human rights are concerned, it is possible that I am not aware of all those reports, particularly as I'm sitting here from memory today.  But they talk about certain local authorities, a number of authorities.  Yes, that is in line with the answer I gave a while ago.  But what I do not agree with is generalisation.  Generalisation to the point that where you say government authorities as a whole, I do not agree with that.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, could Mr. Constant tell us for how long the Prosecutor has been examining.  I have the impression that he is being elastic. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
It's about three hours, ten minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Which gives me at least another 20 minutes, if I'm -- my arithmetic is correct.  If Mr. Hometowu could confirm that for me, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Well, it is indeed 3 hours, 24 minutes.  And by the time standards, you have 20 more minutes to go.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In any case, Mr. Nahimana, the report from that commission is -- the entirety of the report is in evidence as P. 393.  I only brought a two or three-page excerpt that does not specifically deal with Radio Rwanda in relation to Bugesera, although my notes would indicate that there's specific reference to
	Radio Rwanda.  But the Chamber will have an opportunity to review the report in relation to your statement that Radio Rwanda was not specifically mentioned.  I don't have it in front of me at this time.  

But in any case, you did not dispute the findings of that report.  Or you do not dispute the findings of that report.  Isn't that so?  Or at least that's how you testified back in 2002.  
A.	Let us be careful here.  The report concerns the entire country, and it goes from the 1st of October right through to the date of its publication.  I would say that I did not conclude the findings.  Or when you say I did not dispute the findings of that report, what in particular are you referring to? 
Q.	Well, let me read to you your exchange with Judge Pillay when you were discussing this very issue back on the 26th of September 2002.  And let me correct myself.  I'm not sure that it was just
	Judge Pillay that was asking the questions.  But in any case, you were asked, "Now, you indicated to us that you didn't dispute the findings of this commission as far as they went.  You thought they should have talked more about the RPF.  Do you dispute this finding?"  

And your answer:  "Madam President, Your Honours, I don't have to contest this conclusion because I, Ferdinand Nahimana, already was in the framework of ORINFOR.  As you know, there had been firm protests against these massacres which took place in Kibilira, Bigogwe, and so on.  And there's an article published in the ORINFOR newspapers." 

And you continue, and you say, "Secondly, I'm not contesting this because I already knew.  And once again, your report is not complete as it is presented here because I know, for instance, that the bourgmestre of Kibilira was dismissed from his office and imprisoned."  

But in any case, Mr. Nahimana, you are talking -- you are being asked generally about the findings of that commission.  And as I read your testimony, the only thing you disputed was the fact that the RPF was not sufficiently investigated.  But as for the human rights violations and killings that were taking place in 1992 and the beginning of 1993, you were in agreement with the findings of the report; right?  This is the 26th of September 2002 at pages 71 and 72 in the English text.  Do you remember that portion of your evidence? 
A.	Yes.  Perfectly.  But I realise that the extracts that you are using today do not make it possible to understand everything that happened.  I can -- I cannot dispute -- and even today I do not dispute -- the fact that there were massacres in Rwanda in 1992, in 1993 and so on, whether we are talking about the massacres of Bagogwe, the massacres in Kibilira or in Bugesera.  Those are clear facts, and those are incidents that took place.  But you do not have with you the excerpt relating to the disputes of the content, referring specifically to the content of that report.  And I wrote the analysis which the associations of -- of human rights, either Butera, ADR, and so on.  And it's a small brochure.  I am sorry, but the small brochure which we published and which is in some of the exhibits in this Tribunal.  And we were showing errors made by investigators of that international commission and some facts.  That is for one. 
Q.	We can agree that there were massacres, and that's really not in controversy.  But what interests me about the report is that they say that government authorities were responsible for those massacres.  So that's really what interests me about the conclusions of that commission which you had told your own Trial Chamber were not to be disputed back in 2002. 
A.	Let me once again say that you are stopping at one fact as a while ago I said to the Chamber I do not contest the participation of certain local authorities in Kanzenze commune.  But I would like to add -- and that completes the answer to the question you are putting to me.  I wanted to add that that international commission included people like Kabonero and Des Forges.  And it emerged that the members of that commission were indeed the RPF's dark cabinet or dark room, and that is why that report is silent on the massacres perpetrated by the RPF from the 1st of October to January 1993. 
Q.	And are you aware, Mr. Nahimana, that on page 50 of that report -- and I'm referring to the French text of P. 393 -- the authors of the report explain that the crimes that they investigated could be characterised as genocide, that they could have characterised those killings as genocidal back in 1992 but that they had an internal debate about whether the number of persons killed would rise to the level of characterising those killings as genocidal?  But in terms of the other elements that would be -- would factor into a decision to characterise the killings as genocidal, those were all there when the report was made back in 1993.  Are you aware of that? 
A.	Yes, I am.  And in fact, I would have liked the massacres perpetrated as from the 1st of October as -- to be characterised as genocide because indeed RPF was committing genocide, and the commission was silent on it.  That is precisely the case.  And I would like to tell the Chamber also that the commission did not spend any time in the RPF zone.  In fact, the time they spent in that RPF zone was one or 
	two hours only.  And that is a clear sign that the commission was extremely partial.  
Q.	And you discussed this report with other members of the MRND party leadership, isn't that so?  Wasn't this report the subject of government debate and debate within the MRND party? 
A.	What I know is that the government represented by the president of the republic and the
	prime minister, Dismas Nsengiyaremye at the time, discussed that.  And I am aware of their findings because a communiqué -- a joint communiqué was issued thereafter, and I am aware of that.  
Q.	What about with the MRND party leadership?  To your knowledge, was this report discussed at the top levels of the MRND party? 
A.	I do not recall.  It may be possible, but I do not recall that the executive of the party issued a report about that.  But that's possible. 
Q.	All right.  We'll move on to something else.  Now, the Appeals Chamber found that you had programmatic control over RTLM during the period after 6th April 1994; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  I know that the Appeals Chamber says so.  But elsewhere it is also said that I did not carry out any activities in that radio station during that period.  That is paragraph 597.  
Q.	In any case, I'll refer to page 15 of the summary of your Appeals Chamber decision, which is what the Presiding Judge read out on Wednesday the 28th of November 2007.  And at the top of page 15 in the English text -- I'm sorry.  I didn't distribute a copy of this to the parties, but I'll read it slowly -- he states, "Concerning allegations of errors of fact, the Appeals Chamber is of the opinion that the Trial Chamber could reasonably have concluded that the appellant was a superior of the RTLM staff and that he had the material ability to prevent or punish the broadcast of criminal utterances by such staff even after the 6th of April 1994.  

"The Appeals Chamber considers that there is no doubt that the appellant knew or had reasons to know that his subordinates at RTLM were about to broadcast or had already broadcast utterance inciting the killing of Tutsi.  

"Finally, the Appeals Chamber considers that the appellant has not shown that the Trial Chamber erred in finding that he had not taken reasonable and necessary steps to prevent or punish incitement by RTLM staff in 1994 to kill the Tutsi.  

"The Appeals Chamber affirms the conviction entered against the appellant, Nahimana, on account of direct and public incitement to commit genocide pursuant to Article 6(3) of the Statute."

That's what you've being referring to all along, isn't it, Mr. Nahimana, in terms of how the
Appeals Chamber characterised your criminal responsibility for the crimes in 1994? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I am aware of that decision from the Appeals Chamber.  I even mentioned it yesterday.  It is after leaving out or after setting aside all the other allegations, it upheld what you have just read.  And there is no doubt that you have the summary there.  You did not get into the paragraphs.  The only element which was relied upon was Madam Des Forges's statement that she learned from the ambassador that the ambassador had told his assistant whose assistant told Des Forges that I purportedly promised to the ambassador that I was going to stop RTLM programmes in early July.  And you know how judgments are drafted in this Tribunal.  

But in the end -- and you did not read that part -- it is said that it was because of programmes on RTLM after the 6th of April which some other person is responsible for and not Ferdinand Nahimana as such.
(Pages 42 to 50 by Deirdre O'Mahony)































1500H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	In any case, we've established to your satisfaction how the Appeals Chamber views your criminal responsibility.  But what interests me more is the factual findings of the Trial Chamber, many of which were undisturbed by the Appeals Chamber, the Appeals Chamber's review.  So let's look at a few of those.

Paragraph 486 -- and here I'm referring to document 57 in my bundle which we have in both the English and the French, and these are excerpts of the Trial Chamber judgement of the 
3rd of December 2003.

At paragraph 486 the Chamber finds that "RTLM broadcasts engaged in ethnic stereotyping in a manner that promoted contempt and hatred for the Tutsi population.  RTLM broadcasts called on listeners to seek out and take up arms against the enemy.  The enemy was identified as the RPF, the Inkotanyi, the Inyenzi, and their accomplices -- all of whom were effectively equated with the Tutsi ethnic group by the broadcasts."

You have no reason to dispute that finding, do you?  
A.	But that conclusion by the Trial Chamber -- I challenged it of course.  Otherwise, I would not have lodged an appeal. 
Q.	Well, my understanding from reading your testimony in your trial is that you didn't contest that RTLM was promoting genocide after the 6th of April.  You simply claimed that you weren't controlling it.  Maybe you want to revise that now.

So are you suggesting that RTLM was not inciting genocide after the 6th of April by its broadcasts?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, and the Counsel for the Prosecution, I know what I said.  Read what I said and read the Appeals Chamber's conclusions or findings.  Be it at the trial level or at the 
	appeals level, I expressed regret for some broadcasts which, as a matter of fact, when you listen to them, incited killings -- that is a fact -- after the 6th of April.  And the Appeals Chamber vindicated me on this because in its judgement the Appeals Chamber held that some broadcasts of the RTLM after the 6th of April are to be incriminated.

If we agree on that point, there is no debate.  I agree.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Your Honours, the Prosecutor has two more minutes to go.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think I can complete everything that I planned to do if I have another ten minutes.  If the Court would allow me that much, I would appreciate it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll start counting now. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, wasn't RTLM significantly controlled by MRND party members? 
A.	Once again, don't mix up things.  Let us be objective and honest.  There is not one single member of the organs of the RTLM radio or Corporation who was designated by the party.  If there was such a member, my answer would be yes.  But there was none.  So my answer is categorically no. 
Q.	Well, in any case, at paragraph 498 -- excuse me.  Excuse me.  At paragraph 494, in the middle of that paragraph, Trial Chamber I says, "Nahimana acknowledged it's undeniable that, although the company was not an MRND company, from its inception it was in the hands of members of the MRND at the political level."

We go to paragraph 498, the first sentence, "Nahimana stated that at the time of the first general assembly held on the 11th of July 1993, RTLM, Limited, had more than 100 shareholders.  Among the largest shareholders were President Habyarimana and Joseph Nzirorera."

We go to paragraph 560, "With regard to the shareholders, Nahimana acknowledges that the great majority were MRND members and that RTLM was established in part to give voice to MRND ideology."  

Paragraph 566, "The Chamber finds that RTLM was owned largely by members of the MRND party with Juvénal Habyarimana, president of the republic, as the largest shareholder with a number of significant shareholders from the Rwandan armed forces."

So apparently you were saying something a little different in your own trial, Mr. Nahimana, because the Chamber is relying on some of your own statements to make its finding that the MRND party significantly dominated RTLM.  
A.	Not at all, Counsel, not at all.  What did the Chamber rely on?  And that is what I'm saying here.  It is undeniable that I said so yesterday -- it is undeniable that the shareholders included many members of the MRND.  It is undeniable that this is a fact.  The list of shareholders was public.  It is known that President Habyarimana had bought shares.  Mr. Nzirorera had bought shares.  I also was a member of the MRND, and I bought shares.  

But what you are attempting to have accepted today which is not said in the appeals judgement or maybe in the trial judgement of 2003 -- what you are attempting to say is that the RTLM radio and RTLM, Limited were run by the MRND as a party.  No.

Many, perhaps the majority of the shareholders -- I'm not very sure because I did not carry out that exercise.  Many of them -- the shareholders were members of the MRND.  This is different.  There is a subtle difference here that should be borne in mind. 
Q.	In any case, I'll remind you that I've just read that the Trial Chamber found that President Habyarimana and Joseph Nzirorera were the two largest shareholders.

And when we get to Mathieu Ngirumpatse, at paragraph 891, which is in document 58 of my bundle, both in English and French, the Chamber starts to develop its analysis of the evidence which goes on for almost three pages about testimony in your trial that Mathieu Ngirumpatse opened and presided a meeting to raise funds for RTLM.  And this starts at paragraph 890 and runs through paragraph 904, I believe.

In any case, at paragraph 891, recounting the evidence, the Chamber says, "The witness testified that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the president of the MRND, opened the meeting.  Standing at the podium, he thanked participants and expressed happiness that they had come to join the fight against the Inyenzi.  He then introduced important personalities in the Hutu Power movement including Nahimana, Barayagwiza, Félicien Kabuga and RTLM journalists."  And he goes on, "Also present at the meeting were Froduald Karamira of the MDR party and Justin Mugenzi of the PL party."

If we go to the next paragraph, 892, "At this meeting Nahimana said the people had just received their radio station which belonged to Hutu Power and should be used to disseminate the ideas of Hutu Power."

Paragraph 893, "There were 15,000 people at the meeting.  According to Witness FS, the crowd responded enthusiastically to Nahimana and Barayagwiza's speeches."  He said, referring to the witness, FS, that "There were 15,000 people at the meeting.  They had been transported there by official buses from ONATRACOM, the government-run public transportation company.  Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi were at the meeting having been transported by these buses."

We get to paragraph 896, "Witness ABE testified that he attended an MRND meeting in 1993 at Nyamirambo stadium which was chaired by the MRND president, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Also present were Félicien Kabuga, as well as Barayagwiza, Nahimana."  And he goes on.  I'm not going to read the entire contents.  I think you're already familiar with them.
Continuing, at paragraph 900, "The Chamber found the testimony of Witness ABE to be credible as set forth in paragraph 332."

At paragraph 901 at the bottom, "The Chamber observes that Witness FS was consistent with his testimony.  He answered questions clearly and patiently despite the provocative nature of some of the questions that were put to him.  For these reasons, the Chamber finds the testimony of Witness FS to be credible."

And at paragraph 904, "The Chamber is of the view that the MRND meeting in 1993 at 
Nyamirambo stadium attended by Witness ABE was the same MRND meeting as attended by 
Witness FS.  They both placed the meeting after the creation of RTLM and sometime during the course of 1993.  They both described the meeting as a meeting primarily about RTLM related to its creation with Kabuga -- related to its creation --" excuse me "-- with Kabuga, Nahimana, and Barayagwiza in attendance."

"Witness FS testified that Kabuga and Nahimana solicited funds for RTLM and that the 
RTLM journalists were introduced.  Their accounts of the introductory speech by Ngirumpatse are consistent in reporting that he asked people to support RTLM and oppose the Inyenzi.  They both testified that speeches made at the beginning were broadcast subsequently on RTLM."   

Do you have any response to that, Witness, or any comment rather?
A.	The comment -- rather, my reaction to what you have said is that you dwell on referring the Judges and myself to paragraphs in the trial judgement.  And you are indeed afraid, seriously afraid, to make reference to the Appeals Chamber's judgement because -- as a matter of fact, all the literature we see in the trial judgement was set aside.  It was set aside -- most of it was set aside.  And where you find that the Appeals Chamber disavowed the trial Judges, you omit.  You don't want to read that.

But for my part, I will refer to the appeals judgement.  What I challenge at the level of the appeals judgement -- of course I'm looking for new facts, additional facts, in order to ask for a review of the appeals judgement.

But for the time being, these witnesses, the witnesses you just mentioned in the excerpts of the 
trial judgement, are not practically mentioned in the appeals judgement.  And this is to say that the Judges of the trial judgement said what you read, but I made -- I launched an appeal, and the Appeals Chamber vindicated me.  

They looked -- they -- the trial judgement convicted me for genocide, incitement, and other things under Article 6(1).  But the Appeals Chamber acquitted me of all the counts based on Article 6(1) of the statute.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
The Prosecutor has exceeded the ten minutes graciously granted by the Chamber by about 
three minutes.  Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This will be the last question then.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Nahimana, let's -- I'd like to hear your response to the Chamber's evaluation of you, you as a witness, not its factual findings.

At paragraph 692, the Chamber states that "The Chamber has considered Nahimana's testimony and finds a number of patterns in his response to questioning.  Nahimana is a man of words, and he manipulates words to suit the circumstances."

I don't know if you deem that as praise or criticism.  It seems somewhat complimentary since the Chamber is recognising your gift with words.

But at paragraph 696, it concludes that "Nahimana was not forthcoming in his testimony.  While he was entirely untruthful, in the view of the Chamber, he was evasive and manipulative, and there were many credibility gaps in his testimony.  For this reason the Chamber has been cautious in its evaluation of Nahimana's testimony on particular matters of fact and does not generally accept Nahimana's version of events." 

So that's not a factual finding.  That's an assessment of you.  Would you like to offer any final thoughts on how the Trial Chamber that listened to your evidence or the evidence in your case for quite some time assessed you as a witness?  
A.	I read that assessment made by the Trial Judges.  As you would imagine, if they had said that I was totally credible, I would have been released.  We don't have to beat about the bush in this regard.  But you would notice that in what they are saying they dare not -- they dare not dismiss my testimony.

They limit themselves to some phraseology.  They use some phraseology in order to have a clear conscience, so to speak, at the time of making their final decision of a conviction.  I -- in turn, I'm saying that the Judges of the Trial Chamber were not honest in their assessment.

Secondly -- I repeat -- the Appeals Chamber disavowed them about 60, if not 70, per cent.  This morning I said in my earlier testimony before this Chamber that I wonder whether the trial Judges at present feel comfortable after their judgement of 2003, a judgement on the media which was disavowed by their colleagues of the Appeals Chamber.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you for answering my questions.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And thank you to the Court for allowing me the extra time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.

Mr. Nimy, do you wish to put any questions to the witness in your narrow examination?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I have two questions in my re-examination of this witness.

First of all, as regards the events of Bugesera, I heard Mr. Nahimana when he was answering one of the Prosecutor's questions and on this point make reference to an interview given to RTLM on 30 October 1993 by the first vice-president of the Parti libéral, PL party.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Is that correct, Mr. Nahimana? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  That is correct. 
MR. NIMY: 
Now, Mr. President, I would request Mr. Issa to take this document, this interview, given by Mr. Landouald Ndasingwa, first vice-president of the Parti libéral, on 30 October 1993.

And please show it to the parties and also give it to the witness.  I'm going to show the witness.  I will be very brief.  I'm going to show the witness what Mr. Ndasingwa said.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, do you have the document in question before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you read on the first page -- I believe that is the last paragraph.  And then you will move on to the next page, and you will read the -- continue reading that paragraph, the part of the paragraph that is underlined.
A.	Yes.  It is Landouald Ndasingwa, vice-president of the Parti libéral, who is speaking.  I read, "I was also surprised by the fact that these political manoeuvres were exploited to mock at the victims of the Bugesera region by pretending to forget that the political rally that Mr. Mugenzi held in this area or region was the trigger that sparked off the atrocities and that the justice of Mr. Mbonampeka was not able to punish them.  But the same people presumed guilty who were arrested were immediately released."  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, what comments do you have to make in terms of what triggered the massacres of Bugesera?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, this is an excerpt of the statement made by the first vice-president of the Parti libéral, the PL, which confirms that what triggered the massacres in Bugesera is the rally led in Bugesera by Mr. Justin Mugenzi on 1st March 1992.  And his responsibility is tremendous contrary to what has been said.  This authority -- this person belongs to the PL party.  It is not someone else.  And he is talking about the rally of his own party.

There are people who, even at the time in question, had the courage to speak the truth, and may the truth live. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Nahimana.  Please tell the Court who this Mbonampeka was.  Which political party did he belong to?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Mr. Mbonampeka was second vice-president of the PL party.  And if my memory serves me right, he said that Mr. Mbonampeka's justice was not able to punish the culprit of the disturbances.  At the inception of the Nsengiyaremye government, Mbonampeka replaced at the ministry of justice Mr. Ngirumpatse.

And it was after his arrival at the ministry of justice that indeed even the presumed culprits who had been arrested at the time Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse was minister were immediately released. 
Q.	Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Nahimana.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would request that you admit into evidence this document as D. NZ785.  I stand to be corrected by Mr. Issa regarding the number of this evidence -- or exhibit rather.  
MR. MJUI:
You are correct.  The exhibit number is D. NZ785.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ785 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
I thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I have a second question, and I would simply request that the witness be given the document which the Prosecutor used a while ago, document 253, document 253 where reference is made to an RTLM broadcast and where the Prosecutor talks about the RTLM, the MRND, journalists who supported the killers, the killers of the MRND.  

That is the document I'm referring to, Mr. President, Your Honours.  But I could help the Prosecutor.  What we're interested in is on page 6, page 6 of the French version -- pages 6 and 7 of the 
French version.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Is Mr. Nimy referring to the excerpt from the broadcast itself or from the testimony of the witness?  Because I don't have a 6 or 7 on the excerpt that I distributed previously.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, the document I have here before me is the document which is found in the file -- in the bundle.  The document which the Prosecutor read does not seem to correspond to this one.  Perhaps that explains the difficulty the Prosecutor has in finding the document.  I have the authentic document which is found in the bundle of documents filed with the Court, that is, KO169790.

Mr. Issa, please kindly show this document to the parties and give it to the witness thereafter.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, if you have the document before you, I will ask you to refer to paragraph 2 of that document that is on page 6.  Do you have that before you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Then you can go ahead and read to the Chamber the second paragraph and go on right to page 7 and read the entire paragraph of page 7 and end up at 15 minutes, 07 seconds.  Do you see it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, please proceed.
A.	"Mention is also being made of young people who are carrying out different atrocities:  Killing, raping, and looting.  I do not know if most of our young listeners know what raping means.  To rape is to take a woman by force or take a girl by force.  

"Mention is still being made of these young people who kill, who rape, who loot.  And what is sad is that these people call themselves 'Interahamwe'.  What we know at the RTLM, the radio which is heard by the Interahamwe, which supports the Interahamwe, the radio which supports the youth of all 
republican parties, is that this youth is united within the same groups referred to commonly as 'Interahamwe'.  

"As General Bizimungu said, this youth is at the front.  That is what we know about these youth that cannot be reproached which is at the front in Nyamirambo, at the front in Kimisange, who is at the front everywhere in Muhima and Rugenge.

"I have just met most of these young people who went to fight in Gikondo.  The only thing is that we cannot state without suspecting all those people who are involved in looting, who are carrying out illegal attacks, who are raping women, and who call themselves 'Interahamwe' because in reality they exist, and we see them.

"And since we see them and they call themselves 'Interahamwe', I think that this issue can be put before the leader of the Interahamwe and also ask if the enemy's tricks, since there are many of them, will not be over our youth and Interahamwe and it will be worse than looting and raping.

"These young people who are called 'Interahamwe' and who are carrying out atrocities will be working for the enemy and will stab us in the back.  We have always talked about it.  The enemy's tricks are many and diverse.  And that is why we have to be vigilant.  

"And I would like especially to convey this call for vigilance to the heads of the republican youth so that we should avoid any bad feelings within the Interahamwe, which is a branch of the MRND, because it is against these that the Inyenzi are protesting.

"You would recall that, when these combats started, international radio stations protested against the Interahamwe of the MRND.  And the Inyenzi are protesting against those whom they know to be youthful.  So you should be very careful, you, the Interahamwe, and do not allow the enemy to infiltrate and commit atrocities which you would be held responsible for.

"And here I would like to remind you of the words of General Bizimungu, the supreme commander of the Rwandan army, when he said --" and I quote "-- 'These youth, commonly referred to as Interahamwe -- that they're helping us, and it is true they're helping us.  But they should help us with discipline.  We would not accept that the youth wing should do exactly what it wants.'  

"The enemy, on the other hand, is doing just anything and getting everywhere.  And that is what we have referred to as something very sad.  Please, therefore, you have to be vigilant in order not to allow these abominable people to infiltrate; whereas, we are counting on you."  
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, when you read this -- and please be brief because you have talked about this earlier -- what do you feel about this passage?
A.	Very briefly, there are two things I get from this paragraph.  They are the Interahamwe of MRND -- MRND who are described here as good.  And then there are young people who join the Interahamwe claiming that they are also members of Interahamwe; whereas, they are rapists and looters and so on.  And the journalist says, "We are counting on the young republicans of different parties and the Interahamwe.  So they should be disciplined."

And the journalist is asking them to be vigilant so that there should be no infiltration of young people who will come with the aim of giving the real Interahamwe a bad name by committing crimes which the young Interahamwe will be held responsible for. 
Q.	Mr. Nahimana, I thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I would simply kindly ask you to authorise the witness to meet the Accused and, in particular, Mr. Nzirorera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  
MR. NIMY: 
You're welcome, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I simply have one last question, and that is to admit certain exhibits, but I can work that out with Mr. Nimy this evening or tomorrow morning, and then we can do it on the record before we start. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.

Mr. Witness, your testimony before us is now concluded.  And as we do all witness, we thank you for assisting the Tribunal in its work.

The registrar will make arrangements for you to have an audience with the Accused after these proceedings have come to an end.

Well, we take our adjournment now until tomorrow.  
(Witness excused)
(Court adjourned at 1545H)
