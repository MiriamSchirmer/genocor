P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Madam registrar, could you open the proceedings please? 
MS. NTILATWA:
Yes, Your Honours.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gberbao Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 8th June 2006, for continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  Please, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.

Yes, before we start the new witness, Mr. Robinson, you wanted to raise the issue that you had mentioned yesterday?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you very much, Mr. President.  Good morning.  

On -- I want to actually make a formal application to be allowed to do re-cross examination on    Witness ZF on the issue of the payments that he has received from the Tribunal.  As you'll recall during my cross-examination he testified that he had received no payments whatsoever from the Tribunal for any of the times that he had come to Arusha, which included 1998, 2002 and two occasions in 2004, as well as for this trial in 2006.  

And then you saw on re-examination, that he initially denied also receiving any payments, but at the very end of his re-examination, admitted that, as to this current trial session, he had received some monies from WVSS.  So the information that emerged during the re-direct was completely different than what had happened -- what -- the information that had been given in cross-examination.  

And now I believe that I'm entitled to explore, number 1, the extent to which he has received payments, not simply for this trial session but for the other times he has been to Arusha, and why he lied about it.  And that is my request that I be allowed to do re-cross examination on that issue.  

And associated with that, you already have pending before you the request that we receive the accurate information from WVSS as to exactly what payments he's received.  And I just simply note that the witness has himself requested that that information be obtained from the Tribunal rather than asked of him.  So, I think that if we are really going to try to get accurate information, we should find out from WVSS exactly when he was paid and how much.  And I should be given the opportunity to put those questions to him.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, there are two issues here:  First, with regard to the -- we already ruled that the quantum of payments is not relevant for -- on the credibility issues.  Now, what was -- you know, we're -- I'm not quite certain how much value further examination of this witness is because what has been already demonstrated from his testimony is that he denied receiving payments and -- in cross-examination.  And on re-examination, it actually took an intervention from the Court before he decided it was something that he was willing to speak about and admit.

Now, in terms of the credibility issue, hasn't -- haven't you made the point that you could make on this issue, and the issue as to its impact on the -- how we look at his testimony?  Isn't that really a matter for you to address us on at a later stage?  Is there any -- I mean, hasn't the point already been established?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, the point has -- one point has been established, that he changed his testimony as to the current monies he received for this current session, which is what Mr. Webster's question was limited to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
But I think -- and so he's lied as to one aspect.  But I think there are many -- now there are many other instances when I was asking him and the Court was asking him, he denied having received money for, and we don't have anything on the record that contradicts that at the moment.  So, it is my belief that more information should be -- basically to have -- to know the extent to which he has given false testimony, I think it is necessary to re-examine him and to get the information to show exactly, did he receive just a few hundred dollars, or a few dollars for this session that he was reluctant to tell about, or has it really been thousands of dollars that he has received over the course of his cooperation with the Prosecutor.  I realise the quantum was not --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, yeah, it's the way you formulated the question that bothers me.  You see, the quantum of money that was received would depend on how long he has been here.  I would take, for example, in this particular issue; in this case, his examination has been extended because we had to do Witness T.  So the actual amount of money is not in issue, in my opinion, because that is dependent on factors that deal with how long he was here and the cost of living and that sort of thing.  The issue was that we -- the issue is that WVSS has given him the usual pendant -- the usual pendant, and he has admitted that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, for this session.  But also the other thing is -- well, so I believe that the amount is four or five times as it would be for this session because he has been here for similar periods of time in the past.  You said that quantum of benefits is not relevant, but it was in a totally different context.  It was in a context of bias, now it is in the context of contradiction.  So, it is different, it is a different footing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the context has already been established. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, it has only been established as to a very small portion of the whole.  And also, the other thing is that new information emerged on re-examination.  And I think we should have a chance to explore why he lied about those things.  That is also important to his credibility, not only the fact that he lied, but why did he lie.  And the fact that he was lying only came out during re- examination, so I think I am entitled to explore it further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see you on your feet. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have a slightly different recollection of the witness's testimony.   I think that to suggest that he was lying and that he deliberately misinformed this Court because of the number of times he's come to Arusha, is really a strong over statement of the witness's testimony.  Now, it is clear that he may have been confused, was reluctant to go into the details of that, but that may have much to do with the special protective measures that are afforded this witness.   I think I had mentioned that to the Court that there was a motion from the Prosecutor.  And WVSS does afford this witness slightly different treatment than it does other witnesses; I think that was implied in my previous representations to the Court.  

This witness does not stay in a safe house when he comes to Arusha.  He does not stay in a hotel.  There are other mechanisms in place to protect him because of the special needs required to protect him.  So that may have contributed to the witness's reluctance to go into the details.  I don't know how much he knows about the regular procedures of WVSS, but one thing he knows very clearly is that his protective status a slightly different.  

WVSS, as matter of policy, does not compensate witnesses for their testimony.  This witness is not protected by the Office of the Prosecutor directly.  He stands in a very different class from the others, Witness T and Witness G, who had relationships with the Office of the Prosecutor prior to testifying.  In those cases, Mr. Robinson made numerous motions.  This Court has ruled on those motions, but there was a basis for making -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor could slow down for the interpreters, please.  Thank you. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I could understand Mr. Robinson making repeated enquiries with respect to those witnesses because they were confidential informants at one point, so there was a series of payments that were -- or means of covering their expenses that Mr. Robinson wanted to clarify.  And he did that.  And this Court has ruled.  

But the Office of the Prosecutor has no financial relationship to Witness ZF.  He is entirely protected by W -- by WVSS.  And I would think that this Court would know, or as a matter of policy, that WVSS does not pay witnesses to testify.  WVSS provides for their sustenance, for their meals, for transportation, expenses of that nature.  And this Court already ruled that those types of benefits need not be quantified.  It goes without saying that witnesses that come to Arusha are provided with living quarters and meals and so on and so forth.  It is not my recollection that when this witness was cross-examined there was a detailed enquiry for the number of times that he has been to Arusha and how his needs were met on each specific occasion.  So I think we have gone far beyond what the witness's testimony would require in order to clarify this issue.  

The issue that it seems to me that the Court was interested in was one of basic credibility, whether the witness was willing to acknowledge that he received some sort of benefit, or compensation, or reimbursement sustenance; it is basically a question of how his needs were met in connection to his testimony here.  I think that is clear for the record, and it would really be abusive to go beyond that.  So that is my submission; the motion should be denied, raises issues that are irrelevant.  And to the extent that -- since credibility is at issue, the Court has a recollection of how he was questioned on           cross-examination, how he responded, and how he responded on the re-direct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I saw that you were about to say something, but we had, in fact, come to the conclusion that we should try -- that we should end this discussion now.  We -- we see a distinction between witnesses that are in the care of the WVSS, and witnesses who receive special arrangements from the Prosecutor's office.  So the issue of credibility in regard to those two classes of witnesses is different.  

Now, as far as this particular witness is concerned there has been no allegation or suggestion that he is in a category where he has had any financial relationship with the Office of the Prosecutor.  What has transpired here in his testimony is clearly on the record.  And I think that the issue with regard to his initial denial, and the way in which he made his admission yesterday afternoon is the point which we are going to have to decide what impact that has on the credibility of his testimony.  And the point has been made.  I don't -- we think that that is not necessary to develop it further because we have already seen the witness's denial.  We have seen how he responded to questions in re-examination.  And we have seen the way in which he eventually made the admission.  And we will have to determine, in due course, what impact that has on how we view his testimony.  So I think that the point could be made, has been made, and it is not necessary to develop it further.  That is the way we see it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  So, Mr. President, just so the record is clear, I take it that my motions to re-examine the witness and to have production of the WVSS material are both denied; is that correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  I did have one other small issue that we began to discuss yesterday with respect to the pseudonyms of the next witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have to go into closed session for that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I actually think we can discuss it in general with referring to the particular pseudonyms as far as I am concerned, unless Mr. Webster feels differently.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, I do feel differently because it is clear if we have a discussion, the way that I assume Mr. Robinson is going to proceed, it is going to link matters that should not be linked on the public record.  And I don't see what is lost by going into closed session for a few minutes to address this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that we should go into closed session because it is a normal part of the protective regime that matters effecting protective measures should be discussed in closed session.  

And for the benefit of the public, we are going to go into closed session because we are going to enter into a discussion which may reveal the identity of a prospective witness.  So we will go into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 6 to 10] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 5 by Donna M. Lewis)









MR. WEBSTER: 
Simply for the clarity of the record, Mr. Robinson had raised some objections about our disclosure in relation to BTH.  And I think I addressed it with him and the other Defence teams privately, but I would like them to clarify that on the record so that I don't go into it any further. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  There were three statements of Witness BTH that were disclosed to us at the end of last week.  It turns out that two of those statements have previously been disclosed to us under different K numbers, but we do -- we have had disclosure of two of the statements.  

The third statement, which appears to be some kind of form, I'm not -- we have not had it translated yet so I'm not sure exactly what it is and how much information is contain within it, but it was a statement from 2001 of Witness BTH, and it has never previously been disclosed to us.  So, after we have translation of that, I can give you more information about what effect that violation of Rule 66(A)(ii) might have.  But there was one statement that is new, two that were already in our possession.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I see you have been trying to attract my attention. 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I would like to backtrack a little on the question we dealt with previously because I still have a question about how I will have to conduct my cross-examination.  If, for example, I ask the witness in the trial, "You previously stated -" I suppose that Mr. Webster will rise immediately to ask that my question be redacted.  Would you object to my question being redacted from the record?  It would be very difficult to conduct cross-examination if one has no way of referencing previous statements in previous trials. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we had understood that that was what your enquiry was.  And we were satisfied with the explanation Mr. Webster gave.  What he said was that you -- the Prosecution would have no objection to your making reference to any prior inconsistent statement, whether made on oath or not on oath so long as in referencing the statement you use the present pseudonym and you made reference to the date and page number.  So you would be able to conduct your cross-examination effectively in that manner by just omitting to use the pseudonym that was in force at the time the statement was made.  Would that be clear?  I think that should clarify that situation. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, with respect to the third statement that Mr. Robinson --  or the third document, rather, that Mr. Robinson described as this statement, we have no record of having disclosed it, but, quite frankly, I think this was disclosed sometime ago because it is a statement -- it is a document that is dated 2001.  And I believe it came -- we received it with numerous other documents from Rwanda.  When I look at it, it doesn't look like much of a statement to me.  In fact, it's simply a form requiring the witness to be brought to a court on a certain date, so it is really -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you don't need to defend something which has not been accused as of yet.  Mr. Robinson has said that he is not making any objection yet. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I recall him saying is that he needs the translation -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
What I was about to do was hand up to the Court -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah, when I completed, I was going to hand up to the Court our unofficial translation which should clarify -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but have you shown it to Mr. Robinson?
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Robinson is assisted by a client that speaks Kinyarwanda, Your Honour, I assume that he has had his unofficial translation of the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he has not made any objection yet. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, I don't think we need to rule on it.

Could we call the witness now?  

Good morning, Witness BHT (sic).  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, that is BTH. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.

Mr. Webster, I hope you take note of that powerful argument which was just made.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I was going to let it slip, Your Honour.  In fact, I was about to jump up but I figured that the witness would correct it when we put it to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I'm sorry for mischaracterising your pseudonym, but you will be known as Witness BTH during these proceedings.  We welcome you to the witness box here.  And you are going to give testimony.  The first thing that will be required of you is to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now administer that oath to you.
(Declaration made by the Witness BTH in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, the way in which your testimony will be given, you will respond to questions put to you by the lawyers who are designated for that purpose.  You will, first of all, be questioned by the Prosecution counsel who will be asking you questions now.  

Mr. Webster, you may proceed.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
WITNESS BTH
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:
May we start by having a document placed in front of the witness?  This is something that I had shown previously to the Defence and I had provided a copy to CMS.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, directing your attention to the document that has been laid before you, can you take a look at the lower half of that document, please?  You will see a mention of a name, a first name, a           date of birth, sex, nationality, religion and ethnicity.  Do those -- what is written there, does that accurately describe who you are, your identity? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The relay was not on in the English booth.  Would the witness kindly repeat his answer?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You have been asked to repeat your answer.  Does the information that is provided there, does that accurately describe your identity? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And then there are entries for your place of birth and where you were located -- or resided in            April 1994.  Is that information accurate as well? 
A.	Yes, it is correct. 
Q.	Could I ask you to please sign the form and then date it.  And then the Court clerk can show it to the Chamber and to the Defence, if need be.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And I'd request that it be moved into evidence as P. 29, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 29 admitted, under seal) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would like to take the first 15 minutes of my direct examination in closed session so that I could go into areas that would identify this witness.  It shouldn't be too long.  And that way we can avoid going back and forth during the course of his --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session now for the reasons just stated by the Prosecutor.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 15 to 18] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 11 to 14 by Donna M. Lewis)




















BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you give us a physical description of Joseph Nzirorera?  What did he look like, as you remember him back in 1994? 
A.	As far as I can recall, he hasn't changed much from what I see in relation to what he looked like in 1994.  He was a good man.  He used to frequently interact with members of the population.  It was difficult to go by without saying hello to him.  He had good relations with the inhabitants.  Whenever somebody made a mistake, or committed some kind of offence, he punished them severely.  And that is what -- that is how he was known, or that is what he was known to be. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  But give us a physical description; was he short, tall, in 1994?  How old do you remember him being?  Just describe him to us, physically? 
A.	He is not a tall person.  He is of average height.  And he is not fat.  His skin colour is neither light nor dark.  And his hair was rather short. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you saw Joseph Nzirorera today, do you think you would be able to recognise him? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  I would like you to take a look around this room and tell us if you see Joseph Nzirorera anywhere in the courtroom? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, we would object to this as having no probative value and also pursuant to our earlier motion that any kind of identification, if there was an issue, should have been done through a photograph array or more neutral setting.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I have responded to this particular objection several times with other witnesses, so I don't think it needs a substantive response.  But I would request that the witness answer the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have already ruled on this issue from time to time.  As we have explained, in-court identification is not proof; it is simply a factor.  The issue of identification, if it becomes an issue, will be assessed by other factors other than the witness pointing out somebody in the courtroom.  However, we think that once the Prosecutor has, in fact, allowed the witness to give information suggesting knowledge, once a foundation has been laid the witness could be permitted to determine whether the person he describes is in the courtroom, and point that person out.  So, we'll permit the witness to answer the question; of course, making the reservation that we do not consider in-court identification as proof. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I understand that ruling, but do we agree that that is the opposite of the rulings that you have made in the previous times that the issue has been raised?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you say that?  

MR. ROBINSON:
It is because with certain other witnesses you denied the request that the witness identify the Accused.  In fact, all of the witnesses who have come so far, not a single one of them has been allowed to point out the Accused in court, particularly, the first two witnesses, Mr. Mbonyunkiza and Witness G, you ruled that probative -- there was no probative value to in-court identification.  You prohibited them from doing it.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is not my recollection of the testimony, actually.  I don't think Witness G was ever asked to make an identification from the location where he was testifying.  The request was withdrawn with respect to Witness UB by the counsel that was representing the Prosecution at that time.  And my recollection is that Mbonyunkiza did make an identification, but I will have to check the transcripts for that, but in either case the Trial Chamber has just ruled on this specific issue, so I don't see why we should -- why we should not proceed at this point. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, Counsel Hounkpatin has just reminded me that on that occasion that  Mr. Morley had sought to get the witness to identify the Accused; an objection was raised.  And after discussions, he decided to withdraw his request for the Accused to be identified.  

But let me also draw your attention to the fact that the witness has already testified in this case, and, therefore, already knows the Accused persons.  Therefore, I don't see the relevance in asking him to point out the Accused before whom he has already testified.  It is meaningless, and that is why I believe that such an action is irrelevant and, therefore, should be dismissed -- or denied.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, as we have said before, right, the in-court identification is not proof of anything, it is just evidence.  Now, what you have just indicated will obviously be a factor if the issue of identification proves to be something that is at issue.  But if we have a witness that has given testimony that he has known somebody from the time he was a child; he has been in and out of the person's house over a number of years, and he has laid a satisfactory foundation, which, in our view would permit him to say, I see or I did not see this person in the courtroom, whether the witness's testimony is believed or not will depend on a number of factors.  This is not conclusive, but we think that a sufficient foundation has been laid to allow this exercise to take place in this case.  We do not necessarily think that --  that there is any interference with a fair trial by allowing this process to take place, in the light of the evidence which this witness has given up to now.  So we permit the question.  We will permit the witness to answer the question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, perhaps you have forgotten the question by now.  But I will ask it again.  Would you mind taking a look around the courtroom and telling us if you recognise Mr. Nzirorera anywhere in the courtroom? 
A.	Yes, I can see him.  He is in the courtroom. 
Q.	Tell us where he is positioned, where he is and what he is wearing, please? 
A.	He is sitting on the first row, next to Mr. Robinson.  He is sitting between Counsel Robinson and a gentleman in a black suit.  His own suit looks like khaki in colour, but it is not khaki.  In fact, he is wearing a white shirt.  And I know him very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I notice that the witness knows Mr. Robinson as well. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that have been as a result of the last trial?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, I think they met on several occasions, quite frankly, most recently last week sometime.  But we can have the answer -- we can put that question to the witness himself. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned Mr. Robinson?  When was the last time that you met him, personally, and had a conversation with him? 
A.	The last time I met him was on Friday; Friday, the 2nd of this month. 
Q.	And do you -- in order to identify -- in order to make reference to Mr. Nzirorera, you mentioned a person that was sitting on the other side of him.  Have you met that person before, whether you know his name or not, have you ever met that person and spoken to him? 
A.	When I met Counsel Robinson, that person was in his company.  In fact, he was his interpreter. 
Q.	And when you met with them, was anybody from the Office of the Prosecutor present? 
A.	No, nobody. 
Q.	You had a private conversation with them? 
A.	Yes, there was a security officer, as well, in attendance during our conversation.  The security officer's name is Diop. 
Q.	And with respect to the second person, not Mr. Robinson but the person who was with him, had you ever had any interaction with that person, prior to your meeting on Friday? 
A.	No, I had never met that person anywhere before. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
So, may we have the record indicate that the witness has identified Joseph Nzirorera?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The way you formulated the question it sounded as though you wanted the Court to make a finding of fact on the question of identification.  Now, the point is, that Mr. -- the Court will note -- has taken note that Mr. Nzirorera is the person that was located where the witness said he was. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay, well that is all I am looking for, but that is usually what we do at this stage in the questioning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, is there something that I didn't ask that I should have?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  It is just the way you formulated the question made us wonder if you were asking us to make a finding of fact at this stage on the question of identification which is just what we have indicated we were not willing to do. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the person pointed out is Mr. Nzirorera. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is 10:30.  It is time for the mid-morning recess. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we take a mid-morning and a mid-afternoon recess.  And we will take our mid-morning recess now.  It is usually about 15 -- 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1032H)
(Pages 19 to 22 by Donna M. Lewis)







(Court resumed at 1105H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, before you continue, we would just like to make a housekeeping announcement.  We have been advised that the translation for the BTH documents is going to require the full day tomorrow.  So we have decided not to sit tomorrow, but to allow that exercise to take place, commencing at 9 a.m.  So the Chamber will be sitting only for the purpose of dealing with the in-court translations of the documents related to BTH tomorrow.  

Now, Mr. Webster, are you going to be able to finish your examination-in-chief on Monday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I would think so.  That's the plan, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can move forward now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  My client and I believe the other two Accused have requested also that they not be present tomorrow for the translation exercise, so may an order be made that they not be brought to court?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can certainly make an order that their presence is not required tomorrow for the translation exercise.  That's clear.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, can you tell us if you were affiliated with any political party in 1994, you personally?  
A.	Yes, I was a member of a political party. 
Q.	Would you tell us which one, please? 
A.	I was an MRND party member. 
Q.	Why did you choose to become a member of the MRND? 
A.	I was motivated by several reasons.  As a member of the MRND, I felt safe and I enjoyed security. 
Q.	Do you recall when it was that multi-party politics was introduced in Rwanda?  Can you recall the year? 
A.	1991. 
Q.	How did the introduction of multi-party politics impact on Mukingo commune as you lived through that period?  
A.	With the advent of multi-party politics in our commune, I noticed that members of the other parties were perceived to be enemies of the state, given that the government at the time was dominated by the MRND.  So members of the opposition were taken for enemies -- or, rather, accomplices of the enemy, and they had to be beaten off. 
Q.	When you say that they had to be beaten off, could you clarify that for me?  Did you have any direct experience with beating off members of the opposition? 
A.	Yes, I'm aware of some cases.
Q.	Would you recall the first incidents of those cases, the ones that you have in mind? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to the relevance of this testimony.  I think that it's going to involve allegations against Mr. Nzirorera which essentially is -- I expect will involve taking action against members of other parties in 1992, perhaps, and I think that no such allegations are contained in the indictment and it's beyond the scope of what he's been charged with here.  It's not having anything to do with the Tutsi.  And so I think it's irrelevant and we shouldn't begin going down the road of hearing a lot of extraneous testimony.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, this gets back to the general point of background and context for the events of 1994.  We've explored this with other witnesses.  It's the same objection that Mr. Robinson has -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What Mr. -- if it's the same background information, why do you need to go over it again?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Because it's part of this witness's direct experience and it's part of his testimony.  So the issue for us is not simply putting that evidence on the record, it's putting that evidence on the record through someone who had a direct relationship with the Accused and who can talk about it, not as being something distant in the background, but something that he personally lived through and participated.  So I don't see it as a waste of time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, apart from time-wasting, we are also concerned about being faithful to the indictment.  Is it connected to the charges in the indictment?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It is connected to the charges in the indictment.  There are crimes against humanity that are pleaded in the indictment.  The indictment charges crimes against -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The crimes against humanity occurred in 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, they did, but they occurred in a specific context of grouping opposition party members with the Tutsi and characterising both as either enemies or accomplices of the enemy.  It's in the pre-trial brief.  I can check in the indictment, but it would surprise me that there's no reference to political unrest prior to 1994 in the indictment.  This is a brief portion of the witness's testimony.  If we had taken the question, we would have been much further along now than the five or six minutes it's taken to debate this point. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, first, could we ask the witness to remove his headphones?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, would you remove your headphones?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, what I anticipate the testimony is going to be is that on one or two occasions in 1992 Mr. Nzirorera ordered the Interahamwe, including this witness, to commit acts against opposition member -- Hutus who were members of the MDR and maybe the PSD party in the Ruhengeri préfecture, and that that included beating them up and taking the flags of the other parties.  Now, that's just that I want to -- so you understand what we're dealing with in the concrete rather than the abstract.  That's very collateral to the charge in 1994 that he somehow was involved in the extermination of the Tutsis.  And it's our position that the Trial Chamber should exercise some judgement at this time to exclude that evidence so that we don't have a lot of extraneous examination with respect to these events.  That's my point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, has Mr. Robinson characterised the testimony being adduced correctly?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, Mr. Robinson was here when this witness testified at length in the first trial, and I'm going over the same information that was introduced previously in another proceeding for the same indictment.  We dealt with these same objections when this witness gave evidence previously, and that's the substance of his testimony.  So it concerns the political violence against the MDR that involved the Interahamwe.  And the purpose for that evidence is two-fold.  It's not simply the political and the social context.  It's developing pattern and practice of mobilising party youth to respond to the orders of the party heads.  So I think it's relevant for this Court on two points.  It's not something that we have to spend a great deal of time with.  Had the questions proceeded, we would have been on to a new line of questioning already.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to allow the question to be asked on two main reasons:  One, we think that the issue of background is reasonable.  It's quite clear that these are matters which -- on which a conviction cannot be based.  But secondly, and more importantly, during the examination of witness -- of the last witness who testified, the issue of the relationship between the political parties was quite substantially canvassed and so we think that we should -- it would be consistent with the examination of the issues raised at that time that this should be allowed from this witness as well.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recall the question?  
A.	No. 
Q.	We were beginning to discuss the events that transpired, or the context of events in Mukingo after the introduction of multi-party politics and you were beginning to tell us what the impact of the introduction of multi-party politics was in Mukingo commune.  In a previous response, you had said something along the lines of "beating the opposition" or "attacking the opposition", and I had asked you to explain that a little bit for us.  So based on your direct experience or your observations, what did that entail in Mukingo commune?  
A.	I did witness this with my own eyes.  It is an experience that I lived through personally. 
Q.	And tell us what happened, if you can think of any specific incidents.  
A.	First of all, I do recall that the Interahamwe to which I belonged launched an attack in Kabere and the MRND banner was flying at that time.  We went out to attack members of the opposition.  We lynched them.  We destroyed tiles in some buildings, and we also attacked the PSD in Gikombe.  Members of that party were lynched.  We captured the insignia of that party and took them to Nzirorera.  When we conducted that attack, he had given us a Daihatsu vehicle belonging to his brother-in-law.  So we brought back the MDR flag and the PSD flag to him.  

I do recall a third occasion on which we went to collect a young man of Tutsi origin of the PSD party.  We brought him to Nzirorera at night, and he was ordered to quit his party, the PSD, and that if he failed to do, so he would run into problems.  He accepted to do so, and for compensation Nzirorera gave him work at his institute.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You've mentioned several incidents, and I'd like to take them a bit apart.  I'm trying to understand, or I'd like the Trial Chamber to understand, whether these are events that took place in 1991, 1992, or 1993.  So, can you think back, and of the things that you've just mentioned, tell us which one occurred the first in time?  Is there anything that you've just recounted that took place in 1991? 
A.	The first incident was the attack in Kabere, in Nyakinama commune.  Then, secondly, the attack in which we brought back the PSD flag.  And the third incident was the one relating to Twizere, Faustin.  All those incidents took place after the advent of multi-party politics. 
Q.	All right.  With respect to the first incident, was that in 1991 or 1992?  
A.	The first incident took place in 1992.  I believe it was in the early part of that year, the first months of that year. 
Q.	Was that the first time that you personally had been involved in acts of violence that were ordered by Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  That was the very first time. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, we'll come back to that incident, but I'd like us to start talking about events that took place in 1991 so this we can move forward chronologically.  Do you recall an attack against Rwanda by the RPF at the beginning of 1991?  
A.	Yes, I do remember that attack. 
Q.	Tell us what was significant about that attack.  What happened during the course of that attack so that we can all understand which attack you're referring to?  
A.	That was the first RPF attack which led to capturing Ruhengeri town.  The RPF was able to release prisoners who had been held in Ruhengeri, political prisoners, including Lizinde, Bizeruka (phonetic), and others.  
Q.	Did they remain -- and when I say "they", I'm referring to the RPF.  Did they remain in Ruhengeri town or did they retreat afterwards? 
A.	The RPF troops fought and captured the town.  They released the prisoners, but the Rwandan army came in afterwards and chased the RPF out of the town and they sought refuge in Rwanda -- in Uganda, rather. 
Q.	So how long did the RPF remain in Ruhengeri town, if you can -- if you know? 
A.	The first gunshots were heard, we heard them at about midnight and 2 a.m.  The next day, early in the morning, we were told that the RPF had been chased out of the town.  
Q.	So, in other words, they left the very next morning; would that be accurate?  
A.	Well, the RPF attacked today, tomorrow and overnight, with fighting going on throughout that time.  So it is only in the evening of the next day that we were told that the RPF had retreated, and it was the day after that we were told that the RPF had been driven out of the town. 
Q.	Thank you.  How did the authorities in your commune react or respond to that RPF attack?  Were you ordered to do anything, or told to do anything by authority figures? 
A.	No.  No orders were issued.  What happened was that military operations were undertaken but some Tutsis and Bagogwe who were living in Mukingo and another commune were arrested and killed, having been accused of being RPF accomplices.  They were arrested by civilian and military officials. 
Q.	Did you participate in those arrests? 
A.	It was only after I joined the Interahamwe that I became involved in such acts.  Previously, the Interahamwe did not exist and I therefore could not be involved in those activities.  It is civilian and military authorities who conducted those acts. 
Q.	Well, when you say civilian authorities, can you tell us who you are referring to?  Give us the names of the -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to this line of questioning.  Now we're trying to elicit evidence of the killing of Bagogwe Tutsis in 1991, which our position is, is irrelevant and not in the indictment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think that this is outside the scope of the case.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we're building a pattern of evidence where every time there's a RPF attack there's a response by the local Tutsi, and that's how it's pleaded in -- excuse me, that's how it's set forth in the pre-trial brief, that every time there is a RPF advance, either militarily or politically, there is a response in Ruhengeri against the Bagogwe.  So that's what I'm trying to get to, but it's taking me a little longer than expected.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have we had incidents about this attack before?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe it's referenced in the pre-trial brief.  I was looking for a reference to it, but I did not see it a second ago.  What I can do, I can go on and come back to this if it's necessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please do so.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your last response you made a reference to joining the Interahamwe.  Can you tell us when the Interahamwe were formed in Mukingo commune? 
A.	In Mukingo commune the Interahamwe were set up towards the end of 1991, but at that time they were not known as the Interahamwe; they were simply known as the youth wing of the Interahamwe -- of the MRND, rather.  It is only in 1992 that the term "Interahamwe" was used or was adopted. 
Q.	Well, dealing with the youth wing in 1991, or that you stated was formed in 1991, can you tell us who among the civilian authorities played a role in organising that youth wing? 
A.	It was Bourgmestre Kajelijeli who convened the youth wings to meet those who were of school age, some attending school and others not.  So he convened them to the Mukingo communal office, telling them that he had received a letter instructing him to create an MRND youth wing and that reports would be forwarded accordingly, stating clearly what had been done.  
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera involved in any way in organising or causing to be argued that youth wing in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, he played a role in it.  When Bourgmestre Kajelijeli convened the youth to this meeting, he said he had received orders from Nzirorera, who had required that a report be submitted to him on what had transpired during that meeting of the youth. 
Q.	Did you participate in those first meetings? 
A.	Yes, I attended those first meetings. 
Q.	What were the purposes or the objectives of the youth wing as it was explained to you?  
A.	First of all, we were told that the youth, those who were attending school or not, were expected to become members of the MRND because the MRND had developed to a certain level and there was need to form a youth group that would collaborate with the MRND because the MRND was relying on the youth as the strength of the party.  Therefore, the youth were called upon to be together as a strong and integral part of the party. 
Q.	At what point was that youth wing turned into the Interahamwe? 
A.	It is not from 1991 that that position was adopted. 
Q.	When was it adopted? 
A.	I do not recall the exact date, but I know that it was in 1992, in the middle of 1992. 
Q.	What role did Joseph Nzirorera play in transforming the youth wing into the Interahamwe, if any? 
A.	Immediately following the creation of the youth wing, the Kajelijeli youth wing reported to Nzirorera in Mukingo commune.  Members of the committee were introduced to him, and he accepted he was ready to collaborate or work with that committee, and if the committee did run into any problems, they should report to him.  We were told that Kajelijeli was to inform us about everything that was happening and that if we had any requests, we should forward them through him.  He had a role to play.  He was in charge of the youth wing and he was the one who would tell us how to proceed. 
Q.	Is this something that Joseph Nzirorera said to you directly?  I'm still not understanding exactly what role Joseph Nzirorero had in relation to the formation of the Interahamwe.  Tell us who was doing what and who was saying what.  
A.	I have told you that following the creation of the youth wing by Kajelijeli, following instructions from Nzirorera, Kajelijeli reported to Nzirorera, and I was present alongside all other members of our committee and other members of our group.  He's the one who told us that this force was necessary because the MRND at the level of Mukingo commune needed to be the predominant party.  He hailed from Mukingo commune and therefore was duty bound to ensure that the MRND was the predominant party in his native commune. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, when you say "he", we're not quite sure who you mean because you've mentioned a number of persons.  So if you're referring to Joseph Nzirorera, you have to say his name so it's clear.  And if you're referring to Kajelijeli, say his name so it's clear, or anybody else.  With respect to your previous response, are you talking about a meeting that was held or an encounter where you were face to face with Joseph Nzirorera?  Clarify that for us, please, and tell us what each person was saying or doing at the time.  
A.	Kajelijeli called the youth to a meeting and invited them to elect their youth committee.  After the committee was elected, the members of the committee were introduced to Nzirorera.  Nzirorera then spoke to the committee openly.  Other members of the youth wing were also in attendance.  He congratulated the committee upon their election.  Joseph Nzirorera undertook personally to assist the committee, to help the committee.  He said that he would provide the committee with what they needed.  
Q.	Thank you.  I don't want you to mention your own name, but tell us who the other members of the committee were, please.  Give us their names.  
A.	There was one Michel Niyigaba, Noel Ndayisaba and Rwihandagaza. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, the witness has just referred to numbers 60, 62 and 81 on the spelling list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  You've mentioned three persons, Mr. Witness.  Can you think of any other persons that were present during that meeting or that were members of the committee?  
A.	Those were the members of the committee in 1991, that is, when the youth wing was initially created.  The other members of that committee, because the committee was expanded in 1992, it therefore included other members in addition to those initial members. 
Q.	Thank you.  With respect to Michel Niyigaba, did he have any particular status in the committee?  
A.	At that time he was the vice-president, but he later became the president of the committee. 
Q.	How much later? 
A.	I believe it was one month later, one month later he became president. 
Q.	With respect to Noel Ndayisaba, did that person have any particular relationship to Nzirorera? 
A.	He was the son of Nzirorera's younger brother, whose name was Apollinaire Kalikutina (phonetic). 
Q.	And with respect to the third person you mentioned, a certain Rwihandagaza, did that person have any particular status on the committee? 
A.	He was the treasurer. 
Q.	What was the purpose of the committee? 
A.	The committee was supposed to manage the youth.  It was a coordination committee also for all activities to be undertaken by the youth, and this committee was also supposed to represent so as to submit the request or demands of the youth wings to whoever they needed to do that to. 
Q.	Well, who would request the demands be submitted to?  When you say "whoever they needed to do that to", you need to be a bit more specific for us.  
A.	The first person was Joseph Nzirorera.  He was supposed to resolve the problems of the youth.  Second person being Juvénal Kajelijeli.  Thirdly, the MRND leadership at commune level; the person responsible was Jean Damascène Niyoyita. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, that name is number 63 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, how many persons had joined the youth wing at the time that this meeting that you've just described took place?  In other words, beyond the committee, approximately how many youth belonged to the wing -- youth wing at that time? 
A.	At the first meeting, about 40 to 50 people attended. 
Q.	Where did that meeting take place? 
A.	At the Mukingo commune office. 
Q.	Are we still talking about the meeting where Joseph Nzirorera himself was present? 
A.	No.  You asked me about the first meeting convened by Juvénal Kajelijeli.  This is the meeting I am talking about. 
Q.	All right.  So with the meeting convened, the first meeting convened by Juvénal Kajelijeli, that was at the bureau communal and there were around 40 to 50 participants; is that your testimony? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	Afterwards there was a meeting where Joseph Nzirorera himself was present.  Tell us where that meeting took place and how many persons were present, and the names of some of the people that were present.  
A.	We were summoned, Kajelijeli had summoned us.  He said we were to meet at the house of Nzirorera's mother.  At that point Nzirorera was present; so was Kajelijeli, of course, and Augustin Bizimungu was also there.  At the time he was a major.  There was also Jean Damascène, Esdras Baheza, Jean Baptiste Nyabusore, and many others whose names I no longer recall. 
Q.	When you mention a Mr. Nyabusore, can you tell us what his status was in his community?  This is number 68 on our list.  
A.	Jean Baptiste Nyabusore was the director of the Institute superieur d'agriculture et d'elevage de Busogo, ISAE. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, ISAE can be found at number 35 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Concerning Esdras Baheza, who was he?  What was his status in your community? 
A.	Baheza was a businessman at the Byangabo commercial centre. 
Q.	You made reference to a Jean Damascène.  Are you referring to Jean Damascène Niyoyita? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And for the record -- 
A.	He was MRND president in Mukingo commune. 
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, that's number 63 on our list.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	With respect to Juvénal Kajelijeli, can you tell us, from what you were able to observe, how did he relate personally to Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  From what I know he was a friend of Nzirorera's.  Whenever Nzirorera was home, Kajelijeli was also there.  He was also treasurer for the institute that Nzirorera had founded.  I was a close friend -- they were close friends, rather.  He would not hide anything from him.  Whatever Nzirorera meant to say, he would use Kajelijeli to come and inform us, and vice-versa.  Whenever Kajelijeli -- or, rather, if we had information that we needed to give to Nzirorera, we would use Kajelijeli as a go between. 
Q.	Did Nzirorera himself ever direct you to use Kajelijeli as a go between?  
A.	Yes.  That is what he told us himself.  He had told us that should we be unable to see him, address him directly, we could get our message to him through Kajelijeli. 
Q.	What about him sending messages to you?  Did he comment on that in any respect? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	How long did that meeting last?  And here I'm still referring to the meeting at Nzirorera's mother's house, where all these authorities were present.  
A.	The meeting lasted about 40 minutes, as the agenda was to introduce the committee that had been elected and also he wanted to show his support for the committee elected.  There was nothing really provided for the agenda, so that the meeting did not last long.  He also introduced us to the people who were retained at his mother's house. 
Q.	When you say "the people who were retained", I'm not quite clear on what you mean.  Can you explain that, please?  
A.	Those are the people who -- figures, who had come with him, including Bizimungu, Niyoyita, Baheza, Kajelijeli, Nyabusore, so he introduced us to these people. 
Q.	Were there any other military figures that were present? 
A.	As I told you, there was Major Bizimungu, Augustin present, in attendance.  Actually, rather, his rank was that of colonel.  I was mistaken earlier. 
Q.	Remind us again of when this meeting took place.  Are we talking about the end of 1991 or sometime in 1992?  
A.	It was towards the end of 1991. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you mentioned at some point this youth wing or this -- yes, this youth wing of the MRND became to be known as the Interahamwe.  You mentioned that occurred sometime in the middle of 1992.  Do you recall if there was a meeting in which this issue was addressed, the notion of calling the group the Interahamwe?  I'm trying to understand the progression.  
A.	I said the name Interahamwe was adopted in mid 1992.  As for the meeting where this issue was discussed, I did not make reference to this meeting, but of course we could not adopt that name without a meeting to discuss it. 
Q.	Well, was there a meeting where this was discussed?  
A.	It all happened at the level of the MRND leadership at national level.  I do not know if such a meeting took place or not. 
Q.	Well, how did you come to learn of this?  
A.	Kajelijeli would tell us about all this.  Besides, this was even mentioned on radio.  At one point it was publicly stated that the MRND youth wing was called "Interahamwe".  However, we, for our part, were informed by Kajelijeli, since he was -- it is Niyoyita who gave us this information since he was MRND leader at the commune level. 
Q.	During the period between that first meeting attended by Nzirorera and those authorities towards the end of 1991, and when you learned of this development to call this group the Interahamwe, did you see Joseph Nzirorera at any time during that period between those two events, or those two landmarks?  
A.	Yes, I would see him. 
Q.	How often, and under what circumstances?  
A.	I saw him several times.  I told you he hailed from that area, and he would often come home.  Almost every weekend, I would see him.  He came very often to his home, especially during the weekends.  His mother lived in that area.  Moreover, he too had a house in the area. 
Q.	On those occasions when you would see him, would this be in the context of meetings of the youth wing or the Interahamwe, or was it simply a social visit between the two of you?  I'm trying to understand the nature of your interaction with him over that period.  
A.	He had several reasons to come to the region, but mostly -- most of the time he was at his house.  But most of the time we would go to his house to hold meetings as Interahamwes because it is following the meetings with Joseph Nzirorera that the Interahamwe would receive instructions.  So that there were several meetings being held at Nzirorera's house involving Interahamwes. 
Q.	When you say "Nzirorera's house", are you referring to his mother's house in Busogo secteur? 
A.	I am referring to his mother's house. 
Q.	When you mentioned meetings, can you describe a typical meeting for us?  How many persons would be present, who among the local authorities would be present, how were things discussed?  Give the Court a picture, a mental image of what transpired.  
A.	First of all, not just anybody could come -- was invited to the meetings.  There were officials like him who came, and following the meetings, these officials and Nzirorera would give the Interahamwe instructions.  The officials, for instance, including Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, Esdras Baheza, Jean Baptiste Nyabusore, Lieutenant Colonel Ephrem Setako, Alphonse Ntirivamunda, Michel Bakunakundi and Jean Damascène Niyoyita, Dominique Gatsimbanyi, Kajelijeli and many others I no longer recall.  When they were in meetings, we would wait within the compound, and following the meeting, they would give us whatever instructions they had to give us.  When they had something to offer us, they would offer it to us and then they would go home.  And upon their return on another occasion, then again we would go to his house.  
Q.	The meetings that you've just described, did they involve anyone who was not a member of the MRND party, or not associated with the MRND?  
A.	No member of any other party would attend the meetings, no one except for MRND members. 
Q.	When you mention that these authorities would give you instructions, and when I say you, I mean the Interahamwe, what type of instructions would you receive? 
A.	I think I have already told you that for example they would ask us to go and remove flags belonging to other parties, that we should chase away other political parties, which we did.  In addition, we were supposed to help provide security.  We were supposed to help at roadblocks, look for RPF accomplices, and check that there were no -- ensure that there were no intruders in the region.  These are some examples of instructions we would receive. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say RPF accomplices, who do you mean by that?  
A.	By "accomplices of the Inkotanyi" I mean the Tutsis who were in the country, those who were not at the front.  Opposition parties were also considered accomplices of the enemy, as well as anybody else who may have had relations with the Interaham -- with the Inkotanyi, even though they may have been Hutu. 
Q.	Well, when you refer to Tutsi being accomplices of the Inkotanyi, are you including in that reference women and children and elderly persons who couldn't possibly have been involved in the war?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  Whether you were a child, an elderly person, as long as you were Tutsi.  The fact that you were Tutsi was enough to qualify you or make you be considered as an Inkotanyi accomplice. 
Q.	Well, what did these authorities tell you to do in relation to these accomplices?  
A.	First of all, they were to be closely supervised so that we could determine if they were collaborating with the Inkotanyi.  We were keeping a close watch on them.  When we were asked to go and fetch a particular person, we would go and fetch that person and hand them over to the military authorities.  Sometimes we were even sent to the home of a person, and we would beat that person up, to the extent that that person would even flee from his own home following our beating. 
Q.	Do you recall any specific instructions from Joseph Nzirorera himself?  I'm trying to make a distinction between Joseph Nzirorera and the other authorities because I would like you to respond to this question in terms of what Nzirorera himself instructed you to do.  Do you recall any specific instructions from Joseph Nzirorera to attack anyone or to beat anyone in Ruhengeri during that period?  
A.	All of the actions of the Interahamwe in Mukingo were ordered by Nzirorera.  He either issued direct orders to act or used someone else.  Because we knew that we were to only obey Nzirorera. 
Q.	Still addressing the period up to the end of 1992, during the period -- during the year of 1992, were there any attacks by the Interahamwe against the Bagogwe or any member of the Bagogwe? 
A.	I recall the attack that took place in 1993, rather, and in the period that followed after 1993.  We went to Busogo and we beat up the Bagogwe, who had to flee their homes and sought refuge in the Busogo parish.  After the Ruhengeri attack, again we attacked the Bagogwe, who had to escape to ISAE, but even as far as back as 1992, there were at that time people who were accusing others, were telling us that so and so is suspicious, and as for our actions, we were asked to go and grab flags belonging to opposition parties.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We're going to address the events in 1993 in a detailed manner a little later in your testimony but I'm still trying to complete your evidence with respect to events in 1992.  Were you ever issued an identification card for the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall when that was and how that came to pass? 
A.	I do not exactly remember the month, but I know that these cards were received in 1992.  A list was drawn up and handed over to the MRND in Mukingo and I know the list was handed over to Nzirorera.  And after some time we received our cards. 
Q.	Who were the persons that were instrumental in making these cards available to you?  Could you give us the names of the persons? 
A.	It was Nzirorera because we had asked him for those cards.  So he told us to draw up a list, to hand over the list to Jean Damascène Niyoyita.  We did that, and in the end we received our cards. 
Q.	Did you ever receive fabric or uniforms or dress that was particular to the Interahamwe or characteristic of the Interahamwe?  Was there a particular dress that you received? 
A.	Yes, we received uniforms. 
Q.	How did that come to pass?  How made them available?  How did you receive it?  Who was instrumental in making that happen?  
A.	Around August 1992 Nzirorera was at his house.  He summoned some Interahamwe and personally distributed uniforms to them, but all he provided were the shirts.  Did he not provide trousers.  He gave out about 40 to 50 uniforms. 
Q.	Were you present and did you receive one directly from Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I was present and I did receive my uniform. 
Q.	Directing your attention to the second half of 1992, what type of reputation did the Interahamwe have in Mukingo? 
A.	At the time the Interahamwe were in force.  They were there in large numbers.  I'm referring to Mukingo commune.  Also recall Kigombe.  I also remember there were not Interahamwes -- there were no Interahamwes having uniforms except for those of Nzirorera.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, the interpreter didn't get the second part of the witness's answer.  Could he repeat it, please?
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let me repeat the question for you, Witness.  Did the Interahamwe have any particular reputation in Mukingo or nationally by the time we get to the end of 1992?  In other words, do you get a sense from the way the Interahamwe were being discussed in the press or on the radio or in other public discussions that they were either liked or feared or any number of things in your community or nationally?  What is your impression or your recollection of the reputation of the Interahamwe by the second half of 1992?  
A.	At local level, as well as at national level, the Interahamwes were known.  Now, as for their reputation, I can simply say they were feared because of their actions, those who had founded them and the way the group had been set up.  It was accepted that they were killing other people so that their reputation was not good, at least, from the point of view of the population.  Moreover, in Kigali they were taking part in fighting, skirmishes with other youth wings like the JDR or youth wings of other parties.  In our area we were similarly feared.  We could barricade a road for five days, for up to five days.  So that the Interahamwe were certainly feared. 
Q.	When you say you could barricade a road, did you actually do that in the course of 1992 at any point? 
A.	I remember that in 1992 we did it.  We did this at the Gisenyi-Kigali road.  It was in Mukingo commune.  We did this for five days.  We stopped traffic until we were granted the authorisation to leave the area.  This took place following steps taken by opposition parties, namely, a speech or an excerpt of a speech by the president which was broadcast immediately after the news.  And following this measure by the opposition parties, we retaliated by barricading the road. 
Q.	When you commented that you stopped the barricade or lifted it when you were authorised to do so, who authorised you?  
A.	Those who ordered us to do so are the MRND leaders, including Nzirorera.  Kajelijeli came to tell us that we should barricade the road until the speech was broadcast as usual.  We would regularly discuss the need to remove the roadblock with various persons, but it is Nzirorera who ordered us to barricade the road.  We were told; we were asked to do it; and we complied.  And at a certain point we were told to remove it and again we complied. 
Q.	When you say that Nzirorera told you to mount the roadblock and at some point to dismantle it, how did he communicate that to you?  Did he say it to the group himself or did he use an intermediary?  Tell us exactly how it was that you received instructions from him.  
A.	I explained it, Kajelijeli came to give us a message from Nzirorera that we should barricade the road.  So when we mounted the roadblock, we would communicate with him, using the radio or telephone in his office, Jean Baptiste office at ISAE so that we were in contact with Nzirorera. 
Q.	When you say Jean Baptiste, are you referring to Jean Baptiste Nyabusore? 
A.	Yes.  I mean mentioned the name Nyabusore. 
Q.	And when you say that there was a telephone conversation, are you referring to Jean Baptiste Nyabusore speaking directly to Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	No.  Rather, our leader, that is, Hakizimana would go to see him see Nyabusore, who would let him use the telephone to contact Nzirorero.  It was our leader who would communicate with Nzirorero.
Q.	Thank you.  When you mentioned the --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, the name that came through as "our leader" came through as something completely unfamiliar to me, so maybe it was either mistranslated or it could be clarified. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe I could have the witness repeat that.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned a person you described as your leader being a conduit of information from Nzirorera through Nyabusore.  Tell us the name of that person again, please.  
A.	His name is Hakizimana.  He was a young man living in Ntirivamunda, Alphonse's house.  Ntirivamunda was a director general.  He was called "Hakiza", but his full name was Hakizimana. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it's 12:30.  Could you indicate when it's a convenient time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can stop here, Your Honour, and pick it up after lunch.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, we take our lunch break.  It's approximately 90 minutes.  We resume at two o'clock.  I must tell you that during this or other any adjournment while you are a witness before our Court, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody at all.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1413H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue now.  I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took at the beginning of your testimony this morning.  

Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon to you, Counsel. 
Q.	We left off talking about events in 1992 and we're just going to deal with that with one or two more questions, and move on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, before you continue, I think I should just let you know that during the luncheon break we reviewed the indictment and the pre-trial brief and we've decided to allow the question to be put on the Bagogwe incident. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did the Interahamwe have a meeting place or a headquarters to Mukingo?  
A.	Yes, they did. 
Q.	Can you tell us where it was, and if it had a particular name, please? 
A.	They had an office at Rwankeli in Busogo.  It was called Isimbi Rya Busogo, a building that Nzirorera gave to the Interahamwe so that they could have their office there.
Q.	All right. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  For the record, Rwankeli is number 80 on our list; Isimbi is number 36 on our list; and I believe there was a reference to Busogo, which was also -- it's number 14 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you said Mr. Nzirorera gave you -- or gave the Interahamwe the house, when did this happen? 
A.	In 1992. 
Q.	Do you recall around what period during the year? 
A.	After June 1992. 
Q.	And did this building belong to Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, that building belonged to Nzirorera. 
Q.	Where was it located in relation to his mother's house? 
A.	Nzirorera's mother lived a bit down the road.  As to the building known as Isimbi rya Busogo, it's a bit above, but both buildings face each other, on opposite, on opposite sides of the road. 
Q.	What was the house used for, or how often was it used by the Interahamwe? 
A.	As of when he handed the building over in 1992, the Interahamwe used it until it was destroyed in 1994.  The Interahamwe had an office in that building.  They had a key, and there was a flag that was hung outside the building, and that was in -- until 1994. 
Q.	When you say until 1994, are you saying until the end of the events of the genocide or before then?  Be a bit more specific for us, please.  
A.	The building was destroyed when the Inkotanyi occupied the country.  When we fled, the building was still standing.  But which we came back, we couldn't -- it wasn't there any more.  So I think it was destroyed between about July and August 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, when you say it was the Interahamwe headquarters, what I'm asking you to describe is what type of activities would go on in that location.  If you can think back in time and just tell us what occurred there.  
A.	Well, first of all, the Interahamwe held meetings there, and secondly, we were trained.  We underwent training.  We learnt how to manipulate firearms, how to dismantle and reassemble a firearm.  That's the sort of activities that occurred there.  And when we got money to buy beer, we would get together there.  So all Interahamwe activities would occur there.
Q.	Well, in regard to training that you received or underwent as an Interahamwe, did you receive any training during the course of 1992, and if so, what kind of training?  
A.	Certain individuals who had been trained -- who received training in 1992, certain Interahamwe -- the training those Interahamwe received was how to dismantle, disassemble a firearm, how to shoot with it, how to draw the pin from a grenade and how to throw it.  That is the sort of training we received there.
Q.	All right.  Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention to the month of November 1992.  Do you recall attending an MRND rally in Ruhengeri town during that period? 
A.	Yes, I do recall because I attended that rally. 
Q.	Tell us what happened at that rally.  
A.	It was a rally organised by the MRND party.  And MRND members and Interahamwe members from all over the country more or less took part, including President Habyarimana, and the main leaders spoke there, including the chief Interahamwe.  There were dance -- there was dancing, and there was a promise issued to -- a promise was made to issue Interahamwe with uniforms.  That is what I observed at that rally. 
Q.	Do you recall how long the rally lasted? 
A.	I think we arrived at about 9 a.m. and other people came, and the rally ended at about 3 or 4 p.m. 
Q.	And over the course of that period, those hours, tell us what happened.  You mentioned that there were a number of speakers.  Tell us who spoke, the types of things they discussed and what stands out most in your mind in relation to that rally.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President I'd like to interpose an objection here as being cumulative.  We've seen the videos of the rally; we have transcripts of the speeches.  I don't know why it's necessary for this witness to give his own memory of these events and what the purpose -- what's furthered by repeating this for now, probably the fourth time in the trial.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I've made it clear because I've responded to this objection several times before, and the rally is evidence on two levels because, on one level, we have the transcript of it, so we know the rally took place.  We also know the words that were actually pronounced, and we have it translated into the two working languages of the Tribunal.  But makes it significant for this case is how it was interpreted, and there are various ways to interpret the speeches that were said.  We've had a witness that interpreted it that provided evidence on how the military saw it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's enough, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps I was speaking too fast for the interpretation.  I can repeat my response, if necessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not quite certain whether it's to lip read, but it's not necessary to repeat your submissions.  We have decided to allow the question.  
(Pages 23 to 39 by Karen Holm)










1430H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I will repeat the question for you.  But what I'm asking you to do is give the Court an account of what transpired on the day of the rally.  So, if you could tell us who you remember speaking, and what you found most memorable about the events of that day.  
A.	Well, what comes to mind is what was said by President Habyarimana.  I know that Robert Kajuga, the president of the Interahamwe, spoke, Mathieu Ngirumpatse spoke.  And he was head of the party, nationally speaking.  And Casimir Bizimungu took the floor, he headed the MRND in Gisenyi.  But, what I recall is what was said by President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you remember from the speech made by the president, President Habyarimana?  What was most distinctive about the things that he had to say?  
A.	I remember that he said that he had not wanted to pass through without greeting the people, because he was taking his children to their grandmother, and he -- as he passed he noted that there was a meeting, and so he wanted to stop there.  

And he went on to touch upon the problem of street -- of children who were wandering around and didn't go to school.  These were the children of the IDPs, internal displaced persons, displaced as a result of the RPF war.  And he expressed a wish that each family should adopt one of the children in that situation.  

And he also asked the Ruhengeri population and the people in general to maintain public security.  And he also dwelt on the topic of justice and said that judicial services were not making the necessary investigations, because some people in Kibuye and Bugesera had -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, that's not clear.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- but he asked them -- the authorities to contact the businessmen, local businessmen to obtain cloth material -- kitenge, it's called -- and that when the Interahamwe wore that specific kitenge, that was the right thing to do.  And he said the electoral campaign is going to start, and he's going to call upon the Interahamwe and the Interahamwe would accompany him, and they would go down, descend.  Another thing is that he mentioned the fact that the soldiers would run his campaign, but it would be essentially the Interahamwe that ran his electoral campaign.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Concerning his comments about the Interahamwe, did you find them to be complimentary things to say, or was he critical of the Interahamwe?  Tell us what you understood him to be saying in relation to the Interahamwe.  
A.	No, he wasn't criticising the Interahamwe.  He wouldn't of said he was going to be accompanied by them in the electoral campaign.  He was congratulating them and asking those concerned to do all they could to find a uniform.  In fact, he was saying instead of working with the military, he preferred to work with the Interahamwe because at the time it was the Interahamwe whom the people trusted.  Moreover, his wife, who was with him, was wearing clothes resembling those of Interahamwe.  In my view, when he was saying those things, he supported the Interahamwe and he was urging -- inviting the rest of the population to also support the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, if you put yourself in the frame of mind of November 1992, when Habyarimana made this speech.  Had the Interahamwe come under criticism, nationally or internationally -- I'm not talking about what Habyarimana says, or said, I'm talking about other persons, whether they be opposition political parties, human rights activists, other citizens from Rwanda.  Previously you told us about the reputation of the Interahamwe, and my question to you at this point is how you understood President Habyarimana's speech in relation to the things that were being said about the Interahamwe at that time.  Do you understand my question?  
A.	I understand the question.  At that time the other parties, parties other than the MRND, blamed the Interahamwe for killing people here and there throughout the country.  So, in his speech, President Habyarimana mentioned -- I think it was the PL party, because at that time the minister of justice was PL -- from the PL party.  And people had been detained because they were suspected of having killed in Bugesera and Kibuye.  But in truth they'd concluded that it wasn't the Interahamwe.  In fact, at that time they said it wasn't the Interahamwe who had committed those massacres; that it was other people.  And the opposition parties were trying to conceal the true perpetrators, I said, so that we knew who the perpetrators were.  And the minister of justice knew well who the perpetrators of those massacres were, and they were not Interahamwe.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'm not quite clear about what you're saying with your last response.  Are you telling us how Habyarimana viewed the events in Bugesera, or are you telling us what you know about the events?  Who's point of view are you expressing when you say that the Interahamwe were not involved?  
A.	I am telling you what President Habyarimana said.  He said that investigations had concluded that it wasn't the Interahamwe who had killed people in Bugesera and Kibuye.  That's what he said at that rally.  
Q.	Do you have a basis to say whether that was true or not?  Would you know if the Interahamwe were involved in the killings in Bugesera? 
A.	I cannot say anything about the Bugesera.  All I know is Tutsi were killed, but I'm not in a position to identify the perpetrators.  What I can say is that -- what about Kibera (phonetic), Mukingo, (unintelligible) --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think he said.
  
THE WITNESS:
-- people were killed there.  And we knew who had killed people there, and the fact that he didn't mention those events in various places -- in the various places I've just named.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, when you say "we knew" who killed the people in Kibulira (phonetic) and in Mukingo, tell us what you mean?  Are you saying that you among the Interahamwe knew who killed?  And if you did, tell us, who did participate in those killings?  
A.	Well, the nearest example is the example of Mukingo, because Kajelijeli with Hasangineza from Mukamira camp abducted people and went and threw their corpses in (unintelligible), or they were taken to the camp and they never came out again.  This is something I can confirm, that people were arrested, we never saw them again.  It was public notoriety that the bourgmestre Gatete killed people.  Gatete was a member of the MRND, but the president did not mention the Gatete case.  

I can give you an example of the event that occurred the nearest, but there are other cases that were often mentioned on the radio.  I know the names of the Bagogwe that were abducted.  Kajelijeli abducted them openly, to everyone's knowledge, and among all the people that were taken away, we never saw anybody again.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Perhaps the witness could be invited to speak at a more moderate speed, sorry.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Getting back to the example -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, your testimony is being translated simultaneously, and the interpreters have requested that you speak a bit slower to facilitate the interpretation process.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, focusing on the events that you're most familiar with, in Mukingo and concerning the Bagogwe, you mentioned Kajelijeli abducting people.  Were the Interahamwe involved?  When you say that Kajelijeli abducted people, did he rely on you or anybody else in the Interahamwe to do these things? 
A.	Yes, he used people, including myself, but I can give you the names of people who were implicated in those acts.  
Q.	Please do so.  
A.	When Rudatinya -- when they came to arrest him, he'd been pointed out by an Interahamwe by the name of (unintelligible). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Sorry, I hope we got that right.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, for the record, Rudatinya is at number 75.  The other name I'm not familiar with.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you repeat the name of the Interahamwe for us again, please?  
A.	Pierre Bashiti (phonetic). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Pierre, which is Peter in French, Bashiti. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, in view of the fact that you knew what the Interahamwe were doing prior to November 1992, how did you interpret the things that President Habyarimana had to say about the Interahamwe? 
A.	That is not easy, but when I -- what I know is, when people under your orders commit misdeeds, you try to protect them.  All I can say is that whatever the Interahamwe did were things that had been prepared.  So, in respect of the Interahamwe and MRND, the acts perpetrated by the MR -- the Interahamwe was not seen as something reprehensible.  It was the other parties who interpreted them thus.  In other -- but, for the MRND, the Interahamwe's acts were not reprehensible.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you hear a speech, or hear about a speech made by another figure from the MRND, a Mr. Léon Mugesera, from around the same period? 
A.	No, I did not hear him make that speech, but it was later -- later I was told that he had made such a speech. 
Q.	Well, then coming back to President Habyarimana, and again I'm talking about the rally in November of 1992, did he say anything in particular in relation to the Arusha Accords? 
A.	I no longer recall. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, we're going to move forward, and I would like you to tell us about anything that you personally were involved in or observed, concerning the Bagogwe, towards the beginning of 1993, in Ruhengeri? 
A.	In the beginning of '93 in Ruhengeri, on the occasion of a meeting held at Nzirorera's house, we were called to his mother's house as usual, we were told that we should ensure security as usual, and we should seek out all the accomplices of the Inkotanyi, where they were.  And we were told that the Inkotanyi had -- were not staying with their arms crossed; although things had been relatively quiet, we should not let them let them invade our area.  And we were told that we should hunt down the members of other parties -- parties other than the MRND.  So, we were told that we should seek them everywhere, the people collaborating with the Inkotanyi, the Inkotanyi's accomplices.  And after that meeting, we attacked the Tutsi families that lived near Busogo parish, and we lynched them.  They had to leave their houses and seek refuge with the nuns. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when you say "we were told", can you tell us who was telling you?  Tell us who were giving you these instructions? 
A.	Nzirorera.  I thought I'd said that when I told you that it was he who chaired those meetings.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, excuse me, I think the witness should still slow down a bit, from what I hear from the Kinyarwanda booth.  

Sorry, Mr. Webster.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the interpreters would request that you still slow down a bit more.  You are still speaking too fast to facilitate accurate translation of what you are saying.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	With regard to the Bagogwe that were attacked in Mukingo, and here I'm going back to the response that you just gave us when you say that they ran from their homes.  Was anyone killed during that specific attack? 
A.	No, no one was killed during that attack.  We merely beat them, assaulted them, and they went to seek refuge with the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
It's not clear whether they were nuns, or -- 
THE WITNESS: 
-- but a few days after that incident, men such as Kabungo (phonetic) (unintelligible) and Kabagibu (phonetic) were arrested and taken to Mukingo communal office and handed over to Kajelijeli, and we never saw them again.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	What was it about these individuals that led you to characterise them as accomplices? 
A.	It was because they were Tutsi, and we were told that all Tutsi were Inkotanyi accomplices. 
Q.	Aside from Tutsi, were there other persons that were considered accomplices? 
A.	Yes, for example the Hutu who were members of opposition parties who were not members of the MRND, they were considered to be accomplices.  Also there were Hutu whose wives were Tutsi, or Tutsi whose wives were Hutu.  That category of persons was also considered to be accomplices. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did there come a time that the RPF again made an offensive -- a military offensive in the north of the country, and here I'm talking about 1993.  Do you recall any such incident? 
A.	Yes, I remember that in 1993, in February, the RPF attacked their -- they went as far as Rushashi near Kigali town. 
Q.	Do you know how long they remained at Rushashi?  Did they remain near to Kigali, or did there come a time that they retreated? 
A.	The RPF went back to its positions after agreement was reached between the Rwandan government and the RPF.  On the strength of those agreements, the RPF returned to the zone it occupied before that attack.  
Q.	Do you recall how long it was before that agreement was reached?  In other words, from the date of the attack until the agreement, would you have any idea how long that was? 
A.	I cannot tell you, but all I know is that at some point in time the RPF returned to the positions it occurred -- it occupied prior to that attack.  And that was done not because it was driven out of the area by the Rwandan army, but simply as a result of the negotiations. 
Q.	Thank you.  How did the local authorities in Mukingo respond to that attack?  Did they take any action following the attack in February of 1993? 
A.	Following the said attack, the leaders told us that Ruhengeri had been recaptured, that is, for the second time, and that it was by surprise.  They were therefore given to think that the region was full of accomplices, and again we were asked to go and flush out the RPF accomplices.  We therefore went to attack those Tutsis whom we had attacked the first time around and then they went seeking refuge at the gendarmerie camp.  
Q.	When you say those Tutsis that you had attacked before, can you be a bit more specific, please?  Tell us who you attacked?  
A.	These were ordinary Tutsi farmers who lived in Munyemvano complex, near the Busogo parish, in Rwinzovu secteur, in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	When you say that these people went to the gendarmerie, can you be a bit more detailed?  Did they leave the gendarmerie and go back?  Tell us what happened to them?  What did they do after this second series of attacks? 
A.	I did not say that they went to seek refuge at the gendarmerie.  I said that they went to ISAE, and that gendarmes were sent there to take care of their security.  Then I found out that they -- when it was found that they no longer had any problems and that calm had returned, they were requested to return to their homes, and they did.  
Q.	Do you recall if any meetings were organised by the communal authorities during that period?  
A.	After that attack meetings were organised, and the communal authorities, working with natives of Mukingo commune, organised a meeting at the Mukingo communal office, to which all parties were invited.  Following that group -- that meeting, a group of Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi was created, known as Virunga force, which underwent military training, and they were provided with equipment to protect the Mukingo area from the Inkotanyi, and to ensure that Ruhengeri will no longer be attacked.  And they were advised that if Ruhengeri were to be attacked and captured, it would mean that there were still several accomplices within the area.  So, the group known as Amahindure was charged with ensuring that Nkuli and Mukingo communes as a region together would be protected and would no longer come under attack.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  For the record Amahindure is number 1 on the list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like us to spend a little bit of time discussing the meeting itself.  With regard to this meeting, do you recall when it was held?  If you cannot give us a date, give us some indication of the period.  Use some sort of event to situate this particular meeting in time.  
A.	I do not remember the month, but it was in 1993, following the second attack on Ruhengeri on the 8th of February 1993. 
Q.	Who organised the meeting? 
A.	The meeting was organised by officials or authorities who were natives of that region, including Nzirorera, Kajelijeli, Alphonse Ntirivamunda, Setako, (unintelligible) Bizimungu, Jean Baptiste Nyabusore, Colonel Ntibitura, Préfet Nzabagerageza, Michel Bakuzakundi, and other figures of authority whose names I no longer recall.  You see, I cannot remember all of them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, two of the names that were mentioned are at number 66 and at number 72.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is it your evidence that all of these persons were in attendance at this meeting?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Who was invited to participate?  How were people invited to participate?  You mentioned the authorities, now I would like you to tell us who the audience -- or, who the other participants were? 
A.	The meeting was supposed to involve all members of the population. 
Q.	Would you be able to estimate how many people attended this meeting? 
A.	More than a thousand people.  
Q.	Where was the meeting actually held?  Where did the event take place? 
A.	The meeting took place at the Mukingo communal office, in the courtyard in front of that communal office. 
Q.	Can you tell us if anyone spoke to the crowd at that meeting? 
A.	Yes, some people spoke. 
Q.	Was Nzirorera one of the persons that addressed the meeting? 
A.	Yes, Nzirorera took the floor. 
Q.	Tell us what he said, to the best of your recollection? 
A.	He told us that we had been convened to that meeting to be told in what manner we should ensure security, because it had been observed that the Inkotanyi had captured the town twice already without any serious fighting having taken place.  He said that the Inkotanyi were able to capture that town so easily simply because there were many accomplices in Ruhengeri who made it possible for the Inkotanyi to infiltrate the city and introduce their military gear into the -- into town.  They therefore said -- he therefore said that they no longer wanted the Inkotanyi to capture Ruhengeri and go as far as Amahindo (phonetic) and Mukingo.  

He said they were going to create a group, or set up a group which would work in collaboration with the soldiers.  That group will be provided military training and equipped.  He told us that the equipment will be acquired, or purchased by the figures of authority who were present.  He went on to say that the group will be created and that he was ready to be part of the effort to acquire, or to purchase the equipment.  He asked us to collaborate with the others in order to unveil the accomplices of the Inkotanyi, as well as the Inkotanyi who were present in the region.  He told us that we would be receiving military equipment as time went on, and as the equipment will be purchased. 
Q.	How did the crowd respond to the things that Nzirorera was saying?  Could you tell from what people were saying, or commenting, or how they appeared to you, what type of -- the way that they received his message? 
A.	They agreed, because be it the Interahamwe or the Impuzamugambi of the CDR, they all took part in the training.  Nzirorera was a distinguished figure who enjoyed most -- much respect in Ruhengeri préfecture, particularly in our region.  So, nobody could refute, or deny, or reject his proposals.  That is why what he said was effectively heeded.  Most inhabitants of that region were either members of the MRND or the CDR, and they therefore could not reject what their leaders were telling them. 
Q.	Did anybody else address the crowd that day? 
A.	Colonel Bonaventure Ntibitura also spoke.  He spoke in his capacity as the person who would be in charge of civilian defence that would be set up in Ruhengeri préfecture.  He told us the cost of a firearm, he said it was very expensive, but that all the officials present had made up their minds to contribute towards the acquisition of the said material.  He said they were going to look for instructors who would provide training to the Amahindure Virunga force group.  He told us that the population should protect itself and face up to the Inkotanyi and their accomplices.  

He said that although the group had been set up in that locality, that would not be the only area, because similar groups will be set up across the country.  He said our area was going to be an example in that aspect, but that such groups -- similar groups would be set up across the country.  
Q.	Did any other military authorities speak during the course of that meeting?  
A.	I don't have a clear recollection of that.  Maybe I will recall some names subsequently, and if I do, I will of course mention them.  
Q.	Well, when we think about the area of Mukingo and Nkuli communes, and that particular region of Ruhengeri, can you tell us what military installations were in place by the time this meeting had occurred?  In other words, what military camps, or what positions of the government army had been established in your locality?  
A.	There was the Mukamira military camp in Nkuli commune.  There was also a military position in Mukingo commune on the Ruhehe colline, or hill.  That was opposite the Mukingo communal office.  There was also a military position, that is, at the border between Kimingo -- Mukingo and Kimede (phonetic) communes, and somewhat below the volcans. 
Q.	Was there any sort of military camp in Kigembe commune in Ruhengeri town?  
A.	Yes, there was the Amuguza (phonetic) camp.  There was also a gendarmerie camp, the Ruhengeri gendarmerie unit.  There was also the police academy, known as Gena (phonetic). 
Q.	Was Mukingo commune considered part of the front with the RPF? 
A.	I know that the RPF stopped at Kigombe commune during the fighting.  The town of Ruhengeri was captured twice by the RPF, but I never saw the RPF in Mukingo commune.  
Q.	In relation to the things that were said during this meeting, talking again about the meeting in front of the bureau communal, was training ever organised for the Amahindure as a result of this meeting, or after this meeting? 
A.	When the meeting took place, the preparations for the training had already been made.  At the meeting, we were told that Chief Warrant Karorero would be in charge of the training of the Amahindure, and that he would be working in collaboration with officials of the Amahindure Virunga force in Nkuli and Mukiro (phonetic) communes.  We were told that Karorero would be starting the training.  Arrangements had already been made for reserve officers to also be part of the training team.  A list of people had already been drawn up, that is, a list of people who would be trained.  
Q.	When did the training actually start? 
A.	The training proper began four days after the meeting.  The next day those who were to undergo the training showed up. 
Q.	How many people were there that showed up, to the extent that you can estimate?  
A.	On the first day, about 120 persons registered.  And I'm referring only to those in Mukingo commune.  Towards the end of the training, there were 300 to 400 persons involved.  
Q.	When you say 3- to 400 persons, are you talking about persons from Mukingo, or were they drawn from other communes as well? 
A.	I am referring exclusively to Mukingo commune, because what the authorities wanted to do was to set up a battalion which ordinarily is made up of 600 persons.  We were able to have between 3- to 400 persons registered, given that towards the end there would be another selection.  The same would apply for the Nkuli commune, where they were expected to create another battalion of 600 well-trained persons.  So, what was expected to happen was that some people will be dropped out in the course of the training, so that it would only be those who are well trained who would remain, and the expected number would have been 600.  
Q.	And when you say 600, am I to mean you understand 300 from Mukingo and 300 from Nkuli, or was it 600 from Mukingo?  Give us some sense of that, please.  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	What did you understand the relationship to be between the Interahamwe as an organisation and the Amahindure? 
A.	There was a relationship between them, because the Interahamwe, who were very powerful and strong, were recruited from among the Amahindure.  From within -- or, rather, were part of the Amahindure. 
Q.	Did the MRND party have a role to play in organising the Amahindure, or controlling the Amahindure?  
A.	Yes, the MRND party played a role in it.  Most of the founding members of Amahindure were MRND supporters.  Furthermore, members of the Amahindure were MRND supporters.  As a matter of fact, there was no distinction between the MRND and the CDR. 
Q.	Well, when you say there was no distinction, I think you're going to have to explain that a bit.  Weren't these two separate parties?  
A.	Yes, indeed, they were two distinct political parties, but I never saw the MRND in conflict with the CDR, and vice versa.  But I have seen them together, fighting against members of the other parties.  To my mind, this means that the MRND and the CDR were always together, and were involved in the same business. 
Q.	Did Kajelijeli have a role to play in the Amahindure?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What was that, please? 
A.	First of all, he is the one who convened the meeting for setting up of the Amahindure.  Furthermore, whenever he came to the training sessions, and we were drawing up lists, he would come to see us and visit with us during the training.  When a great number of Interahamwe had joined the Amahindure, the Interahamwe activities continued.  And he remained the mediator, or the link, between the Interahamwe and Nzirorera.  Because the Interahamwe continued to forward messages to Nzirorera through him.  
Q.	Well, what role could you discern between Nzirorera himself and the Amahindure?  
A.	Nzirorera was one of the brains behind Amahindure, as he put it in his own words, himself.  He told us.  We also want to note that many members of the Interahamwe became Amahindure, and he provided them about equipment.  And he admitted that himself.  
Q.	Well, when you say "he provided them with equipment", tell us what you mean by that.  Can you be more specific?  
A.	He gave them weapons and ammunition. 
Q.	Is this something that you saw yourself, or is this something that someone told you? 
A.	He said it himself.  By the way, after the training, some of the weapons were distributed, and some weapons were still being expected.  
Q.	Did you receive a weapon? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	From whom did you receive it? 
A.	I received a weapon from**************************************************************.  I collected that weapon from Nzirorera's mother's house.  
Q.	Did you see weapons distributed to any other members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, others received weapons as well.  I can mention Michel Niyigaba, who received a weapon from Dusabimana, at Nzirorera's mother's house.  Other persons who lived in Nzirorera's mother's house also received weapons, including François Dusabimana, Nzirorera's junior brother, and Michel Shizirungu (phonetic), as well as Noël.  Those were Nzirorera's nephews.  Kinamba as well, that is the driver of Nzirorera's junior brother.  Other Interahamwe as well received weapons from the military position on Ruhehe hill.  Other Interahamwe received weapons from the Mukamira military camp.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Is this something that you saw for yourself or was this something that was reported to you? 
A.	These are things that I am aware of and I know the persons who received the said weapons. 
Q.	What makes you say that the weapons came from Nzirorera? 
A.	First of all, he had made the promise that he would provide those weapons to us.  Secondly, some of the weapons were collected from his mother's home and my presumption is that it is not his mother who bought these weapons.  Those weapons came from the military camps.  Let me take the example of the weapons distributed which were provided by -- or, which were distributed at the Mukamira camp, came from soldiers.  

I believe that there must have been some agreement between the officials of the camp and Nzirorera. 
Q.	You were telling us about training.  Did you, yourself, participate in this training? 
A.	Yes.  I underwent the military training over a brief time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can close here, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the mid-afternoon recess now.
(Court recessed from 1533H to 1600H)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, when we left off you were about to tell us about the training -- the training of the Amahindure or the training of the Interahamwe.  So, going back to that point in your evidence, could you provide us with an account of how you underwent training and what you saw in relation to others? 
A.	The day after the meeting, we began drawing up the list of those to undergo training.  And four days after, the training began with physical exercise, running, handling of weapons, how to mount and dismount a weapon, how to load a weapon and how to shoot.  We were taught how to hide and a number of military techniques as well.  At the end, weapons were distributed to us.  Part of the training was conducted at the Mukingo communal office field, and part of the training was conducted on the Ruhehe Hill, where we were taught how to shoot. 
Q.	Do you know if any training was actually conducted on the premises of one of the military camps? 
A.	The people from Nkuli underwent their training in Nkuli communal office.  And after selection, others went for training at Mukamira camp, military camp. 
Q.	Would you have any idea of the numbers of persons who were actually trained at Mukamira camp? 
A.	In any case, after selection more than 300 people went to Mukamira to continue the training. 
Q.	Were you among them? 
A.	No.  I was trained at Nkuli commune.  I am a native of Mukingo and I was trained at Nkuli since I came from Nkuli.  So I couldn't go to Mukamira camp because I was --I did not come from Nkuli.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry, that is exactly what I heard, so. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Maybe, Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you to clarify a portion of your last response.  

You were asked if you underwent any of the training at Mukamira camp and you began to explain that.  And I believe your explanation was that only the persons from Nkuli commune went to Mukamira camp for training, you can either correct that if I'm wrong or tell me if that's correct. 
A.	Yes, you are correct.  

People from Mukingo were trained at Nkuli communal office, whereas people from Nkuli who went to Mukamira camp for their training.
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I heard in English is that people from Mukingo were trained at Nkuli.  Now, it doesn't seem to be consistent with what the witness was saying before.  So, is that a translation issue or a --
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you comment again, please? 
A.	Yes, it is a mistake.  I didn't say that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Oh, I don't know.  It's what we heard from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Well, tell us again, please, people from Mukingo were trained where? 
A.	People from Mukingo were trained on the grounds of Mukingo communal office, just as in the quarry were -- on Ruhehe Hill they dug for precious stones -- whereas people from Nkuli were trained at Mukamira military camp.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And just for -- to clarify once more, my understanding -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And another group was trained at Nkuli communal office, adds the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	So the persons from Mukingo were trained in front of the bureau communal or across at Ruhehe hill; was that your evidence? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you recall how long your training lasted?  Do you have an estimate of the period of time? 
A.	Three to four months. 
Q.	During this period of time, was Joseph Nzirorera still coming up to Mukingo on the weekends? 
A.	He never stopped coming.  He continued to come. 
Q.	Did the meetings at his mother's house in Mukingo continue during this period? 
A.	Also those meetings continued. 
Q.	Do you recall any conversations with Joseph Nzirorera, himself, during that period where you discussed the training that was going on? 
A.	We discussed the training at its conclusion, but during the training there was a meeting and we were able to discuss matters with him. 
Q.	Do you recall anything he said at that time? 
A.	When he finished talking with the authorities, he stayed with Kajelijeli and other authorities from the region, and they called us, so we went inside into the living room, and he asked us if there were any accomplices.  And then he told us that we should seek out the accomplices and give the list to Kajelijeli.  So the president of the Interahamwe said there was a problem with one Makoni.  And then Nzirorera said that, "We should kill that Makoni" because it had been discovered that he collaborated with the Inkotanyi. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Cooperated.  Cooperated with the Inkotanyi.  
THE WITNESS:
And after having told us that we went home and we tried, for our part, to go to Makoni to get him, but as he knew that he was being sought, he had also purchased a firearm so we thought that it would be more prudent not to go to his house to confront him as he had a firearm.  And matters calmed down for a while, and then later on during the genocide, Makoni was killed.  He was killed during the genocide by a captain who was his neighbour. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you know Makoni's ethnicity? 
A.	He was Hutu. 
Q.	Why was he considered an accomplice? 
A.	It was someone who had gotten rich very quickly.  He had a drinking place, and perhaps people considered that he had too much money compared to someone who runs a drinking place.  Moreover, there was a telephone, although he lived in the countryside, so people began to think that he was a collaborator with the Inkotanyi and that is why the decision was taken to eliminate him.  But we did not kill him as I have told you.  He was killed during the war.  
Q.	Going back to the meeting that you described or the incident where Nzirorera was speaking to you about Makoni, you mentioned authorities being present, can you tell us who those authorities were, please? 
A.	Well, there was Kajelijeli, Nyabusore, Baheza, those are the only ones I recall.  
Q.	And when you mentioned "we", referring to yourself and others going into the house, can you tell us who those persons were in addition to yourself? 
A.	************************************************************************************************* ********************************** (phonetic).  
Q.	Would you describe all of these persons as belonging to the MRND political party? 
A.	Yes.  All belonged to the MRND. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness has a tendency to accelerate again, especially when he's giving the names.  I hope they all came across all right. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	And with respect to the authorities that you mentioned, did they all belong to the MRND party? 
A.	Yes, all belonged to the MRND. 
Q.	During this same period, were there meetings held at the Isimbi house?  
A.	No.  Nzirorera never hosted a meeting at Isimbi.  It was always at his mother's house, his mama's house. 
Q.	Were there ever occasions where Nzirorera hosted a meeting at his own house?  You had mentioned that he had two places where he resided; his mother's house and then another house that belonged to him by himself.  Do you recall any meetings that involved the Interahamwe at Nzirorera's own house? 
A.	I'm aware of the meeting in the course of which we received Interahamwe uniforms.  That is the first time I went to his house.  I don't know if he held other meetings at that house, but the meetings I am aware of were the ones held at his mother's house. 
Q.	And the meeting where you received an Interahamwe uniform, is this the meeting in August of 1992 that you had described earlier? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Based on your experience, did the Amahindure have any particular command structure that distinguished it from the Interahamwe or was it really one and the same?  I'm trying to understand if there was really any difference between the Interahamwe and the Amahindure. 
A.	Yes, Amahindure had organs (as translated); that is all.  That -- that's all, sorry. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let me put the question to you again.  You described a committee in relation to the Interahamwe, and you had given us at least four names in regard to that committee; Michel Niyigaba, Noeli Ndayisaba and one or two other names.  I think you know the names that you provided previously.  What I am trying to understand, now, is with respect to the Amahindure, were those same individuals leaders of the Amahindure or was there a separate set of leaders? 
A.	This was the situation:  The Amahindure from Mukingo and Nkuli were led by Sergeant Major Karorero.  He had an assistant, a deputy; one in Mukingo and one in Nkuli.  At Mukingo, there was François Dusabimana.  In Mukingo, his deputy was Sergeant Dusabimana -- François, Dusabimana.  Dusabimana.  He also had a committee, a committee of the Interahamwe of which I have spoken to you, and also in Nkuli.  I do not know the names of the leaders in Nkuli.  So there was Sergeant Major Karorero who had a deputy, Sergeant François Dusabimana in Mukingo and François also had a committee of Interahamwe who worked with him.  And there was another deputy assistant in Nkuli who also had a committee in Nkuli. 
Q.	Did those persons, the persons that you describe having some sort of authority in the Amahindure, were they members of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  I confirm that all those leaders who played an important part -- an important role in the Amahindure, were MRND members -- party members. 
Q.	You described the president of the MRND at the level of Mukingo commune.  I believe that was Nyabusore.  Did he have any special relationship to the Amahindure? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, before the question is answered, I think it is actually Mr. Niyoyita, so it might cause some confusion. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Mr. Niyoyita? 
A.	Yes, since he was MRND president in Mukingo commune, he was responsible for all party members in Mukingo, including Interahamwe.
Q.	Concerning the training that you received when the Amahindure was introduced, did it also include any sort of instruction on who the enemy was?
A.	That was known -- that was already known.  The important thing was to identify the enemy -- the people had to fight the enemy and we knew who the enemy was.  Moreover, in the course of the training, we were told how to conduct ourselves when the enemy showed itself in one way or another.  The enemy was the RPF and the RPF's accomplices.  
Q.	Well, how were you told that you should conduct yourself towards the RPF's accomplices? 
A.	The essential thing was to execute the orders we were given, as there were accomplices in our area, we had to confront the accomplices.  When we were asked to kill them we implemented the instructions. 
Q.	Did you take any decisions on your own, with respect to how you would confront the enemy or were your actions governed by what you were instructed to do by others? 
A.	We were under the control of others.  We never acted on our own initiatives.  We only fulfilled the orders that were given to us.  
Q.	Well, with respect to Vincent Mukingo, who did you consider the most senior authority who was at the top of the pyramid? 
A.	Among the civilian and military authorities, I would say that it was Nzirorera who had the most influence.  No one could oppose any order emanating from him.  He was highly respected by the authorities, and by the population in general.  Consequently, he was the most influential in that location. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what leads you to say that?  Can you give us an example or tell us what you are basing that statement on?  How -- what makes you think that Nzirorera was the most powerful authority? 
A.	Well, first of all, he was a minister and he'd been a minister for a long time.  And at that time, he had been able to find work for many people.  Secondly, he had been a member of parliament, secretary general of the MRND party which was a very strong party.  So, he was very rich, succinctly.  He could -- this is an anecdote, but he could stop a truck and give beer to everyone around. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to move on and ask you to direct your attention to the events of 1994.  First of all, if you think of the first half of the year from January to April, do you recall if Joseph Nzirorera continued to come up or to be present in Mukingo commune on the weekends, as you have suggested for the earlier period?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did the gatherings at his mother's house in Busogo continue during that period; this is 1994? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you have any specific recollections of either conversations or events in Mukingo in 1994, during this period, where Joseph Nzirorera is involved? 
A.	Nothing special was done.  We were asked to continue ensuring security and each time he went there we would have to meet him.  That is why I say, that is how I can assert that he continued coming all the time.  Otherwise, no special event occurred at that time. 
Q.	I'd like to direct your attention to the 6th of April 1994, did there come a time that you learned of the death of the president? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Tell us how you came to learn about that? 
A.	We heard the news of his death over the radio:  There was classical music, and at one point a communiqué was read and announced that the president had been killed in an accident and that another president was -- or president was also killed.  That is how I learnt of the news of -- heard the news of his death. 
Q.	Do you recall whether it was in the morning or at night.  Tell us when it was that you heard this news? 
A.	It was between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m., I don't remember the exact time. 
Q.	Tell us what you did later that morning? 
A.	I got up very early and I went to the ************market and took some tea, drank some tea in the restaurant.  It ******************take some tea in that eating place.  And a few minutes after I arrived there and after we had drunk our tea -- our cup of tea, we exited and were standing outside the restaurant.  We were wondering what -- how the president had died.  At that moment, Sergeant François Dusabimana and Michel arrived.  They had spent the night at a drinking place and had not heard the news.  And they asked us whether we knew what had happened, but before they arrived we saw Kajelijeli's vehicle, and Baheza's vehicle, and Nyabusore's vehicle.  We saw them passing, going to Nzirorera's mother's house.  After they had passed, Dusabimana arrived, came there.  And immediately afterwards, a child came to call them, because they wanted them to go to Nzirorera's mother's house and when they arrived at that place, I, myself, went there.  I saw Nyabusore and Kajelijeli in conversation, and when I saw that nothing particular was being said, I returned to ***** markets and Dusabimana arrived with Michel.  We were standing in front of the restaurant and they said, "Habyarimana is dead, let us go and kill the Tutsi."  He ordered Michel Niyigaba to go and get Rukara, so an example could be given in dealing with Rukara's person.  Michel went to get Rukara, and Rukara was killed publicly and that was the signal for the massacre to begin. 
Q.	You mentioned the name of Michel several times.  Are you referring to Michel Niyigaba? 
A.	Yes, that is he. 
Q.	You also mentioned going over to the house of Nzirorera's mother.  Did you enter the compound at that time? 
A.	Yes, I went into the compound and I saw Kajelijeli, Nyabusore and Baheza, and they were talking there but I left that place quite quickly. 
Q.	And in your previous response, you suggested that nothing in particular was being said.  Would you go back to that and clarify please, because it seems odd that the day the president has been killed that no one would have anything to say?
A.	I said when I arrived at Nzirorera's mother's residence those people were talking, but they did not say anything to us and so I went back to********.  That is what I stated. 
Q.	When you say "us", "they said nothing to us", who was with you at that point? 
A.	Niyigaba, Michel -- Michel Niyigaba, and François Dusabimana. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That's it, thank you.  Sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Further on in your response you mentioned a certain Rukara, which is No. 78 on our list.  Who was Rukara? 
A.	He was a Tutsi who lived at Byangabo trading centre.  He was someone who manufactured bricks, cement bricks.  I have nothing else, particularly, to say about that Rukara.  
Q.	Why was he killed on that morning?  
A.	Because Sergeant François Dusabimana asked that he be fetched.  He lived nearby and he said, "Let's bring Rukara and start with him."  He was a Tutsi and the example had to be given.  And as Rukara was in the vicinity, he was brought there and killed. 
Q.	Do you know if Rukara had any dealings with the RPF? 
A.	The only connection between him and the RPF was that he was Tutsi.  As to the rest of it, I never saw him bearing a firearm or doing anything.  All I know is that the only possible connection with the RPF is that he was Tutsi. 
Q.	How many people had gathered at the time that Rukara was killed?  In other words, was there a crowd that had gathered by that time? 
A.	Yes.  A huge crowd had gathered, including persons living in Byangabo.  Conseiller Ndisetse was present as well. 
Q.	Was Conseiller Ndisetse a member of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  He was an influential -- very influential member of the MRND. 
Q.	For the record, he appears at 61 on our list.  Well, Mr.  Witness, this is the first time you mentioned Ndisetse.  What role did he play, if any, in forming the Interahamwe in Mukongo or in Busogo?  
A.	I don't know any particular role that he may have played in that connection, but I know that he was among the supporters of the Interahamwe.  When the Interahamwe were being presented he was present as the member of the MRND supporting the -- or, the Interahamwe and he was expected to facilitate their activities. 
Q.	And when you say "the Interahamwe were being presented", give us a time frame for that, please, in relation to your last response. 
A.	The time frame is 1991, after the meeting with Kajelijeli; after that meeting with the youth wing of the MRND members of that group were introduced to Nzirorera and Ndisetse was present at that occasion. 
Q.	Thank you.  

Right, returning to back to the 7th of April now.  How many people did you estimate being present when Rukara was killed? 
A.	More than 200 persons at the market square when he was snatched from his home.  A significant portion of the population gathered to see what was happening, so it was a huge crowd.  
Q.	The persons that snatched him and attacked him, would you describe him (sic) as members of the populace or were these Interahamwe that was doing this? 
A.	It is the president of the Interahamwe who went to fetch him and his name is Niyigaba, Michel.  When he brought him he didn't kill him alone, he was struck with an axe and then several other Interahamwe attacked him including Semanza and others.

1645H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	After Rukara was killed, what is the next thing that happened that morning that you were able to observe?
A.	After Rukara was killed, Dusabe said the following:  "All of you here present, come, let us go kill the Tutsi."  Anybody who would remain on site will be sanctioned, so everybody had to go.  They then moved to Rukara's home and killed his senior brother whose name was Rudasingwa, Lucien.  After killing Lucien, the group then split into two.  The first half went towards Muhinda while the second half went towards Samvura's.  And there were a significant number of Tutsis living in that neighbourhood and all the Tutsis were killed.  Thereafter, the assailants went up to the Busogo secteural office in Mumabanga area.  And other Tutsis living in that area were killed.  Then the killers went on to the Busogo parish where Tutsi had sought refuge at the convent in the Busogo parish.  When we got to the location, we found government soldiers on the site.  They were in uniform and they were from the Mukamira military camp.  We encircled the convent and the Tutsi within the convent were killed.  After having killed those people, then we took possession of the vehicles belonging to the priests and other project vehicles used in the area, then we took those to Byangabo.  Once in Byangabo, the assailants rested.  They went to bars or to restaurants.  And then the search for Tutsis continued thereafter, here and there.  At about 17 hours 30, 5:30 -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've said quite a bit.  We're going to go over that information in smaller bits.  So we can pause here for a moment and go back over some of what you have said.  Now, you've mentioned the presence of Kajelijeli outside Nzirorera's mother's house.  Did you see or interact with Kajelijeli, or did he make his presence known anywhere else in the vicinity that morning while the attacks were going on or before the attacks started?
A.	Following Rukara's death, when we were on the way to Busogo, Kajelijeli was in front of his bar.  We saw him arrive in his vehicle.  After Rukara was killed, we saw him head for his bar.  And when Rudasingwa was being killed, he was part of the group that was in the surroundings.  
Q.	Based on what you saw and heard and observed in relation to Kajelijeli, was he encouraging the killing;, was he disinterested, was he discouraging the killing?  I'd like to understand what his role is or was in relation to those events that morning.
A.	At that time, he spoke to the inhabitants and said, "The father of the nation has been killed, so the Tutsis must be killed as well."  I heard him say that myself.  But I went along with the assailants.  He is someone who supported the killings and encouraged the killings.  I was going -- I was about to talk about another location where he took the floor and encouraged the killers in the statements he made.  In a nutshell, one can say that he was in support of the killings.  
Q.	Concerning the attack against Rukara's brother, was that something that was done by the local population or was that Interahamwe that were attacking him?
A.	It is the Interahamwe who had attacked that individual.  Sibomana and Dusabimana, François, are those who killed him and they were both Interahamwe. 
Q.	What about the attacks against the Samvura family.  And you mentioned another family as well, or another location beginning with an M.  Concerning each of those two other attacks, can you tell, us based on your own observation, whether it was the local population, Interahamwe, or a combination of the two?
A.	Those who attacked were the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi of the CDR.  After killing, the Interahamwe would leave and then the population would then plunder the property.  That is the role the population at large played.  
Q.	You mention the presence of soldiers near the Busogo parish church.  What were they doing there?  What was their role?
A.	The soldiers had come to help the Interahamwe kill the Tutsi.  
Q.	Did you recognise any military authorities among the soldiers; in other words, were there any officers present? 
A.	I did not see any officer there.  
Q.	Do you know a Corporal Rachel?
A.	Yes, I know Corporal Rachel, son of Bunuma.  His father's name was Bunuma.  He hailed from Nyabirehe in Mukingo commune.  At the time, he was a teacher -- or, rather, a military instructor at the Bigogwe training camp.  
Q.	Did he have any role to play in the events of that morning, the 7th of April?
A.	Corporal Rachel met us at the location where we were attacking Samvura's family.  He helped the Interahamwe to kill Tutsis at that location.  He also gave orders to Mwambutsa, Théoneste, to burn down all the houses in that area.  And there were Tutsi children within those houses.  He had ordered that the fires -- that fire be set to those houses.  Then, with Corporel Rachel, we went up to Busogo parish where the Tutsi had sought refuge and where they were killed.  Corporal Rachel began by asking one of the sisters why the Tutsi had sought refuge in their parish, and before any answer could come from the sister, he ordered Iyamuremye to break the door.  And once the door was broken, grenades were tossed into that building and those in the building were killed.  
Q.	Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, one of the names mentioned is at number 59 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you mentioned Remye (phonetic).  Are you referring to Rugamiri (phonetic), or is it another name?  Could you repeat that second name for us, please.  The person that tossed the -- 
A.	Iyamuremye.
Q.	Iyamuremye.  Sorry, thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That would be number 37 on our list. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know if there had been any communication with Joseph Nzirorera that morning, the morning of the 7th of April, between the authorities in Mukingo and Mr. Nzirorera himself?
A.	What I know is what Michel Niyigaba, president of the Interahamwe, told me because he said that they had received orders, and every indication -- that discussions had taken place with Nzirorera.  So the orders that came to us came after discussions with Nzirorera, and that is what Michel told me personally.  
Q.	When did Michel Niyigaba tell you this?
A.	He told me that after Lucien's death.  When we were going towards the Samvura family, I asked him whether there would be no problem, and he told me that he had received orders from Kajelijeli who had had a meeting with Nyabusore and Nzirorera.  And so he said he had had discussions with those people and that we should not fear anything befalling us.  
Q.	Well, since that conversation, or since that -- those words were uttered on the 7th of April, has anything transpired, or has anything -- have you learnt anything subsequently that would cause you to doubt the accuracy of that statement?
A.	No, I haven't heard anything else because after the killings no one bothered us.  It is only after the Inkotanyi took power that we got into trouble, but before then no authority questioned our actions.  
Q.	Do you know of any other communication between Michel Niyigaba and Joseph Nzirorera during the course of April 7th?  So I am moving away from what Michel said in the morning.  Were there any other communications that you're aware of?
A.	Michel told me that he had talked with Nzirorera on the phone and that Nzirorera had told him that there was no problem, that they should go on and kill everybody, kill all Tutsi.  He said that all Tutsi had to be killed without any distinction.  He said that Ingabire had to be killed, because -- the question had been put to Nzirorera whether Ingabire should be killed because Ingabire was related to Nzirorera.  And Michel told me this. 
Q.	Do you recall when it was and where it was that Michel Niyigaba said these things to you?
A.	It was around 1 p.m. when he told me and, at that time, we were on the road that goes down from Busogo parish. 
Q.	Did he explain how it was that he was able to speak to Nzirorera?
A.	He simply told me that he had had a telephone conversation with him and I didn't ask for any further explanations because I believe that what he said was the truth, so I didn't seek to find out any more on that issue.  
Q.	In reference to Ingabire -- which is number 32 on our spelling list -- explain how this person was perceived to be related to Nzirorera.  
A.	Nzirorera's wife was a Tutsi.  She -- he had a daughter with this wife whose name was Nyirabidabari.  His wife also had another child whose name was Ingabire.  Most people knew that those two children were Nzirorera's children.  
Q.	Well, when you say he had a wife, is this the woman that he was actually legally married to, or did they -- are you simply referring to the way that they related to each other, to the extent that you know?
A.	Nzirorera's legal wife was not that woman, she was some sort of a concubine.  Nzirorera's legal wife was known as Anatolie.  
Q.	Well, with respect to this woman, who was the mother of Ingabire, clarify for us whether Ingabire himself was the son of Nzirorera, to the extent that you know or to the extent that it was repeated or discussed in Mukingo, because it is still not clear for me.  The relationship between Ingabire, this woman that you describe as the wife of Nzirorera and the other child of this woman who you mentioned was a daughter or a woman.
A.	One thing is certain, I know very well that Nyirabidabari's daughter was Nzirorera's daughter, but as far as Ingabire goes, I do not know who his father was, but he was considered to be Nzirorera's son.  So because Nzirorera was a highly respected person, nobody could dare to go after his wife, so all I know is that Ingabire was Nzirorera's son because his mother was Césarie Kiberwa who was Nzirorera's woman.  
Q.	Were you present when Ingabire was killed?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Who killed him?
A.	He was killed by one Kinamba and Noel, Nzirorera's nephew, as well as one Morombo (phonetic).  Kinamba was the driver and there was also one Dusabe who was a younger brother to Nzirorera, but --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is going too fast again.  I think that should be repeated.  Excuse me.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think we're going to have to slow the pace of your responses because the interpreters are experiencing a bit of difficulty.  So if you could just speak a little bit more slowly.  

But, aside from that, in your last response you mentioned the name Dusabe.  And on several occasions it seems to me that you've used the word "Dusabe" and "Dusabimana" interchangebly because you've referred to the both of them as the younger brother of Nzirorera.  So clarify that for us for the record, please.  Are you referring to the same individual when you use the names "Dusabe" and "Dusabimana"?
A.	Yes, it is one and the same.  In fact, we used to call him Dusabe, but his real name was François Dusabimana. 
Q.	Were the persons that attacked and killed Ingabire members of the Interahamwe or were there others?
A.	They were Interahamwe. 
Q.	You mentioned an attack on the parish church.  Which came first in time, the killing of Ingabire or the attack on the church?
A.	Ingabire was killed before the attack at the parish.  
Q.	Were there any other areas or families that were attacked after the attack on the church?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Tell us where and who, please.
A.	After the attack at Busogo, we attacked Nkuli commune, Musumba secteur.  There were Tutsi who had to be killed.  It was planned.  
Q.	Was there an attack on the Munyemvano family?
A.	Most Munyemvano were -- members of that family were killed at the time of the attack on the convent -- the nuns' convent.  I must say that when we were at the convent, some of us went to fetch Gateyiteyi who had not hidden at the nuns, he had hidden at a neighbours near Munyemvano. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when you say "we attacked", can you give us some idea of the numbers of people that attacked, and can you distinguish for us whether the attackers were Interahamwe or whether they were the local population so that we clearly understand what the role of the Interahamwe was in these events?  
A.	The assailants were Interahamwe and soldiers.  As to the members of the population, the local inhabitants, I told you that after the attacks the local inhabitants would loot the property of the Tutsi who had just been killed.  
Q.	Well, as to the numbers -- to the extent that you can estimate, I realise that you weren't doing a head count, but if you can estimate how many Interahamwe attacked the parish church, for example?
A.	There were approximately 300.  
Q.	Were these the same people that you had trained with when you were undergoing military training in front of the bureau communal.  Are we talking about the same groups of people?
A.	Most of the people with whom I had undergone military training participated in those attacks.  
Q.	What were the weapons that were used?  Were there firearms used or were there other weapons that were used during the attacks?
A.	There were rifles, clubs, sometimes people just used stones or had spears, and there was grenades.  Sometimes we would even burn down houses.  
Q.	Where did the grenades come from?
A.	We received them from the soldiers.  
Q.	Are you able to estimate how many soldiers were active in those attacks on the morning of the 7th of April to the extent that you can estimate?
A.	There was between 15 to 20 soldiers.  
Q.	Based on your observation, were the persons that were killed in anyway linked to the RPF?
A.	Well, it was said that all the Tutsis supported the RPF or were their accomplices.  But, as far as I know, there were no relations between those Tutsi and the RPF.  They were simply targeted because they were Tutsi.  
Q.	Were Tutsi women attacked in particular; in other words, were there attacks of a sexual nature against Tutsi women that you could observe on that day?  We're still talking about the 7th of April.
A.	Yes, there was.
Q.	Can you describe the incidents that you yourself observed?
A.	But before going there, I would like to ask whether I'm allowed to start citing the names of people who were the subject of such acts in public, whether I can publicly state -- give the names of the people who were subjected to such attacks?  
Q.	Perhaps the best solution would be to ask you to describe the attacks and then we'll write -- we'll ask you to write the names of the persons on a separate piece of paper and number them.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps the registry could be of some assistance; if the witness could be provided with a pen and a sheet of paper. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you -- I'm going to ask you to tell us what you observed.  And when you get to the point where you're going to provide the name of the victim, tell us and we will give that person a number and you can write that name down next to the number.
A.	The person who is number 1 on the list was raped and then killed.  A piece of wood was thrust into her vagina, into her private parts. 
Q.	Can you tell us if you were present when this transpired?
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness thereto.  
Q.	Can you tell us who the perpetrators were?  Did you recognise the perpetrators?
A.	Yes, it was Nteziyaremye, commonly known as Rugumire; Gatama; Mbonankira, generally called caporal -- Corporal -- caporal.
MR. WEBSTER:
The first name that was mentioned was number 76; then number 22 on our list and -- 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, you were about to give us -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, and number 47 on our list.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So you've mentioned three individuals.  How many other individuals were involved?
A.	It is those three in respect of the first victim that I saw.  I saw one was on top of the victim and the others were right beside them.  
Q.	Were these individuals members of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you see them at the meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house during the period leading up to the events of April 1994?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were any of those three individuals also participants in the military training that was provided in 1993?
A.	Yes, all three of them.  
Q.	Had you ever seen Joseph Nzirorera interacting with these individuals personally, in other words, talking to them or speaking with them, buying them beer or anything of that nature?  You be the one to describe if there was any sort of interaction -- personal interaction between any of these individuals and Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	No. 
Q.	The woman that was killed, what was her -- excuse me.  The woman that was raped, what was her ethnicity? 
A.	She was Tutsi.  And it wasn't a woman, it was a young girl.  She wasn't yet old enough to get married.  
Q.	Around how old was she?
A.	I'd say 15 to 16.  
Q.	Was this incident ever discussed among the Interahamwe afterwards?
A.	Yes, they discussed it. 
Q.	In what way?  What did they say about it?
A.	They were boasting saying, "Before killing so-and-so, first I raped her."  They thought it was something to be -- to boast about.  
Q.	Where did this boasting take place?  Do you recall the place and the time?
A.	Do you want to know what they said?  I'm afraid I didn't understand your question exactly. 
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Witness.  My question was actually:  When did this boasting take place?  I'm trying to understand if this was something that was discussed on the 7th of April when the incident took place, or if it was something that was discussed subsequently, in other words, on another day?
A.	On the 7th and the 8th and in the course of the days that followed, in fact, people would say how they killed people, how they'd flush them out from where they were hiding and there were people who had been raped.  When everywhere here and there whenever Interahamwe met in one drinking place or another they spoke of what they had done.  They were not ashamed because the one who had killed the most people or flushed out the most people considered himself to be someone to have helped the state to achieve something.  
Q.	Well, in relation to the boasting that you've described about the rape of this young girl, do you recall if any authorities were present along with you to overhear the boasting of the perpetrators, to the extent that you remember?  
A.	Well, the example that springs to mind is that we were in the habit -- a drinking place that belonged to Kajelijeli and another that belonged to Jerome, and we'd speak of that -- boast of that.  Kajelijeli and the other authorities were present.  So there was -- people were not ashamed to talk about it and they did nothing.  
Q.	Well, I thank you for your response, Mr. Witness.  We know from your previous testimony who Kajelijeli was.  You mentioned another name, Jerome.  I'm not familiar with that name.  Tell us who that person was.
A.	Jerome was an ordinary citizen.  He had no particular role to play, but he had a drinking place.  And when we didn't go to Kajelijeli's drinking place, we went to Jerome's drinking place.  And that's all I have to say about him.  
Q.	One last question before we end for the afternoon:  You mentioned Kajelijeli and other authorities, but it is not clear to me who these other authorities are.  So in terms of the presence of authorities during this boasting session, give us some of the names of other persons that you remember being present.  If you don't remember anyone, you can say so, but if you do, please tell us who they were.
A.	Kajelijeli, Jean Damascene Niyoyita, Samahane, who was the bourgmestre's assistant and later occupied the post of bourgmestre for a certain -- for a time, and others.  I cannot remember the names of all the authorities that were present.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I've concluded for the day, Your Honour.  I can pick up on Monday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Okay.

Witness, we'll take the adjournment for today.  We resume tomorrow morning -- sorry, yes, we do not sit in this case tomorrow morning.  Your testimony will continue on Monday.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  There's other uses going to be put of the Court's space sometime tomorrow morning.  I remind you, I already told you at midday that during this or any other adjournment you're not to discuss this case or your testimony with anybody at all.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I can make one parting comment:  I think I will finish my direct by Monday afternoon before lunch, so what I plan to do on Monday morning is to introduce a series of exhibits and then complete the narrative, but I don't think I'll go beyond the end of the morning session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that.  

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President, I had risen before when Mr. Webster started just after the break.  I wanted to apologise for the absence of Counsel Hounkpatin who had to leave for the second part of the afternoon.  I wish to, therefore, present her apologies to the Trial Chamber.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I had not noticed your attempt earlier, but thank you for mentioning that now.  

Okay.  We take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1736H)
