P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 25th of January 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Witness, we thank you for coming to give evidence at the Tribunal.  The first thing that will happen as part of your testimony is that the registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth during your testimony.
(Declaration made by Witness 7/14 in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by answering questions put to you by the lawyers appointed for that purpose.  I think that your testimony will be given in two phases.  The first part will be conducted now, when the lawyer for the Accused will question you, and then we will have an adjournment, and you'll be notified of a date to return when the lawyer for the Prosecutor will question you.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What language do you intend to give your evidence in?  
THE WITNESS:
My native language.  That is Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an interpreter here which will permit you to do that.  Mr. Hooper will commence his examination of you.  

Mr. Hooper?  
WITNESS 7/14,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you give your full name, please?  
MS. FALL:
I think we are in open session, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, can you give your full name, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, did you understand the significance?  This is a protected witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
He has no objection to his -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  
MR. HOOPER:
-- to his evidence being in open session.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I better explain, Mr. Witness, just in case I have misunderstood.  I understand you're content to have your evidence in open session.  You are, if you wish, able to have matters -- some matters dealt with in closed session, in secret, but I understand from our previous discussions that you're content to have your evidence in open session, just speaking in this way.  Is that right?  
A.	I have no objection.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to know for the record what the status of this witness is.  Is he a protected witness or not?  If he says he's no longer a protected witness, we shall take account of it.  We were informed that this was a protected witness.  If his status has changed in the meantime, we'd be very glad to know exactly what state he is now.  

MR. HOOPER:
As a protected witness, my understanding is, he's in a position to deal with his evidence in the manner that he wishes.  The only matter that I understand he'd wish to speak about, if it's approached at all, in closed session, would be any activities relating to the RPF.  But the rest of his evidence, I understand, he's content to speak frankly and openly, including his personal details.  And on that basis, I'll proceed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that right, Mr. Witness, what I've just said and which I hope has been translated to you?  
A.	Yes, that's right.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  So what is your full name, please?  
A.	My name is (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  
Q.	And were you born in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)?  

There may be a problem in the booth, Mr. Witness -- or you're not hearing me.  
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me, interpreters, is there a problem?   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness indicates that he cannot hear Kinyarwanda.  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear the Kinyarwanda booth now.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  So, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), I was just asking you, is it correct that you were born in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Were you born and brought up (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) in Rwanda?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	In that year, did something happen that caused your family to leave Rwanda in order to go and settle in Burundi?  And if so, what was it?  
A.	The events of 1959, 1960 occurred, and these events are well known.  
Q.	And did that concern persecution of Tutsis within Rwanda causing many to leave for neighbouring and other countries?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And are you, in fact, a Tutsi from a Tutsi family?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did your family settle in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) in Burundi, and were you educated in that country?  
A.	I went to secondary school in Burundi in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), but my family lived in the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) refugee camp, but I lived in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), and that is where I attended secondary school.  
Q.	Can you spell (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) for us, please, so we have an accurate spelling for the record?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) 
Q.	Thank you very much for helping us with that.  And after secondary education, what did you study after that and where?  
A.	I was in Kinshasa, and I spent two years there in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  
Q.	And what were you studying there?  
A.	So this was an applied technical institute, and I learned ****************** there.  
Q.	And thereafter, between then and 1994, just briefly, where did you live, and what occupation did you pursue in those years?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)  
Q.	And so we can -- would we be right in saying that from the time you left as a young boy, in 1959 or '60, until 1994, you did not live in Rwanda at all; is that correct?  
A.	That is true, I never did return to Rwanda during that time.  
Q.	May I ask, if it's not impertinent, how many times have you been married, and how many children do you have?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) 
Q.	And what is your wife's name?  
A.	My wife is called -- is called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  
Q.	I wonder I think we could -- could you help us with the spelling of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) family name?  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)  
Q.	Now, in April of 1994, where were you -- where were you living?  
A.	In April 1994, I was in the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal) camp for displaced persons because I had fled my home when Ndadaye died.  
Q.	Did there come a time when you made your return to Rwanda, and when was that, please?  
A.	I returned to Rwanda in June 1994.  
Q.	And when you first went to Rwanda, to which bit did you go?  
A.	I went through Rwanda -- I went to Rwanda through Bugesera at the crossing point known as Sake.  
Q.	And Sake is spelled S-A-K-E, and Bugesera is spelled B-U-G-E-S-E-R-A.  And while I'm on it, can I just deal with an earlier spelling, (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal)  
Q.	Right.  Now, in 1994, were you, at that time, a member of any political party?  
A.	Yes.  I was a member of the RPF.  
Q.	Now, having entered and gone into Rwanda, did there come a time when you went to Kigali, and if so, can you tell us when that was, please?  
A.	I didn't stay in Sake for long.  I went on through Kibungo, and even though I don't remember the exact date on which I arrived in Kigali, I do remember that when the government of national unity took the oath of office, I was in Kigali.  
Q.	Now, did you get a job that took you to the area near Gikomero commune, and when was that, and what was the job and the circumstances, please?  
A.	When I was in Kigali, I was working for the RPF, and at some point, I decided to go and get another job because I no longer had a job within the RPF.  I was working in (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), and I was assigned to the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  I started working there on the 3rd of October -- the 16th of October 1994, and that is the first time that I went to Gikomero.  
Q.	And again just to go back on the spellings, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
 
Did there come a time when you met and formed a relationship with a woman who lived in that area, and if so, what was the name of that woman, and when did you meet her?  
A.	I did not know many people at my work site, especially as this was not my area of origin.  But when I came, I was interested in Lake Muhazi, which was within walking distance.  I could walk there in three hours.  On my way to Lake Muhazi, I met (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), who lived in that area.  And when I got to Muhazi, I would buy fish which I sent -- I would buy fish, which I would give to my servant to take back home.  And then on the occasion I met her, I stayed with her and had a drink.  This was in October 1995.  That is the first time I met (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) -- I met (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).
Q.	I'm just pausing there because we're unclear whether an issue has arisen here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know whether we should go into closed session to discuss the issue just for a moment or two.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that would be reasonable at least.  Yes, we -- there is an issue which has arisen concerning witness protection, and I think we should address it now.  So we'll go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 7 to 26] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 1 to 6 by Wendy Molnar)


































MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'd said that when we went into open session I'd, with your leave, Mr. President, summarise very briefly what had been said in closed session by the last witness, albeit protective of any witnesses for which -- or in respect of whose security and identification the closed session was held.  And just give me one moment to collect my thoughts on that.  

Yes.  The last witness, Witness 7/14, gave evidence in closed session.  He identified himself and he identified himself also as a member of the Tutsi ethnic group who came to know a Prosecution witness called GIN, G-I-N.  He testified that she demonstrated before him a -- that she was fabricating evidence, together with a man who was then bourgmestre called Rutabagirwa, and others that the witness named, that they were fabricating -- part of a clique in Gikomero, fabricating evidence.  They had as targets intellectuals, as he described them, in Gikomero; that in particular she targeted a man called Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda, or the group did.  And he had direct experience of the group meeting and he had direct experience of them orchestrating and including in fabricating the evidence.  

He stated that he was trusted, and a trusted observer of this, because although he himself had no interest in the fabrications himself -- he was, it would appear, indifferent to them -- he was himself a Tutsi and he was trusted for that reason, as all the targets were, in fact, Hutus, and this was in the years following the terrible genocide.  

He also said that Witness GIN had confided in him and told him of the events that had befallen her, and that she had told him that during the genocide, for most of the events that occurred in Gikomero, she wasn't at her home but had been removed by her husband because she was a Tutsi, together with her sister, and taken to a place of safety, where she was protected.  He also said that at no time had she ever mentioned the Accused in this trial, André Rwamakuba, in the context of the genocide as being an active participant in any way in the genocide.  He, for his part, had come to know the area and its people well and in the years since the genocide, he had never heard any allegation made against André Rwamakuba, neither in respect of his coming to the area, inciting it, that is, in the course of the genocide or shortly before.  

He also said that, as far as his knowledge of the incident at the Kayanga health centre was concerned, that the -- that GIN's husband, he understood, had never, in fact, left the Gikomero secteur area to go to Kayanga.  He wasn't present at all.  

I think -- I hope that's a fairly fair summary of the closed-session evidence, without implicating any particular parties.  

Mr. President, I've got two matters.  The first one is this:  As a result of information received from WVSS yesterday, I was able to compile our best shot, as it were, at this stage of our ordering of witnesses and it included there, for this Friday, Witness 5/16.  We were told yesterday afternoon by the ever-helpful WVSS that Witness 5/16 has agreed to testify via video link and she would be available only on a Friday; that's either this Friday coming or the 3rd of February.  

She has also requested to have her face shielded and her voice distorted.  We know that, as far as the latter is concerned, we can have her evidence in closed session as well as video, and that would be a way about that last problem, particular problem.  

In terms of her being video linked this Friday, I'm not in a position just now to tell you whether that is convenient, in the sense of possible, this Friday, but we'd ask that it be done because we hope that Mr. O'Shea is able to get there.  He mislaid his passport this morning, and I haven't actually seen him since to see whether he's recovered it and whether he is now able to start his journey to Kigali.  But on the expectation that he -- I hope he has and that he will make that journey, it will mean that, of course, he's in the capital to assist in the way that we described yesterday and to assist me by his presence there.  And obviously, in those circumstances, if there are other witnesses for video link, it would be far more convenient and economic to do it while he's there than not.  

So we're hopefully pencilling in -- more than that, I hope it can be arranged that we can have this second video link on Friday, but I need an order, in fact, from this Court to facilitate that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that this has already been discussed, in principle, and we have already, in fact, decided, in principle, to make video-link testimony an appropriate substitute in relation to protected witnesses who are having difficulty in attending trial in Arusha.  So we make the order for the video-link testimony to take place this Friday, if it is possible, and, if not, on the following Friday.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we also assure the witness, if it's appropriate, that she can give her evidence in closed session over the video link?  That will get over the problems of distortion and the rest of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Didn't we make this order already, Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
For tomorrow's witness.  This is another witness, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we make the order as well for the Witness 5/16. 
MR. HOOPER:
And finally, I apply by way -- in respect of Witness 4/18, 4/18 is one of the professional persons in respect of whom a subpoena order has been made, and this is an oral motion, but I've passed -- I've typed it out and I've passed it to the English -- to the English booth, so I'll keep to my script, as it were.  

It's an oral motion, essentially, that the Court make or invite the government of Rwanda to effect the subpoena by a set date, in this case, the 7th of February.  The witness concerned is 4/18, and he's been made the subject of subpoena dated the 16th of December 2005, and the order acknowledged the Defence had taken reasonable steps to obtain the voluntary cooperation of the witness and that the witness's testimony can materially assist the Defence case, and its issuing was deemed, therefore, to be in the interest of justice.  

WVSS have informed me that they have -- and indeed the Court -- that they have communicated the fact of that subpoena to him and the witness has declined to make himself available.  He has also declined the opportunity of giving his testimony by video link.  No reason has been given for his ignoring the order of the Tribunal.  

It's in the interests of justice that the witness attend.  This is a trial of limited length of a single accused.  The government of Rwanda, by reason of its international obligations, is obliged to facilitate the production of the witness before this Tribunal, and we request that the Tribunal, under Rule 54, request the government of Rwanda to facilitate the production of the witness by the 7th of February.  

The setting of a time limit of two weeks is reasonable, we submit, in all the circumstances, and will obviate the necessity of further delaying the length of the trial.  The Witness 4/18 is known, and has been in contact with, the WVSS.  He's based in Kigali.  There is no reason to believe that the witness is under any disability or has any reasonable cause not to obey the order of the Tribunal.  His travel to, and accommodation in, Arusha will be paid and arranged for by the registry.  

The ordering of a fixed time limit of two weeks for the implementation of the order and the attendance of the witness is, we submit, a reasonable time for the state of Rwanda to fulfill its obligations.  It is assumed, and believed, that the State of Rwanda will willingly comply with such a request.  Should that not be the case, then we submit that any order to comply by specific date may allow for the State of Rwanda to make such representations in opposition to it, if it's felt necessary by that state, within seven days of the making of an order.  

So that, essentially, is the -- that's our application, or motion, this morning in respect of the subpoena, and its object is to secure the attendance of a witness in a timely fashion.  And perhaps behind it is a -- to some extent, a belief that if one's dealing, as one inevitably is, with a bureaucracy, however fair that bureaucracy may be towards such an application, it will consume and take time, and a reasonable order, we feel, such as that is, will serve as a very efficient focus.  And we feel that it's not an unreasonable order to comply with and to secure an attendance of a witness at a time when this Tribunal is so urgently and necessarily seeking to conclude the evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that the decision is the Trial Chamber's.  Our sole concern on the Prosecution bench is that the dates put forward by Counsel Hooper are dates on which we were planning to cross-examine, as these are firm dates that we propose, the 3rd, the 6th and the 7th.  And under those conditions, we should try and see how to organise our work so that we could both undertake cross-examination, examination-in-chief, and subsequent cross-examination again of that witness.  That is our sole concern. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Hooper, we will consider your application, and we expect to be in a position to deliver our decision tomorrow morning. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I hear any comment that given a certain period of time, the capacity for us on these benches to fill it as it comes up to half past 12 is always somewhat surprising, but there we are.  I thought we were going to finish much earlier today; I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Surprising is rather an inadequate description of how I feel, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Fated, perhaps.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the adjournment now.  We are going to recess until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1218H)
