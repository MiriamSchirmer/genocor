P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

Mr. Robinson, are you ready for the continuation of your cross-examination of Witness GFA?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you. 

Please usher in Witness GFA.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, while we are waiting, I'll just say I think my -- I am going to finish this examination in a few minutes, less than 30, probably, and I do want to thank the Trial Chamber for allowing me to get through all of my questions on my cross-examination of this witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you for that information, Counsel.  I think after you it will be Mr. Hooper, am I correct?  Very well. 

Good morning, Witness GFA.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Robinson is going to continue cross-examining you today.  We do wish to remind you that you are still under oath. 

Very well.  Mr. Robinson, you have the floor.
WITNESS GFA
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Muraho.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Amakuru ki.
A.	Amaza.
Q.	I'm just going to ask you a few more questions about the meeting in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November, and then you will be finished with me.  

First of all, would you agree that Mr. Nzirorera was not present at this meeting?
A.	I did not see him.  I presume he wasn't there.
Q.	Now I'm going to play two short clips of the CD-ROMs from this meeting, and in the first one is a very short clip of some people singing a song, and I'm going to ask you to listen to this song and tell me whether or not what the people are singing says that there should be unity between the Hutus, the Twa, and the Tutsis.  So if you could watch this clip and listen and tell me whether you heard that on the clip. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If we can have that first clip, thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
Could we identify it, for the record, where because all of these videos have -- are counted out, and we've identified them A through G, I believe.  Just for the clarity of the record, if you could tell us which of the CD-ROMS and how it is counted out, from what minute to what minute.
MR. ROBINSON:
This is the CD-ROM KZ392C, which is the third CD-ROM, and I've asked the portion be played from 28 minutes 50 seconds to 30 minutes.
(CD-ROM played)
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, I think that's enough.  That's the end of that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness GFA, did you hear the song and the reference to this Hutsi, Tu (sic), and Twa -- and this Hutu, Twa, and Tutsi?
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I don't want to get us on the wrong track with a series of objections, but it would be more appropriate for counsel to ask witness what he said, instead of telling him, "Did you hear the following?"  So if we could just take things the right way and avoid -- I don't want to interrupt 
Mr. Robinson, that's not my intention, but we should do this the right way.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I think the right way is I can ask leading questions on cross-examination.  So I don't understand that objection.  I'm entitled on cross-examination to ask the witness a leading question.  So I asked him a leading question.  I don't understand what's the problem.
MR. WEBSTER:
You asked the witness to look at the videotape.  I believe it would be appropriate to ask the witness what he heard, and then you can contradict him if you think the videotape is saying something else.  But to tell him, the witness, did you hear this that and the other, it is inappropriate,  particularly since we don't even understand what was being said.  The tape was played, it was not transcribed, it was not interpreted for us.  So under the circumstances it is not the proper way to ask the question.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, it's probably easier for me to do as Mr. Webster suggests, but honestly, I don't see that as a valid objection.  You can ask leading questions on cross-examination.  I don't understand what the legal basis for that objection is.  But, nevertheless, I'm willing to do that if it make it go quicker.
MR. WEBSTER:
If that portion had been interpreted and we all heard it and then you said, "Okay, did you hear that."  then it would be appropriate; but under the circumstances it wasn't.  And I only make the objection now because I would like the questioning, during the course of your cross-examination to be appropriate.  I don't want to interrupt you every time you ask a question.  That's why I'm making this objection now so we take things the way they should be taken.  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained. 

Please, can you put your question again to the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes.  Witness GFA, can you tell us what you heard on that portion of the tape?
A.	I hear those singing greet President Habyarimana by saying hello to him.  They were saying that he's a good man and that he has triumphed over conservatives and bad people.  These are the kinds of personal praises being directed at President Habyarimana.
Q.	And did you also hear the portion of that -- and if you didn't we can play it again -- where there's a reference to Hutu, Twa and Tutsi?
A.	No, I did not hear that.  It's a matter of Habyarimana being praised.  One wouldn't be talking about Hutus, Twas and Tutsis.  It's a welcoming song, a form of praises to Habyarimana, and the mention of Hutus, Twa, and Tutsis wouldn't be well placed within that context.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if we could play just that portion from 29 minutes to 30 minutes.  I may have stopped this tape a bit too early before that reference was made, so that's my mistake.  But if we could go ahead and play it from 29 minutes to 30 minutes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, did you indeed hear what is being said on this video or did you have any gaps?  Did you miss something in your listening?
THE WITNESS:
I heard everything.  It's true that the sound is not very good -- the sound quality is not very good, but I heard what I told you about.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  
Could you continue, Counsel?  It's not useful to replay the video, because he's told us what he heard on the portion you wanted him to hear.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  So I'm going to ask that the video be resumed from the portion -- I believe that I stopped the portion of the video too soon.  So if we could go back to portion that he has not yet seen, I believe it's from about 29 minutes to 30 minutes, we can play that and we'll see if he hears what I believe has been translated as being on this tape.  So I would ask that that be done.  It's only one minute.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  It is not necessary for you to have replayed what we've already seen.  You move on to the next portion.
MR. ROBINSON:
I believe that it was somewhere around 29 minutes that we stopped the tape.  So if the operator can start it again from about that point.
(CD-ROM played)
MR. ROBINSON:
      Okay, thank you very much.  We can stop this portion now.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness GFA, did you hear anything -- any reference to Hutu, Twa, and Tutsi in the song?
A.	Yes, I heard that reference being made to Hutus, Twa, and to the Tutsis.  However, I did not understand what was being said about those ethnic groups.  Maybe what can be done is that the portion be replayed so I can hear it again.
MR. ROBINSON:
May I repeat that, Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, could you reply that portion, please?
(CD-ROM played)
MR. ROBINSON:
You can stop now.
THE WITNESS:
I have heard.  They are saying that they are living in harmony.  They are saying that the enemy was going to exterminate them, and Habyarimana had saved them, and so now they are sleeping under the sun in peace, and the three ethnic groups are living in harmony.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you, Witness GFA.  Now, we saw on that portion of the clip -- well, did you see the wife of President Habyarimana sitting next to him?
A.	Yes, I saw her.
Q.	And was she wearing the uniform of the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	And in fact, that was cloth that was MRND, it was an MRND kitenge cloth that was worn by many people throughout the country; correct?
A.	Yes, that's right.
Q.	Now, we're going to have another clip shown --
A.	But I would like to say something, by your leave.  That's what was said.  That's what we used to say, and I think that I explained to you this.  The members of the population lived in harmony; Hutus, Twas and Tutsi were living together from a long time ago.  Amongst the population, there were no problems.  It was the leaders who were sowing seeds of division.  It was the leaders who incited them to kill themselves (sic).  Why is this happening?  It was because the leaders asked them to do so.  

Now, as for the clothing worn by the Interahamwe, for Habyarimana's wife, she was manifesting her solidarity with the Interahamwe.  It was a dress worn by the leaders of the party.  Please show the part where Habyarimana was saying that it was necessary to find clothing for the Interahamwe.  His wife wore the same cloth to show that she was supporting her husband in the party, that they were a couple of Interahamwe.  And this was a manifestation of that solidarity.  That was the image she wanted to project.
Q.	Yes.  Thank you.  And we are going to play President Habyarimana's speech next, and you will see where he says exactly what you have said about the Interahamwe uniform.  

Now, before we play the speech of President Habyarimana, I want to call your attention to some testimony that you gave on the 30th of March, and I'm going to ask you, after we look at the speech of President Habyarimana, whether how you have characterised that speech is correct.  And I'm speaking particularly of your interpretation of what he meant by "defending with the Interahamwe."  So I'm going to ask you when you listen to this speech to tell me whether or not you believe that President Habyarimana is speaking about fighting the enemy or speaking about campaigning for election.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And at this time I would like to have -- before I have the second portion of the speech played, I would ask that the witness be provided with Prosecution Exhibit 18G, which is the transcript of the excerpts of President Habyarimana's speech.  We're not quite ready to play the speech yet, but I'd like the witness to have the transcript of -- the portions of the transcript the Prosecutor selected of President Habyarimana's speech.  The whole speech is only about five minutes, so I'll ask that it be played in its entirety.  Some of this is contained within the transcripts, others are not.  

If the Trial Chamber is interested in following this to a greater degree by transcript I would refer you to Exhibit DNZ. 21, which is not admitted into evidence but which is the interpreters best efforts to transcribe this portion of the CD.  

So if the Registrar could place Exhibit 18G before the witness we'd be ready to play the next portion of the tape.
MR. WEBSTER:
May I ask request that counsel directs us to the portion of the transcript on the 30th of March that he's going to refer to.  That way we could find it before the witness starts to testify.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can do that.  It's going to be on page 19, line 23 and line 29; on page 20, line 6 and line 15.  

And for Mr. Webster's information, we are going to replay tape No. KZ392F, and we are playing from 18 minutes 15 seconds to 23 minutes, 48 seconds.  And I think we're ready to play the tape now.  (CD-ROM played)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness GFA, did President Habyarimana say that he was in favour of the Arusha Peace Accord and that the MRND was in favour of the Arusha Peace Accord?
A.	Yes, he said that.  He came back to that point because the person who was representing the negotiators in Arusha was a member of another party, and it is for that reason he would come back to the issue often.  He said that some people claim that the MRND does not support the negotiations when, in fact, it does, or did.  He says that because the MRND claimed that the person who represented Rwanda in the negotiations did not say what had been agreed upon.  There were accusations of supporting the MDR's interests.  This is what I believe was said.
Q.	And in the portion where he talked about the Interahamwe, did he say that he personally believed that political rallies have not yet really started, and when they start he would call upon the Interahamwe, and we will then descend. Did he say that?
A.	Yes, you heard that.  That is what he said.
Q.	And then did he also say that he was told, "If you embark on an election campaign, your soldiers will accompany you and they will canvass on your behalf.  What is wrong with that?  I know that the Interahamwe are the one who will proudly canvass for me because we are on the same wave length."  Is that what President Habyarimana said?
A.	Yes, that is what he said.  You are repeating what he said.  But you have to understand the context, the context of his words.  Interahamwes were going to descend.  You represent the Interahamwe, accompany the president.  They had the power.  The group had taken over the army or been more powerful than the army.
Q.	When you testified, on the 30th of March, before you had an opportunity to review this CD-ROM, you said that when he said, "We would come down," you understood him to mean that the Interahamwe would accompany him to the war front to chase out the Inkotanyi and that you understood that he meant that the Interahamwe should go fight wherever the enemy was to find all these people. 

Now, having reviewed the actual words of what he said some 12 years later, would you agree that in fact he was speaking of political rallies and elections not to fight the enemy?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, but I can't --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I simply can't find what counsel has just summarised, and to avoid an objection coming from this side of the room, if he would simply read what the witness said in the transcript, then we wouldn't have this concern.  But I am not seeing what was summarised and put to the witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
I can do that, Madam President.  All these things make us take a longer time, but if you feel that is necessary I can do that.  

So we'll start on page 19, on line 23.  I'll read your testimony, your answers, Witness GFA.
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me, if it's in contradiction to what he is saying now, then its appropriate to read it back to him and bring out the contradiction.  But to simply go and re-read his prior testimony is not appropriate.  If you are going to put a question to the witness and now the witness says something that is different from what he said several days ago, then we can read the transcript.  But I don't understand where we are going with this line of questioning, if it is not to bring out a contradiction.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Madam President, I'm making every effort to accommodate Mr. Webster, but I think we've come to a point where we are wasting a lot of time.  I'm going to go back and ask the question the way I want to ask it, if you want to sustain his objection, we'll stay here for as long as it takes to get it right.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness GFA, I'm going to ask you, having reviewed the tape, isn't it true that what President Habyarimana was referring to was the Interahamwe campaigning in the elections, not fighting the enemy at the front?
A.	I was asked a question put in the context of the president's speech.  We agree we heard the same thing.  I was asked to explain what he meant when he said he was going to descend with the Interahamwe.  I said that there were other parties opposed to the MRND who caused disturbances throughout the country, including in Kigali.  

I said that there was also a war with the Inkotanyi.  I explained following:  He said they were going to go down or descend, but I don't know where they were going with him or descending with him.  

I asked myself three questions in my head:  Was it to combat the enemy; was it to confront the other parties, because that was a phenomenon that was very popular or recurrent; or was it to campaign?  I don't know.  He said that they were going to descend with him, but I understood that there were three possibilities.  Those are the three.  Those are the three options, if you will, that I thought of in my head.  If you read my testimony, that's what you will see.  I did not assert they were going to descend to do this or that.  I explained that there were three possible options, if you will. 

Furthermore, we knew of political stance, if you will.  There was something hidden.  The parties were fighting each other all of the time.  They were the Abakombozi, the GDRs, the Interahamwe.  People from Ruhengeri did not go down to Kigali.  People in Ruhengeri put Kigali license plates on so that they could go throughout the city uninhibited.  There were always these types of problems.  Sometimes people were ask to cut off the roads because there was such-and-such an incident.  There were all of these issues, and it was in that context that I did not assert that they were going to descend to do this or that.  I submit that there were three possibilities of what could have happened.
Q.	And Witness GFA, would you agree that of the three possibilities the only one that was mentioned by President Habyarimana was the election campaign?  He made no mention of fighting the enemy, the Inkotanyi, and he made no mention of fighting other political parties.  Would you agree with that?
A.	Listen, Kinyarwanda is a complex language.  Someone can tell you hello and in that hello you interpret something else.  Why did you say they have to dress the Interahamwe, not all the others?  Why did the Interahamwe have to replace the soldiers?  Why did the Interahamwe have to campaign on behalf of him and not the rest of the population?  I understood those three things, because I know the context of the country and those three problems existed, the war on Inkotanyi, the war against the other parties existed, and the campaign was also a fact.  And you had to read between the lines of those three possibilities.  These were facts.  Everything he said in his speech, the facts, thereafter, manifested all of these possibilities that I'm making reference to.
Q.	As you attended this meeting on the 15th of November 1992, did you have any feeling that President Habyarimana or any of the other speakers were urging that Tutsis, within the country of Rwanda, who were not part of any war, be killed?
A.	Each group has a stance.  They had to consolidate Habyarimana's power.  They were opposition parties, you must know.  They couldn't say openly, "Let's go kill people."  On the 7th of April 1994 people were being killed, before, rather, prior to that date people were being killed but in secret.  People were being killed, their bodies were thrown into ditches.  In the end people knew about it, but it was done secretly at first.  Do you think that he could say in public, "Go kill people."  No, that could not be done.  
And then people who understood the situation say that Habyarimana was different from the extremists.  He did not support the killings.  There are people who say that.  But he was under pressure, pressured by the extremists.  But ask yourself the question, why did he want to spoil the Interahamwe, and dress them, and do all those things for them?
Q.	Well, Witness GFA, we watched these tapes for many hours and had them translated into a language that we understand, and I can tell you that for all the hours I don't see any reference or indication that there was any suggestion that innocent civilians be killed.  Now, is that correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question.  Counsel is offering his own opinion.  We are here to hear testimony from the witness, not the opinion of the opposing counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that objection is sustained, Counsel.  Please move on to another question, Counsel.  Try to avoid putting that type of question to the witness.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is there anything on the -- at least the portions of this meeting that you've seen, in which it is indicated that civilian Tutsis should be killed?
A.	No.  That was not part of the programme on that date.  He indicated that he was going home.  He was going to visit his mother and he simply dropped by to say hello.  He spoke of the problem of the refugees and the displaced persons, and then he spoke of the Interahamwe, because he found Interahamwe in that festival, if you will.  He said that he didn't have much to say.  He didn't say everything he thought.  It wasn't the occasion to do so.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Madam President.  At this time I would like to offer exhibit -- what I will label 
Exhibit DNZ. 25, which is the paper with the name that this witness has written on during his cross-examination.  And on that paper, under the number 1, should be listed the person he says he gave his gun to.  And under number 2 should be 12 persons that he says were present at Mr. Nzirorera's residence when Mr. Nzirorera distributed uniforms.  So I ask that be marked DNZ. 25 and admitted into evidence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you're speaking of DNZ. 25, but from 21 to 24 we did not register those exhibits.  You said that you wanted to tender them.  You said they were summaries, and for the time being you could not tender those as exhibits.  So apparently this should be DNZ. 21.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, yesterday we encountered this exact same situation with Exhibit DNZ. 17, which was the Interahamwe card that was not admitted.  And Mr. Webster suggested that we retain the numbers that were referred to in the Court that to maintain some kind of consistency and so I'm following -- and you accepted that practice yesterday.  So I'm following the practice that you accepted yesterday.  If we need to change that practice I don't have a problem with that, but we need to probably decide one way or the other whether an exhibit which is not admitted is still marked.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection to marking what Mr. Robinson wants to offer now as DNZ. 25 and we can leave DNZ. 21 through 24 open for when we do have actual transcripts.  And then the Prosecution will consent to the transcripts of those speeches coming in and being marked with those numbers, just for the consistency of the record.  So that's not a problem for the Prosecution, but just to make a distinction between DNZ. 21 through 24 and the Interahamwe tape.  In that context the witness did identify the MRND cards.  I mean there is a distinction between the two.  But I have no opposition to reserving those numbers for the transcripts when we actually obtain them.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Logically we cannot reserve the DNZ. 21 to 24.  We prefer to attribute this exhibit with No. DNZ. 25, but apparently there is some confusion.  

No, no, DNZ. 21 for this current document, the document on which the witness indicated the names of people he mentioned in this courtroom.  This document will be DNZ. 21.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, perhaps that should then be DNZ. 20 because Exhibit DNZ. 20 was the Interahamwe card that was also not admitted in evidence.  So if you are going to be consistent here and anything that is not admitted in evidence should not be given a number, then it should probably be DNZ. 20.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As regards the -- as regards the card, it's already admitted.  We are not going to spend a half hour on this issue.  The last one was the card and it was admitted because the witness did recognise the card.  He said it was a bit different from the one that he was familiar with, but that document is tendered as an exhibit and we admitted it. 

As regards the others, these are summaries and we cannot admit them pending receipt of the transcriptions.  

So this document will be DNZ. 21.
	(Exhibit No. DNZ. 21 admitted, under seal)
MR. WEBSTER:
Just another comment, Your Honour.   This should be under seal, since it does contain information that we are trying to conceal from the public.  And I notice in the minutes that I received yesterday it did not indicate that DNZ. 17 would be under seal, that is the witness statement from the Office of the Prosecutor that was admitted yesterday.  Now, on the exhibit that I did received from the registry, did mark on it "under seal" but I notice in the minutes I received that indication was not there.  And I spoke to Mr. Hometowu and I don't believe he has it in his records as an exhibit that should be under seal.  So both DNZ. 17, A and B, and DNZ. 21 should be under seal.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  It seems there has been an error in the minutes. 

DNZ. 17 was indeed placed under seal.  DNZ. 21 shall also be placed under seal.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we would request, when the registrar has the time, we receive a copy of DNZ. 21 because we had not had a chance to write down all the names during examination.  

And finally, Madam President, I have no further questions at this time for the witness.  I would reserve the right to seek recall the witness, seek recall of the witness, once we receive the complete disclosure of his statement, and we filed a motion yesterday for your assistance in obtaining the remainder of his statement.  Thank you very much.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you have to floor for the cross-examination of this witness.
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Madam President
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, for my benefit can you just clarify one matter?  To your knowledge, when did your group, your Interahamwe group, start killing people?
A.	First of all, I would to tell you that the group was not mine, it was the MRND's.
Q.	Could you please answer the question and not give me a speech?
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness was answering the question by clarifying -- I'm sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
I was actually objecting to the response by counsel.  The witness was asked a question.  He was clarifying information in the question that was put to him, so it is a completely appropriate answer.  And the Court can instruct the witness how to answer a question if he is not answering it appropriately.

BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	When did the Interahamwe --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may proceed, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER: 
May I point out the Prosecutor interrupted Mr. Robinson about a hundred  times, and I hope that's not going to be a pattern repeated today. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when was the Interahamwe --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, please, Mr. Hooper.  Please try to ask questions that are necessary.  Let the witness answer.  We are here to interrupt the witness if need be.  Whenever it is necessary, we'll do that. When the witness is answering your question, please let him answer.  He's here for that purpose.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did the Interahamwe group, of which you were one of its principal leaders, to your knowledge, first start killing?
A.	I'll point out that they're Interahamwe from the MRND and not my Interahamwe. 

The people began to be killed on the 7th of April.  The people began to be killed prior to the 7th of April 1994.
Q.	Yes.  When was that, to your knowledge?
A.	I said that it was before 1994.  If you look at my answers, I think that I gave the approximate date on which the first person was killed.
Q.	Well, kindly do that again now, please.
A.	You can answer one thing yesterday and today you may have forgotten; so I'm asking you to verify in the documents.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please respond to that question.
THE WITNESS:
To my knowledge, I believe that it was between 1991 and 1994.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Killing is not something that's done lightly.  When was that first person killed, to your knowledge?
A.	I've already explained the Bigogwe began to be killed in 1991 in my region; however we weren't the ones who began to kill them.  Perhaps other Interahamwe killed people.  But the event that I personally witnessed was in 1993, when for me the first person was killed in my presence.
Q.	And where was that?
A.	It was at a roadblock.
Q.	And when was that, which month?
A.	I don't remember, Counsel.
Q.	Was that because you killed so many people that you can't even remember that first one?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, that question is not allowed.  We are asking you to respect the witness.
MR. HOOPER: 
I'll try to. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Your group, in April, after the president was killed -- I say "your group" and I understand that you object to my saying that, but the group to which you were attached -- killed, as I understand your evidence, about one to one and a half thousand people; would that be right?
A.	No, I never gave that figure, Counsel.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will move on.  We don't have to deal with figures.  Please move on, Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Towards the end of May you tell us you went back to school; is that right?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	Was that school-as-normal or what?
A.	Yes, we had gone towards the school.  Not many of my classmates came back to the school, obviously.  At a given point in time we stopped.  After a short while we stopped and classes were closed.
Q.	You remember the schools, though, being opened towards the end of May; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was going back to school, for you, a relief after all that chaos and killing?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the relevance of the question, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I believe the Prosecutor's comment was not interpreted.  Very well, Mr. Prosecutor, can you please repeat?
MR. WEBSTER:
On grounds of relevance whether it was a relief to this witness or not to go back to school, I fail to see the relevance for purposes of reliability or establishing the fact that are alleged -- the allegations against the Accused.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained. 

Mr. Hooper, we are asking you to ask relevant questions, put relevant questions to this witness, please.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would you agree that the opening of the schools may well have been an effort to contribute peace to the area?
A.	I do not know how or why they decided to reopen the schools.  At any rate, we had been studying for a short period of time and they closed the schools down again.  I don't know, maybe those who were responsible for the schools -- I don't know why they decided to reopen the schools.
Q.	Well --
A.	At any rate, it wasn't the case throughout the country.
Q.	But wouldn't you agree that opening the schools is a step towards normality?  Can't you see that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Those are your opinions, Mr. Hooper.  He has already answered this question.  Please move on to another question, please.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you listen to the radio during this time?
A.	Yes, we would listen to RTLM and Radio Rwanda.
Q.	Can you remember an announcement being made on the radio about the opening of the schools and the reasons for it?
A.	No, I do not recall having heard such an announcement.  All I know is that I went to school.  I do not remember whether I heard any such announcement.
Q.	You joined the Interahamwe right at its very inception, is that correct, in 1991?
A.	There was a youth meeting which was convened.  Kajelijeli called us and he explained to us that all the youths, including us, all the youths should be assembled within the MRND and that we needed to set up a youth wing of the MRND.  And he encouraged us to go about the establishment of that wing.  Furthermore, as I have explained, it wasn't easy to join parties other than the MRND.
Q.	So is the answer yes?
A.	No.  You could join the MRND against your will, but given the prevailing situation in the area you were obliged to join the MRND, but despite explanations given to you about the goodness of that party, even if you knew that party was not the ideal party, you had to join the party so as not to put yourself in trouble.
Q.	There were people you knew in your area who joined the MDR and the PL and the PSD; is that right?
A.	I mentioned to you people who joined these parties, and as soon as they did so we did all in our power.
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...  And get through this as quickly as possible.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Hooper, we are asking you to observe a pause between the answers and your questions because we didn't have a complete interpretation of your question.  
Mr. Hooper, maybe you should be aware that this interpretation is being carried out in relay and once the channel is not released the interpreter in the French booth will not be hearing you.
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you for that.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I'm objecting to Mr. Hooper's latest comment.  The witness is providing an answer to the question that he asked.  He is eliciting the response from the witness.  Now I agree that we need to move quickly, but he cannot object to the witness giving an expansive answer to his question if his question itself contains an ambiguity, an ambiguity that needs to be explained.  I'm objecting to his direction to the witness.  The Court can direct the witness to shorten his answers to tailor his answers to its requirements.
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I asked a simple question and I'll ask it again.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you know people who joined these other parties?  Can you answer yes or no?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think it's a bit difficult to ask the witness to answer via yes or a no.  You can ask him to be precise and concise and not to expound too much on a question.  Please proceed.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	At the same time as you became a member of the Interahamwe, multipartyism started in Rwanda; is that correct?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	You opposed multipartyism, did you not?
A.	Yes.  We were told that we needed to look for members from parties opposed to the MRND.  I do not know the policy of those authorities who were giving us instructions, but we were asked to pursue the members of other parties who were opposed to the MRND. 
(Pages 1 to 15 by R Lear)











	1015H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And did that policy run from 1991 onwards?
A.	What policy are you referring to, Counsel?  Could you please explain that question of yours to me a bit more?
Q.	You are not an unintelligent man, are you?  You understand my question.  I'll put it again to you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, avoid any comments.  Please put your questions without any comment.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The policy that you say you were asked to put into effect of opposing other parties, was that a policy that was put into effect from 1991 through '92, '93 and into '94?
A.	Yes, that policy was implemented during those years.
Q.	You said in evidence that members of other parties were to be attacked and hunted down; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You also said: "If you were opposed to the MRND, you had to die."  Was that correct?
A.	Yes, I told you that all those opposed to Habyarimana's regime were referred to as accomplices of the Inkotanyi.  I think I have given you explanations long and wide on that matter.
Q.	It's the words you used I am asking you about: "If you were opposed to the MRND, you had to die." Is that correct?  

I am sorry, another interruption.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am asking counsel to direct me to the portion of the transcript where this reference is being picked up.
MR. HOOPER:
It is the witness's first day of testimony. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you not remember saying that, Mr. Witness, or do you dispute saying that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Hooper, you can at least indicate the page of the transcripts to us from where you are obtaining this statement by the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
It's taken from my own note because the transcript only got to me this morning, and I haven't had a chance to go through it.  But that's my note, the witness can comment on it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My concern is that counsel seems to be insisting on that sentence, and I don't recall it.  That's why I was asking for the reference in the transcript. 
MR. HOOPER:
Let me move on and we will look for it.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you were opposed to the MRND, did you have to die?
A.	Yes, there are some who died because of that.  There are, for instance, Tutsis who died because of that.
Q.	Did members of the MDR die because of that?
A.	Yes, some of them were killed.
Q.	When were they killed?
A.	In 1994.  Do you want me to give you examples, Counsel?
Q.	Let me ask you about an earlier time.  I'll come back to '94.  Let me ask you about your préfecture of Ruhengeri.  Would it be right to say that MDR party was the principal opposition party in Ruhengeri to the MRND?
A.	Yes, you are quite right, Counsel.
Q.	And from 1991 that party was consistently attacked by the Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, that's right.
Q.	During this time, you have told us, that you were trained by the military in, as you put it, "All the things that a soldier had to learn."  Is that right?
A.	I have told you that when we received such training, and I gave you the beginning of those training exercises, and I told you also that amongst the Interahamwe there were former soldiers, and I also told you that machetes and clubs can also kill.
Q.	The military trained you; is that right?
A.	I have already explained to you, and I gave you details about the training exercises.  We were being told how to shoot within the Virunga Force Amahindure in 1993.  We were taught, and it's quite natural that those people who knew how to shoot would teach us how to shoot, and our instructors were former soldiers.  They told us how to handle weapons.
Q.	So you were taught how to camouflage yourselves, how to approach an enemy, shooting positions.  You listed them for us, and thank you for that.  

Can I ask you this:  Were you trained with any members of the MDR?  
A.	I have explained that to you.  I explained to you that they taught us combat methods and everything that soldiers needed to learn.
Q.	Were you trained together with any members of the MDR?
A.	No.
Q.	Were you at any time, Witness, aware yourself of incidents where MDR families in Ruhengeri were burnt out of house and home, had their homes destroyed before 1994?
A.	What I recall is that in a place known as Kaberwa in Nyakinama commune, we were told that one man was a member of the MDR; we went to his home.  We took the registers containing the names of members of the MDR and we broke up everything in his house, and I was a member of -- *********** *********************.
Q.	Were you aware of any events against MDR members in the commune of Nyarutovu, for example?  
A.	No, I don't have any information concerning events in Nyarutovu.
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of events in Ruhondo commune, including killing?  Do you have any knowledge of any of that?
A.	Ruhondo is very far from my commune.  The communes neighbouring mine were Nyakinama, Nyaratovu, Kigombe; but Ruhondo commune is very far from my home.  Cyabingo and Kinigi are also neighbouring communes to mine.
Q.	Nyakinama is a neighbouring commune that you know; is that right?
A.	Yes.  I think I mentioned it amongst the neighbouring communes.
Q.	Do you know if the president of the MDR there was murdered before the president's plane was shot down, before the events of April?  Do you know if he was murdered?  Is that something you have ever heard of?
A.	No, I don't know about that.  I gave you instances of events of which I was an eyewitness.
Q.	May I ask you this:  In your position in the Interahamwe, if the president there had been murdered, would that be something -- the president of the MDR -- would that be something that you would ordinarily expect to hear about or not?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.
MR. HOOPER:
Can we have a reason for the objection?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is calling for speculation on the part of the witness.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is sustained, Counsel.  Please move on. 
MR. HOOPER:
I would have appreciated the chance of replying to the objection.  I don't see how it is speculation when it is something within the personal knowledge and awareness of this witness.  He knows the systems, he knows the organisation within which he was living.  He can tell us whether it would be a surprise to him for an event like that to have happened and for him not to have heard about it.  Doesn't mean that it has happened or it hasn't happened; it's merely a reflection of the structure within which he was placed and the access to information that would normally come his way. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Previous to the question that I objected to, the witness said he didn't know about the incident.  In view of that response, to then go on and say, "Is it something that you as a leader would know?" It is calling for speculation because he has already stated on the record that he didn't know about it.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'll hazard a question.  If he was killed and you don't know about it, is that a great surprise to you?
A.	I will tell you that there is nothing surprising about that.  ************************************************ *************************************************.  You see, these men that you are representing claimed that they know everything that happened throughout the country.  I wasn't moving about.  I wasn't in Nyakinama commune.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You see, we are getting there because you are asking questions which call for speculation and the witness is going on in that line.  So, please stop asking these kinds of questions, Mr. Hooper.  We have already told you that before. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	After April '94 were members of the MDR in Ruhengeri, to your knowledge, murdered?
A.	Let me tell you that in Ruhengeri I didn't know the members of the MDR except people such as Munyarukiko and Bicamumpaka, who lived in Kigali.  So I do not know members of the MDR in Ruhengeri.  Those who were members of the MDR, we pursued them; we tore down their flags.  And I do not know any members of the MDR in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	If it was your job to hunt them down, how were you going to hunt them down, if you didn't know who they were?
A.	Quite so.  Those that we found we chased away.  Others were living in Kigali, and we were not going to chase them out of Kigali; there were Interahamwe in Kigali.  But those who were in Mukingo or its environs, we hunted them down. 
Q.	Attacks on the Tutsi population, of which you were part, attacks on the Bagogwe, which is a clan of Tutsis, is it not?
A.	Yes, the Bagogwe are Tutsis.
Q.	As I understand your evidence, and correct me if I am wrong, those attacks started in earnest after the Ruhengeri attack of January of 1991; is that right?
A.	Yes.  They -- the attacks on them began after the attack of -- on Ruhengeri from 1991 to 1994.  From 1991 they were being hunted down, and this continued right up to the end of the war, which was launched by the RPF.
Q.	And you told us that these attacks were attacks that were made in secret and done in secret, and done at night, right up until the 7th of April; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I explained to you that before the 7th of April, the attacks were being done secretly, but from the 7th of April, the attacks were carried out in the open.
Q.	And you told us that it was done in secret because other parties would otherwise oppose you; is that correct?
A.	No.  We didn't want the other parties to shout out to say, "No, that you are killing people," and that's why people would move about in secret.  Sometimes they'd use a pretext so that such-and-such authority would disturb the peace and people would be kidnapped and they would disappear. 
Q.	So, then it is right to say that it was done in secret because if the other parties knew what you were doing, they would oppose you and shout out and say, "Do not kill these people."  That's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is one of the reasons why they were afraid to abduct people in the open, because the authorities were the ones abducting those people.
Q.	You told us, as I recall, that you did not know what the policies of your party, the MRND, were.  You answered Mr. Roach last week to that effect.  Would that be right? 
A.	I said that I didn't know the statutes or the future projects those authorities had.  Perhaps you can ask the leaders of the MRND, they know better than I.
Q.	Yes, that was the quip you came out with last week.  

What about the policies?  Did you know what the policies of your party were?
A.	That's it.  I told you that I was not an expert in that area.  I only followed instructions given to me.  We weren't to ask questions and say, "What are your policies?"  We didn't know the statutes of our party; we only carried out instructions given to us.
Q.	Would it follow that knowing, as you claim, so very little about your party, the MRND, that your knowledge of the other parties and their policies was non-existent?
A.	No, that did not regard (sic) me at all.
Q.	I mean, did you know anything about the policies of the PL, for example, and what its members were doing?  Did you have any interest or knowledge about that?
A.	No, I was not interested at all in knowing the ideology of other parties. 
Q.	And that would apply to the MDR, would it not; no interest?
A.	No interest whatsoever.
Q.	The Ruhengeri party meeting for the MRND that we've talked about at length and seen the CDs and parts of the CDs, can I just come to that?  That was in November of 1992, and you've given your evidence as to what you understood was being said.   That's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	Would you accept that set against the transcripts and the CDs, the reality of what was said, that perhaps your memory of what was said does not serve you very well?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting. 
MR. HOOPER:
Tell us why.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
 Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question, Your Honour.  It mischaracterises what the witness has said in his previous responses.  He did not say that his memory of the event itself was not very good; there are specific points.  And you referred the Court and the parties to portions of the tape as being more authoritative than his recollection of significant portions of his testimony.  But to put this witness -- a question in such broad terms to the witness is inappropriate, so I am objecting on that basis.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, can you please rephrase your question.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Twelve years after that speech, would you agree that your memory may have let you down about what was said?
A.	I can accept that proposition.  I didn't memorise everything I heard, like a song, but I do retain the general idea of what was said.
Q.	Is that because you heard what was said through the eyes and ears of a potential Interahamwe killer?
A.	It's not because I was going to kill that I understood things in that way.  We were Interahamwe.  We were interested in having the support of the authorities.  Habyarimana said that, "We are going to dress the Interahamwe."  I couldn't forget that.  It was in my own interest.  He said that, "We were going to descend."  Everybody knew; nobody forgot that.  

There are other details that I don't remember.  For example, I don't know who danced, who didn't dance.  You see, these issues are secondary. 
Q.	But your president said, President Habyarimana said that he wanted you to descend in the context of political elections, didn't he?
A.	I have already answered that question today; and before today I even answered that.  I think that that is enough.
Q.	Would you agree that on the face of the record of that meeting that there's no ethnic hostility at that meeting, no public hostility to any group in Rwanda, is there?
A.	No, I cannot accept that.  You did not show the Chamber everything that was said.  You see your duty is to plead your innocence; the other is alleging your guilt.  You didn't look at all of the parts of that speech to claim that -- be able to claim that it's reality.  You have to show the entire context if you want to make that assertion.
Q.	Is there any part you think we should see that will help you?
A.	Yes.  It's up to you to show the Chamber the entire video, and then it would be up to the Chamber to identify the parts that are relevant.
Q.	Very well, I think we might do that in due course.  

Now, by November 1992, what was ever -- whatever was being said in public, such as that meeting, your group was killing people; is that right, the group you belong to?
A.	I would like to point out to you that the massacres of the Bagogwe began in 1991 after the first attack on Ruhengeri.  Up until our flight in July 1994, the leaders continued to orchestrate these killings.
Q.	And the group to which you belonged were carrying out the killings during that period; that's right, isn't it?
A.	My group existed, and so did the authorities; and I am telling you we did not kill people in Murambi, in Bugesera, and elsewhere where killings of that nature took place. 
Q.	So who was killing them, if you weren't?
A.	That is a question that you should ask yourself.  Some people were killed by Interahamwe, some were killed by the administration in place at the time.
Q.	Were the Interahamwe doing any killing of Bagogwe, yes or no?
A.	Yes, the Interahamwe participated.
Q.	So, on one view, are you saying that it seems that President Habyarimana was saying one thing in public and orchestrating another thing in private?
A.	Listen, I've given my opinion on Habyarimana.  He is not the only person to have given a speech.  There were several speeches.  It's up to you to analyse the general context, and you can conclude whether or not there was hatred in those speeches.  For example, they spoke of people who sent their children to the Inkotanyi.  Why did they prohibit people from doing that, in your opinion?
Q.	Just on that, it's right that both Hutus and Tutsis sent children to the Inkotanyi; isn't that right?
A.	The large majority of children who went to the Inkotanyi were Tutsis.  Some Hutus joined the Inkotanyi, but these were Hutus opposed to the Habyarimana regime.  Kanyarengwe and Bizingi (phonetic) and others became members of the Inkotanyi in that way.
Q.	So, one possibility is that President Habyarimana was being two-faced; another possibility is that there was a third force in the country, another force, a dark force in Rwanda; that's right, isn't it?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to this line of questioning, Your Honour.  There is no foundation for it.  It's gone far beyond what we covered in the direct examination.  I don't want to interrupt counsel repeatedly, unnecessarily, but we are going into a whole different sphere now. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'll move on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, move on to another question, Counsel; thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Your group of which you were part, the Interahamwe, had put its roots down all over Rwanda, had it not?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And after the 6th of April, in the words you used this morning, eloquently, you said "They were the power.  They were more powerful than the army."  And that was right, wasn't it?
MR. HOOPER:
I really don't need all this interruption. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Counsel is mischaracterising the testimony of the witness.  If he is going to insist upon those exact words, put those words to the witness and ask him if he said them, rather than making that the assumption of the question.  I was sitting right here along with everyone else; I don't recall those specific words being spoken. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Do you deny saying them?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper -- Mr. Robinson, sorry.  We are not calling you to help, Mr. Robinson.

Mr. Hooper, you would assist us greatly if you could indicate exactly when the witness said exactly what he said.
MR. HOOPER:
He had been asked the question by Mr. Robinson:  "Did he say, when there were rallies that, then, the Interahamwe should descend that soldiers would accompany you, and what is wrong with that?"   And the witness gave a fairly long answer, and I confess my fingers didn't keep up with it entirely, but my recollection, and it's from my note, and it could be wrong, is that he said words to the effect, "You have to look at the context.  The Interahamwe are going to descend or accompany the president.  They were the power, more powerful than the army."  And I don't know if the witness can agree or not that he said that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, yes. 
THE WITNESS:
I said the following.  I was asked indeed that question.  I said that Habyarimana had said that the Interahamwe had to accompany him.  He said that rumours have it that the soldiers should accompany him.  My commentary was that, in his opinion, according to Habyarimana, the Interahamwe were stronger than the army."  And I said that that illustrates the fact that to accompany the president, the Interahamwe had to be more powerful than the army.  That is what I said.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And after the 6th of April, they were more powerful than the army, were they not?
A.	I said that Kinyarwanda is a complex language.  They weren't more powerful than the army.  Saying that they were going to accompany him, that it wasn't going to be the soldiers to accompany him, that is because they knew how to do it, how the Interahamwe were going to accompany him.  I will inform you that some soldiers left the army and joined the Interahamwe.  You should understand how they did that or why they did that.  The leaders, military chiefs, were surprised by the Interahamwe.  The army, of course, was stronger than the Interahamwe, but since the leaders of the Interahamwe were the same as the leaders of the army, everybody became an Interahamwe.  Everything we did was approved by the army.  They said, "Do this and do that."  It is, therefore, clear that everything was planned such that be it the army, be it the Interahamwe, it was the same family, if you will. 
Q.	After President Habyarimana was murdered, on the 7th and the 8th of April, you, together with the group that you belonged to, engaged in what you described as "the most murderous attacks on innocent people in your area."  That is correct, isn't it? 
A.	I said we were ordered to kill the Tutsis.  I did not say that it was the most murderous attack.  You are putting words into my mouth.  I am saying that we were ordered to kill all of the Tutsi.
Q.	My recollection is that you said that the most murderous attacks took place on the 7th and the 8th of April, and thereafter there was little killing in which you participated; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  These were big attacks, huge attacks; yes, massive attacks.  I did say that the biggest attacks took place on the 7th and the 8th.  Thereafter, the attacks were not as big. They were -- tended to hunt down an individual who was hidden here and there.  They were not large scale.
Q.	After the 8th of April, can you just remind us how many were killed, for example, in your presence in attacks which you participated after the 8th of April?  Simple question; simple answer, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the interpreters did not clearly understand your question, would you mind repeating?
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you remind us, Mr. Witness, of the numbers killed in attacks that you participated in or were witness to after the 8th of April?  A simple question, and a simple answer, please.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we spent at least an hour, an hour and a half, going over this in great detail yesterday and the day before.  Mr. Robinson covered this area expansively.  Now, clearly Mr. Hooper has a right to cross-examine this witness -- I am not questioning his right to cross-examine the witness -- but are we going to spend another half hour going over the issue of simple numbers of killing.  I think it has gone past the point where this line of question is relevant or productive.  The witness has dealt with this at length.
MR. HOOPER:
In the time that that somewhat lengthy objection was made, the witness could have answered the question several times over.  Simple question and a simple answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
The 7th and the 8th, there were more than 300 Tutsi victims.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Witness.  

After the 8th, how many attacks with how many dead did you participate in?
A.	After the 8th, I no longer participated in the attacks.  I said that I was aware of four other victims who were killed at the roadblock.  I also spoke of the attacks at the court of appeals, but I said that I was not present, and that more than 300 people were killed during the attack on the court of appeals.
Q.	So we come back to the question a moment ago.  Do you agree that the most murderous attacks took place on the 7th and the 8th?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He has already answered that question.  Please move on to another question, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I think, by that, the answer was yes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	On the 7th and 8th, did the government order you to kill?
A.	I told you who had given the orders.  But the state is in charge of ensuring the safety of the population. Why did we kill civilians and the state did not punish us?  Doesn't that demonstrate that the state supported our actions?
Q.	A simple question capable of an answer yes or no and then, if you want, an expansion.  The question is: On the 7th and 8th, did the government order you to kill?  Yes or no, please.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you have already put that question to the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
I didn't get an answer.  I am posing it for that reason.  It's an important question. 
THE WITNESS:
I responded by saying the following:   I gave you the names of the people who gave us orders and apparently, visibly, the state supported our actions.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I am going to try one more time.  Did the government order you to kill on the 7th or the 8th, yes or no?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
That question has already been answered and you should not ask it again.  You are starting to badger the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I -- can someone provide me with the answer because I haven't had an answer.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you not listening when the witness answers your questions?  Please look at your notes.  You can find this in -- if you haven't taken notes, you can find it in the transcript. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am listening with keen interest, and I have not heard an answer to this question. 
JUDGE ARREY:
I have got an answer: "The government gave me the names of the people."  It says so. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to Your Honour, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
I did hear. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Isn't it right, Witness, that there was no government on the 7th and 8th, that no government was installed until the 9th of April; isn't that right?
A.	If there was no government, there were leaders; leaders who had power during that transitional period.  And I will point out that even after the installation of the new government, it continued.
Q.	I am dealing with the murderous attacks of the 7th and the 8th.  Do you agree that there was no government in place on those days?
A.	Was the country ruling itself?  Certainly there were leaders.
Q.	There was chaos, wasn't there?  Do you understand what I mean by chaos?  
A.	I have understood.  I have understood you quite well.  But, please, you were not in the country, I was in the country.  It was not chaos; the leaders were there. 
Q.	And in that chaos, you killed and killed and killed, didn't you?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection.  He said there was no chaos, so to then -- I am sorry. 
MR. HOOPER:
I will ask another question. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Who were the leaders?
A.	I believe a committee was set up.  Ask Bagosora and his ilk because they know.  You can also ask the military officials at the time.  They will tell you.
Q.	Was this something you knew at the time?  Did you know this on the 7th and the 8th, that there was a committee? Can I ask you that?
A.	Yes, of course, I knew.
Q.	How did you know?
A.	I was listening to the radio.
Q.	Listening to the radio after the president was killed, did you hear an order by the ministry of defence that all people were to stay indoors?  Do you remember that?
MR. HOOPER:
Please let him answer.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.  This has gone way past the scope of the direct examination.  If the Court is going to allow inquiry into those general matters, the structure of the questioning has to change.  Counsel would have to adopt the style of making direct questions to the witness.  Leading questions at this point would be inappropriate, and I'm suggesting that we have gone way past the scope of the direct examination.  And the cross-examination of this witness does have to come to an end at some point.  We've been with this witness for the past three weeks.  If you look at your calendars, we've been -- took direct examination for one week, cross-examination for two weeks; we are into the third week now.  This has to stop at some point. 
MR. HOOPER:
I have been on my feet for not an hour, and again and again you get up to protect your witness, I suggest.  You make unnecessary interventions.  Now, the reason why this witness, in my respectful submission, should answer this question is that this witness, in-chief said that he --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, if we could gain time that would be useful. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My simple concern is we are going from the events in Ruhengeri to events on a national scale, events in Kigali.  This witness does not have the basis to comment on events in Kigali and decisions of a political nature, and so on and so forth.  It is not fruitful to take the scope of his examination beyond the events in Ruhengeri; that was the substance of his direct examination.  I am simply asking the Court to exercise some discretion to keep the cross-examination within the bounds that were anticipated by the Rules.  

Now, I don't want to interrupt Defence counsel.  I would prefer to listen to a cross-examination without interrupting, but I interrupt when there is a need to do so because the questions are too far afield or improperly put to the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, can I just briefly respond?  The question, you may recall --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but Counsel, we are taking a great deal of time on a matter as to whether the witness heard this announcement on the radio or not.  

Mr. Witness, did you hear the announcement on the radio?  Please say yes or no.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I heard that announcement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you move on to another question, Counsel?
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So why did you go down to the marketplace in Mukingo for a cup of tea, if you were meant to stay indoors?
A.	That's what I wanted to do.  It's my private life; I wanted to go there, and as I have said, I was going to take my breakfast there.
Q.	But the authority in the country had told you to stay indoors.  You weren't listening to any authority, were you?  And you went down to the marketplace, not to have a cup of tea --
A.	But the problem is that all these people, Kajelijeli, Baheza, Nyabusore made those announcements.  Why did they leave their homes to go to the place where I indicated?  They themselves didn't obey their own orders.  So I left my house in order to go and take my breakfast; I was free to do so.  I explained what happened subsequently.  So why did they not punish all those who had left their homes?  Why did they not punish all those who went to kill subsequently, if indeed they wanted everybody to stay indoors?
Q.	Did you really go downtown to have a cup of tea or was it to get busy to start working?
A.	Listen, in our area -- in our area, my home and the place to which I went to take my breakfast is not separated by more than*************.  I was free to move around within my area.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
If you would please move on to another question, Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The people you listened to, people like Kajelijeli you mentioned, they were local men, local men with local power, that's right, isn't it?
A.	Let me tell you that Nzirorero was the most respected person in Mukingo, and even throughout the country he was a very influential person.  You are asking me questions regarding events which took place in Mukingo.  We respected Nzirorero, Kajelijeli, Baheza and Nyabusore.  Nyabusore was a director; he was an influential person.  These persons were very influential and everything they ordered was obeyed.  They were our leaders. 
Q.	When the minister of defence came on the radio and told you to stay indoors, you didn't listen to that order, did you?  You disobeyed it.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
This question has already been put to the witness and he has answered sufficiently. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You were listening to the radio, and I want to ask you whether you may have heard some other comments over those days.  Did you hear an announcement by the officers of the army of the FAR not to attack each -- one another, and to avoid criminal actions?  Do you remember hearing that on the radio?
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.  If you were going to ask the witness what he heard on the radio, at this point you should ask the witness, "Tell us some of things you heard."  You cannot put these facts to the witness.  It was not covered in the direct examination. We have gone far beyond the scope of the direct examination.  If the Court is going to allow the Defence to go into other areas, the style of questioning has to change as well. This is going into new area now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, I don't want to take up time at this point, but in my submission the Prosecution have got this aspect of the Rules of Evidence quite wrong, and I am asking questions under Rule 90(G) permitting me to ask this witness questions relating to the Defence case.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no dispute with Rule 90, my submission is that there is not - there is insufficient foundation for asking questions about materials that were beyond the scope of the direct examination.  If Counsel is going to be allowed to go into new areas, the foundation has to be laid for it, and the foundation has to be through direct questions, not through leading questions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think the Chamber must exercise control here.  Since you are moving away from the scope of the examination-in-chief, we are going to ask you to move on to another thing.  We have done this several times and you are coming back to this announcement on the radio.  We have already told you that you need to move on to other questions.  The witness did not ever speak about this thus far.
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, the Prosecutor has said on a number of occasions -- Mr. Webster has said that questions have to be laid if they are outside examination-in-chief, and I ask for him to support that proposition by authorities.  It's a matter of considerable importance.  

Madam President, I am asking these questions because they are relevant to the Defence case.  And if I can put you in the picture, it may assist you as to the geography of my position; it's simply this.  The Defence - can the witness take his earphones off while this goes on, please?  Can the witness take his earphones off?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, please.  I do not think we need to go into this discussion, given the fact that the Chamber has the Rules; the Chamber knows what it needs to do.  We have already given you our standpoint.  We are not going to listen to any exchanges between you.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Let me ask another question.  

I see Mr. Robinson is on his feet. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  Mr. Webster has misinformed you with respect to the direct examination.  On the 31st March, Mr. Webster asked this witness whether the interim government ever --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Robinson, we have already dealt with the issue.  Mister -- the Prosecutor did not mislead us in any way whatsoever.  We know what we are doing.  Please trust us and please go on.  Could you allow your learned friend Mr. Hooper to continue with his cross-examination, because if we continue with this kind of defence (sic) between the Prosecutor and the Defence, we are going to waste a great deal of time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't mean to waste your time.  I think I have an obligation as an officer of the Court, when something is stated that is not correct, to correct the record, to at least make an effort to assist in the administration of justice here.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, that is true.  But what we have said here, you also heard what we said.  We have said that we are going to be controlling the debate if it moves away from the scope of the examination-in-chief, and many questions have already been asked which have had nothing to do with the examination-in-chief.  So, we do know exactly what we have to do.  We do not believe that someone can mislead us.  We thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Hooper, you may proceed, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
I see the time.  I have got one other topic to come to.  But, before I turn to that, I ask that the witness either leave the court or remove his earphones, and raise a matter with you, Madam President, which is of some importance.  I would rather not - I would feel more open talking about it without this witness listening.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to take a break now, and when we come back you will be able to make your observation before the witness is ushered in; 15-minute break. 
(Court recessed from 1120H to 1137H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is called to order.  Who is speaking?  Is it Mr. Hooper?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to make a motion at this time.  It is a motion for reconsideration of your decision that the question regarding efforts to stop the killing by the authorities is beyond the scope of the direct examination.  In support of my motion, I would like to read to you from the transcript of the direct examination on the 1st of April, on page 15, line 20.  And the question by Mr. Webster was: "What about the interim government?  Did you ever receive any instructions, directly or indirectly from the government to stop the killings?" And the answer was, "No.  The government never ordered us to stop the killings."  It's my submission that the questions that Mr. Hooper was trying to ask, which are important to all of us, was directly within the scope of that question and that answer, as he was about to put to the witness, statements made by the authorities in which they were urging the population to stop the killing.  

And so, on that basis, now that I have accurately informed you of the record in this case, I ask that you reconsider your decision and allow the question.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Roach.
MR. ROACH:
Your Honour, this question as to what attempts were made by the government or by those who had powers to stop the killings is a very important one for my client who, as you know, was the president of the MRND.  And, in as much as it's going to be imputed to him or he will be deemed to have been a person in authority, it is important for us to know the answer to these questions as to what steps were taken.  

And I would implore the Court, in the interest of equity and fairness, tol allow exploration of this question as to the -- what the radio announcements were, what the army announcements were with respect to the attempt to stop the killings.  

Thank you very much, Your Honour.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One of you has to sit down because I am seeing two counsel on their feet.

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Before the adjournment, Madam President, you said that we have to trust you.  You needn't have said that.  We have got absolutely no choice but to trust you, and we need to trust you; we have to trust you.  

I was rather surprised to hear, after I had been on my feet about 40 minutes, an issue of time.  What's gone before my cross-examination has been out of my hands in terms of time.  I hope I am putting relevant questions.  I'd ask you to trust me to ask relevant questions.  I'd be so bold as to say that if you can show me an irrelevant question on any of the transcripts that come back from this morning, I will eat the page on which it is on.  

There has been, this morning, numerous objections by the Prosecutor, a hundred when Mr. Robinson was on his feet, and he is doing pretty well now I am on my feet; and he is acting in the interests of his case.  What concerns me is that you, Madam President, have been reaching decisions without any recourse to inviting the Defence to offer any view as to the merits of the objection.   In respect of this issue, I am concerned that the Court -- Tribunal hasn't seen the relevance of the questions.  It does disturb me. 

This witness, we maintain -- and he is not in court and I speak more freely -- engaged in all his murderous acts, in the main, at a time when there was no government, and you know my position in this case.  He said that there was no -- that the government never told them to stop killing.  He has told us now that he listened to the radio and he heard what was said by an authority, who wasn't some local warlord or some such, but, in fact, the minister of defence, instructing him to stay at home, and he has just cheerily gone off and done his own thing, lived his own life which, in this context, meant taking the lives of others.  That is deeply relevant.

I find, with respect, some of the restrictions put on me in this case, today and before, so restrictive that I have to ask myself what proper merit there is in my continuing in this case, if I cannot in fact advance, reasonably advance a Defence case.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you very much, Madam President.  

I wanted to support Mr. Peter Robinson's motion because in this trial, Madam President, Your Honours, it is often a matter of the MRND, the government and various institutions.  Furthermore, the Prosecutor in the indictment that I have, the draft indictment that I have, because let me say in passing that we do not have the final version of the indictment in French, and therefore I am forced to work with a draft indictment in the French; and one can note in that draft that the Prosecution is making a distinction between two periods of time: before the 8th of April and after the 8th of April.  And with regard, in specific terms, to the period after the 8th of April, the Prosecutor often refers to the interim government and to the MRND.  Now, on the transcripts of the 1st of April, indeed that question was, indeed, raised as to whether or not there was any announcement asking the Rwandan citizens to stop the killings.  

And this is why, Madam President, Your Honours, I respectfully wish to express my support of the motion filed by Mr. Peter Robinson.  I thank you. 
(Pages 16 to 32 by Judith Baverstock)

	1145H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Yes, Mr. Webster, do you wish to respond to this?   
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, just briefly, Your Honour.  First of all, I am a bit surprised by Mr. Hooper's submission.  To me, it sounds like a veiled threat to strike, and I don't feel that's an appropriate way to address the concerns that he has. 

We've all made great efforts to push this -- to move this trial forward, both on the Defence side, the Prosecution side and the Chambers.  That's what we're trying to do.  We're all here trying to make the wheels of justice turn.  So if I object, it's for a good reason; it's not to interrupt the counsel unnecessarily.  And in my opinion, I have been rather conservative with my objections.  If I was pleading in an American court, there would be many more objections because the form in which some of these questions have come is really objectionable.  I have been conservative and very reserved in objecting, and I do so simply to put things on a proper course.  

With respect to the question that Mr. Hooper -- the last question that he asked that I objected to, it's not simply a matter of going beyond the scope of the direct examination; it's the form of the question.  There are many questions that were put to the witness that went far beyond the direct examination.  And my concern is not that it's not going beyond the direct, because the Rules allow for that, but it's the form of the question.  Once we go beyond the direct examination of the witness, we cannot simply put leading questions to the witness in the same manner.  Some foundation has to be laid, and it's on the question of foundation that I had my strongest objections.  

Now, in view of Mr. Robinson's submission, my question to the witness when he was on direct about efforts of the interim government, I can see his point in regard to that particular question.  But what I heard Mr. Hooper asking about was a communiqué from the ministry of defence and the minister of defence and so on and so forth, which goes beyond what I had asked on the direct.  And I am not suggesting that he cannot ask a question about the ministry of defence, but there has to be a foundation for it.  Once the foundation is laid, then if it goes too far beyond the cross, then I will object.  But, fundamentally, my concern was that the foundation had not been laid for the type of question he was asking.  And I thought that I made that clear.  There were two prongs to my submission: the foundation for the question and then its relevancy and the appropriateness of asking questions that go so far beyond the direct.  

As for Mr. Sow, if he is working with a draft of the indictment, then he is certainly derelict in his duties, or CMS is derelict in their duties, because we all have a copy of the indictment, both in French and in English.  It was the basis for the initial appearance of the Accused, I think on the 23rd of February, if I am not mistaken.  I am not quite sure of the date, but clearly there is an English language original and a French translation that was served on the registry, and that formed the basis for the initial appearance of his client.  So he's working from a draft.  That is really his problem.  

I think I've completed my submission.  I would like to move this ahead.  I am not trying to be obstructive.  I am trying to advance this trial on a proper footing with questions that are fair, both from the Defence side and the Prosecution side.  We've gone far beyond what was brought forth in the direct.  I'm not objecting to that because the Court has latitude to allow that.  But if we do go to areas beyond the direct, the proper foundation has to be laid, and the questions cannot be in the same form that they would be for the matters that we went into on the direct.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
There may be a significant difference between the view that Mr. Webster takes of the jurisprudence relating to the asking of leading questions and to what, we would submit, is a reasonable interpretation of the Rules.  

I am not going to go into that now, but there is this difference, and it's borne perhaps largely out of the fact that in American courts there are restrictions which do not apply in any other common law jurisdiction, and Mr. Webster perhaps should leave some of the American baggage behind.  It's not appropriate here.  The important issues here are whether questions are relevant.  

The issue of laying a foundation to a question is an alien concept to many of us.  The questions I was asking went to an issue, a subject, in the words of the Statute, or the Rules, I should say -- went to a subject that was raised in chief, in any event.  There is a further two basis on which I could justify the question, but I'll stick with that one.  

It's on issue that was a subject of his evidence-in-chief, and there's two aspects to it.  He's dealt with one, this witness; that is, the factual story that he wanted to present to you of having a cup of tea when he's whisked along on this enterprise.  But then there's the more important issue of who he takes his orders from, and the other issue which rose in chief, and that is that no one from government told him to stop killing.  And that last matter is a very important matter.  

And the questions that I am putting to this witness, whether they are in a leading form or not, doesn't matter.  They go to that subject, and they go to seek to contradict him.  And in cross-examination that's my job, matters that are raised in chief to be clarified or contradicted.  

In terms of leading questions, for example, on the factual issue, the factual issue of the minister of defence announcement, this witness acknowledges that he heard such an announcement from a superior authority, far superior to anyone kicking around Mukingo, you might think.  And what's his reaction?  He totally disregards it.  He says he has no need to have any resource to it at all.  That's very significant, and it colours his entire behaviour and attitude, doesn't it?  

I've got a number of other broadcasts.   I am not going to go through all the broadcasts -- we'll be here all morning, but I'm going to put some other broadcasts to him and ask him if he's listening to the radio, heard any of these too, that's if you give me leave to.  And after that I have one issue.  

I told the Prosecutor yesterday, when we were able to catch up with him, that we would be an hour to an hour and a half this morning.  We've been bang on.  We'd have been a lot shorter without the interruption and with some shorter answers, perhaps, from the garrulous witness.  Some of that garrulousness, I invited; I agree, Madam President, that's sometimes the risk of sound questions.  But we're not here to take up time.  We're spot on what we thought was reasonable.  We've covered quite a lot of ground.  I've got one principal area left to cover with him.  I told the Prosecutor we'd all be done and dusted -- if that can be translated into French -- by twelve o'clock.  And without many of these objections this morning, we'd have reached that target with considerable time to spare.  

So we trust you, Madam President, but we deserve to be trusted as well.  And as I said, perhaps 
Mr. Webster can leave some of the American baggage behind. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
(Speaking over interpretation)...and whether we call it foundation or we call it by another name, I think it's an issue that's worthy of a bit more discussion, because the issue of the question that was raised goes exactly to the point of foundation.  

Mr. Hooper cannot have it both ways.  My question on direct to the witness was about the interim government.  Did the interim government issue any directive to stop the killing?  The witness's answer was no.  Mr. Hooper then leads the witness down the path -- the whole structure of his questioning is to suggest that there was no governmental authority in place for a few days and then goes on to say, "Did the department of defence, or the ministry of defence, make some sort of communiqué?"  Well, he cannot on the one hand develop a whole line of questioning to suggest that there was no government in place and then use my question on direct about the interim government to say, "Well, the Prosecutor raised it in his direct; I should be able to go into it."  So that's the question: it's foundation.  

From the perspective of this witness, was there governmental authority in place?  That has to be explored before we get to the leading question of, well, didn't the ministry of defence say such-and-such on such-and-such a day?  So that's the whole issue.  It's an issue of foundation.  

So I beg to differ on that point, and I think that the Defence is trying to have their cake and eat it too.

Now, the question -- the area of enquiry, there is some relevance to it, but it's relevant only when you lay the proper foundation to go into those areas.  Once the foundation is laid and you are asked the question in the proper way, then the Court can decide whether we're going too far away from the direct or not.  And that's my concern.  And I think this is the third time I've tried to make the same point. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just -- on one matter very briefly.  It's very strange.  One glance at the indictment, we can see what the Prosecution case here -- this is a non-contentious issue.  There was no government in place until the 9th of April.  This is his case.  

Now, why are we wasting time?  It's like a man charged with a bank robbery, and no sooner do the defence start asking questions about the bank when the prosecution stands up and says, "Well, we haven't said there's any money in the bank."  It is quite extraordinary.  We can save a lot more time, surely, with the Prosecution actually considering the substance of their case and appreciating these are not contentious issues.  Let the Defence lead the witness to them.  It's just timesaving. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  After having heard the parties, the Chamber is of the opinion that within the Tribunal we have the custom of examining the grounds for an objection before sustaining or dismissing it.  With regard to the question which was raised, we had a problem, especially with the form of the question, and that is what we're asking of the Defence; in other words, to try and put questions in such an a way that the witness understands what he's being asked, and not to make suggestions which show a line towards the answer.  This is why we had a problem with regard to this question.  

But given what has been said thus far, we are now going to have the witness ushered in, and we're going to ask Mr. Hooper to put his question to the witness by enabling him to fully understand the question being put to him. 
(Witness enters courtroom)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I was asking you about the radio, and you told us that you listened to Radio Rwanda and you listened to RTLM.  You told us that you had heard the announcement on the morning of the 7th of April from the ministry of defence to stay indoors, but you lived your own life, and you chose to go out instead.  And that was the point we had reached.  

In subsequent days -- and this is my question -- did you hear any announcements at all on the radio, asking people not to kill one another; did you hear anything like that?
A.	I heard no such announcement.  It is true that I didn't listen to the same radio station all of the time.  When Habyarimana died, the next morning, early, 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning, we heard an announcement saying that all citizens had to remain at home, but we had a right to go out.  We went outside.  

On the 7th and the 8th we went out to do what we did.  Thereafter, we heard other announcements saying that the Inyenzis had been killed and so on and so forth.
Q.	Did you ever hear, for example, a préfet say on the radio that it was forbidden to attack others?  Did you ever hear anything like that?
A.	No.
Q.	Did you ever hear Prime Minister Kambanda on the radio?  Did you ever hear him on the radio?
A.	Yes, I heard him.  He said that in the fields people had to carry their weapons with them.
Q.	Did you ever hear him say anything to the effect that you were to avoid anything which divides the Rwandese people, especially the ethnic factor?  Did you hear him say anything about that at all?
A.	No, I never heard such things.  I heard him say that the peasants had to use their weapons in their fields so that when the enemies attacked they could counterattack.
Q.	Did you ever hear the bishops and priests of Rwanda calling for an end to killing or anything like that?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, your own préfet, Préfet Baryangu --
A.	Yes, that was him.
Q.	You told us about him, and he was killed.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	He was killed, that is indeed what I said.
Q.	What did you understand to be the circumstances of his death?
A.	All that I know is that we were told he was killed on the 7th and that he was in Kigali when that happened.
Q.	Let me ask you this.  Did you ever hear that in fact he and his family were murdered by the RPF in a part of Remera called Kigali.  Did you ever hear anything like that, or is today the first time you've heard it?
A.	All that I know is that he lived in Remera.  We were told that he was killed with his family.  No one said exactly if it was the Interahamwe or the Inkotanyi who had killed him.
Q.	He was MRND, wasn't he?
A.	I have no idea.
Q.	You have no idea even what the political membership was of the préfet of your own prefecture; is that the position?  No idea?
A.	No, he was préfet for a very short period.  He replaced Nzabageragaza.  So I can't say in which political party he was.  He had a meeting with the population.  He would have had to do that for us to be able to know, but nobody ever told me from which party he was from.
Q.	And Baryangu, for the record is B-A-R-Y-A-N-G-U.  And he being dead, there was no préfectural authority in Ruhengeri; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, that is not true, because there is Ntarwanda who was sous-préfet.  That person replaced him.  That's how Bazel Nsabumugisha was appointed thereafter.
Q.	And Bazel's name is spelt N-S-A-B-U-M-U-G-I-S-H-A.   And he replaces the dead préfet.  Now, in your evidence, you said that he was installed at a meeting at Gisisero football pitch about two weeks after the commencement of the events.  I am going to put two dates to you, and you can tell us whether you can agree with them, whether they conform with your recollection.  Was the installation on Thursday the 22nd of April?
A.	I don't remember the date.  I told you when he was appointed.  It wasn't during that meeting.  They came to introduce him to the population during that meeting.  He was appointed two weeks after the beginning of the massacres, so I can't tell you the exact date.
Q.	I appreciate, after such a long period, dates are difficult, but if I were to suggest to you that he was appointed on a Sunday, the 18th of April, would that be about right, as far as you can remember?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the question.  The witness has already answered.  He says he does not remember the date.
MR. HOOPER:
Do the Prosecution take any objection to the date I put to the witness?  Do they dispute that date or not want to acknowledge it or what may be the position?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not being directly examined here.  I don't answer questions from the Defence about the substance of the case.  All I am suggesting to you is that the witness has answered the question; he has given you an answer to the question you asked, so now go ahead and ask him, "does the 18th sound about right," is inappropriate, and I am objecting on that basis. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I invite the Prosecutor to assist not me but the Tribunal as to the date, if they know the date.  If they don't know it, then they can't help us.  I am putting the 18th, the Sunday. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I'm assuming the question is being put to the Court now.  Is that the situation?
MR. HOOPER:
I don't direct questions to you.  I direct them through the President.  

I'm sorry, we're going too quickly.  

I'll recap.  I put a date which I believe is within the knowledge of the Prosecution, and they can confirm it or not, but it would assist everyone, including this Tribunal, if, at an early stage, we knew what dates we're talking about.  It's very significant.  I'm suggesting it was Sunday, the 18th of April that he was appointed.  

The Prosecution have documents that illustrate that, in my submission, and that was he installed, I suggest, on Thursday the 22nd of April.  That's the matter I am putting.  

Now, we can spend a lot of time on it or the Prosecution can say, "Yes, well, we accept that," or they can say, "We don't."  That's the position.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would think that André Rwamakuba is the best person to inform you about that.  He was a member of the MDR.  You have contact with your client, you can take instructions from your client, and if you're conducting an investigation --
MR. HOOPER:
Please, don't direct me directly.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- your client is the starting point.
MR. HOOPER:
You should address me through the President.  I'm sorry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please allow to us deliberate. 

We are asking you not to intervene in that matter.  

Witness, can you confirm that date or not? 
THE WITNESS: 
I've already answered.  All that I know is that he was installed two weeks after the beginning of the hostilities, but I can't give you an exact date.  I can't be exact.  What I am saying is there is a difference between the date of the actual nomination or appointment and the date when the préfet was introduced to the population.  I don't know when he was installed, but I do know that he was presented or introduced to the population two weeks after the beginning of the hostilities. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And it's the installation that really we're concerned with.  I accept that.  

So two weeks after the start of hostilities, seven and 14, two weeks, is 21.  I am putting it was Thursday, the 22nd.  You can't help us further, but that would comply, wouldn't it, with the position?  

Now, your recollection of what happened and what was said at that meeting ten years ago, would it be fair to say it's not clear and distinct at all?
A.	I did not say that I forgot the events.  I told you that Bazel was introduced to the population.  I answered, and you asked what happened that day, and I told you.  All that I know is that he was introduced to us two weeks after the massacres began. 
Q.	Can you remember if Radio Rwanda or RTLM were present, making any record that was subsequently broadcast; can you remember?
A.	I don't remember.
Q.	Can you remember if you saw any members of UNAMIR, the United Nations force, present?
A.	No.  I told you who I saw at that location.
Q.	And you told us that the meeting started at 10:00 in the morning and went on until 1500H or so in the afternoon; that's right, isn't it?
A.	That is right.
Q.	You remember the minister of the interior making a speech; is that right?
A.	Correct.
Q.	Can you remember what he said?
A.	I gave you a general overview of the message delivered during his speech.  I even think in my written statements I've given that same type of overview of what the minister of interior said.
Q.	And today you can remember him saying all that, can you?
A.	I remember that he spoke of security, of Inkotanyi, about Habyarimana's death, that they had shown up to install a new préfet, and he told us that we have to maintain security.
Q.	Would it surprise you to learn that there was no minister of the interior in the country at that time, no minister of the interior in the country until the end of May; would that surprise you?
A.	In that case, you would have to show me who else came to install the new préfet.  I know that an authority from the ministry of interior came to install the new préfet.
Q.	You were present at that meeting, were you?
A.	I was.
Q.	Casimir Bizimungu, what was he the minister of, can you remember?
A.	I believe that he was minister of health at that time.
Q.	Was he present?  Did you see him there?
A.	He was there.
Q.	And you are quite sure you saw him that day?
A.	Yes, I confirm that, and I'll confirm it again.
Q.	You're sure, for example, that it wasn't someone else from the ministry of health?  It is definitely the minister, Casimir Bizimungu; that's your evidence, yes?
A.	I know Casimir Bizimungu very well.  Even if you were to bring him here before me, I'll show you who he is.
Q.	Incidentally, the new préfet, Bazel Nsabumugisha, do you know where he is, where he might be today?
A.	He is a detainee in Ruhengeri prison.
Q.	Jerome Bicamumpaka, B-I-C-A-M-U-M-P-A-K-A, you saw him there, did you?
A.	I did see him, yes.
Q.	Had you seen him before?
A.	No, I only heard about him.
Q.	And how did you know it was him?
A.	He was introduced to us.  If somebody is introduced to you, from that point you'll know who that person is.
Q.	Did you ever see him again afterwards?
A.	No.
Q.	Can you describe him to us?
A.	He's not very dark-skinned nor very light skinned. 
Q.	Very well.  That wouldn't help me picking him out in a crowd.  Could you help us a bit more?
A.	All that I know, I have been told that people change over the years.  You can be light skinned, whereas before you used to be darker skinned, and vice versa.
Q.	As I have discovered.  Would it surprise you to learn that he was in Kinshasa?  Would it surprise you to learn that he was in Kinshasa?
A.	It would surprise me.  Give proof.  He has to come; he has to give evidence before the Tribunal saying -- attesting to the fact that he wasn't there or was somewhere else.
Q.	Donate Murego, is that someone you have heard of or no?
A.	No, Murego was not present at that time.
Q.	Now, he was a member of MDR, wasn't he; did you know that?
A.	He was a member of the MDR, correct.
Q.	And he came from Ruhengeri, did he not?
A.	Yes.  I explained that he was a native of Ruhengeri, but he had activities in Kigali.  He never came to hoist his flag in Ruhengeri préfecture.
Q.	Well, that would have been a very dangerous thing to do, wouldn't it?  Was he at this meeting?
A.	No, I never said he was present at the meeting. 
Q.	When did you first hear the words "MDR-Power", according to you?
A.	I heard "MDR-Power" for the time after Habyarimana's plane went down.  It was said MDR-Power supported from that time on the MRND and that the MDR had split into two factions, and that each faction had its own committee. 
Q.	Now, you've already explained how very little you knew about politics in your own party and that you didn't give a -- you had no feelings at all or interest in the other parties.  When did you have this knowledge come your way and how?
A.	I heard of that when Karamira announced it over the radio.  I knew because it was said that the 
MDR-Power, from that point on, was supporting the MRND and that we should no longer consider the MDR-Power wing as enemies. 
Q.	Did you ever hear Karamira, Froduald Karamira, on the radio, instructing the MDR people not to hurt one another, to respect each other, that one (sic) person is equal?  Did you hear anything said like that by him?
A.	No, but I heard him ask the population to receive the means for civilian self-defence.
Q.	In your evidence, as I recall, you told us that during this meeting at Gisesero, one of the things that you were told was that the extremist wings of the parties had joined together; is that right?
A.	No, you are putting words in my mouth.
Q.	Later, you're imprisoned and you eventually get out, and during the time that you spent since 1994, would it be fair to say you've gone through a process of re-education; would that be fair?
A.	When you are held in prison, you are not taught anything; you are placed in prison.  Nobody teaches you anything.  All that happens to you is that you are under detention.
Q.	But weren't you given talks as to what had happened and what had gone on, in an effort to give you prisoners the wider picture, as it were?  Didn't you receive any talks at all while you were in prison from the authorities and from others?
A.	No, the authorities didn't need to come to talk to us; rather, they needed to come and contact us so that we could give them the true version of the events, how the indents happened.  It's not up to them to come and talk to us.  We are the ones who needed to inform them, maybe.  All that they gave us in the way of teaching was religious education, because in prison religious activities were quite far advanced. 
Q.	Again, my recollection of part of your evidence was that there came a time when you discovered that people were making statements against you, people outside the prison had made statements against you, and that you were surprised about that.  Do you remember saying that?
A.	I said that on the outside there were people who accused me, and that's quite normal.  I learned this when we received our case files, and I received this kind of information from persons who were on the outside.  Outside the prison, I mean.
Q.	My recollection -- it may be wrong -- was that you said were you surprised to discover that; is that right?  Were you surprised to discover people had made statements against you from outside?
A.	That might surprise me.  All that depended on the kind of accusations levelled against me.  The essence is that in fact I recognised the fact that there were people outside who were accusing me of having committed certain crimes.
Q.	You told us that you went back to Rwanda after only a month.  In August of '94 you returned to Ruhengeri; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	You went back very quickly.
A.	That's what I wanted.  I wanted to go back home.  Congo was not my country.  I wanted to go back home, and I did so.
Q.	It wasn't in order to intimidate survivors who lived there, was it, not to tell the truth, not to implicate you and others?
A.	Did I tell you that I threatened them so that they did not denounce me?  Did I say that in my testimony?  You are the one thinking that maybe, but, I'm sorry, I didn't say anything of that nature.
Q.	But did that happen?
A.	What?  I never threatened anyone. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  We thank you, Counsel. 

Mr. Webster, do you wish to have re-examination of this witness? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I would, Your Honour.  I have a few -- actually just a few -- three quick matters and one relatively short matter that I'd like to go into.  It shouldn't take us more than a half hour at the most. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, during your cross-examination -- excuse me.  Yes.  During your cross-examination, you were questioned by Mr. Robinson about meetings that took place at the mother of Nzirorera's house, and during the course of your cross-examination you were offered an opportunity to look at a witness statement and compare a statement that you had made to investigators in 2002, I believe, to your testimony during direct, and this had to do with whether you were inside the house or outside the house when meetings were taking place at Nzirorera's mother's house.  

Thinking back over the last -- well, actually, thinking back to over ten years ago, thinking back to the period between 1991 through 1994, which is the period of time that you told us that these meetings took place, are you able to count out every single meeting that took place at Nzirorera mother's house? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  I have an objection to this question.  First of all, I'd like to object to the form of the question.  I don't think it's proper for Mr. Webster to make a long preparatory remark, introducing his question and directing it to other things that have come during the course of this examination.  It if he has a question to ask the witness, it is very simple to put the question, not give us a long preface.  So I object to the form of the question. 

Secondly, I think that just to -- since Mr. Webster is asking such a lengthy question, I think it is more applicable for the Trial Chamber to ask him to reformulate his question, to make the question shorter, to break it down into small elements so that the question could be easily understood by the witness, and we can have for the record a very clear answer to that question.  So I ask that you ask him to reformulate his question so that we don't take up a lot of time.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Mr. Webster, I think that what Mr. Robinson has just said has taken the words out of my mouth, as it were.  Can you please reformulate your question?
MR. WEBSTER:
I was really trying to direct the witness to a specific point in his cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, but I don't think that it's proper for Mr. Webster to explain in the presence of the witness what his goals are during the examination.  I think he should simply put a question to the witness.  This is a form of leading, and I think that when he's given direction by the Trial Chamber, he should simply take that direction and move forward.  We're all interested in moving forward here.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I indeed appreciate direction from the Trial Chamber, so I will follow the Trial Chamber's direction.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be able to count out every single meeting that you attended at Nzirorera's mother's house over the course of 1991 to 1994?  Is that something you are capable of doing?

MR. ROBINSON:
I object to that question, Your Honour.  This is a rhetorical question that obviously is not something that the witness is in a position to seriously answer.  And I object on the grounds that this is an improper question, asking the witness to speculate what he's able to do. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought it was a very direct question.  Is he able to mention or count out every single meeting he's ever attended between 1991 and 1994.  If he's able to do that, he can say yes; if he's not, he can say no. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can answer that question, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
No, I am unable to do so.  I do remember the meetings, the essential meetings, that took place, but as for the others, I have forgotten about them.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Is it your testimony, Mr. Witness, that you have never once set foot inside Mr. Nzirorera's house?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I am going to object.  That's a leading question.  Leading questions are not permitted on re-examination.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I beg to differ on that point.  I think leading questions are appropriate in re-examination, and this witness has given a lengthy direct examination and very, very lengthy cross-examination.  My question is not suggestive; it's simply asking -- it simply expedites matters to put it in that form.  I'm not trying to suggest an answer to the witness, so I think the question is appropriate. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I must support Mr. Robinson's intervention a moment ago.  The status of the Prosecutor's witness, that doesn't (unintelligible) and leading questions, apart from the answer, it being given no weight anyway, shouldn't be asked at this point.  

Expedition is one thing, but you don't circumvent the necessary restrictive rules dealing with your own witness. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In the first instance, the question was not leading. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please proceed, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you remember the question, and can you answer it, please?
A.	Yes, I do remember the question.  I frequently visited that family.  His brother, François Dusabimana, was my peer.  I was in school together with him.  We were in the same class.  Therefore, I know that house, but the meetings were held inside, and we would receive our instructions outside.  I never went into the house during the meetings.
Q.	Mr. Witness, with reference to Ngabire, you described for us the killing of Ngabire during your direct and it was explored in cross as well.  Can you --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I'm sorry to rise to my feet, but, again, it is improper for Mr. Webster to be making a speech before he puts a question and characterising what has gone on in this trial in the direct and in the cross.  If he has a question about Ngabire, he should put the question to the witness.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Here, I don't think there is a whole speech.  He hardly said a few words before putting his question to the witness.  

You may proceed, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you know the name of the Tutsi woman with whom Nzirorera had a child in Mukingo?
A.	Yes, I know her name.
Q.	Would you tell us her name again, please. 
A.	Her name was Kiberwa, Césarie.
Q.	Then who was Nyabuhu?
A.	Nyabuhu is another lady who was related to Kiberwa, but Nyabuhu was already dead before 1994.
Q.	Do you know if there is any relationship between Ngabire and Nyabuhu?
A.	Yes, Nyabuhu was maybe the aunt of Ngabire.  One could say that she was Ngabire's aunt.
Q.	Do you know if they lived together or in the same compound in Mukingo?
A.	Yes, they lived in the same compound.
Q.	What about Kiberwa?
A.	Kiberwa lived in Kigali.
Q.	Did you ever see her in Mukingo during the period of 1991 to 1994?
A.	No, I never saw her there during that period of time.
Q.	Well, when you would see -- did you ever see her in Mukingo, putting aside the dates?
A.	Yes, yes, she would come.  She would even come and visit us.  I knew her very well.  Before the period in question, she often came to her house in Mabanga, and she would even come to our house to visit my mother.
Q.	Well, okay.  The house in Mabanga, is that the same location where Nyabuhu was living?
A.	Yes, it's the same location.
Q.	Did you know the daughter that Kiberwa had?
A.	Yes, her name was Nyirabidabari.
Q.	Okay.  When you would see this person in Mukingo, do you know where she was staying?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  This question lacks foundation.  He first of all hasn't testified that he saw her in Mukingo, nor do we know the basis for which he would know where she was staying.  So I object on the foundation basis.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can rephrase the question.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you ever see this person?  You're talking about the daughter of Kiberwa.  Did you ever see her in Mukingo?
A.	Yes, I would see her.
Q.	Did you know where she resided, if and when she was in Mukingo?
A.	Yes, she lived at Mabanga where Nyabuhu and the others lived.
Q.	Okay.  So are we talking about one compound that was for the entire family?
A.	Yes, quite so; it's the same place.
Q.	Mr. Witness, how do you know that Nzirorera is the father of Kiberwa's child?
A.	It's rumour which had been ongoing for some time.  According to that rumour, that child was of born of Nzirorera.  I often visited Nzirorera's family, and I heard that said, and I also heard it said in other situations.
Q.	So Nzirorera himself was not in the habit of discussing these types of personal matters with you?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President, that's a leading question. 
THE WITNESS:
Oya.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, I'd ask that the answer be stricken until the Trial Chamber has made a ruling on my objection. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can rephrase the question.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera himself ever discuss these types of personal matters with you?
A.	No.
Q.	Directing your attention to the 7th of April in the morning, when Michel Niyigaba told you that he had received a call from Joseph Nzirorera or that he had spoken to him on the phone, did you have any reason to doubt the veracity of what he was saying at that time?

MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  That is a leading question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
How is it leading?  It's a fact already in evidence.  He's testified to it on direct and cross.  My simple question to him was, was there any reason that he would doubt the truth of what he was hearing from Michel Niyigaba.  In what respect is that a leading question? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, would you like me to respond to that? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please respond, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's a leading question because it suggests an answer.  When you ask a question "is there any doubt or did you have any doubt," that suggests an affirmative answer.  A non-leading question would be "what did you think when you heard such a preposition"  but to say "was there any doubt," it suggests an affirmative answer, so therefore the question is leading.
MR. ROACH:
Your Honour, I should like to remind the Chamber that I put to this witness a question as to whether or not he believed what he had heard with respect to the RPF shooting down the president's plane, and I was prevented from an answer to that question because it was deemed to be an inappropriate question.  We find that there's a similarity between this question now and the question that I put which I was prevented from answering (sic). 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, I don't see how the two questions are similar. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, can you please reformulate your question so that we can move forward.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did Michel Niyigaba tell you the morning of the 7th of April in relation to Ngabire?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  That has been asked and answered. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I asked the question; you objected.  I withdrew the question, I'm asking a different question, and you are suggesting that it's asked and answered.  How is it asked and answered?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, would you like me to respond to that?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, it's not necessary.  

Mr. Webster, can you please go ahead.  I think he's answered that question already.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, based on your familiarity with Mukingo, would there be any basis to confuse Nyabuhu with Kiberwa?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  That calls for speculation. 
THE WITNESS: 
I know Kiberwa --
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Excuse me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You can proceed with your question, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you answer the question, please. 
A.	Since I knew Kiberwa and Nyabuhu very well, I was able to distinguish one from the other.  There was no way that I would confuse them.  Maybe people confused them because Nyabuhu was living in the area.  Kiberwa did not frequently live in Mukingo commune.  I think maybe people believe that these children belonged to Nyabuhu whereas they were Kiberwa's children.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would like to move to strike the last portion of his answer as to what people maybe believed.  That is totally speculation.  He said he didn't confuse the two people; that's the answer.  The rest of it should be stricken.  Thank you.  I make that motion.
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness completely answered the question that was put to him.  There is no basis to strike any portion of his testimony. 
THE WITNESS: 
That was my answer.  That was my way of answering. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is of the opinion that the witness only answered the question, and that there is no need to strike out the end of his answer.  It will make an evaluation on that later -- an assessment on that later.  

Mr. Prosecutor, you may proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And between Ngabire and his sister, is there any reason why one would be confused with the other?
MR. ROBINSON:
Please, Madam President, I have to object.  This is totally in the realm of speculation.  Mr. Webster is trying to rescue the mistakes that he made in his indictment by saying that it's impossible to confuse things.  It's possible that someone could confuse Mr. Nzirorera with someone else too, but that doesn't become relevant.  What's relevant is what's actual.  So I'd ask that this be question be reformulated so that we don't have speculation.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may respond.  The proper foundation was laid for the question.  I brought out the fact from the witness that these people lived in the same location, that it was rumoured that Nzirorera was the father of both of them, that the two women could have been miss -- could have been confused, one with the other.  Having laid that foundation from that witness based on his answer, I think it's completely appropriate to ask him to summarise his response by clarifying whether there was any basis or reason to confuse one person with the other.

There is nothing leading.  There is nothing inappropriate.  It was a question that came on the tail end of a whole series of questions. 
MR. ROACH:
If I may. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, you have the floor now. 
MR. ROACH:
Obviously, the Prosecutor is trying to explain some discrepancy in the indictment, and it is not proper, I would submit, for him to ask the witness for some explanation that would make it look as though, well, this was an honest mistake on their part or not an honest mistake.  He's really already admitted that there was an error or something that has to be corrected.  And I think we've accepted that; we should move on from there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, can you put a different question to the witness, please.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did the familial relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and Ngabire have anything to do with Ngabire's death?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Your Honour.  That assumes facts not in evidence.  There is no familial relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and Ngabire, and the Prosecutor knows that because Kiberwa has told him that, that Nzirorera was not the father of Ngabire.  

So he's asking a question, first, that assumes facts not in evidence and, second, assumes facts he knows not to be true.  So I object. 

MR. WEBSTER:
This witness on at least two occasions has described the relationship that was perceived to exist between Ngabire and Joseph Nzirorera.  

My question to the witness is, was the perception between the familial relationship between Joseph Nzirorera and Ngabire a factor in his death. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Even that is a leading question, Madam President.  So I object on that basis as well. 
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, we can dance around this issue for the next hour, but this is an area that is going to be explored.  This witness has relevant testimony to offer on this point, and I will explore it.  So you can object as much as you like.  I will reformulate the question every time you object. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Madam President, I just want to say that I think for the first time Mr. Webster is feeling the frustration that those of us on the Defence feel when he made his numerous interventions, and so maybe he doesn't like to have an American defence attorney using American trial tactics that he's been using throughout this, but we're not going to sit here and take it.  So if he has a proper question, he should ask it, and if not, he should assume there would be an objection.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can assure the Court and the parties, that I am not the least bit frustrated.  I am more entertained than anything else.  So I am certainly entertained; I am not frustrated. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we're not entirely, for our part, entertained.  This witness has been giving evidence now for two weeks.  If you can ask a proper direct question, you can get your answer, and we can all go for lunch. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Rephrase your question, Mr. Webster, so that we can proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, given the stature of Nzirorera in your community, would it have been expected that you would kill the flesh and blood of a person that was so highly regarded in your community?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  Again, that calls for speculation, and it is also irrelevant what is expected or what is not.  It's not a direct question at all.  We asked him to put a direct question.  It calls for speculation.
MR. HOOPER:
And that was 100 percent leading as well.  And, you know, you demand certain demands of the Defence --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let's calm down.  Let's try to proceed.  We're not here for entertainment.  This is serious business.  Let us calm down. 

Mr. Webster, can you put a different question to the witness, because apparently here you are asking for the witness's opinion.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, under Rwandan law, a child of Joseph Nzirorera would be what ethnicity, please?
A.	That child would be a Hutu.
Q.	With regard to Ngabire, he was killed on the morning of the 7th.  Why was he killed on the morning of the 7th, himself being a Hutu?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  This has been asked and answered.  He's testified Ngabire was killed.  He related the conversation that Michel Nyagaba had with him, so that's been asked and answered. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You can answer that question, Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Ngabire was killed because the mother was Tutsi.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Were all persons with Tutsi mothers killed during that period, during that day?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I have to object.  The witness himself here is of a Tutsi mother.  That is a question which makes no sense.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Would you like to answer the question then?  I mean, it seems as if counsel is answering the question for the witness.  My question was directed to the witness that's testifying before us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, we're spending time with questions that are absurd. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please answer the question. 
THE WITNESS: 
No, not all.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When some were spared, why was that?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, lack of foundation.  How does he know? 

THE WITNESS:  
I know.  I know.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Excuse me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Answer the question, Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Those who were not killed gave money.  Some were hiding, and others had favours from relatives.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And in this context, Dusabimana, who you mentioned was the killer of Ngabire, did he have a relation with Ngabire?  What was his relationship to Ngabire?
A.	Yes, François Dusabimana is the same one who killed him.  Noel, Mutima's son -- Mutima was Nzirorera's younger brother.  He was killed by Muhumbo, who was the young brother of Noel.  Tamakemwa's (phonetic) driver was in on that.  That brother works for Nzirorera's young brother.  You see, all of these people had family relations between them. 
Q.	I'm interested in the family relationship between the killers of Ngabire and Ngabire himself.  Could you clarify that for us, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  Madam President, this assumes facts not only that are not in evidence but, that are not true and that Mr. Webster knows are not true.  

Please, there is no family relationship between Ngabire and Mr. Nzirorera.  That is established as a fact that the Prosecutor cannot deny.  And to ask a question based on that assumption is misleading the record and misleading the Trial Chamber.  It assumes facts that are not in evidence and that are not true. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may answer, Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
Ngabire was Nyirabidabari's brother.  Those who killed Nyirabidabari's brother are Nyirabidabari's uncles, and Nyirabidabari was Ngabire's sister.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you, along with Dusabimana and Noeli (sic), went to that location, did you expect to find the family members of Ngabire and his mother and his aunt and so on and so forth at that location?
A.	No, we knew that Ngabire was the sister. The mother and sister of Ngirabidabari were in Kigali.  I knew that the two did not live there, but we knew that Ngabire had arrived and that he was there.
Q.	And what were your instructions in relation to him that morning?

MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, asked and answered several times.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm trying to clarify a factual matter on the record.  The Defence is vociferously objecting because they do not want the facts clarified.  Now, I could have covered this much more quickly if I was allowed to ask leading questions and if I had been permitted to ask the questions that I had originally formulated.  My interest here is in bringing out all of the facts which are clearly confusing, because of the familial relationships among them.  

Now, if the Court would prefer that I not clarify the matter, then I can move on.  But my interest here is in clarifying who was related to whom and what the motives were for attacking this family. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I suggest that it's not necessary to clarify by repeating questions that have already been answered.  If that's the case, we too are trying to clarify when our questions were objected to as being asked and answered.  If there is a technique that the Court wishes us to employ to repeat answers so that it clarifies for the Trial Chamber, let us all do that, but if there is a rule that says if it's asked and answered, you don't ask it again, apply that rule across the board as well.  And I think that my objection is well taken, and it should be sustained.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please answer that question. 
THE WITNESS:  
Michel Nyagaba said that he had just spoken with Nzirorera on the phone and that Nzirorera had given instructions, according to which even his son was to be killed.  We followed those instructions.  We trusted Nyagaba.  We knew that what he was telling us was the truth, and that all of Nzirorera's orders were respected, even when he was not present.  We did what he wanted to us do, and that is why we did what we did.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you received those instructions, was it your impression -- what did you understand to be the reason for Nzirorera's instructions?  What did you personally understand to be the reason behind that?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  This witness can only competently relate what was said to him, since he wasn't speaking with Nzirorera directly.  His understanding is irrelevant.  What was said to him is relevant, and that's already been asked and answered.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  

Please move on to another question, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, was there any personal animus that you were able to perceive between Ngabire and Joseph Nzirorera?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  There's a lack of foundation for that.  He had never even seen Ngabire and Joseph Nzirorera together, as far as we know.  How could he make such a conclusion?  It's speculation, lack of foundation. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Rephrase your question, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, did Joseph Nzirorera that morning, through -- either directly or indirectly, provide you with information of specifically which individuals had to be killed?
A.	Yes, he said that the Tutsis, Tutsis in general, infants and adults.  That is how Michel Nyagaba had just said that he had just spoken with him and that Nzirorera had ordered that not only Tutsis had to be killed, but even his own son should be killed as well.
Q.	Witness, I'll go on to another area.  I'd like to direct your attention to the massacre at the court of appeals.  Did you hear anything on the radio in relation to the killings at the court of appeals during that first half of April 1994?
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I object to this as being beyond -- excuse me, Witness GFA.  Could you please wait until we have had a ruling on an objection by the Trial Chamber.  Thank you.  

Madam President, I -- my objection is based on the fact that this is beyond the scope of any cross-examination that was made.  There was no cross-examination about any radio broadcasts regarding the court of appeal.  The only cross-examination about the incident at the court of appeal was whether Mr. Nzirorera had anything to do with that.  So to now ask about things he heard on the radio about the court of appeal is beyond the scope of any cross-examination, and therefore is improper re-direct examination.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would beg to disagree.  It's certainly not beyond the scope of cross-examination.  All counsel cross-examined this witness on the massacre at the court of appeals.  We are here to explore responsibility for that massacre.  My question to the witness is, did he hear anything on radio Rwanda in regard to that massacre.  His answer to that question will elicit testimony about who may be responsible for the massacre.  So it certainly is within the bounds of cross-examination.  

Furthermore, there was extensive cross-examination from Mr. Hooper about radio transmissions.  So on both grounds, in terms of exploring the Radio Rwanda broadcasts and the court of appeals massacre, there's a basis for exploring it in my redirect. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You may answer that question, Witness. 
THE WITNESS: 
People were killed at the court of appeals.  On that same night we heard on Radio Rwanda that Inyenzi-Inkotanyi launched shells at the court of appeals, and that shelling resulted in victims.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you heard that announcement, did you understand it to be an official communication?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Madam President.  

Excuse me.  Excuse me.  When we have an objection, please wait.  

That's a leading question.  I object on the basis of leading. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I can reformulate the question.  It's just going to take me twice as long. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you may answer that question. 
THE WITNESS: 
For me, it was an official communiqué because the radio that broadcast it is an official radio station.  The announcement was made during the nightly news.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you heard that announcement, did you think it was true or false?
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please.  This, if I might, Your Honour, is precisely the kind of question I put and that I was prevented from asking the witness; that is, when he heard the announcement of the killing of -- the assassination of the president on the radio, did he believe it, did he think it was true?  That very kind of question is now being put by my friend, and he was the one who objected to it.  There must be some form of equity here, or we will have double standards.
MR. WEBSTER:
My objection during the cross-examination of Mr. Roach was because the question itself was irrelevant, because the issue of the death of the president is not an issue in our case.  It was on that basis that I objected.  

Here we have an issue where Joseph Nzirorera himself is being held responsible for the massacre at the court of appeals, so that is in the indictment. He is charged with responsibility for that massacre.  He is also held responsible as a member of government, even though he was not a minister.  His relationship to the MRND party classes him among governmental authorities.  So my question to the witness is to elicit testimony about the nature of the communication, which he has already stated he perceived to be an official communication that took place after the killings.  

So there are two very different issues, and I think Mr. Roach is conflating them.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, also I would like to object that this is, again, beyond the scope of any cross-examination about -- now we're talking about Mr. Nzirorera's responsibility for this event, as a member of the government, which I didn't have an -- I didn't cross-examine on.  I didn't have an opportunity to because it wasn't raised in direct.  

So I am going to ask that you give me an opportunity for re-cross examination if this area is now being explored for the first time as to what the communiqués on the radio were and some other form of responsibility by Mr. Nzirorera other than that which was raised in the direct examination.  

Secondly, I just want to point out that when I asked if something was true or false from the indictment, Mr. Webster objected to the form of my question, and so I think I should object, also, to the form of the question in addition to it being beyond the scope of the direct examination and cross. 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, I think the Defence is mixing apples and oranges here.  I did not ask about an allegation that I read from the indictment.  I asked about what this witness perceived and what his frame of mind was at the moment that the incident occurred. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please rephrase your question, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, around what time was it that you heard this announcement on the radio, if you recall?
A.	At about 7:00 p.m.  That is when the news in Kinyarwanda is broadcast.
Q.	Prior to 7:00 p.m., did you have any interaction with any of the attackers from the court of appeals.
A.	Yes, I spoke with Gato, Abdul Karim Musafiri and others.  They explained how they had killed those people, how many they had killed, and they explained that others were captured and then subsequently replaced.  They said that they shot at the victims.  In fact, they described how the massacre took place.  

When I heard that announcement, I immediately understood that it was a lie, because I had just spoken with people who had perpetrated the massacres.  And when I heard on the radio that it was the Inkotanyi who killed those people, immediately I understood it was a lie.  It was the Interahamwe and members of the CDR who had killed those people. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, I'd like to direct your attention to an exhibit, DNZ. 19.  This is one of your previous witness statements in Rwanda.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If that could be placed with the witness, please.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Witness, directing your attention to DNZ. 19, can you tell us what the content of that statement is?
A.	In the document there is a description of the procedure according to which an accused can make a plea of guilty and make a confession.  In the document there is a description of how the accused get a reduction in sentence in exchange for the plea of guilty.
Q.	That document is dated the 20th of October 1999; is that so?
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, I'm going to object.  That certainly is a leading question, and my records shows that that document is the 29th December. 
THE WITNESS: 
The date is the 20th of October.
MR. WEBSTER:
We're referring to Exhibit DNZ. 19, are we not. DNZ, as I have it in my records, is dated the 20th of the October 1999. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, it's 20 October 1998. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  Maybe I am confused because it's in Kinyarwanda, but I have two documents.  One is the 10th of October to 19 -- maybe it is a 2 that's written.  It's very difficult to read on this document, but I had been proceeding on that this is the 10th of October and the other one dated the 29th of October to 1999.
MR. WEBSTER:
I think the 10 refers to the month. October is the tenth month, and I believe that's the 10 you're looking at.  The date of the document is the 20th of October.  I believe -- I was told it was 1999.  The witness now informs us that it is 1998. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we give the document to the Kinyarwanda interpreter so that we can have the exact date for this document. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
It's marked 20 October. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The year, Mr. Interpreter?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
1998. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  That is indeed the date that the witness gave.  

You may proceed, Mr. Webster.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, so on the 20th of October 1998, you were given an opportunity to plead guilty.  Is that what this document is telling us?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection.  That's a leading question, Madam President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness just testified as much. 
THE WITNESS: 
Yego.
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness just testified as much, then it's been asked and answered. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness has already answered this question.  Yes, he answered question.  

Very well.  Proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay.  And, Mr. Witness, directing your attention to DNZ. 18.  This is also a previous witness statement that was entered into the record during your cross-examination.  Can you summarise the contents of this document, please? 
A.	This is also a document which explains to the accused his rights and the interest he has in pleading guilty and making a confession of guilt.
Q.	Did you elect to plead guilty at that time?
A.	It's a document which an accused person receives, so it is that on the day of his initial appearance he cannot deny the existence of that possibility.  You are given a document.  You sign it in order to show that you've received it.  It's a kind of acknowledgment that the information has well been received.  This document is prepared before the case file is surrendered to the court so that the detainee or suspect can never deny ever having received that information.
Q.	All right.  But this is a document that's prepared by the authorities; is it not?  It's not a document that you yourself write?
A.	All these documents are prepared by the prosecution.  It's the authorities that prepared them, not ourselves.
Q.	Now I'd like to direct your attention to DNZ. 13.  This is a document that you've previously identified for us as your letter to the prosecutor general, which was part of your guilty plea.  Who prepared this document?
A.	I am the one.
Q.	Did anyone assist you in preparing it?
A.	No, no one.
Q.	What about the annexes that were appended to the document, Annex 1 and Annex 2?
A.	No one helped me draft these documents.  I prepared them all by myself.
Q.	Did anyone supervise you in the preparation of these documents, anyone from the authorities?
A.	No, no one.
Q.	With regard to DNZ. 13(A), which is the document, the letter.  On the first page of the document I notice a seal there.  Can you tell us how that seal was attached to the document?
A.	That was the procedure.  When a detainee drafts such a document, given the fact that one does not have the right to send that letter independently to the prosecution, this document has to be transmitted to the prison authorities so that a covering letter can be obtained, so that it can be sent under cover of the director of the prisons.
Q.	So the seal itself, is it a seal from the -- from the prosecutor's office or is it from the prison authorities?  I'm trying to find out what that seal itself means. 
A.	No, it's a stamp from the penitentiary administration, prison authorities.  The prisons fall under the ministry responsible for security.
Q.	In affixing that stamp to that document, does that indicate that they approve of its contents or supervised its contents in any way?
A.	No, not at all.  Not at all.  The detainee must tell the authorities of all of his acts.  They did not supervise my drafting of the document; they did not know what I could have committed as a crime.  Is has absolutely nothing to do with it.
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, how would you know what to plead to in offering a plea of guilty?
A.	When one proceeds with the confession of guilt, one consults the official gazette, which contains the order issued to that effect, and this order provides the way in which one proceeds with a confession of guilt.  We asked for a copy of the official gazette, and we consulted that law, and we followed the instructions in order to follow the procedure which is outlined officially. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, are you going to be finished soon because there is another court session in this very room in 15 minutes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll finish within the next five minutes.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am trying to understand the content.  Did the gazette tell you the content of the statement or the form of the statement?
A.	No.  It says that if you are to confess your guilt, you have to confess everything and you confess all you did.  Furthermore, if you killed a number of persons in different locations, if you have done that, you would be placed under the category 1.  So we therefore needed to say everything we had witnessed, and this procedure concerns only the form and the procedure.  As for the content, it's we who provide that.
Q.	So, did the authorities ever confront you with specific allegations or -- that led you to generate this document?  How did you yourself come up with the content?  Was it in response to specific accusations that were made against you?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  He's just put three questions to the witness.  I would ask that it be broken down and one question be put to the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are you able to answer that question? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I am able to do so. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please go ahead. 
THE WITNESS: 
Each one is aware of the crimes he or she committed.  One does not need to be reminded of what one did.  Each one has his or her own conscience, and one says what one wishes.  Let me give you an example.  I was never accused of having participated on the attack on Musumba.  I was accused of having participated in the attacks in Mukingo, but I, of my own volition, decided to include what I know and admit having done in Musumba.  

So, as I was saying, one needed to write everything one knew, whether those facts are included in the allegations against you or not.  It's a matter of saying everything that you know.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And now, turning our attention to Annex 2 of that very same document, in Annex 2 you provide information against Joseph Nzirorera.  Did anyone tell you to do that back in September of 2002?
A.	No one asked me to make any accusation against Nzirorera.  I myself decided to denounce him because all that we did we did following orders from Nzirorera.  I needed to say the truth, and I said that it was they who ordered us to do everything we did, and I did not need to hide that fact.  No one forced me to do so.  I decided on that myself because that's the truth.
Q.	And when you submitted this document on the 12th -- excuse me -- some time in September 2002, had you had any contact with the ICTR at that time?
A.	No, I had never had contacts with any official from this Tribunal.
Q.	Did any one of the authorities make any promises to you or agree to accord you certain benefits in exchange for this testimony against Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	No.  No one ever gave me such orders.  No one ever promised me anything whatsoever.  Furthermore, at the time that we pleaded guilty, we did not know that we were going to be released.  We knew that we could even suffer the death penalty.  In our mind, we didn't have any promise, no hope of ever receiving any reward or compensation.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, there did come a time that you were released however.
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was that subsequent to the presidential decree on the 1st of January 2003?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection.  That's a leading question.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Were you released after January 1st, 2003?
A.	It was before the 1st of January 2003.  It was after the presidential decree.
Q.	Among the persons that were released after this presidential decree, are all of them corroborating with the ICTR, as far as you know?
A.	No.
Q.	There are persons who are released who are not appearing in any of the trials before this Tribunal, as far as you know?
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection.  Leading.  Asked and answered.  

Excuse me, excuse me, Witness.  Please don't answer a question until the Court has ruled on the objection.  

It's asked and answered and leading.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  

Please move on to something else, Mr. Webster. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I would just like to advise that there is a rule in American courts that if your cell phone goes off in court it is confiscated.  So I just wanted to bring that to Mr. Webster's attention. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Happily we're not in America, so I can hold on to my cell phone.  But I apologise.  Sometimes it turns itself on, even when it strikes something in my pocket.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Witness, did your agreement to collaborate with the Tribunal have anything to do with your release?
A.	No relationship whatsoever.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You must conclude, Mr. Prosecutor, please. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you know of persons released in the same manner that are testifying for the Defence in the proceedings before this Tribunal?
A.	I know one person, yes.  I saw one witness.  There is another one who refused.  But I know in particular that Nyagaba, Michel came to testify as a Defence witness, and that's the only person that I may mention at this moment.
Q.	In relation to the prior testimony of any witness, has that had any impact on their status within the Rwandan justice system?
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.  I object to this question.  First of all, how would this witness know, because these are protected witnesses in the first place?  I don't believe that this is a question -- the witness would just be speculating why people -- other people are released. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, it was on cross-examination from Mr. Robinson that this line of testimony was elicited because it is his questions that brought to bear -- that brought out the fact that this particular witness is testifying in another matter.  So my question is simply, has his testimony, his previous testimony as a defence witness, has that had any impact, as far as you know, upon his status within the Rwandan justice system.  The witness can answer to the extent that he knows.
MR. ROBINSON:
I object, Madam President.  This is not a matter within this witness's knowledge.  How the Rwandan justice authorities have viewed another person's case is not something that is proper for this witness to comment on. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll rephrase the question.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, to your knowledge has Michel Nyagaba been rearrested since his return to Rwanda?
A.	No, he was released.
Q.	Do you expect to gain anything from your testimony here today?
A.	No.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  I have no further questions, Your Honour. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Excuse me, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. O'SHEA:
I'll be very quick, Madam President.  Just a housekeeping matter.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, just a moment, please.  I think the witness should withdraw.  

Thank you, very much, Mr. Witness, for your testimony here before us.  We have concluded with your testimony, and we thank you very much for having kindly answered our questions.  A safe journey home. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much. 
(Witness excused)
MR. O'SHEA:
What I have to say relates to the witness, but the witness need not be here while I say it.  Yes, the first matter is, I put a communication to Mr. Webster yesterday in relation to the Prosecution witness statements with regard to Prosecution witness GBU.  I hadn't had an opportunity to speak with him about this today, but I did ask if he could perhaps make available copies of the witness statements that we did not have today.  I don't know if that has been done.  If it has not been done, then may I please request, since Witness GBU will be commencing his testimony tomorrow, that the Prosecution perhaps informally -- they can always put them through the system as well if they wish, but perhaps informally provide us with the copies of the witness statements we do not have for GBU.  

If his case manager is in court, I can just indicate that we do have the first witness statements of the 7th of May 1999.  We also have the witness statements of the 13th of November 2002.  We do not have -- we also have the confession.  

Mr. Webster kindly has indicated to us -- sorry, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, maybe you can mention all this immediately after this session to the Prosecutor so that those documents can be given to you, but I'm obliged to adjourn now because the other Court is ready for the Muhimana case.  We can settle this outside, please. 

MR. HOOPER:
I know the urgency, Madam President, that you want to leave the court.  I well understand.  There is one matter of concern.  

The last witness in re-examination was asked questions relating to that announcement to the radio news about the attack on the court of appeal at Ruhengeri.  And it went along --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, but please, please, Mr. Hooper, I think the witness has gone out of the courtroom.  We cannot speak about this any longer, please.  

So we shall adjourn now.  By your leave, we can see one another in the corridor because we must now absolutely adjourn because everybody is waiting to enter this courtroom.  Please, I do beg.  

We do have a problem here so we do adjourn, and we can see one another just outside.  Thank you, one and all.  
(Court adjourned at 1358H)
