         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registrar introduce the matter coming before the

        17        Thank you, Mr. President. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  

        19        

        20        May we have the appearance for the parties, starting 

        21        with the Prosecution, for the record?

        22   MS. OJEMENI: With due respect, Your Honour, Ifeoma Ojemeni, 

        23        trial attorney, I appear with Dorthée Marotine, 

        24        case manager for the Prosecution. 

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

        26   

        27        My we also have the appearance of the Defence, please, 

        28        for the record?

        30        representing Mr. Kajelijeli.  I am assisted by

         1        Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         3        

         4        Professor Hinds, your next witness?  

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Our next witness will be Witness MEM.  But 

         6        before we call --

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: M --

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: MEM.  But before we call that witness, 

         9        Your Honour, we had notified the Prosecutor's office and 

        10        also the Trial Chamber co-ordinator this morning of our 

        11        new order of witnesses for this session.  This is as a 

        12        result of our discussions in meetings with victim and 

        13        witness protection and the witnesses who are now here.  

        14        So the new order -- it does not change the detained 

        15        witnesses whom we had already scheduled.  

        16        

        17        So, we will have MEM and then RHU27.  That is already as 

        18        it were, followed by KNWA, which again does not change.  

        19        The new change is that after KNWA, we now have a witness 

        20        from (By order of the Court this name has been extracted 

        21        and filed under seal), TLA who is now in Arusha.  And --

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Can we have the proposed new order?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: The proposed new order, starting today, MEM 

        24        followed by RHU27, followed by KNWA, followed by TLA.  

        25        Then for what we are proposing, we are assuming that 

        26        those people could be completed this week.  Next week 

        27        the order would be JN, KAA, ZLG and MLCF.  And the last 

        28        week, the week of December 9th, RHU21, MLNL, MLNA, ZLA 

        29        and if we can reach Colonel FMB.

        30   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, Prosecution does not really have

         1        any objections to this, but I would like to make an 

         2        observation that we have not been notified like the 

         3        Defence has just said. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, could you please -- it does 

         5        also help us, we do also follow.  If in the course of 

         6        the day, you can formalise this one by way of formal -- 

         7        just the order as it is. 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, There is a memo that was filed 

         9        with the registry this morning addressed to Mr. Ken 

        10        Fleming, carbon copied to the co-ordinator for 

        11        Trial Chamber II, copied to Mr. Amoussouga and copied to 

        12        the client.  I realise that perhaps, Ms. Ojemeni does 

        13        not have it on hand, but I just wanted to inform the 

        14        Court since we are here of what the order is and that 

        15        memo was, in fact, sent out to the registry this 

        16        morning.

        17   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, just to set the record straight, 

        18        Mr. Fleming does not also have it, the Prosecution does 

        19        not have -- that is just the point. 

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right.  We take note of that.  So 

        21        maybe this one should be followed up because we also do 

        22        like to keep a record of -- we are aware of the former 

        23        order and we take note of that.  Can we now have the 

        24        next witness, please brought in?

        25         

        26        Yes, could you please swear the witness, Registry?  

        27   MR. KIYEYEU: We will do so, My Lord. 

        28        (Declaration made by Witness MEM in Kinyarwanda)

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness MEM, you have just made a solemn 

        30        declaration.

         1   MR. KIYEYEU: I don't know whether the witness has been 

         2        translated into French.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, I see.  What do you mean, he is --

         4   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: My Lord, can I please have the 

         5        registry's typewritten formula sheet.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Witness MEM, you have just made a solemn 

         7        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

         8        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

         9        essential elements to you.  You will be led in your 

        10        evidence-in-chief by the Defence, who are seated on this 

        11        side of the courtroom.  Thereafter, questions will be 

        12        put to you in cross-examination by the Prosecution, who 

        13        are seated on this side of the courtroom.  The Judges 

        14        sitting in front of you may also put questions to you to 

        15        clarify your evidence, if they will have such questions 

        16        to ask you.  If a question put to you is not clear or 

        17        you do not understand it, please say so and such a 

        18        question shall be repeated or explained.  These are the 

        19        few essential things we want to bring to your attention 

        20        before you begin your testimony. 

        21   

        22        Yes, Professor Hinds?

         1   Q.   Witness, do you have your spectacles with you? 

         2   A.   Yes, I have my spectacles with me, but I don't see any 

         3        documents that need to be read because normally, I use 

         4        my glasses for reading. 

         5   Q.   Okay, Witness.  Witness, we are going to show you a 

         6        document which you would need your glasses for and we 

         7        would like you to go over the particulars on this 

         8        document and see if it is accurate.  If it is accurate, 

         9        we would like you to date the document at the bottom and 

        10        sign your name.  Do you understand? 

        11   A.   Yes, Counsel, I understand.  Am I to sign this document?

        12   Q.   Yes, you are to date it, put today's date and sign it if 

        13        all of the information is accurate.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness has signed and 

        15        dated the document and the Defence tenders this document 

        16        as Defendant Exhibit 28 (sic). 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection?

        18   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: It would be 29 I suppose, not 28.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am sorry, Exhibit 29.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: So, let the document containing the personal 

        22        particulars of this witness, MEM be admitted as Defence 

        23        Exhibit No. 29 and the same shall be kept under seal as 

        24        it contains the particulars of this witness, who is a 

        25        protected witness.

        26   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would now like to go into 

        29        closed session to ask the witness some questions which 

        30        may reveal his identity for a short period.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: I suppose there is no objection from the 

         2        Prosecution on this. 

         3   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: So, we will have to go into closed session to 

         5        enable counsel to raise questions with the witness, some 

         6        of which could have a bearing on his identity.  We 

         7        regret to members of the public.

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Witness, we are now in open session and you should be 

         3        very careful not to mention your name or anything that 

         4        would identify you.  Do you understand that? 

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: And translate to the witness what we had also 

         6        said. 

         7   THE WITNESS: Agreed. 

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, in 1994, were you aware of the name of the 

        10        individual who was the conseiller of Rwinzovu cellule -- 

        11        I am sorry, secteur? 

        12   A.   Yes, I knew his name. 

        13   Q.   Can you tell the Trial Chamber the name of this 

        14        individual?

        16   Q.   Do you know what has happened to Murara, Amos? 

        17   A.   No, I don't know what happened to him. 

        18   Q.   Do you know if he has been arrested or is he in prison 

        19        in Rwanda.  

        20   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness has 

        21        answered he does not know.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, he can answer that question.

        23   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Could you please repeat the 

        24        question, Counsel?  

        25   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        26   Q.   Do you know whether or not Amos Murara is in prison? 

        27   A.   No, he is not in prison. 

        28   Q.   Do you know if he was ever arrested for the events of 

        29        1994 that occurred in Rwinzovu secteur? 

        30   A.   No.

         1   Q.   Is it no you do not know, or no he was not arrested? 

         2   A.   I mean that he was not detained. 

         3   Q.   Now, sir, do you know the Defendant in this case here in 

         4        Arusha, Juvénal Kajelijeli? 

         5   A.   Yes, I know him. 

         6   Q.   How long have you known him? 

         7   A.   I have known him for a very long time since his 

         8        childhood. 

         9   Q.   Do you know the name of his father?  What is his 

        10        father's name?

        11   A.   Yes, I know his father's name.  His father's name is 

        12        Bananiye, B-A-N-A-N-I-Y-E. 

        13   Q.   Witness, could you sit closer to the mike, move your 

        14        chair up.  Do you know the occupations that Kajelijeli 

        15        had from the time that you first knew him? 

        16   A.   Yes, I know the occupations, his occupations over the 

        17        years. 

        18   Q.   Can you tell the Trial Chamber what those occupations 

        19        were? 

        20   A.   He has been a conseiller, he had been interim 

        21        bourgmestre, he took some training in Gitarama.  He was 

        22        a tax officer, accountant for the Nkuli commune, 

        23        N-K-U-L-I, Nkuli.  He was also accountant for the 

        24        Mukingo commune.  And then in 1988, he was appointed 

        25        bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune, an office he held 

        26        until 1993. 

        27   Q.   Now, sir, do you know the circumstances under which 

        28        Kajelijeli left office in 1993? 

        29   A.   He was suspended by the appropriate authorities from the 

        30        office of bourgmestre.

         1   Q.   Now, you have already told us who the person was who 

         2        replaced him for four months, so we don't want you to 

         3        mention that name.  But do you know the name of the 

         4        person who was the préfet at that time who made that 

         5        interim appointment?

         6   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Witness says he did not 

         7        understand the question. 

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, previously you told us who was appointed acting 

        10        bourgmestre after Kajelijeli was removed in March of 

        11        1993.  We don't want you to mention that name.  We just 

        12        want you now to tell us who was the préfet at that time.

        13   A.   The préfet at that time was Sylvester Bareyanga.  

        14        Bareyanga is spelled B-A-R-E-Y-A-N-G-A.

        15   Q.   In April of 1994, was he still the préfet? 

        16   A.   No. 

        17   Q.   Do you know what happened to him in April of 1994? 

        18   A.   Bareyanga was killed by the Inkotanyi before April. 

        19   Q.   In what year? 

        20   A.   In 1994.

        21   Q.   Do you know where he was killed?

        22   A.   Yes.

        23   Q.   Could you tell the Trial Chamber where he was killed by 

        24        the RPF? 

        25   A.   He was killed in Kigali.

        26   Q.   Now, you said that Kajelijeli was removed from the 

        27        position of bourgmestre in March of 1993.  Do you know 

        28        what Kajelijeli did after he was removed from being 

        29        bourgmestre?  Do you know what his occupation was, or 

        30        what he did for a living?

         1   A.   After his suspension, he went into private activities 

         2        and he was farming as well. 

         3   Q.   Now, sir, without telling us what your occupation was, 

         4        can you tell us whether you had occasion to be in the 

         5        Mukingo commune office from March to June of 1994 -- 

         6        I am sorry from March to June of 1993? 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, we do not have the -- we have the 

         8        summary here.  I don't know -- we don't have much 

         9        details, but what we would request is that this 

        10        background information must be done but, at least, 

        11        bearing also to relevance so that we can move forward on 

        12        the issues that you want to address that are relevant 

        13        and central to the case as soon as possible. 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we are dealing right now with 

        15        respect to use of the commune vehicle.  This witness 

        16        talked about the role that he placed in that capacity 

        17        and there is an issue now about -- in the case 

        18        obviously -- 

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Who?

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS:  -- about the driving of the commune vehicle 

        21        and so on and so forth. 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Because, you know -- we are now in our second 

        23        hour on this backup information.  So, we would like 

        24        really to see -- you can demonstrate as soon as possible 

        25        how these things relate, so that we can also follow you.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I am telling you, you have listened to 

        27        the evidence as we all have.  There has been evidence 

        28        that Kajelijeli, while he was out of office, was, in 

        29        fact, even more powerful than the bourgmestre.

        30    MR. PRESIDENT: We take note of that.  Can you --

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can I proceed?

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: But try as much as possible to make the 

         5        linkage as quickly as possible, so that we can also 

         6        follow you and move with you and see exactly the issues.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know what you want me to do.  Do you 

         8        want me to -- are you preventing me from asking the 

         9        witness --

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: No, no.  We are drawing your attention to 

        11        demonstration of the relevance, and, of course, by 

        12        trying to show the linkage as soon as possible with the 

        13        issue that you want the Trial Chamber to follow. 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  So, in this case, is the Trial Chamber 

        15        clear on where I am going?

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: We are waiting to see at least how you 

        17        develop.

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   Let me go to something else and then I will come back to 

        20        that.  Witness, do you see Juvénal Kajelijeli in the 

        21        courtroom? 

        22   A.   Yes, if I am given the opportunity, I can try to locate 

        23        him. 

        24   Q.   Can you, Witness, try to identify Juvénal Kajelijeli in 

        25        the courtroom and identify where he is sitting, what he 

        26        is wearing?  You can stand up, Witness, if you need to.

        27   A.   Yes, I have just seen him.  He is wearing spectacles.  

        28        He is also wearing a dark tie, a jacket -- a khaki 

        29        coloured jacket and a blue shirt. 

        30   Q.   What row is he sitting in, Witness?

         1   A.   He is seated on the last row. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Witness identifying Kajelijeli, 

         3        Your Honours. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Although the row is not correct but -- 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: But there is nobody on the row.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: He is clear with the identification as regards 

         7        to how he is dressed and we take note of that.  The 

         8        Trial Chamber takes note of that.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honours. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: And let the record so reflect that the witness 

        11        has identified the Accused Kajelijeli in the Court well. 

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Witness, while you had occasion to be in the commune 

        14        office, did you ever see Juvénal Kajelijeli using the 

        15        communal vehicle? 

        16   A.   Which period are you referring to, Counsel?  Is it 

        17        during the period when he was bourgmestre or after his 

        18        suspension? 

        19   Q.   After his suspension. 

        20   A.   No, after his suspension, he was not using the communal 

        21        vehicle because that was impossible. 

        22   Q.   Do you know who the driver of the communal vehicle was, 

        23        the person's name?

        24   A.   The driver w as called Avit Muhunde.  I spell Muhunde, 

        25        M-U-H-U-N-D-E. 

        26   Q.   Witness, why do you say it was impossible for Kajelijeli 

        27        to drive the communal vehicle during the time that he 

        28        was not bourgmestre? 

        29   A.   It is because the communal vehicle was used by the 

        30        person who replaced him, and that that person could not

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think the witness has 

         7        identified where he is.  So, I don't want to translate 

         8        it.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe what we can do, we could deal with this 

        10        issue in a minute in closed session and come back to it, 

        11        so that we can streamline the record. 

        12        

        13        We will go into a closed session for a short while for 

        14        some follow-up questions, perhaps by Counsel on this 

        15        issue that he is addressing, hopefully for a very short 

        16        while. 

        17        

        18        Registry, can you see that is done?

        19   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lord.

         5   Q.   Witness, do you recall meeting with me in Rwanda and

         1   Q.   Did you inform them that you had given a statement to 

         2        the Defence of Mr. Kajelijeli?

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, what does he want to say?

         4   THE WITNESS: I wanted to answer this question in a detail 

         5        manner.

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Now,Witness, just answer the question yes or no, and 

         8        then I will direct you with follow-up questions.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        10   THE WITNESS: Very well.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, what was the question?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: The question was: Did you notify these 

        13        individuals that you had given a statement to 

        14        Mr. Kajelijeli's lawyers; that is, these people from 

        15        Arusha?

        16   THE WITNESS: I did not give them a statement.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Maybe I should start again.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe the question was not understood.

        19   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        20   Q.   Witness, after you met with Kajelijeli's lawyers, did 

        21        you meet with anyone from the Prosecutor's office, and 

        22        if so, can you tell us went?

        23   A.   I did not understand your question.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, maybe you can make it simpler, Counsel, 

        25        perhaps so that we can move forward.

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Witness, did you meet with representatives of the 

        28        Prosecutor's office at any time while you were detained?

        29   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: That's broader.  That's broader.

         1   MS. OJEMENI: Can he be specific.  There are many prosecutor's 

         2        offices.  Can you be specific, please?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: THE WITNESS can say "yes", then I could ask 

         4        him who.  I mean, I'm trying to find out if he met with 

         5        anyone.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: That is okay.  The only thing is that I think 

         7        in your earlier question, you were dealing with the 

         8        period after you have met him.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, but apparently there is some confusion.  

        10        So, now, I'm -- because I don't know what is in his 

        11        mind.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: And so, I'm trying now to give him some 

        14        frame of reference to which he can answer the question 

        15        and see what his problem is.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        17   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   The question,Witness, is, did you ever meet with 

        19        representatives of the Prosecutor's office while you 

        20        have been detained?

        21   A.   I met representatives of the Prosecutor, but they did 

        22        not put any question to me.

        23   Q.   Now, what Prosecutor did you meet?  Was it the 

        24        Prosecutor from Rwanda, or the Prosecutors from Arusha?

        25   A.   I met the representatives of the Prosecutor of Arusha.

        26   Q.   Now, do you recall went you had that meeting with 

        27        representatives -- the first meeting that you had with 

        28        representatives of the Prosecutor's office in Arusha?

        29   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         1   MS. OJEMENI: The Witness has not said that he met with the 

         2        Prosecutor's office several times, that should warrant 

         3        the line of questions my learned friend is putting.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I have no problem rephrasing it.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   The question is: when did you meet -- what date, if you 

         9        recall -- representatives of the Prosecutor's office 

        10        from Arusha, who put no questions to you, as you said?

        11   A.   I do not recall the date on which I met them.

        12   Q.   Do you recall whether it was after you met with 

        13        Mr. Kajelijeli's lawyers, or before?

        14   A.   I met the representatives of the Prosecutor before I met 

        15        the Defence team of Kajelijeli.

        16   Q.   Now,Witness, did you have any meetings with 

        17        representatives of the Prosecutor's office from Rwanda 

        18        after you met with Mr. Kajelijeli's lawyers?

        19   A.   Yes.

        20   Q.   Can you tell the Trial Chamber if you recall who from 

        21        the Prosecutor's staff in Rwanda contacted you, and what 

        22        did they say to you, if anything?

        10   A.   ***************

        11   Q.   Now,Witness, at the time you were introduced to 

        12        representatives of the Prosecutor's staff from Arusha, 

        13        could you tell the Trial Chamber whether or not any 

        14        questions were put to you and what answers you gave, if 

        15        any?

        16   A.   They put questions to me, and do you want me to tell you 

        17        the kind of questions they put to me?

        18   Q.   Yes.  I want you to tell the Trial Chamber what 

        19        questions they put to you and what answers you gave, if 

        20        any?

        21   A.   They asked me questions relating to Kajelijeli.  I 

        22        answered them that, if they wanted information on 

        23        Kajelijeli that they should refer to the statement that 

        24        I gave at the Ruhengeri Office of the Prosecutor, 

        25        because I did not want to go over what I had said 

        26        earlier.

        27   Q.   And what was the response from the Prosecutor's office 

        28        from Arusha?

        29   A.   They left me.  They did not put any further questions to

         1        time at 11 p.m.

         2   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber what you did after 

         3        you heard the news of the president's death?

         4   A.   I and the neighbours held awake until six o'clock in the 

         5        morning.  Thus, we didn't sleep until six in the 

         6        morning.

         7   Q.   Did you visit with your neighbours that night?

         8   A.   No.

         9   Q.   Did your neighbours give you any details concerning how 

        10        the president might have died; that is, on the night of 

        11        the 6th?

        12   A.   The neighbours told me that they had heard on the radio 

        13        that the president's plane had been shot down.

        14   Q.   Did there come a time went you confirm what your 

        15        neighbours had told you?  And if so, went?

        16   A.   At 6 a.m. I went to Byangabo market where I arrived at 

        17        6:30, in spite of the fact that on the radio people had 

        18        been asked to stay home.

        19   Q.   Why did you leave your home, notwithstanding the 

        20        instructions, as you say, advising people to stay at 

        21        home?

        22   A.   Because I didn't, in fact, leave my cellule, the cellule 

        23        in which I resided and where also Byangabo market was.

        24   Q.   Could you tell the Trial Chamber what you observed, if 

        25        anything, went you arrived at Byangabo at 6:30 a.m. the 

        26        morning of the 7th?  What did you see?

        27   A.   I found people displaced by the war from Mutaro commune 

        28        and were living there.  I also found traders who lived 

        29        around Byangabo market and we went on discussing the 

        30        president's demise.

         1   Q.   Now, how were you able to identify people you say who 

         2        were displaced from other areas, other secteurs, other 

         3        communes, how could you identify them?

         4   A.   In fact, I couldn't identify who was present because 

         5        there were people displaced by the war and members of 

         6        the population who all collected there -- gathered there 

         7        to try and find out more about what was happening in the 

         8        country.

         9   Q.   Witness, I'm asking you, could you tell those 

        10        individuals who were displaced persons from others whom 

        11        you had seen?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Hasn't he understood the question?  What does 

        13        he want to say? 

        14   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness says he has not 

        15        fully understood the question.

        18   Q.   Witness, did you see people whom you would describe as 

        19        refugees that morning at Byangabo at 6:30 in the morning 

        20        within the population you saw?

        21   A.   We knew the place where the displaced people had their 

        22        camp, and we could distinguish between the DPs, 

        23        displaced persons, and the persons who lived there 

        24        around Byangabo.

        25   Q.   Now,Witness, did you have any conversations that morning

        10        were?

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Would you like it screened, Counsel, 

        12        Photograph 24?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  Yes, Your Honour.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Before we go to the screen, I just want him 

        15        to answer the question, if he says "yes", then we go to 

        16        screen.  If he says "no", then I will go some place.  

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Right.

         4        projector, the overhead projector and give him something 

         5        to point to -- to point with?

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, and draw the curtains before he moves.

         7   MR. KIYEYEU: We are going to do so, My Lord.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, what are we looking at here, the 

        10        Picture No. 24?  That is a picture of what location?

        11   A.   I see the members of the population, peasant farmers of 

        12        the area in the photograph.

        13   Q.   Can you tell us,Witness, what is that location shown in 

        14        the photograph -- what is the name of the place?

        15   A.   Byangabo.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can you get a chair for this witness to sit, 

        17        please, because of his health problems?  I don't want 

        18        him standing up.

        19   MR. KIYEYEU: We are going to do so now, Counsel.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Now,Witness, looking at the photographs, are there -- is 

        22        there a tarmac road going through Byangabo, and can you 

        23        point to it?

        24   A.   What you see there is the asphalt road.

        25   Q.   Witness, are there shops?  Are you using your 

        26        glasses,Witness?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Ask him if he has his glasses on.

        28   The witness: I had forgotten.  Please forgive me.

         2   Q.   Okay, Witness, are there shops shown in the photograph, 

         3        the shops at Byangabo, do you see shops?

         4   A.   Aren't those shops that I see over there?

         5   Q.   Well, tell us, Witness, whether or not, as you look at 

         6        those, do those look like shops that you saw at Byangabo 

         7        on April of 1994?

         8   A.   No, things have changed.

         9   Q.   Now, you mentioned a tree before, and do you have -- can 

        10        you describe or show us the tree in the picture where 

        11        you say the youth and displaced persons were gathered?

        12   A.   That is the tree.

        13   Q.   Okay.  And was that tree there in 1994?

        14   A.   Yes.

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, could we take a short break, 

        16        Mr. Kajelijeli needs to take his medication.  I was 

        17        trying to finish up this area, but I've got two notes so 

        18        far.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, we'll come back to this one, I think you 

        20        are still on the 8th, on the tree and the area.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's right.  We only need about five 

        22        minutes.  I think he just needs to go into -- take his 

        23        medication.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  So, we stay here. 

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, just about five minutes.  

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: We wait for him here?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  He can go and take his medicine.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, could we take a short break, 

         3        Mr. Kajelijeli needs to take his medication?  I was 

         4        trying to finish up this area, but I have gotten two 

         5        notes so far.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We will come back to this one.  I 

         7        think you are still on it, on the tree and the area?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's all right.  He will only need about 

         9        five minutes.  I think he needs only to go about five 

        10        minutes to go and take his medication.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: We wait for him here?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, just for five minutes.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: He only needs to go and take his medicine.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Mr. Kajelijeli waives his rights to be here 

        15        while he goes to get his medication.  So I will continue 

        16        with the questions, he waives his presence.  So we could  

        17        continue while he goes to take his medication and comes 

        18        back.  It is going to take two or three minutes.  It's 

        19        probably one question or so, yes if, the Court permits 

        20        it.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, let him go.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Can we continue, Your Honour, or you want 

        23        me to wait?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, if it is two minutes, we will wait for 

        25        him.  (After a pause) Yes.  Right, Counsel, I think he 

        26        can continue, the accused is back.  You were addressing 

        27        the --

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, we need to be shown on the screen.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the tree.

         1   Q.   Now,Witness, I had asked you to point to the tree where 

         2        you say that young people and displaced persons had made 

         3        the comment concerning taking revenge.  Which tree was 

         4        that? 

         5   A.   This is the tree.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: And, Your Honour, I think I am finished with 

         7        that. 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you describe the tree for the record, 

         9        Counsel, that has been pointed out by the Accused?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, it is the only tree shown in 

        11        the photograph that extends up to the top of the 

        12        photograph right in the length from the trunk of the 

        13        tree all the way up to the top.  It extends up to the 

        14        top of the photograph and there is an object to the 

        15        right of the tree which looks -- at least -- what it 

        16        looks like to me, is an overturned truck, but it may not 

        17        be.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, no.  The tree is right in the centre of 

        19        the picture, of course, those structures I don't know 

        20        what they --

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, there is a structure, yes, right to the 

        22        right of the tree, but I don't know what it is.  But it 

        23        is a tree that is in the foreground.  Maybe, it is a 

        24        tree that is to the right of the tarmac road shown to 

        25        the left and the tree -- the height, the top of the tree 

        26        is cut-off by the top of the picture.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that should be it.  Counsel, would that 

        28        be a fair description of the tree in question?

        29   MS. OJEMENI:  Yes, Your Honour.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay, I am finished with the photograph.

         1        The witness can take his seat.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  It is possible, Counsel, to find out from the 

         3        witness what was the part of Byangabo that is shown, if 

         4        you so wish, in the picture 24.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, going back to No. 24, Picture no. 24, can we 

         7        have it shown on the screen, please?  Now,Witness, 

         8        without -- think very carefully, don't say anything that 

         9        may reveal your identity, can you tell us what part of 

        10        Byangabo is being shown in the photograph, if you can 

        11        tell?  That is in relation to the tree, do you know of 

        12        any shops or structures that that tree is close to?

        13   A.   From the tree there to near the tarmac, that tree would 

        14        be on the left if you were going towards Gisenyi and  

        15        Byangabo is a bit down below, that is what you see there 

        16        is Byangabo and the shops go up to one that we called 

        17        Isimbi.

        18   Q.   Now, where would be -- in which direction, can you point 

        19        in which direction would be Isimbi?

        20   A.   When you were coming from Ruhengeri, when you leave the 

        21        tarmac, Isimbi is over here on the right, around here. 

        22        Isimbi I will spell it for you, I-S-I-M-B-I.

        23   Q.   So,Witness, Isimbi is not shown on the photograph; is 

        24        that correct?  

        25   A.   No, I don't see it.

        26   Q.   But it would be on your right side of the photograph; is 

        27        that correct? 

        28   A.   Yes, that is correct.

         1   A.   That tree is in Mugogo cellule.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Does the Court need anymore information 

         3        concerning that?

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: No, thank you.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Could we have the witness take the witness 

         6        seat, please?

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Now,Witness, after you heard the youths and the 

         9        displaced persons making the comment concerning taking 

        10        revenge, what, if anything did you do or say?

        11   A.   I told the young people that there was no Tutsi 

        12        accomplice in Busogo secteur.

        13   Q.   Were the young people addressing you personally or were 

        14        they talking in general when they were talking about 

        15        taking revenge?  Was it addressed to you or were they  

        16        talking in general?

        17   A.   The young people were talking to me, but there were 

        18        other persons around, and let me say that there were 

        19        lots of other people present around the place.

        20   Q.   Now, why did you make the comment that you made to the 

        21        young people that there were no Tutsi accomplices in 

        22        your cellule?

        23   A.   I don't understand the question.

        24   Q.   Why did you tell the young people and others that there 

        25        were no Tutsi accomplices in your cellule?

        26   A.   I did that because when the young people re-grouped, 

        27        they came saying that they were looking for accomplices.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  I want -- you used in questions, cellule, but 

        29        I think in his previous answer he had used the word 

        30        secteur.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let me clarify.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Yes,Witness, when you spoke to the young people, did you 

         4        say there no Tutsi accomplices in your secteur or 

         5        cellule?

         6   A.   I referred to the secteur but you understand that if I 

         7        referred to the secteurs it means the cellules are 

         8        included.

         9   Q.   Now, could you describe to the Trial Chamber what -- 

        10        withdrawn.  Could you describe to the Trial Chamber 

        11        whether any of the individuals who were addressing you 

        12        at that time were armed or had weapons in their 

        13        possession?

        14   A.   The young men had clubs.

        15   Q.   But did you see any other weapons displayed by any other 

        16        people who were there, besides clubs?

        17   A.   No.

        18   Q.   Besides telling these young people there were no Tutsi 

        19        accomplices in your secteur, did you say anything else 

        20        to them?

        21   A.   Can Counsel please repeat the question?

        22   Q.   Besides telling the people that there were no Tutsis 

        23        accomplices in the secteur, did you say anything else to 

        24        them?

        25   MS OJEMENI: Your Honour?

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        27   MS. OJEMENI: I do know, that all we are trying to do here is 

        28        to establish the truth as to what happened in Rwanda in 

        29        1994, but with all due respect, I think this particular 

        30        question is leading.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: What part of the question is leading?  Does 

         2        the answer -- is the answer obvious from the question?

         3   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, the witness has been asked what 

         4        he -- the witness has already given evidence as to what 

         5        he said to the youths, the -- my learned friend is now 

         6        leading him to get further information as to what he 

         7        said.  The witness should be able to say so himself when 

         8        he was asked the first question.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: The question put to the witness is; what if  

        10        anything did -- you say further he could say nothing or 

        11        he could whatever.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: He can answer that question.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

        14   The witness: I told the people who were at Byangabo that 

        15        whosoever would attack the Tutsi would be held 

        16        responsible.

        17   Q.   At the time when those people were speaking to you, were 

        18        you aware of what their intentions were?

        19   A.   I don't understand the question, Counsel.

        20   Q.   Witness, did you know or have any idea of what the 

        21        intentions of those people who said that they wanted to 

        22        take revenge, what they were planning to do to the 

        23        Tutsis.  Did you have any idea?

        24   A.   Yes, when I heard these people talk about vengeance, I 

        25        knew that definitely the killings were going to follow.

        26   Q.   Now, when you told them that anyone who harmed the 

        27        Tutsis would be held responsible, how did the youths 

        28        react to you, if anyway?

        29   A.   They continued saying that they were going to revenge 

        30        the death of the president because he was killed by the

         2   Q.   Did you make my further comment to them or anyone else 

         3        when they insisted on taking revenge?

         4   A.   I told you that at this stage I was talking to all the 

         5        people present.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber what happened after 

         9        you made your feelings known to the youths and the 

        10        people who were there? 

        11   I don't understand the question.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, can you repeat it?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Let me ask another question. Witness do you know whether 

        16        the individuals you spoke to and who spoke to you knew 

        17        who you were that morning of April 7 1994, did they know 

        18        who you were? 

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Without mentioning who you were?

        21   Q.   Without mentioning your name or your position?

        22   A.   Yes, those people knew me.

        23   Q.   Did you know any of the people whom you had addressed?  

        24        Did you know them, that is, were you able to identify 

        25        them and know them by name any of the individuals 

        26        without giving them your name?

        27   A.   Yes, I knew some of the people.

        28   Q.   Now, after you told these individuals what you were 

        29        feelings were, do you know whether or not your 

        30        statements had any effect on them and if so, what effect

         4   Q.   What happened after that, if anything?

         5   A.   They told me that I myself was an accomplice.

         6   Q.   And what was your reaction to them calling you an 

         7        accomplice?

         8   A.   At the same time, a military vehicle arrived at the 

         9        spot.

        10   Q.   Did you -- were you able to identify any of the 

        11        individuals within that military vehicle?

        18        vehicle and told him that I prevented them from avenging 

        19        the death of the president.

        14   Q.   Why did you run?

        15   A.   I fled because it was said that I was also going to be

         6   Q.   How far was that shop from the events that you have just 

         7        described?

         8   A.   I want to know if you are asking for the distance 

         9        between me and where Rukara was killed or the distance 

        10        between my hiding place and Juvénal Kajelijeli's store.

        11   Q.   No, I am asking you for the distance from Juvénal 

        12        Kajelijeli's store and where you say the military 

        13        vehicle had stopped and where you saw Rukara being 

        14        beaten, how far was Juvénal Kajelijeli's shop from those 

        15        events?

        20   Q.   Now, do you know what activities were conducted in 

        21        Kajelijeli's shop or store at Byangabo?

        22   A.   Someone had hired a shop and was selling beer.

        23   Q.   When you say someone had hired, do you mean someone had 

        24        rented this shop to sell beer?

        25   A.   Yes, that is what I mean.

        26   Q.   Now, did you see Kajelijeli at his shop that morning at 

        27        Byangabo?

        28   A.   No, he did not come to the shop.

        29   Q.   Do you know whether or not that morning, was the shop

         1   A.   The shop was not open.

         2   Q.   The youths that you saw there, did you see them later on 

         3        from the place that you had fled to?  Did you see the 

         4        youths and people at Byangabo?  Were you able to see 

         5        them?

         6   A.   After the death of Rukara, the youths and the other 

         7        people started moving towards Rwankeri.

         8   Q.   Now, did you actually see them as they moved off towards 

         9        Rwankeli?  Were you able to follow their movements from 

        10        where you were?

        11   A.   Yes, I saw them when they were moving towards Rwankeli 

        12        because I was not hiding far from the route they took in 

        13        that the direction of Rwankeli.

        14   Q.   Sir, can you tell the Chamber what the youths were 

        15        wearing as they went to Rwankeli?  What was their 

        16        clothing?

        17   A.   These people were wearing ordinary clothes just as the 

        18        other people, they were not wearing anything special.

        19   Q.   Did you see any military personnel among those 

        20        individuals as they went towards Rwankeli?

        21   A.   These persons were accompanied by soldiers who had been 

        22        sent off from the army, in other words, people who were 

        23        no longer soldiers.  There were also soldiers who had 

        24        deserted the front, the war fronts. 

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, maybe, Counsel, on these areas that are 

        26        important, ask questions which are not between leading 

        27        or anything, we would like to know whether they were 

        28        accompanied by any anybody without any possible 

        29        suggestion of soldiers and what have you, the account of 

        30        the witness.

         2   Q.   Witness, could you -- how did you identify these 

         3        individuals as being people from the military?

         4   A.   At the beginning, we could see people together with the 

         5        youths.

         6   Q.   What were they wearing?  Can you tell the Trial Chamber, 

         7        what they were wearing?  How were they dressed?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Which ones?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, we are only talking about the people 

        10        described as the military now.  We have been talking 

        11        about the others, how they were dressed.

        12   The witness:  The youths were wearing ordinary clothes, 

        13        nothing special.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Maybe that is a good place to stop although 

        15        it was not the answer to the question.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, he can -- can you follow it up maybe he 

        17        can give an answer to that question.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: If the witness understands it.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Witness, I asked you before; could you tell us what the 

        22        military were wearing, what clothes were they wearing, 

        23        that maybe, identify them as military?

        24   A.   I don't understand the question.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you rephrase the question, Counsel, 

        26        perhaps?  Okay.  Go ahead, Counsel. 

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Witness, you said you saw some people accompanying the 

        29        youths, a few displaced individuals that you say were 

        30        the military people or deserters, how could you tell

         1        they were military people?

         2   A.   It is because I knew these people previously.  I knew 

         3        they were deserters from the army and I used to see them 

         4        with the youths.

         5   Q.   Were they dressed in civilian clothes or did they have 

         6        military clothing on?

         7   A.   They were wearing ordinary clothes because they had left 

         8        the army.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Is this a good place, Your Honour?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Yes, we will stop here and resume our 

        11        work this afternoon at twenty to three.

        25        this witness concerning actions he took in his position, 

        26        and I think we may need to go into closed session

         1                         CROSS-EXAMINATION 

         2   BY MS. OJEMENI:

         3   Q.   Witness, could you tell this Court how far Busogo  

         4        parish is from Byangabo market?

         5   A.   The distance between Busogo parish and Byangabo market 

         6        is a kilometre, one kilometre. 

         7   Q.   How far is Rwankeri cellule from Byangabo market?

         8   A.   Byangabo straddles three cellules, Rwankeri, Busogo and 

         9        Mugogo.

        10   Q.   How far is Rwankeri from Busogo parish? 

        11   A.   Rwankeri cellule is practically adjacent to Busogo 

        12        parish, because there is a small road at the end of 

        13        Rwankeri cellule which leads to Busogo parish.  I could 

        14        say that buildings of Busogo parish down to the road is 

        15        about 50 metres from the road. 

        16   Q.   This road you referred to, is it the road dividing the 

        17        Busogo cellule and Rwankeri cellule? 

        18   A.   That is correct. 

        19   Q.   Kajelijeli's bar or the shop you referred to in your 

        20        evidence, that is the beginning of this road, isn't it? 

        21   A.   Yes, Kajelijeli's little shop is just after turning off 

        22        from the tarmac road onto that small road, just after 

        23        that junction. 

        24   Q.   It is actually at the corner of that road facing the 

        25        road itself and not on Byangabo market, isn't it? 

        26   A.   That is correct, you must have been there.  I was with 

        27        you, I mean -- I think you went there, because we were 

        28        together.

        29   Q.   Thank you for that information.  Now when you are at 

        30        Byangabo market, could you see somebody who is inside

         1        that bar?

         2   A.   No.

         3   Q.   Can the witness be shown Exhibit P7, Prosecution 

         4        Exhibit P7?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Exhibit P7, Counsel.  

         6   BY OJEMENI:

         7   Q.   Can you take a look at the building P7, the building -- 

         8        that would be in Exhibit 23 of P7.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Exhibit or --

        10   MS. OJEMENI: Photograph 23.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, photograph 23.

        12   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        13   Q.   Do you recognise the building? 

        14   A.   Other buildings have been built at the place.  I can recognise 

        15       them. 

        16   Q.   I thought you just told the Court that I went there with you.  

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness says he does not recognise 

        18       what is depicted in photograph 23.  I think that is what he says.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Is that definitive?  We will say so if it is 

        20       definitive.  

        21   The witness: Other buildings have been built at the place.  I can't 

        22       recognise what this photograph shows.

        23   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        24   Q.   Now,Witness, we will take a look at Exhibit 24.

        25   MR. KIYEYEU: Maybe it should be photograph 24, because now we 

        26        are having a mix-up.

        27   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        28   Q.   Photograph 24, if one stood in front of this tree, the 

        29        big tree that touches the top of the photograph or 

        30        within the shops around it, would you be able to see

         1        Kajelijeli's bar? 

         2   A.   No. 

         3   Q.   How far is Busogo hill from Busogo parish? 

         4   A.   From Busogo hill to Busogo parish, there is about 

         5        300 metres.

         6   Q.   Looking at photograph 24, you could see hills behind it, 

         7        are they Busogo hills?

         8   A.   I don't see Busogo hill on this photo.

         9   Q.   Where exactly is Busogo hill situated in terms of 

        10        Rwankeri and Busogo cellules? 

        11   A.   Busogo cellule starts where the shops of Byangabo are 

        12        and extends to Busogo parish and Busogo hill is between 

        13        the two.  Rwankeri cellule also starts at Byangabo 

        14        market but straddles the road.  You came there with me 

        15        when you went to see the ruins of the Tutsi houses.  

        16        Rwankeri cellule is therefore on both sides of the road 

        17        and continues on to a place called Gahanga and another 

        18        place known as Rwunga.  I will spell Gahanga, 

        19        G-A-H-A-N-G-A.  And Rwunga, R-W-U-N-G-A. 

        20   Q.   From Byangabo market, would you be able to see the top 

        21        of Busogo hill? 

        22   A.   Yes, from Byangabo market you can see the summit of 

        23        Busogo hill -- the top of Busogo hill. 

        24   Q.   If there were activities on top of that hill, would you 

        25        be able to see from Byangabo market, like human beings, 

        26        movement of human beings?

        27   A.   No. 

        28   Q.   In which secteur was Manjeri cellule in April 1994? 

        29   A.   Manjeri cellule was in Rwinzovu secteur.

        30   Q.   Was Manjeri in existence in April 1994?

         1   A.   Manjeri cellule has always existed.  It wasn't born 

         2        after '94. 

         3   Q.   Which cellule is Busogo parish? 

         4   A.   Busogo parish is in Rwinzovu cellule.

         5   Q.   And in which cellule is the Busogo parish? 

         6   A.   Busogo parish is in Manjeri II.

         7   Q.   How far is Busogo parish from Kajelijeli's house in 

         8        Rwinzovu? 

         9   A.   Could you repeat, please, the question?  Could you 

        10        please repeat the question?

        11   Q.   How far is Kajelijeli's house in Rwinzovu cellule from 

        12        Busogo parish? 

        13   A.   From Busogo parish to Kajelijeli's house, it is a 

        14        distance of about three kilometres. 

        15   Q.   If there was an explosion in Busogo parish, would you be 

        16        able to hear that from Kajelijeli's house in Rwinzovu 

        17        cellule? 

        18   A.   In fact, there is no Rwinzovu cellule, it is Rwinzovu 

        19        secteur.  And coming back to your question, if one is at 

        20        Kajelijeli's house in Rwinzovu secteur, you can hear in 

        21        the distance an explosion that took place at Busogo 

        22        parish, but you couldn't hear it very well. 

        23   Q.   In which cellule is Kajelijeli's house in Rwinzovu 

        24        secteur? 

        25   A.   I don't remember exactly the name of the cellule where 

        26        Kajelijeli's residence in Rwinzovu secteur is, but I 

        27        think it is in Mikingo, I will spell that,

         5   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, may the answer be translated before 

         6        my learned friend says something?

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Can we have the answer?

         8   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness has not yet answered

        11   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: My Lord, as this is open session

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Please, keep it up, it is extremely important.

        23   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, I would ask for a brief proceedings 

        24        in closed session. 

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Whenever that happens, whether it is not

         1   BY MS. OJEMENI:

         2   Q.   Witness, could you take a look at Picture No. 20?  Does 

         3        that scene remind you of the place -- I mean, does it 

         4        mean -- does this scene mean anything to you?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, is it possible for us to 

         6        project that photo on the screen?  Part of our problem 

         7        is that we are missing some photos here.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Your team?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: You have only one? 

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, we have a book, but we are now trying 

        12        to sort why I don't have Photo No. 20, and we just 

        13        borrowed it from the client, but he now doesn't have 20.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, we can have it screened, and then 

        15        for you to be able to see it on the screen and the 

        16        witness could continue using his.

        17   THE WITNESS: I cannot recognise what's on this picture.  I do 

        18        not recognise the location.

        19   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        20   Q.   Thank you.  Let's move on to Exhibit 24?

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, you can switch off that.

        22   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        23   Q.   I would like you to look at Exhibit 24 and Exhibit 20 at 

        24        the same time.  I am actually referring to Photo 20 and 

        25        Photo 24.  Could you look at the trees behind the 

        26        building in Exhibit 20, and then you look at the tree -- 

        27        the trees in front of Exhibit 24, starting from the big 

        28        one down to --

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe if you zoom 24, I don't know how that 

        30        can be done, from the tree to the end.

         1   BY MS. OJEMENI:

         2   Q.   Do you see any semblance among the trees?

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: If you can zoom maybe near that big -- the 

         4        photograph -- Photograph 24, maybe zoom it close to the 

         5        tree -- from the tree, big tree.

         6   BY MS. OJEMENI:

         7   Q.   Let's look at Photograph 24 then.  You can see many 

         8        trees there.  Are you seeing them? 

         9   MS. OJEMENI: Please, can the witness put on his glasses.

        10   THE WITNESS: Are you talking about Photograph No. 20?  Which 

        11        photograph are you talking about?

        12   MS. OJEMENI:

        13   Q.   Has he answered my question?  

        14   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness is asking you a 

        15        question, Counsel.  Is it Photograph 20 you want him to 

        16        look at?

        17   MS. OJEMENI: The photograph on the screen now is 

        18        Photograph 24, and that's what I want him to look at, 

        19        and I am drawing his attention to the trees appearing on 

        20        that photograph.

        21   THE WITNESS: I don't remember where these trees are situated.

        22   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        23   Q.   Is it your evidence that you cannot recognise any of the 

        24        trees?

        25   A.   No, I cannot recognise this location.

        26   MS. OJEMENI: No further questions, Your Honour, for now on 

        27        the issue of trees.  And looking at the time, I'm about 

        28        going into a new area, so, I'm wondering if this is a 

        29        perfect time to adjourn.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay, we have three minutes to go, we can stop

         1        here if you are moving to a new area.

         2   MS. OJEMENI: I'm moving to a new area.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: All right. 

         4   MS. OJEMENI: And I would be seeking for a closed session for 

         5        that. 

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Could you -- we'll stop here and resume 

         7        our work tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning.  

         8        

         9        Could you tell Witness MEM accordingly, and that since 

        10        he has -- he continue to testify, he should not discuss 

        11        his evidence with anybody else outside court until we 

        12        meet tomorrow in the morning at 9:00.  

        13   THE WITNESS: Very well.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: So, until tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning 

        15        these proceedings stand adjourned.
