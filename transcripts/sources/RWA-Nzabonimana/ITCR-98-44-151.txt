MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  We resume our case this morning.  

Mr. Registrar, could you, please, open the proceedings?  
MR. KIYEYEU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Bryon, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, the 26th of August 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Good morning.  Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.

Your testimony will continue this morning.  You are still under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your evidence.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
WITNESS ALW,
              CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Just before we get to the body of your evidence, can I just ask you one question regarding -- I have to put the list back in your hands.  Can't you, please, be provided with the tick list?  I want to ask you a question about number 6 and number 9.  You may recall you told us that you knew number 9 for months, and you knew number 6 -- I think you said that you knew her just recently.  What I want to ask you is this:  Did you know that they were witnesses in this case? 
A.	Yes, the day we went to Kigali, those people informed me of that and told me that they had been witnesses.  And it was that day that I learned of that. 
Q.	And when did they tell you that on that day? 
A.	They informed me of that when we were on the way to Kigali. 
Q.	But why on earth would you be together making that journey, unless you already knew? 
A.	I wanted to speak of my security, to begin with, but they also had the -- had the same problems and encountered the same problems.  In fact, it was a common problem. 
Q.	But how on earth did the three of you know that you had a common problem that required you to take a taxi together to the capital? 
A.	It was ************************************************************, who called us and informed us of what Counsel Hooper had said to him. 
Q.	And what was that? 
A.	He called us, and once we were -- when we were in his office -- once in his office, he told us that the Defence counsel had asked him for information as to her identity, her names -- and her surnames and forenames. 
Q.	Didn't it occur to you that -- I would use the third person -- that Counsel Hooper would have known all those names already, he would have been told them by the Prosecution? 
A.	You asked for information regarding person number 6, and you thought that -- moreover, that it was a Hutu person ******************** before the war. 
MS. FALL: 
	Mr. President, I should, at this stage, like to intervene to ask the Trial Chamber whether this line of questioning is a line that concerns this trial, but is peripheral to the matter at hand.  It is just a question I'm putting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you have a comment on the intervention made by the Prosecutor?  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, it probably goes to an issue of credibility, and I think I am on the margins of it, if I can put it like that.  And I may just have one question more to -- to put in respect of it, which would go to the knowledge of the deputy director as to their status. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is allowed. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Just one question, then, on this.  You were summoned to the (The name has been removed and put under seal by order of the Court); you gave his name yesterday, can you repeat it for us for this context, please? 
A.	His name is *************** (The name has been removed and put under seal by order of the Court).
Q.	Can we have the spelling for the surname there?  (The name has been removed and put under seal by order of the Court), I think we can deal with.  Can you, Madam Witness, just -- sorry to trouble you, it's not an easy thing.  Perhaps can you help us with --  
A.	***** -- let me start again, (The name has been removed and put under seal by an order of the Court). 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And that is the gentleman who summoned you to his office and tells you whatever he tells you.  Presumably he knew that you were all witnesses; is that right? 
A.	I wouldn't know, as far as I am concerned. 
Q.	All right, you are now living in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that this -- we think that the reference to the institution and the reference to the office could disclose the location, and we order them to be redacted from the record. 
MR. HOOPER: 
	Sorry for not controlling that or mentioning it. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right, now, let's go back to what we are -- you are already here about, of course, which are the allegations you make against Dr. André Rwamakuba.  First of all, I'm just a little unclear what you are saying the effect of what he did was.  You've told us that the five women he hit were -- I think you used the word "weakened" and that the two men he hit fell.  Were they -- were there seven people, in fact, according to you, killed by André Rwamakuba?  You didn't use that word in your evidence, but is that, in fact, what you are saying, that he killed them? 
A.	Those people that I saw were victims of aggression asserted by Rwamakuba. 
Q.	So, is your evidence that they were not killed by him? 
A.	He said that he did not kill them.  Do you mean that they are still alive?  
Q.	I am saying nothing; I am asking you what your evidence is.  
A.	He killed them. 
Q.	All right.  Now, you lived in the commune of Huye, H-U-Y-E, which is effectively Butare itself, is it not? 
A.	Quite. 
Q.	And I don't think this will lead to any identification.  You made your way to the hospital.  How far away from the hospital did you live? 
A.	You can generally cover that distance in about two hours. 
Q.	So, can you tell us how far that is in distance? 
A.	I can't tell you how far it is in kilometres, but I thought that by telling you how long it takes for one to cover the distance, you would be able to have an opinion, have an idea as to the distance. 
Q.	So if one suggests that's about eight kilometres, would that seem about right to you? 
A.	I cannot confirm anything in that regard.  I am not in a position either to deny or affirm what you have just said. 
Q.	What I say isn't evidence; it's what you say.  So, you can't tell us how far it is in kilometres at all, or miles or whatever -- kilometres it would be, of course.  All right.  

Now, you -- you are living there in your family home and you've told us how you first hear of the death of President Habyarimana, his death on the 6th of April, and, subsequently, there is nothing abnormal until the 19th when the genocide starts in your area; is that correct? 
A.	In the meantime, I can tell you that there were soldiers who prevented us from leaving from our houses.  That's what I can say.  That is what I noticed at the moment in time. 
Q.	On what date was it that the houses in your area set on fire and the attacks start?  Can you remember what day that was, or what day of the week it was? 
A.	I don't remember what day of the week it was, but I can remember the date. 
Q.	And what was that? 
A.	It was the 19th. 
Q.	That was a Tuesday, I can see from my calendar, Tuesday, the 19th.  And were you -- did your aunt live with you or near you?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth did not understand Counsel Hooper's question.  Perhaps if you repeat. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did your auntie -- did she live with you or close to you? 
A.	She was our neighbour.  She lived quite near to us. 
Q.	And the injuries that you both received were received on the 19th of April; would I be right?  And you received them at or close to where you lived; would that be correct? 
A.	We had already left home when we were injured -- wounded. 
Q.	And what time of day had you had to leave home, can you remember?  I am not asking for the exact time of the clock, but was it early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, evening?  Can you help me, please? 
A.	We left home in the morning, during the morning. 
Q.	And when you were -- were you both attacked at the same time and received these injuries at the same time? 
A.	Yes, we were together. 
Q.	I don't -- sorry to dwell on that, because obviously it was a terrible experience for you.  And as a result of that, you've told us of your wounds to your -- both your left arm and your left leg.  Were those deep wounds, deep cuts, machetes kind of blows? 
A.	They were wounds inflicted on us with machetes. 
Q.	I'm just asking this to try and better understand and gauge the extent of your own injuries that day.  So, let me put it like this:  When you got to the hospital, did your wounds -- did you receive stitches in your wounds? 
A.	Yes, sir, that is correct. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, your auntie received, you told us yesterday, not just the blow to the head, which you referred to in statements, a serious wound, as you've described it in your statement, I see, she also received other cuts and blows to her.  So, would it be right to say that your aunt was in a -- you were in a bad state and she was in a very bad state, indeed?  Would that be a fair summary of the position you were in? 
A.	Yes, she was in really bad shape.  She had bled quite a few, but she was still able to move, although with difficulties.  But the truth be told, she had lost a lot of blood. 
Q.	But you took her or helped her.  The two of you went on a journey that's normally two hours, and is then hostile country with Tutsi (sic) killers rampaging about it, and you went and got as far as the hospital two days later.  That's the position; is that right? 
A.	The truth be told, there were the Red Cross vehicles which move the wounded persons to the hospital, and those are the vehicles that we used to get to the hospital. 
Q.	So, you got to the hospital though, you told us, two days later.  So what day did you get the Red Cross vehicle? 
A.	We boarded the vehicles on our way. 
Q.	All right.  Now, on your evidence, as I understand it, you got to the hospital two days later, and we can easily calculate that that would be the 21st, the Thursday of that week.  And when you got there, you received -- or, more particularly, you both received hospital treatment there, and your aunt was given a bed, that is right; isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you remained in that ward with her as her helper for three days until the incident with Rwamakuba, on your evidence, and the other doctors and people, the attacks on the women in that ward, caused you and your aunt to leave.  So you are three days in the hospital, that's correct, isn't it, three days in the ward, I should say? 
A.	I cannot confirm with certainty that I stayed there for that number of days.  I'm not very certain about that.  So, I cannot give approximate length of time. 
Q.	All right.  I understand that.  But it may help you to know that when you made your statement in 2003, to -- 18 months ago, you said there that, " On the 24th of April after three days at Butare hospital", you then talk about the incident with the attack on the five women in the beds.  So when you made that statement, you were -- you felt able there to specify that it was after three days and that it was on the 24th of April.  When you made that statement, did you believe that statement to be true? 
A.	I explained this to you. 
Q.	Well, I asked the question.  When you made that statement and you said, "It was on the 24th of April, after three days, that the incident with the five women occurred."  When you made that statement, did you believe what you said was true and accurate? 
A.	Yes, what I stated is true. 
Q.	And I quite accept that it may still remain to some extent an uncertain element of specifying dates given your condition and the circumstances, and we are all aware this is a long time ago now.  So, I'm not holding you to any particular specific date.  Allr right, I quite understand -- we understand your difficulties.  But it was after some days, anyway, that the incident with the five women took place.  And I want at this stage to ask you about -- about those days.  But before I do that, I want to ask you this just on the side:  Do you know why it was you, having made statements in the Gatera case back in 1998, that it wasn't until five years after that, that any investigator came to see you and to take a statement from you?  Let me put it another way:  Do you know what it was to cause those investigators to come and speak to you in November 2003?  Do you know? 
A.	I do not know who gave them the information according to which they should come and see me.  All I did is, when I was summoned, I presented myself before them. 
Q.	And who summoned you? 
A.	I was summoned by the administration.  I was told that there were people who wanted to see me. 
Q.	And who -- what was the name of the person who summoned you? 
A.	I do not quite remember. 
Q.	And when you were summoned, did you know what it was to be about? 
A.	No, I do not know why I was being summoned to the office. 
Q.	But, in fact, you were going to be asked about André Rwamakuba and only about André Rwamakuba; is that right? 
A.	When I got there, I was told that they were seeking information concerning André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Now, prior to that meeting, who had you told about André Rwamakuba, if anyone? 
A.	I think that I had never given information concerning Rwamakuba to any other person. 
Q.	Now, you are in the ward for some days, three days, you seem to accept before this incident with André Rwamakuba.  In that time, did you see him at all prior to his arrival with Gatera to attack those five women?  Had you seen him at all in those three days? 
A.	I had seen him outside.  The students had pointed it -- pointed him out. 
Q.	And where was he and where were you when the students pointed him out? 
A.	I was in front of the surgery room, and he, for his part, was in the corridor, towards the surgery consultation room. 
Q.	Can I just make a correction in an error that I have just made or caused to be made?  In your statement, you say, "On the 24th of April, after three days at the Butare hospital, I saw 
	André Rwamakuba for the first time in my life.  And it was some friends of mine who pointed him out.  The following day does the attack" -- according to your statement -- "on the women."  So, that's the sequence.  So I misled myself and then you and the Court.  So, this is after three days in the hospital, according to your statement, that you first see André Rwamakuba; is that right? 
A.	I saw him three days after my arrival at the hospital. 
Q.	Now, in the three days before you saw him, you were there as your auntie's helper and you were by the side of her bed helping her in the things that she needed; is that correct? 
A.	I wasn't by her bedside all the time; sometimes she would be sleeping, which means I didn't have any reason to stay by her bedside all the time.

0945H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, I quite accept that.  

Did you have, in fact, one of these authorities or papers that gave you an authority to be there in the position of helper to your aunt? 
A.	Yes, the hospital authorities used to give us a written document showing that we could be patient attendants. 
Q.	And during these days you received treatment, stitching to your wounds.  I dare say you were bandaged up.  Is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And your aunt was in a bed and receiving proper treatment and receiving blood transfusions and on a drip.  Is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And during the three days, until -- in fact, four days, I suppose, until the arrival of Rwamakuba and the doctors, had there been any identification checks on you or your aunt? 
A.	Yes, people came and checked our identity card before those people arrived. 
Q.	And you had your ID card with you? 
A.	I had lost my identity card. 
Q.	Did your aunt have her ID card with her? 
A.	Yes, she had her ID. 
Q.	And when these ID checks were made, presumably your aunt was able to produce or had produced for her the identification card, her identification card?  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, she showed her ID card. 
Q.	And did that ID card have the detail on it whether she was a Hutu or a Tutsi or a Twa? 
A.	Yes, the ID card bore her ethnicity, which is Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, when these ID checks took place, you having lost your card, what, if anything, did you produce for identification purposes? 
A.	I told them that I was not of age to have an identity card. 
Q.	What age do you need to be to have one? 
A.	Identity cards were issued to people aged 18 and above. 
Q.	Now, Witness, authority to be the helper, you obviously didn't have to stay 24 hours out of 24 hours with your aunt and you had other personal needs to attend to, as well.  Did you move about the hospital freely? 
A.	Since there were killers and many soldiers, I avoided moving about quite a bit inside the hospital.  Sometimes I would leave the room to go to the kitchen to see if I could get something to eat. 
Q.	Was your aunt able to eat at that time or not?  Did you provide food from the kitchen for her? 
A.	Yes, she was able to eat.  She didn't eat that much, but she would eat a little bit. 
Q.	For your part, you had no difficulty, at least, obtaining some food for yourself, is that right? 
A.	Yes, I had difficulties in obtaining food to eat. 
Q.	Now, while you were at the hospital, were you aware during those three days of any important visitors coming to the hospital? 
A.	No, I never knew that there would be important personalities or persons who would come to the hospital. 
Q.	Now, you weren't the only Tutsi, aside from your aunt, in that ward, were you?  There were other Tutsis.  What proportion of the patients -- and I understand there were about 30 patients, you say, in that ward -- what proportion of them would you say were Tutsis, was it half or less than half or -- 
A.	Generally speaking, I would say that, apart from the unrest or disturbances that occurred between the Hutu and the Tutsis when there are Hutus killed Tutsis, all Rwandans look like one another.  You could not tell if a person was a Hutu or a Tutsi.  It wasn't easy to tell them apart. 
Q.	These were difficult times, and you would be obviously looking around that hospital trying to see who your friends could be or might be and who your enemies could be or might be.  Would it be fair to say you were quite alert to who might be a Tutsi there? 
A.	People were concerned during this period, and people were very concerned and were not discussing with one another and they were just waiting to die. 
Q.	Now, these other patients, did they have helpers with them, some of them or all of them? 
A.	Yes, those patients also had people attending to them. 
Q.	And over those three days and nights did you talk to those other helpers about what was going on, your experiences, your fears, what might happen next?  Did you have that kind of conversation with people? 
A.	We were no longer conversing with one another.  We were in such a situation we didn't feel like talking about our experiences. 
Q.	Do you know the names of anyone else in that ward or any of the helpers? 
A.	No, I do not know anyone. 
Q.	You didn't know the names of the ladies or the helpers in the next beds, next to you, where you were with your auntie? 
A.	It's been quite a long time, and I cannot remember the names of persons. 
Q.	What about the nurses who were looking after you and your aunt, can you name any of them? 
A.	I can no longer remember the names of the nurses that -- I believe that there is one who was in the surgery and another who was working at the ENT.  As far as their names are concerned, I can't remember them. 
Q.	Who was the doctor who was looking after you and your auntie? 
A.	At the time the doctors didn't come to check patients.  They just went around the rooms to see how patients were behaving, and it is the nurses who dressed the wounds of the patients. 
Q.	So, you weren't seen by any doctor, nor was your auntie.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	Except for the time when I was sutured, the doctor, at that time, did arrive. 
Q.	And while you were waiting there you said you had André Rwamakuba, after three days, pointed out to you.  

Before we come to that, you say you had heard his name on the radio.  And when was that? 
A.	I heard his name on the radio when the new government was ushered in. 
Q.	That's the new government under President Sindikubwabo and the Prime Minister Kambanda, is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is the government I mean. 
Q.	And what other ministers names can you remember? 
A.	I recall Nyiramasuhuko was there, too, in that government.  I do not remember the names of the other ministers. 
Q.	That's Pauline Nyiramasuhuko who is, of course, and was a very significant figure in Butare where you lived.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is the woman I'm referring to. 
Q.	And she was a government minister.  Did you see her come to the hospital? 
A.	I did not see her during my stay at the hospital.  As I have told you, I refrained from moving about.  The situation was very dangerous. 
Q.	Would you have recognised her if you saw her? 
A.	I do not know Pauline Nyiramasuhuko. 
Q.	But you never heard of the prime minister coming to the hospital, and you never heard of the president, Sindikubwabo, coming to the hospital, did you? 
A.	Yes, I did hear about that. 
Q.	Was it while you were there? 
A.	I heard people talking about the visits by these officials, but I do not know exactly when these officials arrived at the hospital. 
Q.	I thought a moment ago you were saying you hadn't heard of any important dignitary coming to the hospital, and I would have thought the president of Rwanda, the prime minister, could have been described as -- 
A.	When you asked me that question, the question was vague.  I did not know which officials you were referring to. 
Q.	And when did you hear they came, these important people?  When did you learn or understand that they came? 
A.	I do not remember very well. 
Q.	And in the three days before you first saw André Rwamakuba, were any Tutsis taken from the ward where your aunt was? 
A.	On a daily basis Tutsis were killed, and particularly those who were at the hospital and others were also killed. 
Q.	Was that something that you saw? 
A.	Yes, I was an eyewitness to this. 
Q.	I mean, you've described in your evidence seven killings, right?  Are you talking about killings in addition to that? 
A.	There were other persons who were killed and I witnessed their murders. 
Q.	And can you tell us about that, please? 
A.	I am not able to tell you their names.  Some were taken and ferried on vehicles, whereas others were thrown into ditches. 
Q.	Did you see them thrown into ditches? 
A.	But I do not know those people. 
Q.	Did you see them thrown into ditches? 
A.	Those people were taken, but we could not follow. 
Q.	Now, I'm concerned with your ward where you are with your auntie.  Before you saw André Rwamakuba, after three days, approximately, at the hospital, did you see Tutsis being taken from that hospital ward? 
A.	In our room people were not taken away, but outside, people were taken. 
Q.	Now, I want you to be briefly shown page 47 of the bundle, the sketch of Butare hospital.  Now, Madam Witness, upon looking at that plan you seemed to be able to cope with it yesterday.  Can you just indicate the place where your aunt was and where you were, the ward?  Is that possible? 
A.	We were in a room that was close -- adjoining the maternity ward. 
Q.	Looking at that sketch plan, do you think you can put a cross, as it were, safely on the place where you think it was?  Have you put a cross on there or not?  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. Kiyeyeu, would it be possible for the witness to be accompanied?  I'm not sure whether she has put a cross or not.
THE WITNESS:
I don't know if it is the rooms as displayed here, there is a room close to the maternity -- near the corridor and there is a door which opens onto the surgery very close to the corridor which leads to the maternity. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Hooper, we wanted to take a break at approximately 10:15.  So when you find the convenient time.
MR. HOOPER:  
But you've all seen the mark there?  

Thank you, this is convenient. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take a short recess, then.  
(Court recessed at 1015H)

(Court resumed at 1054H) 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I'm sorry for that delay.  We were trying to get digital photographs showable on the monitors, and we almost got there several times, and then -- we kept you out for that reason.  And I'm not sure if we have actually achieved it.  If we haven't, well, we'll pass on without using it.   I'm sorry, I --
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see something on my monitor. 
MR. HOOPER:
Do you?  Oh, it's working there.  That's a first. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I just thought I would let you know that we intend to stick to our schedule and stop at midday. 
MR. HOOPER:
At midday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mm-hmm. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  Thank you for the indication.  I doubt if I'll be through with the witness by then.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm sorry, Madam Witness, but we'll see where we get.  

Madam Witness, I don't know if you can help me.   Do you see a picture on the screen in front of you?  And -- 
A.	Yes, I can see the photograph before me on the screen. 
Q.	All right.  And can you help me as to what that photograph shows that's on the screen? 
A.	I see houses on the photograph. 
Q.	All right.  Now, that's understood -- well, I suggest that that's, in fact, a photograph of some wards, hospitalisation wards, at the Butare University Hospital that were there in 1994 and are there.  Do you recognise them? 
A.	Yes, I see the buildings you refer to. 
Q.	Now, just perhaps help me by answering this question yes or no:  Is that the general area where your -- does it show the ward that your aunt was in and that you were in? 
A.	I cannot see the ward in which my aunt was. 
Q.	Let me show -- that may well be the case, because if I can indicate -- in fact, do -- you still have the plan in front of you; that if we look at the plan, we can find paediatrics on the plan, and right next to paediatrics there is 11 hospitalisation wards, and the word "salle" has been written in; and it's a long building indicated there, and that's what the photograph is showing.  

Let me show you another photograph, please.  Do you recognise what is indicated in that photograph? 
A.	Yes, I can see the photograph on the screen. 
Q.	Does it show any part of the building in which -- the ward where you and your aunt were? 
A.	I really cannot see the ward in question very clearly. 
Q.	Can you see it at all? 
A.	I see the building that houses the maternity on the photograph.  I can also see the toilets. 
Q.	Can you tell me what the building is on the right, on the right-hand side of the picture?  You don't see the complete building.  It's on the right-hand side.  Which building is that? 
A.	You're referring to the right side.  Is it in relation to my position or in relation to the way the photograph is configured?  
Q.	As you look at the photograph on your screen in front of you, it's the part of the building that's on the right, on Ms. Fall's side, as it were, that side of the courtroom.
A.	I can't get the hang of it, but I can see the building which houses the maternity next to the building where the toilets are located. 
Q.	Are the toilets the building with the white or light gray corrugated sheeting on the side of it? 
A.	I don't know about columns, but I can see the building where the toilets are located. 
Q.	Not "columns."  The word is -- if it could be translated, please, is "corrugated," white corrugated sheeting on the building.  Which building is that, please? 
A.	I see the building with the white corrugated sheet.  That is a corridor. 
Q.	Well, let me just ask you this:  Does that picture, that photograph, show you any part of the building in which -- the ward where your aunt was housed? 
A.	It seems to me that that building doesn't include the ward where my aunt was. 
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you.  Can we leave those pictures, then?  And I'll just pass up to you page 53 of our bundle, where there is a photograph, just to see if you recognize, perhaps, the ward on this picture, if it -- if it exists.  It's -- mine is marked in English, but I don't think it will concern anyone.  It's page -- page 53.  It's the lower photograph in the bundle.  Does that help you, madam?  
A.	Yes, I can see the photograph you refer to, and I understand.  It is clear. 
Q.	And does it show the ward that your aunt was in? 
A.	I can see the entrance to the ward where my aunt was. 
Q.	Well, I doubt if I would be able to finish you today, so what I'll do is we'll get a clearer photograph of that or a copy of it, and I'll show you it again, if the situation arises, on Monday.  If I have that opportunity, I'll show you the photograph, and you can mark it, and we can exhibit that so that we're all clear.

But I think we can see in our photograph -- is it the building closest to the camera, to the photographer, in that photograph?  Is that where your aunt's ward was? 
A.	Yes, this is the building you refer to. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  If I can have my document back, please, and -- now, three days after you arrive in the hospital, as I understand it, your evidence is that you first saw Dr. André Rwamakuba, and can you just remind us where he was when you saw him? 
A.	I have told you that I was standing in the corridor leading to the surgery ward, and he was standing in the corridor leading to the surgery consultation offices. 
Q.	And what was he doing when you saw him? 
A.	He was with Dr. Gatera.  They were in the corridor, and they were going towards the surgery ward. 
Q.	And where were you?  Can you remind us, please? 
A.	I was standing in the corridor which leads to the surgery or surgical ward. 
Q.	And was he walking towards you or away from you? 
A.	I was standing in the corridor below.  He, for his part, was walking in the corridor that was opposite to the one where I was. 
Q.	And who were you with? 
A.	I was with other -- with other people who were looking after patients who were in the surgical ward. 
Q.	Were these friends of yours? 
A.	These were people I had met at the hospital.  We met there in the circumstances that you're aware of. 
Q.	Did you know them before you met them at the hospital? 
A.	No, I did not. 
Q.	Do you know any of their names? 
A.	No, I don't. 
Q.	I understood you to say this morning that you weren't at all in the habit of associating with other people who were there; but from what you've just said in your answer, that does not appear to be the case, does it?  You do appear to have been meeting and talking to people that you had met at the hospital.  
A.	You say I was talking with people at the hospital, but when was that?   You seem to insinuate that we were going somewhere and we went there and talked.  I don't quite understand what you're driving at. 
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  There you are with people you do not know their names, and you see in the other corridor Dr. Gatera and Dr. Rwamakuba.  You've told us you knew Dr. Gatera, and how did you come to know the other man was Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	The students of the campus who had sought refuge at the hospital pointed him out to me and identified him, so I heard what they said.  That is how I got to know him.  
Q.	Why would they trouble to point him out to you?  Did they point Dr. Gatera out to you? 
A.	I have told you that I already knew Dr. Gatera.  These students said that he was with this man and that they had organised meetings preparatory to the massacres, and so his presence at the hospital was taken note of.  We were in danger and our lives were at stake.  That is -- that is what he was saying. 
Q.	Well, first of all, did these students know that you knew Dr. Gatera? 
A.	They did not know that I knew Dr. Gatera.  This is what they said:  "Look, there is Dr. Gatera with Rwamakuba.  Rwamakuba organised a meeting to prepare the massacres at the university.  Now here he is, and this is dangerous for us."  That is what they said. 
Q.	So they were -- and this is a new piece of evidence, isn't it?  They were saying that Dr. Rwamakuba had organised a meeting at the university to kill the Tutsis; is that right? 
A.	That is not new evidence.  This appears on my statement, and I have always talked about it. 
Q.	Well, let me remind you what your statement says.  It says simply this: "On the 24th of April, after three days at Butare Hospital, I saw André Rwamakuba for the first time in my life, and it was some friends of mine who pointed him out."  

Now, just pause.  That's all it says.  There is nothing at all about what you've just said, and there is nothing at all about the words you expressed yesterday; namely, "There is Dr. Rwamakuba," and that he had organised a meeting to organise the killing of the Tutsis, "and now he has come here.  We are finished."  The first time you said that was in the witness box, and now you've added, or clarified, if you like, that the meeting he held was a meeting at the university in respect to killing the students there.  That is not a detail, you see, that's in your statement, so you're mistaken when you say that you've written it in your statement.  It's not there.  
A.	I think my words were not taken down accurately.  I believe I suggested that corrections be made.  I was not aware that these corrections had not been made.  I thought you were aware of that.  But it is you who tell me now that you were not aware of that. 
Q.	So you're saying you did say that, but it was left out; and when it was read to you, as I suggest it was, you didn't correct it but signed it as correct.  
A.	I asked that corrected -- corrections be made to that effect. 
Q.	In July 2005 you made not corrections, but you indicated in a will-say statement that the students or whoever it was that you -- in fact, the friends had told you that they were to be killed now that         André Rwamakuba had arrived.  That was the only correction you made shortly before you were due to give evidence on the last occasion.  
A.	Now I am here before the Trial Chamber, so I can explain anything that does not seem to be clear.  I have sworn to tell the truth.  You may ask me for clarification on any matter that does not seem clear.  
Q.	Now, were these students talking amongst themselves with you overhearing what was said, or were they talking to you directly? 
A.	These are people who were somewhat surprised when they saw this gentleman.  I think it depended on what they knew of this gentleman.  So that is why they said what they said.  And, by chance, I was at the -- I was there when they were saying these things. 
Q.	So you would say you effectively overheard what they were expressing amongst themselves; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I was practically with them.  I was standing next to them when they said these things. 
Q.	You told us that you didn't know the names of any of them.  Can I ask you this:  Where does             Eric Gohongor (sic) fit in?   I'm sorry, Gashongore.
A.	It's not Gohongor, it's Gashongore. 
Q.	Yes, the name you mentioned yesterday.  I'm sorry I mispronounced it.  But where does he fit into your account here? 
A.	I said that I was with a friend.  I said this in response to a question that was put to me.  I told you that I was with other people who were looking after sick people.  As to Eric Gashongore, he's one of the students who told me that these -- this person that I could see was André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Yes, but you just told us you didn't know any of these people.  
A.	You put me a question -- you put a question to me.  You wanted to know whether, amongst the people who were looking after patients with me, there were some that I knew.  That is when I said that I did not know the names of these people with whom I was in the ward. 
Q.	Well, I suggest it was a clear question and a clear answer relating to the people you were with in that corridor who pointed out Rwamakuba to you; and in that context, I suggest you said that you didn't know any of them.  Now, if that was said or if I misunderstood it, your evidence now is that amongst them was Eric -- please let me finish -- was Eric Gashongore, who is someone you did know and who, you told us yesterday, taught the group scolaire and is now dead.  Is that now your position, that he was with them and told you that that was André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I even said it to you in the same way previously, I think. 
Q.	Can you describe André Rwamakuba to the Chamber, bearing in mind you saw him, of course, that day, bearing in mind you saw him then in dramatic circumstances two days later, and also, of course, remembering that it is all of 10 years ago?  I realise that.  But can you tell us what he looked like or not? 
A.	I saw that it was -- that he was a man of a certain age, and his skin was darkish in complexion. 
Q.	Was he a small man or a big man?  A sturdy man?  A thin man? 
A.	He was of average build. 
Q.	Anything else in particular?  Was he bald?  Did he have any distinctive feature or was he wearing glasses?  Was he -- well, what can you tell us, anything else that you may have noticed about this man?  
A.	I don't really remember very well. 
Q.	I just want to show you a photograph -- I can pass this up to you -- which is one that -- while you were in the hospital, did you ever see the person in that photograph while you were in the hospital? 
A.	I cannot recognise this person.  I'm not able to tell who appears on the photograph.  In any case, it's a long time ago.  I can't recognise this person. 
Q.	All right. Could I have the picture back, please?  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just for the transcript, the witness has just been shown a registry-marked photograph -- I should say the registry-marked photograph that we discussed yesterday.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, how was he dressed?  Of course, I take into account you saw him on two different days.  So the 24th, first of all, and if it's different when you saw him next on the 26th or so.  Let's deal with the 24th.  When he was pointed out to you in the corridor, can you remember how he was dressed? 
A.	I remember that he was in civilian clothes.  He was wearing boots.  Now, as to the colour of the clothes he was wearing that day, I cannot remember. 
Q.	So the first time you saw him, he's in civilian clothes.  Do you mean a suit or trousers and a shirt?  How was he dressed?  
A.	I don't quite remember as to the distinction you wish me to draw.  What I remember is that he was wearing civilian clothes.  I can't tell you whether it was a suit or a shirt and trousers.  I can't remember. 
Q.	Well, let's move to the next day and the attack on the -- the killing of the women in the ward.  Can you remember how he was dressed then? 
A.	I also remember that he was wearing boots. 
(Pages 13 to 18 by Jean Whalen)
























1130H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes.  That's the first time you see him.  What about the next day, when you see him in the ward with your auntie?  Can you remember, is he dressed differently then or not?  
A.	Allow me to also put a question.  You know, at that time we were being hunted down to be killed.  Do you really think we had the stomach, we had the heart, to observe so as to remember such details?  
Q.	You'd be surprised how many witnesses do remember these details.  And if the position is that you don't remember clothing, then that's your answer; you say so.  But, you say -- you've already been able to help me by describing him as wearing civilian clothes and wearing boots on the first day you saw him.  So I've asked you now, on the subsequent two occasions that you saw him -- that's, first of all, in the hospital ward, and secondly, in the corridor by the avocado trees when he attacks the two men -- is he ever dressed differently? 
A.	The first time I saw him, he was wearing boots.  When he came back into the ward, he was wearing the same boots. 
Q.	And when he attacked the two men in the corridor near the avocado trees, how was he dressed then? 
A.	He was wearing civilian clothes, the usual, and shoes, that of course are different from boots, as we understand them. 
Q.	Well, then you are -- you see, your memory can go back and provide that detail.  You describe him as wearing an axe, carrying an axe when he came to the ward, carrying an axe on the third time when he attacked the two men.  Incidentally, I take it he killed those men, did he? 
A.	Yes.  Yes. 
Q.	Because that's not a word you'd used yesterday in your answer, so it's quite clear.  And was he wearing an axe when he was pointed out to you on the first day that you saw him? 
A.	I cannot assert that I clearly saw the hatchet, the small axe hatchet, but there was something at the belt.  He had something, but I cannot assert that it was a hatchet or a small axe the first time I saw him.  
Q.	And on no occasion when you saw him was he wearing a bright yellow track suit, for example? 
A.	To tell you the truth, it was some time ago, and I can't remember what clothes he was wearing at the time. 
Q.	Did you ever see him in a doctor's coat? 
A.	No, I don't think I saw him wearing a doctor's jacket or gown. 
Q.	Have you ever discussed any aspects of your evidence concerning Rwamakuba with any of the people whose names were on the list, the nine names that were on the list, including the people you went to Kigali with?  Have you ever discussed any aspects of your evidence with them? 
A.	No.  As to my testimony, I have not discussed it with anyone among those people. 
Q.	Now, how did you know André Rwamakuba was a doctor? 
A.	I heard that his name was Rwamakuba.  As to his profession and title as doctor, that I did not know.  
Q.	So you didn't know that he was a doctor? 
A.	I did not know that he was a doctor. 
Q.	But you've referred to him as a doctor.  When did you find out, if you did find out, that he was a doctor? 
A.	When -- I learnt that when they came to question me about him. 
Q.	Well, I've got your statement in front of me here, and I'm -- I will be corrected if I'm wrong, but, in fact, at no time in your statement do you refer to "Dr." André Rwamakuba.  Throughout your statement it's only "André Rwamakuba."  But, you see, it was the people who questioned you who referred to him as a doctor; is that right? 
A.	Yes, quite. 
Q.	Now, yesterday, for the first time, you gave evidence about being told -- or the detail about being told about Rwamakuba, having him pointed out, and you said this: "The refugees" -- that's if my note is correct, all right?  Sometimes it's not.  But my note reads, "The refugees said, 'There is Dr. Rwamakuba and he'd organised a meeting to organise the killing of the Tutsis, and now he's come here; we are finished.'"

So you're telling us that he was telling you he was Dr. Rwamakuba.  Was that a mistake on your part?  
A.	But the students were also refugees.  
Q.	All right, I'll pass over that.  Now, you say you didn't know what his title or position was; is that right? 
A.	I knew that he was minister of education, but I didn't know that he was a doctor.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Now, who told you he was minister of education?  
A.	I heard it over the radio, when they set up the Abatabazi government. 
Q.	Now, I asked you earlier on about other ministers.  Why were you particularly interested to remember that particular name and not the others, essentially, and that particular post? 
A.	It is due to the fact that I witnessed that man's deeds, and the deeds he committed remained engraved in my memory. 
Q.	And those deeds are something that are engraved in your memory, the killing of the five women and the two men, one of whom was a blood relation?  The details of those particular deaths are engraved in your memory; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's it precisely. 
Q.	Now, in your statement, not only do you make no mention of André Rwamakuba being a doctor, you've told us that's something you didn't know about then, but there's no mention here of his being a minister or the minister for education, no mention of that in your statement that you made in September of 2003.  Do you know why that came not to be mentioned? 
A.	I think I did mention it.  But, you know, when people communicate in several languages, things can fall by the way in the course of the discussion between several protagonists -- several participants. 
Q.	Now, in your evidence you were questioned by Madam Fall:  "While you were in the ward, what happened, or what occurred while you were there?"  And you said, "While we were there, there were doctors who would come and take away the Tutsi patients, to kill them."  
Let me say that again:  "While we were there, there were doctors who would come and take away the Tutsi patients, to kill them."  

As I understand your evidence this morning, you're saying that that didn't happen; is that right? 
A.	It did occur. 
Q.	I'm not talking about the event with Rwamakuba and the killing of the five women in the bed.  I'm coming to that very shortly.  But were there occasions while you were in that ward with your aunt when other doctors came -- or doctors came -- and took away Tutsi patients?  
A.	Yes, the doctors came and brought patients to kill them. 
Q.	So that's something that happened before the incident with André Rwamakuba; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So how does that fit in with your evidence this morning that those incidents didn't happen, that no one was taken from the ward?  Which is it?  Were they taken from the ward, or were they not taken from the ward before the incident with Rwamakuba?  
A.	The first patients were killed daily, here and there.
Q.	I'm asking you about your ward where you were.  Did anything like that happen in your ward, taken away, or killed there, or taken away to be killed?  Did anything happen like that?  
A.	With regard to the ward where I was, there were no such incidents where I was. 
Q.	And while you were in the hospital, did you at any time hear of soldiers coming by night and taking quite large numbers of people away to be killed?  Is that something you heard about or witnessed at all?  
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	When you first saw André Rwamakuba and he was pointed out to you, can you remember, very approximately, what time of day that was? 
A.	In the morning time. 
Q.	When he came with Dr. Gatera into the ward and killed those women, do you remember approximately what time of day that was? 
A.	It was about 9:00 a.m. 
Q.	When he killed the two men outside the surgery block, do you recall about what time that was? 
A.	It was also in the morning time. 
Q.	So there comes a time when André Rwamakuba arrives with Dr. Gatera and you described -- I think it was translated as "male nurses."  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	And apart from Gatera, Rwamakuba and male nurses, was he with anyone else? 
A.	They were also accompanied by Interahamwe. 
Q.	Now, can you help us at all as to, very approximately, the numbers of Interahamwe -- the numbers of Interahamwe who came into that hospital ward? 
A.	You know, when we saw the Interahamwe, we were mainly concerned with security and didn't have the heart to observe so as to be able to estimate the number of people there.  We were afraid, really afraid. 
Q.	Well, just help us a bit.  I mean, were there five or six Interahamwe, or were there 20 or 30, a lot?  A great number or just a few?  Can you help me? 
A.	I really don't remember.  I couldn't give you a figure, even an approximate figure. 
Q.	Well, when you say that, was it more than five Interahamwe?  More than 20?  
A.	I have answered that I do not remember as to how many there were. 
Q.	Were they armed, these Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, they were armed. 
Q.	You see, seeing a doctor, another man and some nurses, obviously, what happens following is very frightening, but it's the presence of the Interahamwe, isn't it, that must have frightened you the most.  Seeing them, of all people, in a hospital ward, that must have been very frightening.  Am I right? 
A.	The doctors were also armed. 
Q.	In your statement you don't mention the Interahamwe in the ward at all.  Why was that? 
A.	At the time of the interview, it's impossible to write down everything you say -- everything you state.  It's impossible to write down everything in the course of the conversation/interview. 
Q.	You see, what you do say is that, later the same day, André Rwamakuba, accompanied by Dr. Gatera and nurses, arrived in that hall.  And you go on to detail what happens.  There's no mention of the Interahamwe you talk about now.  
A.	One usually answers a question on the basis of the way it's put, its formulation.  You don't give all the information the way I am doing so now, here.  
(Pages 19 to 22 by Karen Holm)

















1200H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you told us that there was a list that they had with them, and that they called out the names on the list.  Is that right?  The names of Tutsis on the list, this piece of paper they had with them, is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And did they call out your aunt's name? 
A.	They hadn't yet gotten on to us. 
Q.	But they are calling out names on a list.  Did they not call out your aunt's name? 
A.	I didn't pay any attention to that because I saw that whenever they came up to someone, that person was killed, so we decided, in view of the circumstances, to leave that place. 
Q.	Now, in your statement you say that he called the names of the Tutsi patients from the identification cards; is that what happened? 
A.	They had already taken the ID cards and drawn up a list on the basis of the ID cards that they had already taken away before hand -- previously. 
Q.	Was it only Rwamakuba who was hitting the patients or were they being -- were other patients being hit by other people or by Dr. Gatera? 
A.	I often saw Rwamakuba do so.  I noticed -- I observed that he was active. 
Q.	You were asked and you referred yesterday to the others also doing things.  It was just that he attracted the most attention.  So, were the others attacking other patients? 
A.	The people with Rwamakuba also attacked the patients. 
Q.	Did they attack the same patients or different patients? 
A.	Before the nurses came and treated the patients, and they asked for their identity cards, they also made certain utterances and then they took away their identity cards and took them along with them.  Of course, when the attackers came into the room, they held the identity cards or rather they had the list of the patients that were in the room. 
Q.	Yes, just on this final point.  You have Rwamakuba killing five people, and you said that Gatera and the others did as much.  I am merely asking you, apart from the five people you say Rwamakuba killed, did you see the others attacking and killing other patients? 
A.	I didn't pay attention to the actions because I left immediately. 
Q.	Well, you paid attention to Rwamakuba's actions in killing five people, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  What were the others doing?  Were they killing other patients to do as much as he, as you put it yesterday? 
A.	They ordered the patients to leave their beds and they handed those patients to the Interahamwe. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think it is a convenient moment, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  It's now midday, and we take the adjournment as we had indicated that we will, at this time.  
Madam Witness, I remind you, as I did yesterday, that during this or any other adjournment, you are still a witness in this -- before the Tribunal and you are not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, we are going to be occupied with another matter on Monday morning.  So, we resume on Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock, you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Yes, Ms. Fall, for the Prosecution, are there any other issues?  
MS. FALL:
Nothing, Mr. President and I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

We take a recess now until Monday at 2 o'clock.
