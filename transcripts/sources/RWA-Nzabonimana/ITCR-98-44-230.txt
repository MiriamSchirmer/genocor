P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 3rd of February 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, before we start, can I just deal with some exhibits before we lose track of them?  The first one relates to Witness 9/31, and if I can pass it up, it's his marked document relating to three photographs.  And as far as I can recall, that's the only exhibit -- no, there was one other exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Weren't there some names that were -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I was searching my mind last night and decided there weren't any more, but as I stand up now, I remember, yes, there were some names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a piece of paper with names. They were written. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I don't know what's happened to them then.  Well, can I come back to the exhibits then a little later, after I've discussed them with Mr. Fry, before we rise today?  Though I can deal perhaps with 5/7, if that doesn't take the numbers out of order with the witnesses, but 5/7, it's one exhibit and it's a printed-out photograph of a door, which she was shown -- she was shown on my laptop; you may recall.  I've printed out the photograph itself.  And that will be Exhibit D. 26?  No.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I believe the last exhibit was D. 204, and that one will be D. 205, if I understood correctly. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. 204 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. 205 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
As I recall, there was no identification document in respect of either one of those witnesses because it was read into the transcript in closed session, so I don't exhibit that document.  And I have an admission that's been agreed, which I can read later, in relation to evidence from the commandant of the prison.  Perhaps I can deal with that later.  Thank you.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like to take this opportunity to enter the supplementary part of the Mamba Gacaca.  We provided that yesterday and we should like to enter it as P. 92, the supplemental part of the Gacaca communication.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can that be deferred until a little later, because I've lost the original document they gave me yesterday?  And until I've seen it and compared it to the later edition -- I haven't been able to do that overnight, but we were served with another one.  I hope to get that fairly soon.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, we will consider your application later this morning.  
MS. FALL:
Very well.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, this is my witness and he's here for cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  As I explained to you, the Prosecutor has to cross-examine you, ask you some questions now, and you have to answer the questions put to you by the Prosecutor.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS 7/14 (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like us to go into closed session, to the extent that examination-in-chief of the witness was entirely in closed session.  I should feel much more comfortable, much more at ease, and be able to question him freely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will go into closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 4 to 42] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
