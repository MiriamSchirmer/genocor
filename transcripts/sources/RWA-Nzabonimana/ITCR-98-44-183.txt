P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Prosecutor, can proceed with the proceedings, please.  Mr. Registrar, I am sorry --.
MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour, thank you. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kham, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday 17th of October 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera at al, 
Case Number ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour, 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

Appearances?
MR. MORLEY: 
For the Prosecution, Mr. Webster, leading.  Myself, Iain Morley, assisting.  Assisted also by my 
Case manager, Takeh Sendze, and by Mr. Gregory Lombardi, who is in The Hague, and has been throughout last week. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
MR. SOW:  
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  For Edouard Karemera, there is Moussa Felix Sow, here and Ms. Dior Diagne in The Hague, and we are with our client, Mr. Edouard Karemera.  

Thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. WEYL: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor and your team.  My name is Fredrick Weyl, lawyer at the Paris Bar and co-counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Today, we are assisted by Ms. Anita Guissé, also a lawyer with the Paris Bar.  And Chantal Hounkpatin, who is our lead counsel and she is presently at The Hague.  

Thank you, Your Honours. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Good morning Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I am Peter Robinson for 
Joseph Nzirorera.  And I am assisted by Russell Hopkins and Georgina Mensah-Datsa. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Well, is The Hague on line?  Can we - yes, good morning, Mr. Witness,   can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good.  Well, your testimony will continue this morning.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony commenced.  And, Mr. Robinson will continue with his cross-examination.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Before, we begin the cross-examination, I want to make two brief applications, and you can decide if you want to discuss them now or later, but I want to make them at this point.

The first one is an application that the Prosecutor be directed to provide us with a list of witnesses to be called during the second trial session not later than Monday 24th of October.  And, the second - - is briefly that we need that information at that time to be able to organise yourselves to work so that we do not have disruptions during the second session.

My second application is that the Trial Chamber circulate to the parties before we leave Arusha, a proposed calendar for sittings for the year 2006 so that we can determine whether or not we can meet the proposed schedule of the Trial Chamber and also  organise our work in such a way that there won't be problems later.  So, those are my two applications before we begin. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson.  Both matters are presently under consideration and we will be addressed. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Also as a housekeeping matter on Friday, I presented the witness with a document which an Item N0. 6 in my list of exhibit, which was a communiqué of JMRND Interahamwe dated the 29th of July 1992.  The witness didn't recognise the document.  So it wasn't sufficient for submission, but I would like this document marked as ID. NZ3 as will be shown to other witnesses later on trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Marked for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, very much, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ3 admitted)
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Okay, Witness G, good morning. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	We were speaking about the November 15th 1992 meeting at Ruhengeri stadium, and I was about to ask you about the remarks of Robert Kajuga which are part of a transcript, D. NZ9A through C.  And I want to ask you first of all, are you able to recall in detail what Mr. Kajuga said on the 15th of 
	November 1992? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Mr. President, with your permission, I propose to play a portion of CD-ROM 392C which is already in evidence, beginning at 19 and a half minutes to 23:52 minutes - - 23 minutes 52 seconds.  May that be done?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, what is the Exhibit Number? 
MR. ROBINSON:   
The exhibit - the transcript of this clip exhibit are D. NZ9A, B and C and hopefully the Trial Chamber can follow in  English as the speeches played and the CD-ROMs themselves are  Exhibits P. 12A through excuse me, actually - P. 11A through F.

So, Mr. President-- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will grant that.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. Thank you. I would ask Mr. Sendze of the Prosecution if he could play Mr. Kajuga's speech.  
Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, we are always anxious to assist the Defence if we can, we seem to have the same problem we had starting on Friday.  System was set up, but once we get through to The Hague, something happens in that booth over there.  Or they press a button and; somehow they disconnect 
Mr. Sendze from Your Honours' television screen.  Now, I am looking to the audio visual booth.  Okay.  I can see that there is somebody looking at me, and I am hoping I am going to get a thumbs up to show that whatever button needs to be depressed -- is pressed, so that can have a link from the computer behind me to the screens in front of Their Honours.  And I am looking to the audio visual booth waiting for the thumbs up.  Perhaps, am I - - maybe getting in please? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Sendze. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, first of all, was that, in fact, Robert Kajuga, who was making that speech? 
A.	Yes, Counsel 
Q.	And he talked about the fact that people who were discrediting the Interahamwe and accusing them of crimes which they did not commit including - - he is making reference to an incident in Cyangugu involving some mines that were seized from people.  Do you recall that incident? 
A.	Yes, I remember that there were killings in Cyangugu.
Q.	And, do you know whether it's the Interahamwe who were involved in those killings? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you because I wasn't at Cyangugu.  I do not know what happened there, but the fact remains that there were killings which were attributed to the Interahamwe and the Interahamwe wanted to show that it was not by them. 
Q.	And based upon your knowledge of Mr. Kajuga, do you believe that he was telling the truth? 
A.	For me, yes. 
Q.	Now, he makes reference in this speech to a few things.  First, he says the truth about the report on the radio about the incident in Cyangugu that it should be brought to light and then -- when is he is discussing an event in Kigali where people were arrested with grenades, he again says that, rather than wrongly impute these actions to the Interahamwe, Radio Rwanda should speak and the Rwandans should speak up.  And I want to ask you if you know at this time in November 1992 which party was in control of the ministry of information? 
A.	The ministry of information was controlled by the MDR.
Q.	And the ministry of information had jurisdiction over the operation of Radio Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, was it a problem for the MRND that it was perceived that the radio Rwanda was not objectively broadcasting information about the political events that were occurring during this time.
A.	I would say so, yes.
Q.	Now, during the speech of Mr. Kajuga, did he make any reference at all to the Interahamwe being used against Tutsis or for ethnic violence?  
A.	Yes, according to Kajuga.
Q.	Was there something in the speech that Kajuga said that indicated to you that the Interahamwe would be used against Tutsis or to commit violence as a result of the person's ethnicity? 
A.	No.  When events such as those in Cyangugu took place, they said that the Tutsis perished during those events.  Every time an event like that happened, opposition parties went on the radio to say that the Interahamwe were responsible for what happened in Cyangugu or any other place in Rwanda.  In fact, they did this because they controlled the radio. 
Q.	And that thing that Robert Kajuga said in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November was intended to encourage the Interahamwe to kill Tutsis; was it? 
A.	I am not sure I understand your question, Counsel.
Q.	During his speech in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November, did Mr. Kajuga say anything to encourage the Interahamwe to kill Tutsis? 
A.	That is a difficult question.  Kajuga himself was a Tutsi.  I don't see how he could have incited people to kill Tutsis.  So for me, no, he could not have done that. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, I want to direct your attention to the speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992, do you recall that speech in detail? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I would like to offer some transcripts as exhibits in the case.  These are found at tab 231 of the Prosecutor's binders.  The first is a transcript in Kinyarwandan bearing 
K number K0356648 and I would ask that this be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ10A.  

The second is a French transcript also in the binder attached to 31, beginning with K0356586.  

And the third is an English version of the speech which was added to the binders.  So hopefully everyone has that, and it's K0358502, and I would ask that it be admitted as D. NZ10B for the French and 10C for the English.  

Also in this particular case, there are differences that have been noted between the transcripts prepared by the language section and the transcripts that we have prepared for these speeches, and they are somewhat-- they are not very many, but there are some that are considered significant.  And so what I would like to do is offer the Exhibit 7. B1 that was contained in my documents which is the English version that we have prepared of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech as exhibit D. NZ10D and the French which is found at Exhibit 7B2 as Exhibit D. NZ10E and then at some point if it becomes necessary to explain the differences between the versions, we will do that during the testimony of 
Mr. Ngirumpatse or any other witness.  But for now, I would simply like to have all the translation admitted.  So my proposal is to admit D. NZ10A through E. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, we have arrived at a point that I was hoping would not come because this is going to generate a contentious issue between Prosecution and Mr.  Robinson on the transcripts for this particular rally.  There are official translations and transcriptions that were prepared by the 
Language section.  They did that at great effort.   I think the transcripts that Mr. Robinson has offered under 10A through C were perhaps the third generation of transcriptions, and translations of this particular speech.  Mr. Robinson and his clients made their own transcriptions, and their own translations of that into French; and hardly enough of their own translations of the original Kinyarwanda into English.  And several weeks ago, I met with Mr. Robinson and the language section to go over all these transcripts and to get some assessment from them as to which was the most accurate transcription and translation of the speech.  And as a result of those conversations, we ended up with the transcripts that Mr. Robinson is offering on the 10A, B and C.    Now, the registry is responsible, officially responsible for translations.  And it is my submission that Mr. Robinson's or actually his client's, transcriptions and translations should both be admitted into evidence.  If there is any dispute of any phrasing within the official transcription, then that should be brought to the attention of the language section or to this Court and we deal with it on an item by item basis.  But to submit a set of transcriptions that the Accused themselves have made, and then translations that the Accused have made, not only into French, but into English, would be inappropriate and it's going to lead to a lot of confusion if we proceed in this manner.  So, I am asking the Court to look at this issue and make a ruling because it is something that that Mr. Robinson is likely to pursue with respect to three or four other transcriptions.  

Now, there was extensive communication with Mr. Daoda Niang, the head of the language section on this issue.  This is an issue that started back in 2003 when the first transcriptions were made and there is litany of e-mail traffic that goes with this specific issue.  As far as I understand the language section is responsible for officially translating all of the documents for this case.  So, I am not sure if Mr. Robinson would care to respond and correct anything I have said if he deems I have misrepresented as the situation developed.  That this is something that has started over a year ago and I had hoped, or had been brought conclusion a few weeks when we received the final installment of the official retranslations and retranscripitions of these particular speeches. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Any response of the Defence? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, very briefly, we have taken the final translations at the language section which took a long time for them to finally get it to where they think it was right, and I showed that to the Accused including Mr. Ngirumpatse who is the author of the speech and they don't agree that the translation is accurate in some respect, not many, but some.  So, this is a matter in my opinion that goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  The Prosecution has translations from the language section that it contents are correct.  We have transcripts which we content are correct.  At some point in the trial, I don't think it's appropriate with this witness, but at some point, there can be some testimony as to what the differences are and what are of significance of those are, but for the purposes of what we are doing here, when we are first encountering a speech, that would be for me reminiscent offer to the language session version of the translations when I don't believe them to be correct.   I think to the best course is to offer them all at the same time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the extent of the differences? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
	They are very minor in terms of number of differences, maybe one or two differences, but in particular, I give you an example of one that I know from this particular speech is the translation section, that translated a Kinyarwandan word, that indicated that Mr. Ngirumpatse had said that the MRND disapproves of the Arusha Accords.  And in fact, the Kinyarwandan word as I understand it, actually means to criticise, not to disapprove.  And it is the position of the MRND that they never disapproved the Arusha Accords.  They were always willing to sign them, but they did cricitise as was their right to do.  So that is an important distinction but on a very small word, but that is one example. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But how many examples are there in the speech - - roughly? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Probably, roughly, two or three. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  And it's usually in terms of the translation of one word? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, has Mr. Weyl something to contribute -- Mr. Weyl, were you standing?
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Pardon me; I am simply taking this opportunity to speak about Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech.  I believe the issue raised by Mr. Webster is a question of the probative value of the statements and the translations --; I am really convinced that the translation proposed by my learned colleague, 
Mr. Robinson is more exact with regard to the speech made by Ngirumpatse.  It should not be impossible to set aside one translation for a better one.  Let me give you an example:  Even the language section can have different translations of the same document.  With regard to Exhibit No.14, we are at the same speech transcribed only once on two occasions, the transcription is the same for both occasions, but the translation there of is different.   When it goes from Kinyarwanda to English, the same text was translated by the same section, and we end up with two different texts.  The language section doesn't always have the same translation for the same text which means it is not impossible to set aside one translation and consider it that is the absolute translation.  We believe that Mr. Robinson's proposed translation of the speech by Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse is more correct; better reflects the actual speech made by Mr. Ngirumpatse compared to the translation by the 
language section.  This does not go to the admissibility in my view; it only goes to its probative value.  As such, I would ask that Mr. Webster's objections be set aside, and that the translation proposed by Mr. Robinson be accepted as one possible translation of the speech.  

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. President, if I could just add a final comment.  Translation has been such a disruptive issue in this trial.  We have Defence counsel that refused to respond to motions because they were filed in English and some Defence counsel expressed discomfort with responses to English motions in French.  So translation has been problematic from the first day in this case.  And I find it astonishing now that the accused themselves would suggest to this Court that they provide better translations, of documents from Kinyarwanda into English, than language section that employs scores of people to manage translation of documents for this Tribunal.  

Now, if there is one word or three words in a speech that Mr. Robinson wishes to dispute that he can dispute those specific words in the official translation.  But to me, it's almost a ridiculous proposition for the Accused themselves to transcribe their own words and translate those words from Kinyarwanda into French and then translate the French into English and ask this Court to rely on their English translations for this speech and then turn around and refuse to respond to motions that are filed in French because they are in a language that they don't understand and motions that are filed in English because they are in a language they don't understand.  So, we have some consistency here and I am asking the Court to exercise its discretion for a good administration of documentation in this proceeding and if we admit three or four different translations of entire speeches simply to satisfy the accused, we are going to end up with a confusing situation. 

The Defence can dispute the single word or the sentence that they dislike or they disagree with, but there should be only one translation, official translation that is entered into the record as an exhibit. 
MR. SOW:  
With your leave, Mr. President, I would like to say that I do not agree with the Prosecutor, when they say that the Defence refuses to respond to the English versions of motions filed. 

You suggested to us, Mr. President-- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, that is not relevant in this dispute.  That is not going to affect our decision on this issue.  That is a peripheral issue.  I don't think it is necessary to go into that.  

MR. SOW: 
Yes, but Mr. President, I want to get back to this issue.  As Mr. Weyl said, we cannot consider one translation as sacred, that which is done by the language section.  It is always possible for the Defence to use 
legal assistants to translate versions into English and into French that we can use to react to these matters.  I think that your proposal to ask Mr. Robinson about the problematic words or phrases will help us to point out the contradictions and look at the consequences that come from those contradictions.

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if I could just make one more reply and say that technically if we are going to try to admit a translation and there is a dispute over it the way Mr. Webster wants to handle this, what we should do is have a hearing at which before any transcript of any translation is admitted, at which the person from the language section were to testify as to the accuracy of his translation from the Kinyarwanda into French and English, and we can then proceed to cross-examine that person.    We could produce our own evidence and you can make a judicial determination as to what the accurate word or words that should be in the document.  To me that is a colossal waste of time, and I am trying to move forward, I am proposing that you admit all the translations, and later when you hear testimony, relevant to any of these issues, you can hear matters about that, but it seems to me it's a more preferable way of proceeding than disputing translations as we go along in making judicial findings a fact. 

Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just to make one last qualification and it's simply the -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Towards --
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I can use one sentence to clarify something.  When I referred to the accused in making translations, I was not referring to the Accused hiring translators or using legal assistants.  I was suggesting that the accused themselves, Mr. Karemera, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and Mr. Nzirorera from what -- based on my conversations with Mr. Robinson, is the Accused themselves that made these translations.  So that is where my dispute lies.
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, pardon once again, just something one last thing for the record, to illustrate what I was saying earlier, let me get back to Exhibit No. 14.  I have two translations in front of me, two pages which were translated by the language section.  The first is KO275151.  The second is K0275147.  It is the exact same speech.  Translation begins with the same words in your opinion.  In both translations, for the phrases are the same, but in a different translation, at one point in time, it says, "List of people to be murdered".  In the other, you have the following:  "To be exterminated".  These are not simple linguistic details.  That formulation is found in the indictment was proposed when we proposed to replace exterminate with kill.  This is only to show that translation of the same speech by the same section, on the basis of the same single translation can lead to contradictions, absolute contradictions.  This comforts me in my conviction that we are we dealing with the crucial issue here, and if the Prosecution asks us to set aside the  translation proposed by Mr. Robinson,  it is because they see great danger in that translation for their case, with regard to their case.  One interpretation of the document can us lead down to a difficult path.  This is the same document from the Prosecution.  I believe this is a crucial matter that you cannot consider one translation as official truth when we have just shown by reading those two extracts that I read, that there can be contradictions.  I ask the Court to kindly overrule the objections made by Mr. Webster.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it is our opinion that the accused are entitled to challenge the accuracy of a translation.  Now, the problem is methodology.  If in fact you are challenging three or four small passages within the document, we do not think that it is practical to admit an alternative document as we have to read to determine what is being challenged.  So, we would recommend that what is put in is limited -- the differences that exist.  Although this is not really a final ruling on it, we are thinking at the moment that the burden of proof is on the accused to show that the official translation is not accurate.  But that is our current thinking on the matter.
MR. WEBSTER: 
In fact, I have just  one final thought, Your Honours, particulars in light of the Court's expression that it has not finalised  its ruling on the matter, I point out that, even to admit a limited portion of the Accused's translation is problematic at this stage of the proceedings because it's an entirely self serving document.  This is something that the accused themselves have proposed.  The translation even if it is limited to one sentence, it is something that Mr. Ngirumpatse personally, Mr. Karemera personally, and 
Mr. Nzirorera personally have themselves authored.  And, if we were to challenge that under voir dire, these accused would have to take the stand and defend their own interpretation of their own words.  So on that procedural matter alone, it's problematic at this stage.  We were in the Defence phase of the case, and they were taking the stand that would be a separate matter and we would consider it in a different light at that point.

One fundamental aspect of my objection here, is these are translations that the accused themselves are proposing it's not even a question of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, Mr. Webster, are you saying that in a criminal trial, an accused person does not have the right to challenge a translation? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's not all, I am saying, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you are admitting they have the right to challenge? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How do they challenge that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
In cross-examination, Mr. Robinson can put, this word can be read in Kinyarwanda.  If he is dissatisfied with the transcripts, he can ask the person in the booth to re-translate as it is read in its original Kinyarwanda.  If that is a problem, he can call a separate expert. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You can do all that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What we have said here is that, we are saying that the accused have a right to a challenge.  They have to explain what their challenge is.  It is a question of fact to be determined, normally the facts are determined. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no dispute with that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And the burden of proof in our view at the moment is on the accused.  And I do not see where the problem is. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't see a problem with that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay, let's move on. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The Court had suggested that we were going to exercise portions of the transcripts. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson has said that there were three or four words whose translations are challenged. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
And I never disputed -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And I think that the record should show that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is not a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is what our ruling is. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What I heard the Court say was that sections of Mr. Robinson's translation -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson - - of course that is what I used, that Mr. Robinson explained during his comments that there were two or three words, and I do not really appreciate having to argue on these matters as such.  Mr. Webster, I think you have to accept the ruling.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The ruling is accepted Your Honour, I am not challenging the ruling and I was stating a position or stating a response to what the Court indicated was not a conclusive ruling on the issue.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's not conclusive yet because we have not had a chance to study the law these are statements put by surprise and this is our off the cuff view.  After we have a chance to review it, our position may change, but that is how we see it at the moment based on the information available to us.  So, we have ruled on this basis, but indicated that we reserve the right to look at the matter again. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, first of all, it is not that we objected to the allocation of the burden of proof in a criminal trial on the Accused.  Okay, so that the record is clear about that.  Moving to the more practical issue, I don't see that I can offer an exhibit to which I know is not accurate, and that is what I am trying to do is now have this witness and all of us will be able to utilise transcripts with this witness, so that you can appreciate what was said during the playing of the speech, and the witness can also have his memory refreshed by something that is accurate.  So, if I can ask you, okay, we have the burden of proof to show that the translation is not accurate, we can do with this witness, and he didn't prepare the translation.  How do you propose that I proceed? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we don't want to advise you.  Basically what we think you are entitled to do at this stage, we think you are entitled to put on record your challenge.  You have said that there were some words in the document which you attribute a different meaning to the meaning expressed in the official translation, and we think the record should show that.  It doesn't mean that we have accepted that you are correct.  We would assume that you would find a method at some stage to demonstrate why you contend your translation is more accurate than that of the official translation.  But we do not know if you can or how you can, or when you will, but at this point in time, we are permitting the record to show that you have challenged the accuracy of the official translation.  I don't know if there is anything that you should add at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  So, this is what I would like to do:  With respect to these exhibits, I would like to offer the Kinyarwandan transcript that the official language section has given which is not disputed as 
Exhibit D. NZ10A and that is found at K0356648.  And I would like that to be placed in front of the witness in The Hague and that document to be admitted.  And that is the first step.  

Now, with respect to the second document in tab 31, the official French transcript of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech, I am asking that this be marked by identification as Exhibit ID. NZ4A.  And, then I am asking that the English translation by the language section which is in the tab 231 as K02358502 be marked for identification as IDNZ4B.  Then I am asking that the English version of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech provided by the Defence which is at number 7. B1 in my exhibits, be given the designation ID. NZ4C.  And then the French which is at 7B2 of my list of exhibits be given the designation ID. NZ4D.  Then all of these are on equal footing and I am not offering a translation that I do not believe to be accurate.  And I will try to do the best that I can with this witness to go through his testimony.  Later on, when we put our case so that we have other witnesses, we will offer some of these transcripts with the requisite foundation concerning the accuracy of the translation.  So that is what I am proposing to do. 
MR. MORBLEY:   
May it please, Your Honour.  May I offer Your Honour, the thought that the official translations ought to go as admitted documents?  The burden is on the Defence as Your Honour has described to show that there are inaccuracies in them and that, in as far as Mr. Robinson's suggestion about his own translation, meet with any favour, those are the documents which need to go in marked for identification. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, I don't want to compel Mr. Robinson to admit to tender anything as an exhibit.  These are in fact your documents and the Prosecutor would be free to admit them in evidence, tender them in evidence if he wishes at an appropriate opportunity. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Very well, Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit the Kinyarwanda document in evidence and mark it for identification. 
MR. ROBINSON 
	Thank you, Mr. President: 
(Exhibit No D. NZ10 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could I have a clarification because I was trying to locate the K number for the Kinyarwanda document that I am having some trouble?  What I believe Mr. Robinson said was K0356648.  Could he confirm that or could we actually see what is being submitted because what I have, for the Kinyarwanda original is a different K number. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, let us just take a minute. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps it may assist if I inform the Court of what I have as the K number for the original Kinyarwanda transcript.  It's K0356593. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. Webster is correct, that is the correct Knumber and that's my mistake. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, have that one.
MR. FRY: 
Yes, we have the same number as Mr. Webster. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  That is the document in evidence.  That is marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ4A through to D admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And just so the registry and everyone is on the same page, I would like to confirm with Mr. Fry that this document that is in Kinyarwanda is D. NZ10 and that documents which are marked for identification are ID. NZ4 A through D and hence the first two being the official translation in the language section A and B and C and D being our proposed - so, hopefully we will all understand that.  Okay, if we can now return. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, are you still with us? 
A.	Yes, I am.  
Q.	this will probably -- from being a lawyer when you are able to have employment, but in any event, we are moving forward now and I am going to ask the Trial Chamber to give me permission to play now the video of the speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse which is at CD-ROM 392D and it begins at 3.50 minutes to 27.minutes and 35 seconds.  And, Witness G while this is being played, if you could look at the Kinyarwanda transcript, and I am going to ask you some questions about what Mr. Ngirumpatse has said. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
So may this be play at this time, Mr. President? 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Permission granted.
MR. MORLEY: 
Pardon too, that is okay.

1130H 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, can we stop the video for a moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Mr. Robinson.  Okay.  Well, I didn't think this is the most efficient use of our trial time then.  It may very well be that the witness could refresh himself from the written transcript, which will take much less time.  We would like to take the break now.  And then we will have to find a way of improving how this is done because we couldn't go through the trial showing all these pictures to the witnesses with a purpose to refreshing their memory.  I don't think that's an efficient way to use our time.  I am not certain what to make about that yet, but it's something that we have to think about. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand, Mr. President, and I tried to do it the other way last time with Casimir Bizimungu's speech and you asked me to do something different.  So, now I tried the second method, but I think at the break if the witness could review the Kinyarwandan transcript of this speech as well as that of 
President Habyarimana, which is also in tab 231, then we can proceed efficiently that way.  

I would also want to bring to your attention, because the Prosecution has the opportunity to meet with these witnesses in advance, and they can play these tapes to them in advance.  They have the ability to shorten the proceedings by refreshing the witness's recollection before they testify.  In this particular case with Witness G, I went to great lengths to attempt to meet with this witness by not only asking his concern, but filling motions for subpoena for interview and subpoenas with the Trial Chamber for which I was sanctioned.  So, I think I have done everything on my part that I could to try to facilitate the smooth running of this witness's cross-examination, but I am not able to have the same opportunity the Prosecutor have.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I think we will take our -- 
THE WITNESS:  
Counsel, the witness also needs a break.  I cannot use my break time reading this.  I need to have time to rest. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this is really the Judge speaking to you now. We don't think it's an efficient use of the 
trial time for you to just look at the video during the trial process.  So we are going to take a break now, and we would like you, as far as possible, to refresh your memory from the written document which will take much less time than looking at the video as a whole, okay.  We are going to take a recess -- a short recess now.   
(Court recessed from 1145H to  1215H) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, are you there? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar informs me that the connection has been lost, but they are trying to establish that. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I don't have any pictures on my screen. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, as long as we have a role here, if I can enquire, how we are progressing on my request for disclosure of the letter sent by Witness Ahmed Mbonyunkiza to the President.  I think that when we last left, you were going to inform us more about that but perhaps -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, progress is being made.  The -- as I indicated earlier, I hadn't told you exactly what was being done, but I think I could indicate that the President has, in fact, commenced doing something about it, and he will be disclosing to us, the Trial Chamber, the results of what he does, at which stage we will make it available to the parties.  I expect that that should take place very soon. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I saw a picture of Witness G.  Maybe, if he could put on his earphones and we could start.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness G.  Have you had sufficient time to read the transcript of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech at Ruhengeri? 
A.	No, I took my break because I needed to take the break as well. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, we certainly don't want to abuse you, and we are happy that you have come to testify. So, I will ask the Trial Chamber then how they would like to proceed? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we don't know what questions you want to ask Mr. Robinson; but in terms -- just my personal preference, I would suggestion, just put your questions to the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't believe I can put my questions to the witness and get an intelligent answer until he has had a chance to refresh his memory through the reading of the transcript, but if you would like me to try that exercise, I can do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not what I meant really.  I don't want this exercise to sound futile.  I am just trying to be efficient and save time.  A very large portion of the speech has already been shown to him on the video.  I don't know what percentage of it exactly, but couldn't he be pointed to what part of the transcript he should read?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if I could start by asking him things already that have been on the video, but my questions about different aspects of the speech pretty much cover every page of my transcript, and from the beginning to the end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much of the transcript has been shown on the video?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I am not a hundred percent positive because I couldn't follow so closely English to Kinyarwanda, but I think about, half. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Only half. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
It was a 27 - it was a 24 minute video.  I don't know how many -- but it would seem like we have done about 15 minutes of it but I am just guessing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, see what you can do and then, you know, my major interest now is -- I can't even explain.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness G, first of all from this part you have seen on the video, were you able to recall that 
	Mr. Ngirumpatse announced that the MRND had entered into alliance with some other political party? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And did he also indicate that he was determined that this alliance would carry out his activities and win all the elections? 
A.	Not the alliance, but that the MRND will win the elections. 
Q.	And then later in his speech, did he complain about the fact that members of other political parties who were assaulting MRND members were not being prosecuted for their crimes? 
A.	Yes, he said so. 
Q.	And then did you also hear him discussing the negotiations in Arusha? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did he say that we support the negotiations, and the proof is that we did not object to the signing of the first and second protocols, and that he had in fact commended the minister of foreign affairs for doing his job, representing Rwanda effectively? 
A.	Yes, I heard that. 
Q.	And then did he go on to say that while the MRND would be patient and let the others conduct negotiations, they had some points to discuss about those negotiations and particularly who would comprise the national assembly? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the minister of foreign affairs who was heading these negotiations in Arusha, do you know what political party he was from? 
A.	The minister of foreign affairs was of the MRND party. 
Q.	And then did Mr. Ngirumpatse, after discussing his -- well, first of all, did he discuss his position that he thought the members of the national assembly should be elected by the people? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And now I am going to ask you some questions about some things that probably we did not see on the video, and maybe you could either reach into your recollection or you can review the transcript that you have in front of you.  Did there come a time when Mr. Ngirumpatse talked about people who were sending their children to be trained and join the ranks of the Inkotanyi? 
A.	Yes, I have read that excerpt. 
Q.	And did he also ask that the authorities, including the bourgmestres, conseillers, responsable de cellule, the ministers and the prime minister to try to stop the practice of sending young people to join the ranks of the Inkotanyi? 
A.	There was an interruption. 
Q.	I will repeat my question then.  And did Mathieu Ngirumpatse during his speech ask that the bourgmestres, the conseillers the responsable de cellule, the ministers and the prime minister, try to stop the practice of sending young people to join the ranks of the Inkotanyi? 
A.	Yes, I just read that. 
Q.	Okay, and then finally at the end of his speech, did Ngirumpatse refer to the Interahamwe and ask them to recruit sharp Interahamwe who are committed to the party throughout the country, and that we will elect the president of Rwanda who is among us, and he should be rest assured that the MRND would win the elections and he would be re-elected with a hundred percent majority.  Was that part of his speech? 
A.	Oh, I do not see that. 
Q.	Could you read the very last paragraph of the transcript and try to refresh your memory? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in that last paragraph, the last part of the paragraph after he talks about Gitarama, does he say that you must recruit Interahamwe who are committed to the party throughout the country, and essentially if we do that, we shall elect President Habyarimana, and that the MRND will win the elections? 
A.	Yes.
(Pages 16 to 19 by Judith Kapatamoyo)

1230H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And is there anything in what Mr. Ngirumpatse said in Ruhengeri, on the 15th of November 1992 that led you to believe that he was advocating the use of the Interahamwe to exterminate or attack Tutsis?  
A.	Well, Counsel, Mr. Ngirumpatse, you know, he was not anybody at that time.  Even today he is an intelligent man, and it is not in the course of such public occasions that he may show himself off.  I, however, never heard Ngirumpatse talk about or encourage the Interahamwe to carry out any killings.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness G.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, Mr. President, I'm going to turn to the speeches of -- or the speech of President Habyarimana on the 15th of November 1992 at Ruhengeri.  And I will begin by asking that in exhibit -- or in tab number 231, that the Kinyarwandan version of that speech, which is a K0356612, be marked as ID. NZ5A and be placed in front of the witness in The Hague.  

I'm also asking that the French translation by the language section, which begins with K0356604, be marked as ID. NZ5B, and that the English translation, which was supplemented to the binders and bears K-number K0358508 be marked as ID. NZ5C.  

Then we have provided from the Defence, as part of Exhibit 7A that was transmitted to The Hague, three transcripts, and I would ask that the transcript in Kinyarwandan that is at 7A1 be marked as one (sic) D. NZ5D; that the English transcript that is Exhibit 7A2 on my list of exhibits be marked as one (sic) D. NZ5E; and that the French, which is at Exhibit 7A3 of my list of exhibits, be marked as one (sic) D. NZ- -- or ID. NZ5F.  So, to summarise, I'm asking that all six transcripts be -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Hague is interrupting, please.  
MS. TALON:
Please, this is registry at The Hague.  We are asking Mr. President to ask Mr. Robinson to start over.  He is going too fast, and we are lost now with the documents.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I apologise, Mr. President.  I'm trying to save time, but I'm wasting time, I can see.  So I'll do my best.  

Okay.  I'm going to start over.  The first document is the Kinyarwandan version of President Habyarimana's speech that is found in tab 231 of the Prosecution's exhibits, and it bears the number K0356612.  And that's the document that I would like to be placed in front of the witness.  It's actually to be designated as ID. NZ5A.  

Now, the second document that I'm seeking to have identified at this time is also contained in tab 231, and it's the French translation from the language section.  It bears the K-number K0356604, and it's to be designated ID. NZ5B.  

The third document that we're seeking to have identified is the English version done by the language section, which was inserted in our binders last week.  That bears K-number K0358508, and it should be part of tab 231, and I'm asking that that be marked as ID. NZ5C.  

Next, turning to the package of exhibits that were faxed to The Hague last Friday, among those is the number 7A1, and that is a translation of the speech of President Habyarimana in French -- excuse me -- in Kinyarwandan, and I'm asking that that be marked as ID. NZ5D.  

Then in that same package of exhibits, item 7A2, which is the English version of President Habyarimana's speech, I'm asking to be marked as ID. NZ5E.  

And, finally, the third translation in the packet of exhibits under item 7A3, the French translation of President Habyarimana's speech, I'm asking be admitted as -- or to be identified as ID. NZ5F.  

So can you confirm in The Hague that that's been understood?  
MS. TALON:
We've taken due note, but we believe that you've made a mistake with regard to the English, because it cannot be 1D. NZ5D, as that is a Kinyarwanda document.  It seems you've made a repetition somewhere.  The Kinyarwanda version and the English version, as you mentioned them, are -- have been given the same number.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I apologise.  Perhaps that was my mistake.  The Kinyarwandan version should be 5D, and the English version should be 5E.  So I may have misspoken, and I apologise for that.  
MS. TALON:
That is correct.  Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And can you place before the witness ID. NZ5A?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ5A, ID. NZ5B, ID. NZ5C, ID. NZ5D, ID. NZ5E, ID and NZ5F, admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q. Witness G, I take it that you did not have the opportunity -
MR. LOMBARDI:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  This is Mr. Lombardi.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	-- during your break to review this transcript; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Lombardi, I'm hearing you.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
Yes, Mr. President, I request a point of clarification with respect to the use of these exhibits.  Mr. Robinson has, on occasion, requested that these exhibits be placed in front of the witness.  And on occasion he has represented that is for the purpose of refreshing his recollection, but we never hear a request that the registry then take the document back from the witness.  And what is happening is that the document remains in front of the witness throughout his testimony.  So I just want to get a point of clarification if that is what the Trial Chamber wishes to happen or it wishes to make other orders in that regard.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry.

Yes, the matter may be resolved very simply if the registry removes the documents from the witness when new documents are being shown to the witness.  I don't think there's any intention on the part of the Chamber -- I know there's no intention on the part of the Chamber that documents which are marked for identification should remain in the custody of the witness.  
MS. TALON:
The registry has withdrawn the documents.  There was no request made, however, but each time the registry has taken the documents.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, first let me ask you if you are able to recall in detail what President Habyarimana said during the meeting in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992.  
A.	I do not recall everything he said.  There are some things I do recall. 
Q.	Would it assist you to refresh your recollection to review the transcript that's before you of that speech?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I find myself on my feet at the moment.  For the first time we've had the witness actually say, "I do remember some things of something that was said so long ago."  I wonder whether Your Honours are of a mind, before an invitation to refresh recollection is made, to invite Mr. Robinson to ask the witness what he does remember.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can certainly do that, Mr. President.  I don't think that would be very productive because we would 

then have to go over the same material in more detail.  I think it would be better for him to refresh his recollection first.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, we don't know what questions you're going to ask.  I'm interested in the economy of time.  So it might be you can see how far you reach and see -- but I said that it's limited by the fact that we don't know what you intend to ask.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think -- perhaps you observed when I was asking questions about the text of the speech before, that the witness was, as I was asking the questions, was scanning the transcript in front of him.  And I think that was somewhat difficult for the witness to be doing that at the same time as I'm asking questions, looking for the material.  So we can do that and we can see how far we get, but really to me it seems a better practice to take a few minutes and let the witness refresh his memory and then let me ask the questions.  But if you prefer me to go piece by piece, we can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask you, overall, how are you progressing with your overall cross-examination?  How much more time do you envisage that you need?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  This is -- this is actually an extremely slow portion of the cross-examination.  It's going to pick up for -- I'm progressing very slowly, to answer your question.  It won't be this way for the entire cross-examination, but there is another meeting in Nyamirambo stadium in November 1993, when we're going to have to do the exact same thing.  The Prosecution alluded to -- introduced the video, alluded to speeches but didn't go into them in detail.  So we'll have another portion later today where this will get very slow also, but in general, these are the two parts of the examination that we're going to get bogged down in, and then the rest of it should go more quickly.  And, especially, I think the witness is capable and does give direct answers to questions.  So I don't expect it's going to be that difficult, but I don't think we're likely to finish the cross-examination in the next two days.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was my real question.   
MR. ROBINSON:
It's very hard for me -- for me to give you an estimate, but right now my best guess would be that I would finish sometime on Wednesday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Robinson, we think you should go ahead.  If the witness needs to refresh his memory, then allow him to do it when he indicates that is required.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, I'm going to ask you some questions about President Habyarimana's speech on November 15th, 1992, and if you need time to refresh your memory by reviewing the transcript in response to any of my questions, just let us know, and you'll be allowed to do that.  Do you understand?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Okay.  So, first of all, with respect to President Habyarimana's address, did he say that, in coming here, he understood finally that the opposition were afraid of the elections, that they pretend to have won, but they refuse to go into the elections? 
A.	Could you kindly point out which passage you're referring to?  
Q.	In the Kinyarwandan transcript, I believe that this is on the first -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I find myself on my feet again, I hope, briefly.  It may be the Court takes the view that inviting the witness to agree with statements from my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, which are plainly on the face of the transcript -- they haven't been seen yet by the witness, because the witness is trying to catch up with the transcript as the question is being asked -- may not be all that productive, when the witness has already earlier given a short answer to say he does remember some things from that speech.  So that it may be Mr. Robinson might best advance, matter for the Court, by asking the witness what does he remember about the speech?  That's the one question which Mr. Robinson hasn't asked.  And it may be because he doesn't have any control over the answer, and I fully understand the difficulties of cross-examination, but at the moment, all we're doing is, we're asking a witness about bits of material on a page, which we can see, and simply asking the witness to see those bits as well, when the witness is in a position to say something independent, which would be proper evidence from the witness, namely, what he remembers.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, since this is my examination, I think I should have the right to conduct it in a way which I would like to do it.  I believe, in my own opinion, if I ask him what he remembers, we are going to have a duplication of questions and answers.  I'm going to have to go more in detail.  So I think the way I'm doing it, by going through the passages of these speeches, asking him if that was said, and then asking him about what was said, to me, it seems like the best way to proceed.  I don't think there's a correct way or a wrong way.  So given the fact that this is my examination and not the Prosecutor's, I ought to be able to do it the way that I would like.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, if I may ask for your clarification, it's your purpose to get the witness to say that -- to agree with you that the speaker said what is already on the record, or it's your purpose to get him to comment on what was said in the speech?  Which of the two are you trying to achieve?  

MR. ROBINSON:
Both.  And I'm trying to first direct his attention to the passage, and then ask him a follow-up question concerning the subject of what was said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, I think if -- if you can look at the third paragraph on the first page of the Kinyarwandan, and I'm hoping that you find what I'm trying to refer to.  And I've asked you if President Habyarimana indicated that he -- in coming here, he finally understood that the opposition were afraid of the elections and that they pretend to have won, but refuse to go in the elections.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, was it your understanding at this time, in November of 1992, that the Arusha Accords provided for a period of transition before elections would be held?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And was it your understanding, at least in the public speeches that we've heard from Casimir Bizimungu, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and now President Habyarimana, that the position of the MRND was to have these elections held as soon as possible?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And do you believe at this time that the MRND would have been successful in the elections against the opposition and the RPF?  
A.	Personally, I believed so.  
Q.	Now, also in President Habyarimana's speech, do you see where he -- after that paragraph -- perhaps if you look on the second page of the transcript that you have in front of you, if necessary -- did he say that members of the party should consult the farmers and discuss with them to know their pre-occupation, their topics of concern, and to share their moments of feast and be at their sides in their difficult moments; and that if the party did that, it would become stronger?  Was that part of his speech that day?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then after that, did he go on to say that he asks that the MRND party sustain the peace and sustain public tranquility, and he asks those assigned to investigate and prosecute not to hide behind false accusations, questioning the Interahamwe or the MRND?  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then does he go on to talk about specific instances in Gitarama, Bugesera, Kabuye, and is he claiming that the Interahamwe were not responsible for acts in those regions for which they had been accused?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And looking further, about two more paragraphs, does he also mention incidents that occurred in Nyabikenke commune -- that's spelled N-Y-A-B-I-K-E-N-K-E -- and Kabuye and speaking about mines in Cyangugu préfecture?  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	And, finally, does he urge the courts to do their work and say that it is to this price that Rwanda is going to recover its peace?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And does he also discuss the fact that he had paid a visit to those displaced by the war?  
A.	Yes.  On page 3.  
Q.	And can you tell us, from your own knowledge, by November of 1992, approximately how many people had been displaced by the RPF's attacks on Rwanda?  
A.	Thousands were displaced by an RPF attack in the northern regions.  
Q.	And does that include people in Ruhengeri préfecture?  
A.	It did.  
Q.	Now, then, I'd like to direct your attention to the portion after that when President Habyarimana begins to speak about the Arusha peace negotiations.  And it's true, is it not, that he says that we sustain the negotiations in progress in Arusha; and that it's false to say that MRND doesn't support those negotiations; and that he, personally, in the name of the MRND, declares that MRND supports those negotiations?  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then does he go on to say that peace doesn't con- -- doesn't confound itself with papers, or peace isn't limited to papers; the peace is in your heart?  
A.	Can you indicate the passage for me?  
Q.	Yes, if you give me one minute, please.  Thank you.  
A.	Yes, I found it.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And, in fact, is that what President Habyarimana said about the Arusha negotiations, that peace isn't confined to a piece of paper, but peace is in your heart?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you understand from what President Habyarimana said about the Arusha negotiations that he was saying that they were to be disregarded or that they were to be supported?  
A.	That it had to be supported.  
Q.	Now, going further in the speech, did President Habyarimana urge that those who were refugees, especially the children, be assisted and helped and ask each Rwandan capable, who has the means, to take charge of a child's education until the end of the war?  
A.	Yes, I remember that.  
Q.	And did he, himself, pledge personally to pay for school notebooks for these children and ask the prefects of Ruhengeri and Byumba to count the number of students so that he could buy them these notebooks?  
A.	Yes.  He said that he wanted an inventory of the needs to be made and that he was ready to provide them with books -- exercise books.  
Q.	And then did he also ask that the national secretariat of the MRND, along with businessmen, provide the cloth or clothing for the Interahamwe, because the Interahamwe look very good in their clothing?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then after that, did he ask the people that -- or tell the people that the important thing is to win the elections, and "Undoubtedly, we are going to win them because you're organised well everywhere in the préfectures"?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then did he send -- did he say that at the appropriate moment he would invite the Interahamwe to accompany him, and that someone had told him that during the election campaign, he would be accompanied by soldiers, but he believes that those who are going to run the campaign for him would be the Interahamwe because they were all together?  Was that part of his speech?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when he said that he would descend with the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992, did you understand it to mean that he was talking about campaigning for election?  
A.	My understanding was that at the right time, when it would be proper to begin the campaign, he would call on the Interahamwe to accompany him.  
Q.	And did you have any understanding whatsoever that President Habyarimana was encouraging the Interahamwe to accompany him or to descend to exterminate or kill Tutsis?  
A.	No, he never said that in his speech.  He simply said that he would need the Interahamwe at the time of the election campaigns, so that they may meet the population for the purpose of the elections.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness G.  We're going to move now away from the Ruhengeri meeting of November 1992, and go forward.  In February of 1993, did the RPF once again attack Rwanda?  
A.	I believe that it attacked Ruhengeri.  
Q.	And during that attack, were a number of people displaced as well?  
A.	I believe that some prisoners from the Ruhengeri prison were taken away by the RPF, and I believe there were also some killings among the inhabitants of the population.  
Q.	Now, in May of 1993, was an official of the MDR known as Emmanuel Gapyisi assassinated?  
A.	Yes.  Emmanuel Gapyisi of the MDR, yes.  
Q.	And did the Interahamwe have anything to do with his assassination?  
A.	I don't think that the Interahamwe were involved.  
Q.	Now, did the military training that Interahamwe underwent begin after the assassination of Emmanuel Gapyisi?  
A.	What I know is that the military training took place in 1993, in -- I believe it was in the second half of 1993, if my recollection doesn't fail me.  
Q.	And was the -- was it your understanding that the purpose of this military training was to protect officials of the MRND?  
A.	As far as I know, that military training was designed to ensure protection of MRND officials because in Arusha it had been said that a battalion would accompany the RPF officials who were coming to Kigali town.  
Q.	And had -- in 1993, the prime minister was from the opposition; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did this training of the Interahamwe come about when the MRND no longer had control of the army and the gendarmerie?  
A.	Well, Counsel, the military training, as I have already stated, were conducted in military camps, and they were conducted by soldiers belonging to the MRND.  Or they were also conducted in premises belonging to MRND business persons.  So it was not in -- in fact, it's not because --  well, the ministry of defence was under the MRND, as well as the ministry of the interior, or of home affairs.  
Q.	I'm recalling something that you had said earlier in an interview, and I'll just quote it from you.  You can tell me if this is accurate, that the training came about when the MRND lost control of the army and the gendarmerie, when the prime minister was from the opposition.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And for the reference of the Prosecutor, this is at the national government who interviewed this witness at cassette number 6, page K0294260.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So let me ask you then if it's accurate that this training came about when the MRND lost control of the army and the gendarmerie when the prime minister was from the opposition.  
A.	Now, what I can tell you here, Counsel, is that the military training was not conducted in Butare, nor was it in Gitarama.  It took place in military camps.  And when I say "military camps," I believe these would be in various préfectures where there were military camps headed by persons from the north.  
Q.	Okay.  Let's talk about then the distribution of weapons.  Now, was it also your understanding that weapons were distributed to be used for the protection of MRND officials?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, did the Interahamwe or the MRND take any steps to import machetes into Rwanda for use in protection or any other purpose?  
A.	I was not aware of that.  
Q.	Was there any plan for the Interahamwe to use traditional weapons to kill Tutsi that you know of?  
A.	I was not aware of that.  
Q.	Were you ever told by anyone that the Interahamwe were being trained or were being armed to exterminate Tutsis or to attack Tutsi civilians?  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Mr. President.  We didn't get the witness's answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you please repeat the answer?  They didn't hear it.  
A.	I said, no one ever told me that the training was intended for killing Tutsis.  
Q.	And is the same true for the distribution of weapons?  
A.	As I told you, the distribution of weapons took place because the RPF was coming with 600 persons for their protection.  Therefore, the MRND officials also needed to have their own protection, and that is what the Interahamwe were needed for.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness G.  Now, I want to move ahead into 1993 to discuss the event at the Ribeiro Hotel that you described concerning fund-raising for the Interahamwe.  And I'm wondering if you could tell us how many times you were at the Ribeiro Hotel for an event for the purpose of raising funds for the Interahamwe.  
A.	Well, it took quite some time.  That's what I can say.  Speeches were delivered.  There was some refreshment, followed by some dancing, and I left rather quite late at night.
Q.	But was there only one such event that you were aware of, or were there more than one time when you went to the Ribeiro Hotel to attend a fund-raising event for Interahamwe?  
A.	The main purpose of that meeting was to raise funds and to be able to finance the Interahamwe.  After promises were made and pledges, there was something else.  We enjoyed ourselves and stayed on.  
Q.	And approximately what month and what year did this meeting take place?  
A.	What -- what I know is that it was in 1993.  Now, it would be difficult for me to state exactly what date and what month it was.  Second half -- second half of 1993, I would say.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And was this the only time that you had gone to the Ribeiro Hotel for a fund-raising event for the Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And President Habyarimana was there; correct?  
A.	Yes, he was there.  
Q.	Was this the first time that the president had addressed the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Was there occasion closer to the beginning of the formation of the Interahamwe where the members of the committee had met President Habyarimana?  
A.	Yes.  Murenzi had organised a meeting with the president in early 1992.  
Q.	And where did that meeting take place?  
A.	At Hotel Rugwiro where he had an office.  
Q.	And during that meeting, can you tell us what the president and the Interahamwe committee discussed?  
A.	That was the first time we were meeting the president, and the president of the republic thanked (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) for endorsing the creation of that organisation.  He encouraged (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal)- - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are using *******************which you should not do at this stage for its capacity for identifying you.  I redact ******************from the comments you've made up to now, and I advise you to speak*****************.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, did you understand what the president was referring to?  
A.	Yes, I understood.  
Q.	So can you tell us again, what was the discussion between the president and the national committee for the Interahamwe?  
A.	The president of the republic thanked the Interahamwe who were present for their acceptance to create that organisation.  He told them that he supported them.  
Q.	And on that occasion -- well, I'm sorry.  The Interahamwe made some suggestions, too, and some requests of the president.  On that occasion --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Again the witness said (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal), Mr. President, and he says he's sorry.  It's very difficult to proceed without saying what he said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, let's do our best.  

And, Witness, please be careful.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, I, myself, as you see, have difficulty with this.  So I know you're doing your best.  And maybe you could tell us, then, what were the suggestions made by the Interahamwe committee to President Habyarimana on this occasion.  
A.	It wasn't only the national committee.  Other Interahamwe members and supporters were also present, and they asked the president to do his level best to assist them because they didn't have funding.  They said they needed the funds to be able to acquire equipment for the Interahamwe.  Some of the Interahamwe went as far as asking the president to see what he could do to give them access -- or facilitate their access to credits from commercial banks.  On that occasion, the president said that he would contact the directors of those banks, and at that time, he even said that he was going to talk to Musabe (phonetic) to explore ways of facilitating access to credit for the Interahamwe, without requesting too much by way of surety or guaranties.  That, in broad strokes, is what we talked about on that day.  
Q.	Okay.  And then when the Interahamwe were suggesting that they wanted funds for equipment, can you clarify what kind of equipment was being discussed?  
A.	Now, equipment would mean uniform, whistles, caps, MRND flags, loud speakers, and some other such equipment.  
Q.	And during this meeting, were the members of the Interahamwe committee showing their support for President Habyarimana and indicating that they wanted to make the MRND party stronger?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And was there any discussion by anyone at this meeting that those efforts would be done in a manner involving the use of force or violence?  
A.	No, no.  
Q.	Now, did the Interahamwe committee meet President Habyarimana on any other occasion after that first meeting in 19- -- in early 1992, and before the meeting in the second half of 1993 at the Ribeiro Hotel?  
A.	Yes.  The Interahamwe committee met the president of the republic again at his residence, and I think it was shortly after the signing of the Arusha Accords.  
Q.	And so can you tell us approximately the month and the year, if you recall that?  
A.	It must have been in -- I believe in January 1994.  
Q.	That would have been after the events at the Ribeiro Hotel then?  
A.	Yes, it was after those events.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's return then to the events at the Ribeiro Hotel, and I'll ask you, first of all, do you have a good recollection of that meeting?  Do you actually have a picture of it in your mind's eye, who was present and what happened, or is that something that's vague in your mind?  
A.	It's not vague.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to ask about this meeting in a little bit of -- maybe take me 10 or 15 minutes, but I can start or we can break now, whatever you prefer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I think it's better to break now, and we'll have -- we'll commence the luncheon break now.  Thank you very much.  

We'll take the luncheon recess now.  Resume at 3:30.  
MR. MORLEY:
Before Your Honour rises, may I just address Your Honour briefly whilst the witness has taken off his headphones -- and we've lost The Hague.  And can that be confirmed?  Thank you.  
MS. TALON:
The witness no longer has his headsets on.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Plainly as the narrative moves along and we move later and later in the relevant period -- we're now in 1993 -- I would invite my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, to consider whether or not where we go next ought to be in closed session.  Your Honour has observed the difficulties again which creep in, through no fault of Mr. Robinson's and no fault of the witness's, but as we descend into greater and greater detail as to what was happening and what this witness saw and heard, it may be -- I invite the Court's consideration, and I'm also, as it were, firing across the Court to Mr. Robinson for his assistance, his consideration as to whether we should be moving into closed session.  The problems are going to repeat themselves.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I suppose this is a suitable note on which to go to lunch, and if necessary, we'll discuss this after the luncheon break. 
(Court recessed 1331H) 
(Pages 20 to 32 by Wendy Molnar)



























(Court resumed at 1530H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  Are you ready?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Yes, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness G.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay. Thank you.  I am going to first go back to something I asked you about, an attack of the RPF, and we had a translation error, I was informed, so I am going to go over that again briefly.  I was asking you about the attack of February 1993, and I believe that it was translated "February 1992".  So going back to thinking about the February 1993 attack of the RPF, were you aware of that attack, and can you tell us where it took place? 
A.	I think it took place in the north of Rwanda. 
Q.	And did the RPF, in fact, come very close to Kigali during that attack in February of 1993? 
A.	Yes.  They got to a few kilometres short of Kigali. 
Q.	And did that attack result in hundreds of thousands of displaced persons? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as of the 6th of April 1994, were most of those displaced persons in refugee camps close to Kigali or in the interior of Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  They were in the Nyacyonga region, I believe. 
Q.	And where is that? 
A.	It was in Kigali on the road to Byumba. 
Q.	And let's go back then to the event of the fundraising for Interahamwe at the Ribeiro Hotel, at the second half of 1993.  Now, what was your understanding that the funds were supposed to be used for that were being raised at this meeting? 
A.	Still the same thing.  The funds were supposed to be used for purchasing uniforms, to rent buses, to transport people to demonstrations in the préfectures, and that was it.  That was it. 
Q.	Was there any expectation that these funds would be used to purchase weapons? 
A.	As far as I know, on that occasion that was not the purpose. 
Q.	And was there any expectation that these funds were to be used to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, did the President Habyarimana make a speech at this function? 
A.	Yes, he made a short speech. 
Q.	And could you tell us to the best of your recollection what he said? 
A.	On that occasion the president of the republic thanked the Interahamwe for the rallies they organised and in which they participated, and he asked them to be there still for the party.  Afterwards, he asked whether it was possible to integrate them as Interahamwe, and on that occasion Robert said "yes", that it was possible, and then he asked the people who were there whether they could come and assist the Interahamwe, and then he began to make the contribution of 300,000 francs, and the others applauded the gesture, and that was it. 
Q.	There is one part of your answer I didn't understand.  You said that he asked if they could integrate the Interahamwe.  What do you mean by that? 
A.	I did not say "integrate". 
Q.	Okay, it was probably a translation issue then.  Can you tell us what President Habyarimana was asking the people to do with the Interahamwe? 
A.	He asked -- he thanked the Interahamwe for the manner in which they behave, and how they have organised the rallies, and he said that this should continue.  After that, he asked the audience in attendance to come to the assistance of the Interahamwe, in other words, financially speaking. And he made the first gesture, and the others followed.  Later on he asked the president of the Interahamwe if he could integrate the Interahamwe, he, himself.  So when the chairman of the Interahamwe took the floor, he said that it was possible as from that day to become a member of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	So President Habyarimana was asking then if he could join the Interahamwe as a member. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay, now if you could just remember that scene at the Ribeiro Hotel in late 1993, as you, yourself, were there.  Can you tell us who else was in front of the room with the president as one of the sponsors or one of the officials of this event; who else was sitting with the president, if you could recall? 
A.	The president of the republic was sitting together with the members of the Interahamwe committee.  He was opposite -- sitting opposite the Interahamwe and the other authorities or officials who were there. 
Q.	So can you tell us now, as you are picturing this scene, which other officials were there, besides the Interahamwe national committee and President Habyarimana? 
A.	There was the minister for planning, Augustin.  There was the minister for health, Casimir Bizimungu.  There was the manager of the commercial bank at that time; I can no longer remember his name.  There was the manager of BSCR.  There was Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  There were the president's children.  There were many other people whose names I don't remember.  I am just remembering the main figures. 
Q.	Okay, I appreciate that.  Now, can you tell us, for example, was Mr. Ngirumpatse present, if you can recall? 
A.	As far as I know.  I don't quite see Ngirumpatse at that rally. 
Q.	And what about Édouard Karemera? 
A.	Karemera was not there either. 
Q.	What about an individual named Michel Baragaraza (sic)?  
A.	Did you say Michel Baragiza (sic)?  
Q.	Baragaraza (sic).  
A.	You mean Bagaragaza?  
Q.	Yes, thank you. 
A.	I don't quite remember. 
Q.	And what about Séraphin Rwabakumba? 
A.	The brother-in-law of the president, Séraphin Rwabakumba, was there. 
Q.	Now, I just want to ask you -- and again, this is not -- well, are you, as you sit here now, are you positive that Mr. Nzirorera was present at that event, because, frankly, I will tell you that it differs from his recollection, and it is not particularly -- I am not saying that you are being dishonest in any way, but in terms of recollection, I would ask you to think about this and tell me if you are positive that Mr. Nzirorera was present at this event. 
A.	Counsel, I must tell you that I remember a hundred percent that Nzirorera was there. 
Q.	Now, did you also attend an event at the Ribeiro Hotel in early 1994 in which funds were raised by President Habyarimana for a football team called Rayon Sport? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you recall an event at the Ribeiro Hotel after a football match between this football club and Sudan, in which President Habyarimana pledged a vehicle for this football club, and other people pledged money.  Do you recall that event at all? 
A.	Offered a vehicle to which team?
Q.	To the team called Rayon Sport, R-A-Y-O-N, S-P-O-R-T. 
A.	If it's a Rwandan team, it must be Rayon Sport.  Same thing as counsel is saying.  I can tell you that I personally did not attend that particular event at Ribeiro L'Horizon. 
Q.	Okay. Now, returning to the event of the Interahamwe fundraising.  In addition to President Habyarimana, do you recall anyone else making a speech? 
A.	Robert Kajuga, who spoke.  There is -- he was the one who was introducing people, and that was Habyarimana's son, whose name was Jean.  In fact, he was the MC for the day.  I think those are the three who took the floor.  Habyarimana, Habyarimana's son, Habyarimana and Robert Kajuga.  I think that's how it went. 
Q.	And was the son of President Habyarimana --
A.	Counsel, there are names there.  Counsel, I think I have just mentioned a name.  That name shouldn't be mentioned in a public hearing.  How are we going to proceed?
Q.	Well, the only names that were mentioned that I heard come through was Mr. Kajuga and the son of President Habyarimana.  So unless someone else has heard anything differently, I don't think we've had any problem.  Is that satisfactory, Witness, or is there some other problem? 
A.	All right.  I shall be mentioning all the names during this public hearing then. 
Q.	Well, I was just asking you who -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Over the past period of his testimony, I think he has been using the term "number one". 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Okay.  I think I understand. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was it your understanding that the organiser of this meeting was the son of the president? 
A.	Yes.  Given what was happening, it was clear that it was the president's son who had organised that meeting. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, I want to turn to another subject concerning the radio station RTLM, and is it true that some of the members of the Interahamwe committee bought shares in RTLM? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was person number 9 one of the people who were, in fact, soliciting people to buy shares in RTLM? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to take a look at document number 8, which is in our exhibits that were faxed to The Hague, and ask you if you recognise that document. 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Could you tell us what this document is? 
A.	This is the document constituting the statutes of the radio television Radio-Télévision Libre des Mille Collines RTLM, and then there are the signatories to the document. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I will offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ11, and I am going to ask that it be received and placed under seal, so that we can proceed without identifying people whose names appear on P. 9.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I haven't -- which document is it on your exhibit list?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
It's number 8 on my exhibit list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ11 admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, if you could look among the signatories on this document, and tell us if you find members of the national committee of the Interahamwe as shareholders of RTLM, and if you do, could you tell us which numbers on Exhibit P. 9 are represented by those people? 
A.	On the list appearing on page 74, there is number 19, one nine;  and nine on P. 9; then there is 
	number 21 who comes under Exhibit 9 of number 7; on page 75, number 44 - 34. I'm sorry.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I'm lost.  I'm sorry, this is the interpreter.  I'm sorry, Your Honours, could he be stopped from 34?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness G, the interpreters didn't catch this -- all of this, so let me go back with you.  On the exhibit -- on the statutes in the signatories, number 34 is the same as number 6 on P. 9, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And number 35 is the same as number 5 on P. 9, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And number 36 is the same as P. 3 -- as number 3 on P. 9, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And number 37 is the same as number 2 on P. 9, is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And are there any others from the list in P. 9 who are also contained on Exhibit D. NZ11, the statutes? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, as far as you know, did the members of the national committee, who purchased their shares, do so with their own money? 
A.	Well, I don't know.  But what's certain is that number 5 on P. 9 used his own account, and he was reimbursed subsequently. 
Q.	And was that reimbursed by his employer? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was it your understanding that the people, who purchased shares of RTLM at this time, did so as an investment? 
A.	Yes, it was as an investment. 
Q.	And was it believed that this private company would make a profit and, therefore, more money would be returned to the shareholders than they had invested? 
A.	Just as with any company.  If there's a profit, they may decide to issue dividends to the shareholders. 
Q.	And at the time people invested in RTLM, as far as you know, was there any expectation that RTLM would encourage the population to exterminate Tutsis? 
A.	No.  When we were told about RTLM, it was presented to us as a company that was going to generate revenue, profit.  The radio station was going to be created and would benefit the MRND, which was our party.  The MRND did not have the same facilities as it had previously during the time it was a single party -- or in the beginning of the multiparty system when they used to use Radio Rwanda.  With the loss of access to Radio Rwanda, this new station would allow the MRND to have access to a radio station where it could express itself. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness G.  Now, we are going to move into November of 1993, and I believe you've testified earlier that you have attended the rally on 7 November 1993 at Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali that was depicted on Exhibit 12, which was shown to you by Mr. Rapp.  So what I would like to do at this time is to begin to find a way to introduce the contents of what was said at this meeting.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And so, Mr. President, first what I would like to do is, with respect to the speech of Mr. Nzirorera, we have in tabs 232 and 233, a Kinyarwandan transcript and a French transcript of Mr. Nzirorera's speech.  The Kinyarwandan transcript has K0356659, and I will ask that this be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ12A, and I would ask that that be placed before the witness. 

Now, similarly, as we encountered with the Ruhengeri meeting, we have some disputes with the accuracy in some respects of the French translation, and so the French translation that is in tabs 232 and 233, I am asking be marked ID. NZ6A.  The French translation offered by the Defence for this meeting is contained in the bundle of exhibits I sent to The Hague as item 9A2, and I'm asking that this be marked ID. NZ6B.  

There is no English translation of this -- from the language section, and therefore the English -- the only English translation that exists is that from the Defence, and that is contained in item 9A1 of the exhibits sent to The Hague; and I am going to offer this as Exhibit D. NZ12B.  So, Mr. President, I'm offering D. NZ12A and D. NZ12B, and I'm asking that two transcripts in French be marked for identification as ID. NZ6A and 6B.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm going to object to the admission of D. NZ12B.  Actually, there is an English translation.  It has not yet been disclosed to the parties.  We've been in contact with the language section.  Their finalised translation is being revised, and I expected to receive a copy of that this morning.  I haven't, so we have not been able to disclose it.  But I would predict that by tomorrow morning we would have the official English translation for all of the speeches that were disclosed in Kinyarwanda and French.  So I would oppose the admission of Mr. Robinson's, or actually 
Mr. Nzirorera's transcription and translation, on the same basis that I made these objections earlier this morning. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Well, Mr. President, this is, I believe, on a slightly different footing than what we dealt with this morning, because we have no English translation from the language section.  So we are not contending that the English translation is incorrect because we have never received it.  So I think we are entitled, in the absence of any other English translation, to offer ours, and it will go to the weight as to whether or not later there are any contradictions or any problems.  So I believe it should be admitted as an exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour will recall that, when we had the official English translation for the speeches of the 
15th of November 1992, Mr. Robinson chose not to rely on them.  So the fact that we don't have those translations before us at this time is not a basis to move forward with admission of his client's transcriptions and translations.  

Now, the same procedure that we adopted this morning, we can adopt right now, which is to have the witness look at the Kinyarwanda original transcription, which has been made available to us through the language section, and move forward with that.  

Failing that, we can take a short break, and I will contact the language section to see if they have completed their final revision of the English transcription, and we can wait until that is available.
MR. MORLEY:
May it please, Your Honour, I do apologise for rising to my feet as Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues are deliberating, but may I make one small contribution to what's being said about the exhibits?  Your Honour knows I have a particular interest in the exhibits.  It seems to me the one point which hasn't been made, and which Your Honour may wish to consider, is Mr. Robinson's version in English is not accepted by the Prosecution, just as there are occasions when Mr. Robinson doesn't accept versions which have been put forward through the registry as Prosecution exhibits.  

When that happens, Your Honour has made decisions that such matters are marked for identification, and they have to be formally proved at a later time.  Insofar as Mr. Robinson is offering a Defence version in English, which my learned friend leading, Mr. Webster, does not accept, then Your Honour is invited to say that the proper way forward is to have that document marked for identification.  It will be formally proved in due course.  But as it is not formally accepted by the Prosecution, Your Honour may feel it cannot be admitted formally into evidence of itself. 

It still needs, in time, to be formally proved.  If it is admitted formally into evidence, it no longer requires any proof or any explanation as to its origin or how it was created.  Because it is not accepted, Your Honour is invited to say, consistent with what we have been doing with Prosecution exhibits which have not be accepted, that they are marked for identification to be formally proved.  So it is not D. NZ12B, it becomes ID. NZ6C.  I hope that helps and I'm sorry to interrupt. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We decided to admit the Kinyarwandan document into evidence and to allow the other documents to be marked for identification.  We think that it would be necessary for the source of the documents to be authenticated before it could be admitted as a -- as a -- as an exhibit.  We don't know its source, and there has been no attempt to establish its authenticity as yet.  But we think it can be used to facilitate your questioning and allow understanding of what the witness says.  For now it is marked as an exhibit -- marked for identification.  The witness' testimony will be based on the original Kinyarwandan document which will be exhibited. 

Mr. Registrar, is that clear enough?
MR. FRY:
Yes, very clear, Your Honour. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  So I understand then that the Kinyarwandan version of this will be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ12A, the French version from the language section is ID. NZ6A, the French translation provided by the Defence is ID. NZ6B, and the English provided by the Defence is ID. NZ6C, is that correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Registrar?  

The Registrar suggested the number is just 12.  There is nothing else.  So we will use just 12. 

	(Exhibit No. D. NZ12, ID. NZ6A, ID. NZ6B and ID. NZ6C admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  So can Exhibit D. NZ12 be placed before the witness in The Hague. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness, tell me when you have that document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this translation is what document in The Hague?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
The translation by the language section--
MR. PRESIDENT:
The English translation. 
MR. ROBINSON.
The English translation in The Hague is my Exhibit 9A1. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, what I'm going to try to do is ask you about the contents of the speech of Mr. Nzirorera.  First of all, I would like to ask you whether you recall his speech in detail without having to look at the transcript.  Do you recall it just from memory? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, if you could look at the transcript while I'm asking you these questions, and if you need time to do that, you could certainly take your time.  So I want to ask you first of all if you could -- would you agree that the topic of Mr. Nzirorera's speech concerned elections that had recently been held in the demilitarised zone in Rwanda. 
A.	According to the document, the speech was made in Nyamirambo. 
Q.	I think there was another translation problem into French.  The speech was made in Nyamirambo, but the topic of the speech was elections which had been held in the demilitarised zone, correct? 
A.	I told you that I don't remember, so I can't take a stance on this speech without reading it.  This is the first time that I'm reading it. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's try to go through this together then.  At the beginning of the speech, does Mr. Nzirorera speak about the attack that was launched by the Inkotanyi on 1 October 1990? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does he say that at that time the Inkotanyi attacked, saying that they came wanting to repatriate refugees, but in fact, six months after the attack, the project of repatriation of the refugees was already forgotten?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does he go on to say that, after the constitution was adopted in June of 1991, providing the opportunity to make a transition government, to prepare and organise the elections in the country, the government had been put in place on the 16th of April 1992, chaired by Dismas Nsengiyaremye, and had the permission to prepare and organise the election?  Did he say that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then did he note that, after the 12-month period of the transitional government had expired, it was given an additional three months for the organising of elections? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does Mr. Nzirorera go on to say that the opposition wants the transition to go on for a long time? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then does he speak of elections that actually took place pursuant to the Kinihira protocols, in areas in Byumba préfecture and Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then does he go on to announce the results of those elections? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And without going into the figures, did he express the fact that the MRND had been overwhelmingly successful in this election, and that most -- the great majority of the councillors and all three of the bourgmestres in Byumba came from the MRND? 
A.	I wasn't able to follow.  There were some interruptions. 
Q.	Okay.  I'll repeat my question:   Does Mr. Nzirorera go on to say that, among those elected in Byumba, the great majority of the councillors and all three of the bourgmestres were from the MRND? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then with respect to Ruhengeri préfecture, does Mr. Nzirorera also announce that the MRND won the great majority of the positions in the communes of Ruhengeri in which there had been elections? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then, after he announces the results of the elections for the various communes, including the last one being Kinigi commune, does he go on to say that there is one problem; the elected people are beaten, tied up and deported because the Inkotanyi didn't want to evacuate the demilitarised zone? 
A.	I can't find that. 
Q.	On page -- page 3, the very last paragraph. 
A.	It doesn't match with what you explained. 
Q.	Well, were you aware that, after the elections in the demilitarised zone in November 1993, those persons who had been elected from MRND were killed or assaulted? 
A.	Yes, I believe I did hear that. 
Q.	And, in fact, the killings in November 1993 in that region were a bone of contention between the MRND and UNAMIR, when UNAMIR failed to investigate those killings adequately, is that correct? 
A.	I am not in a position to confirm that. 
Q.	Do you recall, however, that people who were elected from MRND, in the demilarised (sic) zone were either killed or beaten after those elections? 
A.	What I know is that those elected from the demilitarised zones had some problems.  They had problems with the RPF. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, I would like to direct your attention to the last paragraph of the speech.
MR. MORLEY:
Before my learned friend does so, perhaps if the witness might take his headphones off.  Please confirm when that has happened. 
MS. TALON:
Yes, the witness has taken his headsets off.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet at the moment to raise a query about the procedure which we're following.  My learned friend is doing his best to elicit aspects of the speech by Nzirorera, and one doesn't want to have to read the whole speech out, because it would take forever and a day.  We would be here until well into 2008.  But one of the features of what is taking place is selective reading, and if Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues have page 3 of Mr. Robinson's helpful marked-for-identification, English version, Your Honours will see -- Your Honour is looking at me in a way which suggests that perhaps I must be slightly mad. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am just slightly amused that you relied on Mr. Robinson's translation.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I always think Mr. Robinson is trying to do his best to help, but what goes in evidence and what doesn't is a matter for formality.  But as we have the document in front of us, and I assume that Your Honours have the document, and therefore it's of assistance to you, as Mr. Robinson is reading questions or aspects to the witness.  Am I wrong to assume that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you just excuse me for one moment, Mr. Morley.  

Yes, Mr. Morley?  I'm sorry for the interruption.
MR. MORLEY:
May I make the enquiry?  It may be that my unfamiliarity with procedures is about to become luminescent.  But I'm assuming that Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues have copies of the document which have been marked for identification ID. NZ6C as tools to assist with the direction of the question, and what it is that Mr. Robinson is asking about. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, one of us is using the French translation, and the other two have access to the document that has been marked for identification.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  Well, that's very helpful, thank you.  I'm anticipating that it may be that Your Honour has the English version directly in front of Your Honour, and that page 3, middle of the page, paragraph which begins "From then on, dear militants," is where your Honour's mind has been concentrating a moment ago.  Does Your Honour have that paragraph?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will see that Mr. Robinson has helpfully, and for obvious reasons, read the sentence which is three lines down:  "They are beaten, they are tied up, they are deported, because the Inkotanyi didn't want to evacuate the demilitarised zone."  Does Your Honour have that sentence?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sort of.
MR. MORLEY:
It's three lines down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have it.  I -- I just noticed that you -- you, sort of, actually paraphrased "demilitarised zone".
MR. MORLEY:
I paraphrased it in exactly the way that Mr. Robinson did.  That was the expression he used.  The reason I'm on my feet is for context.  Mr. Robinson has skillfully moved on to another area of the speech that he wants to ask questions about, but Your Honours may be interested in, of course, the next two sentences, because arguably it turns a slightly more sinister light on what's being said.  

On the one hand Mr. Robinson is eliciting, and quite fairly, that Mr. Nzirorera was expressing unhappiness at what had happened to MRND officials who'd been elected, but what isn't then drawn to the attention of the court, because we don't read the entire speech, is what Mr. Nzirorera goes on to say is going to happen next.  

The reason, therefore, I'm on my feet is to draw the Court's attention to what may be thought to be the dissatisfactory nature of this method of questioning.  It simply cherry-picks small sections of the speech which one worries may not otherwise be considered in its whole.  What the answer to this problem is, is difficult to know.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think I have an answer to it.  We don't want the whole speeches read.  We cannot do our job unless we read them ourselves.  We think counsel, both the Prosecution and the Defence, are entitled to draw attention to the witness to matters that they want to highlight.  And you can bring this up in re-examination if you want to expand what Mr. Robinson has done, just as he is entitled to expand what the Prosecutor has done in this cross-examination.  So we think if the procedure follows its normal course, there would generally be fair play.
MR. MORLEY:
I see the direction of Your Honour's mind.  It may be that, in my home jurisdiction, the business of cross-examining in a way which ensures the context of what is being elicited is always made plain and fair before the witness, is something which has no role here.  What it is that can be done, of course, is a re-examination on these relevant areas.  But I was simply on my feet to establish whether Your Honour would wish Mr. Robinson to maintain context. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I think that it's obvious -- I mean I'm happy to read the speech.  That would be my preference, that we read every speech of Mr. Nzirorera and Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Karemera, and that's probably the fairest way to present to you exactly what they said, word for word, verbatim.  And that is the preference that I would have to do that.  I don't think there is anything sinister in anything 
Mr. Nzirorera said.  The sinister part, I think, is an inference that there is anything about these speeches that in any way encourages the crimes for which these people are on trial, because it is clear that there is not.  Now, I'm trying to assist the Trial Chamber to move forward, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we do not expect either counsel to read the entire speeches onto the record.  We, as judges, have to familiarise ourselves with the evidence, and we will do that.  We are expected to draw attention to the issues that you wish to highlight.  If Mr. Morley has raised a particular issue about a context, then you can -- you can accommodate him and read the whole paragraph.  But we don't expect the whole speeches to be read.
MR. ROBINSON:  
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he has asked that a particular two sentences be read, then accommodate him. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness G, we're going -- can you put your headphones back on, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can the previous statement be repeated?  The interpreters didn't get it in the booth, from The Hague, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Could the registrar in The Hague please make your comment again?  It was not understood here in Arusha.  
MS. TALON:
We were wondering, Mr. President, whether it isn't time for the break.  Thank you, sir. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, you don't seem to be doing your work properly.  I thought you were taking up the role of official time-keeper?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I -- I think that others are finding my examination to be less than scintillating. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I suppose we can take the break now. 
(Pages 33 to 45 by Jennifer Spring)












1700H  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you can resume, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. President.  I just want to express to you that I am doing my best to move quickly, but at the same time I am being asked to -- you know, to read additional text by the Prosecutor and to slow down by the interpreters.  So maybe we will not be going as quickly as we are capable of, but I will try to accommodate everyone's concerns. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Witness G, what I would like you to do is to take the transcript in Kinyarwandan of Mr. Nzirorera's speech which is Exhibit D. NZ12.  I would like you to look at the third page, in the very last paragraph and the first four lines of that paragraph before the applause is noticed.  I would like you to read those four lines to us? 
A.	"You will understand that our party is in good health. We only have one problem.  Presently, they are in disarray or they are beaten every day.  They are very zealous because the Inkotanyi have refused to leave.  He told them, "We are going to leave you and we will await the general elections".  I would like to tell you about a problem - - 
Q.	Okay excuse, Witness.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The witness believes that that is where he should stop in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
He is right. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness G.  Now from that part that you have just read, is there any indication to you of anything sinister that Mr. Nzirorera is suggesting? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Maybe I can enquire from Mr. Morley, if there is there are other paragraphs of this speech that we would like to him to read.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Inaudible)
BY MR. ROBINSON:   
Q.	Now, Witness G, going to the last paragraph of the speech, if you could look at that, it is on page 5.  Does Mr. Nzirorera indicate that the RPF and the opposition parties don't want to end the transition, but the MRND should over the next 12 months ask for the elections so that the country can be led by people who are elected by the people?  Does he say that?  
A.	12 months and not 12 years. 
Q.	I think also we had another translation error.  I actually said 12 months.  So perhaps we are thinking about out the same thing but it is not coming out that way.  But let me ask you the question again: Does Mr. Nzirorera say that the RPF and the opposition don't want to end the transition, but the MRND should require during the next 12 months that elections be held so the country can be led by people who are elected? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written here. 
Q.	And is there anything else in Mr. Nzirorera's speech which suggests that Tutsis should be targeted or exterminated? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness G and we are now going to proceed to deal with the speech of Edouard Karemera on the 7th of November 1993. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
	And returning to tabs 232 and 233, I would ask that the Kinyarwandan text from the language section which bears K number 0356672, be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ13A and that the French text from the Language section found at Tab 232 and 233 bearing the number K0356664 be admitted as D. NZ13B as there is no dispute with respect to the speech as to its accuracy in translation.  And then, I would ask that the English version provided by the Defence with the speech, there being no language section - - English version be marked as ID. NZ7 and be used during these proceedings under that number for identification.  

So at this time, Mr. President, I offer exhibits D. NZ13A and B. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, that is clear?
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ7, admitted) 
MR FRY: 
	It is okay --  
	 (Exhibit No. D. NZ13A and B admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
And the Kinyarwanda transcript D. NZ13 A can be placed in front of the witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
 	Mr. Robinson, I am sorry, could you please give us the reference for your English version? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
 	My English version is No. 9C on those exhibits that were taken to The Hague.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, do you have the Kinyarwandan transcript of Mr. Karemera's speech?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Okay.  You are going to treat this a little bit differently. I am going to ask you two questions about this speech and the two questions are following:  First, during this speech is Mr. Karemera speaking about the problem of compensating the members of the commune's cellules in Rwanda?  And secondly, in this speech does Mr. Karemera refer in anyway to attacks or extermination of Tutsis?  And what I would like you to do to answer those two questions is to read to yourself the transcripts that has been placed before you and let me know when you finish and I will ask you those questions to you one by one.  
	Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I understand you. 
Q.	Thank you.  Go ahead and start reading, and let us know when you are done?
(Pages 46 to 48 by Petrus Chijarira) 





























1730H 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I am done. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, very much, Witness G, and I apologise for making you work so hard.  My first question is then; was Mr. Karemera speaking about the problem of compensation for members of the committees of cellules in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in his speech, did he make any reference whatsoever or allusion to attacks or extermination against Tutsis? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  And we are now ready to move on to the speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse at Nyamirambo stadium on the 7th of November 1993.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So turning once again to tab 232 and 233, I am asking that the Kinyarwandan text found on those tabs of the speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse be marked as D.NZ14.  And the K number is K0356648.  And I will offer that as D. NZ14 at this time, and ask that it be placed before the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is so ordered. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ14 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am now going to ask that the French translation of this speech from the language section, which is also found in tab 232 or 233, and bears the K number, K0356643 be marked as ID.  NZ8A.  And that the French translation provided by the Defence in exhibits sent to The Hague under 9B2, be identified as ID.  NZ8B.  And that the English of the speech provided by the Defence at item 9B1, be marked as ID.  NZ8C.  May that be done, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's so ordered. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ8A, NZ8B, NZ8C, admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	So now Witness G, you have in front of you the Kinyarwandan transcript of Mathieu's speech.

Witness G, it is not necessary for you to read the speech first.  We are going to go through it like we have done in the past before we started with Mr.  Karemera's.  So, can you just confirm to me that you have that transcript in front of you?  
MS. TALON: 
Mr. President, for a short while we haven't been getting any sound, and so we are not quite sure what's going on in Arusha. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry; I will ask Mr. Registrar just to check on that, please.  
MR. FRY:
Can The Hague confirm whether they are hearing the sound properly now, or whether I should go out and check it?  
MS. TALON: 
The sound has been restored, Mr. President.  However, could Counsel Robinson kindly start all over as the witness did not follow what he said a short while ago? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, thank you.  Mr. Witness G, you have in front of you the Kinyarwanda transcript of 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech at Nyamirambo stadium on the 7th of November, 1993? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay.  So we are going to go through this, and I would like you to look at the transcript on the first page, and the second paragraph.  And is it correct that Mr. Ngirumpatse, "Thanks the Interahamwe for their tomorrow's party, and even there they are the Rwanda of tomorrow."  Do you see it there? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then turning to the second page, on the first four paragraphs on the second page, or perhaps even a little further down, do you see that Mr. Ngirumpatse is directing himself to the whole youth of Rwanda and asking them to listen and discover the truth; and saying that they wished that there were no more fights or blows among the Rwandan youth, did he say that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then does he go on to say in the next paragraph that we don't wish any battles between the young.  This time is by gun, and they must take activity.  And if they initiate this unhealthy game, they won't succeed.  So that is better that the Rwandan youth live in peace and concentrate on the objective of the defence of democracy in the current day -- in the coming days.  Did Mr. Ngirumpatse say that? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Now, in the next paragraph, does Mr. Ngirumpatse make reference to the events in Burundi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber what happened in Burundi prior to the November -- 7th November, 1993, rally? 
A.	In Rwanda or in Burundi?  
Q.	In Burundi, were there some events in Burundi in October 1993 that had an impact on what was going on in Rwanda? 
A.	The President Ndadaye, of Burundi, who was democratically elected was assassinated. 
Q.	And did that event increase the tension in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, the assassination of President Ndadaye increased tensions from Rwanda immediately following his death.  We must remember that after he died, there was on organised demonstration in Kigali.  MRND, MDR and I believe PL parties, including others, demonstrated and matched from the Kigali roundabout to the Nyamirambo stadium. 
Q.	And what was the ethnicity of the president of Burundi who was assassinated? 
A.	President Ndadaye was a Hutu. 
Q.	And had he actually lived in Rwanda before becoming president of Burundi? 
A.	Yes, Ndadaye studied in Rwanda.  He was a professor in Rwanda.  He went back to Burundi, but he was in Rwanda as a refugee. 
Q.	What was the ethnicity of the people who assassinated him? 
A.	According to information broadcast over Radio Burundi and other radio stations, the perpetrators were Tutsis.  Those who assassinated President Ndadaye were Tutsis. 
Q.	And after his assassination, was there unrest in Burundi which led to the arrival of refugees from Burundi into Rwanda? 
A.	I am sorry there was -- there were problems with the sound.  Could you kindly repeat that, Counsel? 
Q.	Yes.  After the assassination of President Ndadaye in Burundi, was there unrest that resulted in refugees from Burundi coming into Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  There were Burundian refugees in Rwanda at that time. 
Q.	And can you give us a very rough estimate of the number of refugees from Burundi that were in Rwanda as of -- let's say the 6th of April l994? 
A.	There were thousands.  6th April l994, there were Burundians who still had not gone back to Burundi after the election of Ndadaye after 1968.  In fact, there were more refugees who came after Ndadaye was killed.  The last of those refugees lived in camps.  There were perhaps thousands of Burundian refugees. 
Q.	Now, going back to what Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying on the 7th of November, do you say where he said that a few days ago the RPF published a communiqué blaming the Rwandan government that it should not have granted shelter to the members of the government of Burundi, here in Kigali.  And therefore, Mr. Ngirumpatse was saying that "I would like to tell you if we hold the elections everything won't happen necessarily in peace.  That when we initiated the period of transition, many believed that it would take place in peace but, it's not what happened.  So, if we hold elections we should defend this democracy so that what went by Burundi doesn't occur in this country."  Is that something that 
	Mr. Ngirumpatse said during his speech? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, going towards the end of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech, does Mr. Ngirumpatse also discuss rallies by the MDR party?  For example, in Butare, where he is speaking about the position of the MDR with respect to the RPF?  And I am probably -- you can look at page 4, maybe the second to last paragraph? 
A.	Yes, I have located that passage. 
Q.	And then does he speak further on in the next paragraph about Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye and the fact that he is currently in Brussels where he is claiming to take care of the interests of the Hutu? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then on the next paragraph, does Mr. Ngirumpatse say that the MDR is trying to put back the PAMEHUTU label and to speak about the interest of the Hutu? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And is it correct that in this period after the death of the president of Burundi, the MDR was trying to gain favour with the Hutu members of the electorate by claiming that they themselves are the party of the Hutu, going back even until 1959? 
A.	In 199 -- what?  Was that 1993 or '94, please?  
Q.	Okay.  I think there was a mistake in the translation.  Well, let me ask you this.  The word PAMEHUTU, can you explain what that refers to?  I am just asking you now? 
A.	Pardon me. 
Q.	I am just asking you now in general not in reference to the speech, but can you explain to the 
	Trial Chamber what PAMEHUTU means, what it stands for? 
A.	Republican Party.  I don't remember what the -- yes, it was the Republican Party for the emancipation of the Hutu. 
Q.	And in 1959 when President Kayibanda created the first republic in Rwanda, was his party called the MDR, PAMEHUTU party? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And now in this speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse, was he saying that the MDR was trying to bring back the PAMEHUTU label to act as if they are champion of the Hutu? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness G.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am about to go into -- I am about to leave the speeches, thankfully.  All of the speeches, I think from 1993 -- '92 and '93, are now complete.  And I am going to go on to another area.  I can start now but if you want us to take the break a little early, we can do that also. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Well, I am concerned about your final finishing time.  We have ten minutes, I don't know if you can use them constructively? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I can always use them constructively.  No problem. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness G, we are now going to turn to another subject, so the registry can remove the transcript that is before you and I want to ask you if you know an individual whose last name Mr. Turatsinze?  
A.	I know or rather knew Emmanuel Mr. Turatsinze. 
Q.	Now, what was his position at MRND, as far as you knew? 
A.	He was a driver of a Suzuki Jeep which belonged to the MRND.  He was a middle man between the MRND chairmanship and the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And how long -- well, can you tell us when you first met this gentleman? 
A.	Right after the Interahamwe were created in 1991. 
Q.	And during the period 1991 through November 1993, can you tell us approximately how many times you saw this man? 
A.	Several times.  There were many meetings held on each Wednesday, Mr. Turatsinze was practically always there.  I believe that after the meeting, he had to report to the executive committee of the MRND, or just someone in the MRND.  At any rate, he was often at the weekly, Wednesday meetings.  Later on, after June 1992, I saw him very rarely, only after working hours and never during the meetings. 
Q.	Would you say that Mr. Turatsinze was an honest or dishonest person by character? 
A.	I don't know how to describe him.  As far as I am concerned and from what I saw, he was someone who always wanted to please, every time you would talk to him.  Honest or dishonest, I didn't know.  I didn't know him enough to be able to make that judgment. 
Q.	Was he the kind of person that you would trust with a large sum of your own money? 
A.	That depends on your friendship with someone.  If he had friends who considered him honest, to them he was honest.  Those who worked with him thought he was an honest man. 
Q.	Is it true that he stole a large number of weapons from the MRND in November 1993 and sold them to a Burundian group called FRODEBU?  F-R-O-D E-B-U? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	So he wasn't all that honest, correct? 
A.	Right.  But, right. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when it was that you first learnt of the theft of these weapons by 
	Mr. Turatsinze? 
A.	When No. 1 had half of those weapons in his possession, we met.  The committee met.  It was said that Mr. Turatsinze allegedly took 400 weapons and sold them.  In the place where we were located, where we met on a regular basis at 5 p.m, there were Burundians from FRODEBU who were on a mission in Kigali.  After Ndadaye was killed those Burundians remained in Kigali.  Amongst those Burundians -- they were all members of FRODEBU, amongst them there were officials and ambassadors.  They were in constant contact with them.  With No. 1 or with Mr. Turatsinze himself.  And so when those weapons were sold, people started to say that they shared the profit with No. 1.  So Mr. Turatsinze disappeared.  And people said that he was the one who had taken the money. 
Q.	And was it around November of 1993 when he had disappeared? 
A.	I can't tell you the exact date when he disappeared. 
Q.	And after he disappeared, was he -- did you see him again ever? 
A.	No. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, Mr. President, I still have more on this topic but I see it's just about 6 o' clock.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson.  Yes, it is now 6 o'clock.  Can we take the adjournment for the day?

Mr. Witness, I remind you, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony during this or any other adjournment.  You are now excused and you can leave the premises.  

There are just one or two matters that we may have to discuss here before our final adjournment.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President please.
(Witness is excused)

1800H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, with regard to Witness Mbonyunkiza, I have just received information that the report concerning this witness should be made available tomorrow.  Now, we had, in fact, made a -- decided on the issue of scheduling the resumption of his cross-examination.  Now, during the discussion we had on this matter last week, Defence counsel for Mr. Nzirorera, who has to complete his cross-examination of this witness, did not oppose the scheduling of the conclusion of his testimony during the course of this week.  

Conversely, it was counsel for the Defence of Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Karemera who expressed some reservations about continuing this cross-examination.  They noted that their lead counsels, who are in charge of the cross-examination of this witness, are in The Hague.  

Now, the Chamber has cautiously reviewed these arguments and dually taken into account the rights of each Accused.  Pursuant to Articles 19 and 20 of the statute, the Chamber has the duty to guarantee a fair trial, including the right of the Accused to be tried without undue delay.  Until now, only two witnesses have been heard, and only partially.  It is, therefore, worth making all necessary efforts to ensure that a third witness could be heard during this first trial session.  

We have considered that the resumption of the cross-examination of Witness Mbonyunkiza would, therefore, be scheduled on Wednesday, 19th October, from 8:45 to 10 a.m., before the continued testimony of Witness G.  Now, the Chamber is of the view that such scheduling will not affect the rights of the Accused Ngirumpatse and Karemera.  Their right to cross-examine the witness has been exercised by their own respective lead counsel who have already completed their cross-examination.  

In addition, the co-counsel of these Accused will be present during the cross-examination by Mr. Robinson.  They are professional and high-level lawyers.  There is no doubt that they will be in a position to defend the interests of their client, where appropriate, as required by the directive on the assignment of Defence counsel, Article 20(E) 1.  

For these reasons, the Chamber orders that Witness Mbonyunkiza will be called to resume his testimony on Wednesday, 19th October 2005, from 8:45 to 10 a.m., except otherwise decided.  He should also be heard on Thursday and Friday -- that's the 20th and 21st October, at the same time before the hearing of Witness G. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Can I -- I just comment on that?  I think I'm not going to be finished with Witness G by the end of Tuesday, and I have always said from the very beginning, when speaking with your Trial Chamber coordinator, that I would be prepared to question Witness Mbonyunkiza after I have finished my cross-examination of Witness G.  And, really, I cannot be expected to conduct two cross-examinations simultaneously.  So I would ask that your order be modified to the extent that if we're not completed with the testimony of Witness G, that he would start his -- the Witness Mbonyunkiza would start his cross-examination the next day after I complete my cross-examination of Witness G.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Well, I must say that we had, in fact, reflected on this matter before you indicated that you would not complete your cross-examination tomorrow.  We thought about it, and we are still optimistic that you will complete tomorrow, and we would like -- what we will do, we will review this tomorrow -- later tomorrow, if it becomes necessary to do so.  But we prefer to leave the order as it is for now.  

Yes, we can take the adjournment now, until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1809H)
