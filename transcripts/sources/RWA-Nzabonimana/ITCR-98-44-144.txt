MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today,                         Wednesday the 13th of July 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case Number 98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  

Mr. Hooper, before you commence your -- or continue your cross-examination, I would just like to make a brief response to a submission raised by Mr. O'Shea concerning the Rwandan dossier.  And I have undertaken some time, I think the end of last week, to make some inquiries and provide some further information as to the position of the Chamber on this matter.

We wanted to draw your attention to the correspondence from the office of the special representative for the Rwandan government, dated the 9th of March 2005, and to suggest to you that the method of obtaining assistance of the -- that is advisable to use the court officers which have been offered by this office who is actually based at the Tribunal, we understand.  And that would be a preliminary step to any motion that you plan to make, because we anticipate that the -- if the offers that have been made in this correspondence are honoured, that it will solve the problem that you addressed.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  My understanding is that the last communication of the 30th of June would indicate that the bureaucracy has effectively been going through its channels, and it is just a question of feeding the documents between the institutions.  If that be the case, I think we can work on the general assumption that we will receive quick cooperation now.  I hope that is the case, and we will see where we go from here.  But thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  We think it is better to pursue the recommended procedure. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, I know, Your Honour.  Of course, we are only physically here for a few days, as well, so I realise that it is something that we have to address immediately.  Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you Madam Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  You are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony begun, you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Now, yesterday we were dealing with the judgement of the court of first instance of Butare of ************* 1998 in the case of Rurangirwa and others.  And you had been shown, as, indeed, everyone else, I think, in the Court had seen, a photocopy extracted from the judgement of -- for our purposes, and my purposes, relevant parts of the judgement.  And that was accompanied with a French and an English translation.  

And from your reply yesterday in respect of that, I'm right in saying that you do not dispute that you are the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) variously named, ************************; that is right, isn't it?  

In fact, I should have that last part struck, I'm afraid.  It is a bit too early for me this morning; I have stumbled into that straight away.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, the order is made. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The names under various spellings that appear there, I think, you accept that is throughout a reference to yourself; am I correct in saying that? 
A.	Before answering the question, I should like to be showed a copy of the judgement referred to in Kinyarwanda -- in Rwandese (sic). 
Q.	I think you were provided with that yesterday, but I think the documents are coming to you now again.  And in fairness to you, I hold the full judgement, which you are more than welcomed to see, if that assists you.  And you also are being handed an extracted list of comparative names that was drafted by me.
A.	Regarding the list of names, most of the time you can't be sure.  For example, I see ************* (phonetic) that has never been my name.  When you give someone your name they normally should write it down correctly.  Number 4, I could see ****************** (phonetic), you know --  
Q.	Just one thing, you will see there are numbers next to the names on that list, just refer to the numbers, just say look at number 4, look at number 5.  And then we don't run into difficulties announcing your name in public, unless you are happy with that.  I think you said yesterday that you are quite happy that your name is in public, if that is the case then that is up to you.  It is your privilege whether you are protected or not.  If you don't want to be protected and you want it all in the open, that's up to you, but consider your position. 
A.	Okay, you see number 2 name there, that is not me.  Number 4, that is not me either.  Number 5, that is not me.  Number 6 is not my name.  And I cannot, therefore, recognise this copy.  But it was never -- I never bore those names.  And I know that photocopies can be manipulated and I want to be sure you received the original of this document.  I think that courts only use originals and not copies. 
Q.	All right.  Well, let's take that in stages, shall we.  Let me ask you this first, were you a party to and gave evidence in a case called Rurangirwa? 
A.	I testified in the Rurangirwa trial. 
Q.	Did you give evidence against that man that he had murdered one of your sisters? 
A.	Yes, I was a prosecution witness against that man, accusing him of killing my eldest sister. 
Q.	And how did you say he had killed your sister?  What had he done to kill her? 
A.	He killed her. 
Q.	Well, did he stab her?  Did he -- how did he end her life?  What did he do to do that? 
A.	He attacked her with a machete. 
Q.	He attacked her with a machete.  And is that something you gave evidence about?  Is that what you told the Court, that he attacked her with a machete? 
A.	I'm sorry; I don't understand your question.  Could you please repeat it?  
Q.	I think you do understand it.  Do you really need me to repeat it?  Let me repeat it.  You say he killed her by attacking her with a machete.  Is that what you told the Court in Butare in your evidence? 
A.	I should like to ask something.  I have the impression that my testimony will never end because we come back to matters we have already discussed.  I should like to be put questions on the points not yet considered, but not that we should go back to a trial that is over -- ended.  I should like to be put questions in line with my testimony which began on the 11th. 
Q.	Did you tell the Court in Butare that he had killed your sister by attacking her with a machete? 
A.	I have just answered your question a minute ago.  If it is necessary, you can come to Rwanda if you want to reopen that trial, start it anew.  I think we have discussed it thoroughly since I began to testify.
Q.	Now, you remember what the Judge President said to you yesterday about answering questions.  You are not answering me; you are providing an answer, a response to a question from me but you are providing it to the Judges.  Now, I want to ask you again, you have told us that this man -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You told us that this man -- 
A.	I will not answer that question. 
Q.	Well, is there a reason for that? 
A.	Yes, there is a reason. 
Q.	Can you tell us what that reason is, please? 
A.	The reason is the following:  Those trials that took place in Rwanda and have been terminated, I don't think that I should be put any questions on those trials here.  If necessary, we can go back to Rwanda.  The Accused here is -- the accused in that trial is not accused here before this Tribunal.  You showed me the various copies of the judgement.  If we want to go back to those judgements, we should go back to Rwanda. 
Q.	Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, in my judgement the question is legally permissible.  You were shown a document and you have questioned the authenticity of it.  The document is a legitimate document for use in this trial.  The questions that are being put to you are directly related to that position.  Now, we as the Judges here, we'll have to make some decisions on these matters, and the answers that you give are directly relevant to the decisions that we will have to make.  So I think it is important that you understand the questions being put to you and that you answer them to the best of your ability.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, very much. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you see the reason, as I think you know, that I am asking these questions is that they show your answers would demonstrate that you are not truthful, and that you are coming to this Court and making a false allegation against a man, which is a terrible thing to do.  So please answer the question.  
A.	I am not accusing anyone falsely.  It is you who are mistaken.  I speak of events in the course of the genocide of which I was a witness -- which I witnessed. 
Q.	Right.  Now, my question, if I can return to it is this:  You have told us that the man, Rurangirwa, killed your sister by attacking her with a machete.  My question was, did you tell that to the court in Butare in his case? 
A.	Yes, I said it. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to pass up a document to you.  It is in two forms, the first form that you will see is a copy of the judgement from the court in Butare, which I assert is plainly a carbon copy.  It has the republic stamp on it and the stamp of the court in Butare on it on each page.  And I'm going to, just for your own mental comfort, hand up to you the same document but in a different form, which has got on the top right hand corner a K number, because this came from the Prosecution.  It didn't come to me from the Prosecution, it was entered in another case here concerning a man called Colonel Muvunyi.  So let me hand those two documents up to you.  

And may I just say that I have put some notes on the top right-hand corner of the Prosecution document but I scratched those through with a pen.  That is my mark on the document.  I want you to look at these two documents in order to, to some extent, satisfy yourself that I haven't spent my time forging documents against you.  They are upside down.  
MR. HOOPER:
While that is being looked at, I will just mark up now that I will be asking the Prosecution to indicate whether they were aware of the existence of that document?  
MS. FALL: 
No, not at all, that is why I want to put some questions regarding this document.  Is it a photocopy of this document here that I am holding here?  Is it not a photocopy?  This is the original in my right hand.  In my left hand that is the copy.  It is a question that I am putting to counsel.  I have not fully understood. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Let me make it plain and to the witness, as well.  The judgement that appears in blue ink on thin paper, copying paper has been obtained by my investigator, who is a member of the Rwandese bar, from the dossier in Rwanda.  The other document is not my document; it is a Prosecution document, which is why it has a K number on it.  That was served in the Muvunyi case.  I don't know its exact routing here, but if you look at it, it is quite plainly exactly the same document, page by page, but there may have been some redaction done on the document looking at the first page.  I haven't been through it in detail, but it has a K number; they all have a K number.  So, that is a Prosecution document.  And as I say, it was served in the case of Muvunyi and came to me recently through the good offices of parties. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Counsel, for that clarification. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, what you are looking at now is a document, it has come from the Prosecution, it has not been forged by the Defence.  And now if you look at the other copy you will see that that is -- and bears, as they both do, in fact, but the blue copy more clearly, the authentication stamp of the court in Butare in which you gave evidence.  And that is the judgement of the court.  Now, if you can put those to one side, I can ask you some questions and, perhaps, can you give me some answers.

My first question is, did you tell the court that your sister had been killed by Rurangirwa with a machete?
A.	I explained this to you, Counsel. 
Q.	Can I have your answer, please? 
A.	I have already answered you, Counsel. 
Q.	All right, my last time of asking.  Did you tell the court in Butare that Rurangirwa had murdered your sister by attacking her with a machete; yes or no, please? 
A.	I have answered your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, do you recall what was the answer to the question?  
THE WITNESS:
I remember the answer that I gave, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you give it again, please?  
THE WITNESS:
I told the Defence counsel that Rurangirwa had attacked my sister with a machete. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But that is not the question I asked.  We know that you have said that.  I have asked you this; did you tell the court that? 
A.	I do not know what you are looking for, Counsel. 
Q.	I think this is the seventh time I have asked you.  Did you tell the court in Butare that detail, that he had killed your sister with a machete; yes or no, please? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what was the name of the sister that he killed? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, that is protected information.  We have to strike that from the record and invite the witness to write the name, please. 
THE WITNESS:
By asking me such questions, I easily forget.  All would depend on the questions that are put to me by the Defence counsel. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But, Madam Witness, you are telling us yesterday that you didn't want to be in closed session, you are quite happy to talk about this and you will give your name and family names in open session; is that right? 
A.	(No interpretation)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper --  

MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, even if the witness feels she doesn't need to be protected, we have the duty to consider her as a protected witness and to abide by the rules governing protection.  So the names that can lead to her being identified should not be mentioned even if this is done deliberately by her. 
MR. HOOPER: 
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.

Madam Witness, you are to write the name of your sister on the paper provided by the registrar.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I assist by passing up a piece of paper with a name written on it?  And if that is correct, the witness can adopt the document, or she can write her own. 
MS. FALL: 
I, thank you, Mr. President.  But I think that the witness can write down the name herself.  She has done so for some other names and I don't know why she is being given a name that is already written down.  I think, therefore, that she herself can write down the name on a document. 
MR. HOOPER: 
As you wish. 
MS. FALL: 
I am insisting on this because the spelling may not be the same, just as she has said.  So, if she has to be made to write down the name of her sister, she might as well do that herself on a piece of paper. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, this is cross-examination, and counsel is entitled to do this in cross-examination. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Right, but I will comply with Ms. Fall's request. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness, you will be given a blank piece of paper.   Can you write down -- can you write down the sister's name?

Don't give her the other piece, please.  Thank you, very much.  

Just write down your sister's name, please.  And could you do it in capital letters because we have had a bit of difficulty reading your writing.  Do you having a difficulty spelling, Madam Witness? 
A.	Please, allow me to take the time that I need to write down this name.  I let you take your time in doing what you do; so, this is my turn.  
Q.	Yes, I don't think that is how it was spelt yesterday.  
A.	I have written down the name that I mentioned yesterday. 
Q.	Now, do you have any trouble reading or are you okay reading?  Can you read a document in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	The documents that I have before me are not very legible. 
Q.	Well, let's give you the originals, please.  
MR. HOOPER: 
The one in blue, Mr. Registrar.  Mr. Registrar, can you give her the court judgement in blue. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, on the first page of that judgement on the top you can probably see because it is in Kinyarwanda, you will be able to read it, the formal introduction to what it is.  You will see that it is the judgement of the *************** 1998.  And after that, it names Ntawangahiza, Rurangirwa Biminyimana with having committed crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity in the secteur of Sahera, Ngoma, commune Butare -- sorry, Ngoma commune, Butare préfecture.  And it then gives various legal references in what, obviously, is a legal document.  

Now, if you can turn, I think, over to the next page, you will see there that there starts a list of partie civil, civilian parties, which is a commune practice in these systems, where people who are claiming civil compensation are attached to the criminal process, page 2.  In fact, if you turn to page 3 of that list, and go to number ****** in the Kinyarwanda, and we can all follow this in the Kinyarwanda, you will see that a name appears at number ***, which I think on the copy you have ends in an "A."  And whether that is an exactly correct spelling of your name or not, that is you, isn't it? 
A.	I am not at that point yet, Counsel.  Can you please wait a minute?  
Q.	Well, it is quite simple.  Look at number ****, it is not spelt as you are commonly spelt, but that is you, isn't it?  And you were part of this case.  There is no other name here in this list that looks anything like yours; that is you.  And we know you were a civil party because at the end of the judgement, they refuse you damages for particular reasons.  And in doing that, they name and accurately spell people we know to be your brothers and sisters.  And those people are there named as your brothers and sisters.   

Can I invite you just to get this over with quickly and just say, yes, that is the truth and I won't try to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.  
A.	Yes, sir, that is my name.  I am the one. 
Q.	Now, incidentally, while you are on that page, look at number ********************, the person you said you didn't know, also claiming in this case; in her case, claiming for her brother who she, in other circumstances, has claimed was killed at the hospital.  Are you sure you don't know *************?
A.	I do not know her.  All of the civilian parties do not know each other.  Each person has his or her complaint and bring their own defence.  We don't know -- all of us don't know each other.  You cannot know all inhabitants of a secteur, unless it is somebody's duty to know all of the names of all of the inhabitants of a secteur. 
MR. HOOPER:
	Now, again, can I invite, with the Court's leave, a Kinyarwanda speaking interpreter, as we had yesterday, to come to the witness box to read an extract from this judgement in Kinyarwanda to be contemporaneously translated, so that we can follow it in our various versions in English and French and so that the matter can be directly read into the record.  

Can I invite one of the gentlemen in the booth to come and assist the Court, the Chamber in that respect.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The permission is granted.  
MR. HOOPER: 
From experience, Mr. Interpreter, yes, you are ahead of us.  And it would be best if you read from the blue official, certified copy of the judgement.  And I'm going to ask -- invite you, sir, to go to page 15 of the judgement and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, as you are about to commence reading, it would be useful, for the record, if you identify yourself for the purpose of the record. 
MR. FURUFURU:
Yes, Mr. President.  My name is Leopold Furufuru.  I am a translator/interpreter for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
	Mr. Interpreter, if you could go down to -- starting from the top in terms of chunks of prose, it is one, two, three, four, five down and it starts (Kinyarwanda spoken).  If you could read from that point until -- and, obviously, we can see the names, so step over the names that are mentioned.  Just pause so that we can see and take in what is being said.  So just leave gaps to protect the witnesses' identity, or identities, whichever.  Thank you. 
MR. FURUFURU:
"Whereas -- he gives the name of the person that she's accusing from amongst the three accused and that she answered by saying that the Accused sent Ruwangira R-U-W-A-N-G-I-R-A whereas" -- and we will leave aside the name.  "And she accuses Ruwangira by saying that he behaved very badly, since he first learned to use a gun and that later he assassinated numerous persons.  Whereas" -- that is for the name, "was asked questions concerning the gun with which she attributes to the Accused, and says that he had it.  And whereas she was asked what type of gun it was, and that she answered that it was a long gun.  Since she says she has seen the gun.  Very well, whereas" -- XX, that is for the name -- accuses Rurangirwa of being the person who killed her junior sister whose name was" -- that is for the name --  "And that she further asserts she was unable to know the names of the other victims.  Whereas" -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  That is sufficient.  
MR. FURUFURU:
-- "whereas Rurangirwa -" 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I indicate the last name, the name for the sister is the same name for the sister that appears in our list of comparative names at number 1 and again at number 7.  It is the first name that is spelled there.  And that is consistent with the spelling in the main of the name in the course of statements. 
MS. FALL: 
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, before the interpreter leaves, I would like to ask him in respect of the translation of the last sentence, when she says that the witness states that he had killed her junior sister.  I would like to know if a mention is made of the manner in which her junior sister was killed, in the translation. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I think we have heard the translation. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
If that is the point you were making, fair enough. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, you don't, at this point, mention how your younger sister was killed and before -- just on that.  But this is the sister you say was killed with a machete by Rurangirwa; is that correct? 
A.	No.  I wasn't referring to my junior sister, but to my eldest sister.  This is one other reason for me not to accept this copy of the judgement, given that everything was written down haphazardly, in disorder.  And I would like to repeat that I do not acknowledge -- recognise this document. 
MR. FURUFURU:
Can I take my leave, Mr. President?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. Interpreter, I'm going to need you again.  So, can I ask you to go to page 27 of the court record and to read the third passage that appears there, which starts (Kinyarwanda spoken), et cetera.  It is the third one.  So starting from the top, there is one paragraph that ends with the figure of 10,600,000; and then the next paragraph ends with the figure 18 million.  And then you come to the third paragraph, and that is the one I would like to be read out.  Thank you, very much. 
MR. FURUFURU:
"Whereas I note that it will not be necessary to pay damages" -- and the interpreter leaves out the name because it is name of the witness, "for her brothers and sisters" -- and we leave out the names of the brothers and sisters, "on the grounds that she has not provided death certificates duly established by the commune in respect of her brothers and sisters.  She has not provided or presented the Tribunal with the death certificates on which the tribunal could base itself for paying her damages." 
(Pages 1 to 11 by Donna M. Lewis)




























1000H 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Mr. Interpreter.  I am going to need you back shortly, but I think you are more comfortable in your booth, I suspect.  So, can I call you back in a few minutes?  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.  
MR. HOOPER:
And for the record, the list of names that appears on page 27 in the paragraph that was just read is spelt and it is in the order that appears at number 7 on the Defence document of comparative names.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, the first name that appears is the name of your sister that you said was killed at the hospital by the Accused in this case, Rwamakuba.  And you say, well, that is not in fact correct because the spelling is wrong and it was another sister -- and I will come back to that in a moment. 

The next name that appears there that starts -- that has the initials N-I, if I can put it like that, the second name, who was that, may I ask?  
A.	I am not seeing the name you are referring to, Counsel.  
Q.	It is the second name that immediately appears on our document after this.  I have circled it here, so that you are clear, and look at that and -- right?  Who was that?  
A.	That's my brother. 
Q.	Now, that's not the brother you mentioned as being killed by André Rwamakuba or at his instigation at the hospital.  But the next name, that is the brother, isn't it, who you say was eventually killed?  
A.	Yes, the name that comes after the name that begins with N-Z-E, that is the one who was killed by your client. 
Q.	What's he doing in this list of names as someone in Sahera -- who had been killed in Sahera for whom compensation is being sought?  
A.	He wasn't killed at Sahera.  
Q.	Can you just give us your explanation for the appearance of his name on this document?  
A.	As concerns this person whose name begins N-Z-E and whose first name begins with V, this is a person who was in the operating theatre at the university hospital, but who was taken aboard then, so he wasn't killed in Sahera.  And, furthermore, since I have been saying since yesterday this document -- these documents were poorly drafted and the information has been put together rather confusedly, and that is why I do not acknowledge or recognise the authenticity of this document.  
Q.	Because, obviously, his name shouldn't appear there at all, should it, in respect of the three men who are on trial there?  That is another mistake, is it, by the court?  
A.	Yes, and that is the reason wherefore I have told you that the drafting of judgments is not done properly.  You know, information is added to it or taken out of it as people want and that is the reason wherefore I continue to say that I do not recognise the authenticity of this document.  My brother wasn't killed at Sahera.  You know very well, which is my colline of origin, and apparently, you seem to know it better than myself.  You can go to the colline and find out for yourself and you will realise that he wasn't killed there.  And since you have gone to the scene, I will request that you go back there and ask people whether my brother was killed on the hill, that is, the colline.  People would provide you with information and will confirm what I am trying to tell you.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
A.	If you are not unlucky to find people who will be telling you lies.  
Q.	Yes, you can certainly answer a question when you want to, and that is your explanation.  The next name -- the last name, I asked you yesterday if that was your aunt and you said no.  Who is it?  
A.	I have explained to you that it was my sister, the one that came after me. 
Q.	So that's your younger sister? 
A.	Yes, my younger sister. 
Q.	Yesterday when you were asked why the sister or why the name that appears in this judgment of your sister, the one who was killed at the hospital, why it appears here, you say, "Well, it is a mistake."  It appears twice in that spelling, but it is a mistake.  That, in fact, is wrong that the sister who was killed at Sahera by this man, you tell us with a machete was a twin sister that had the same name, the same Christian name.  That's your explanation, isn't it?
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And the first name -- if we look at our list of names or if we look at how Rwandese names are commonly presented, the first name is in a way of family name, but it is very rare that the same people within the family, the immediate family, have the same name, they will bear the different name as we know names; that is right, isn't it?  
A.	I have some explanation to give you on this point.  In Rwanda, when you have twins, boys or girls, generally, they are given the same name.  I know other twins, boys or girls who have the same name.  So, don't be surprised if the twins have the same name because they were born on the same day and all parents are free to give their children the name they want to give. 
Q.	Now, the first name -- the name of the sister whose name commonly features in this case is the one who was killed, you say, by the Accused in this case, indirectly.  I understand that translates in Kinyarwanda to "the God I pray to" or "the God I ask."  That is its meaning; is that correct?  
A.	I don't know, parents can give -- 
Q.	And the second name which you wrote down on a piece of paper -- 
A.	-- and another parent can give the name (inaudible) "the God I pray to."
Q.	But, "the God I pray to".  And the second name that you have provided on a piece of paper today means exactly the same thing, isn't it?  It means "the God I pray to."  So, the surname in loose language --  
A.	But in the previous name there is the term "Saba" the good Lord to whom I am imploring, begging, asking."  
Q.	Well, I suggest they essentially mean almost exactly the same thing in Rwandese, but I am not going to get into that.  But is this notion of two twin sisters both having the Christian name and it is a Christian name here, and you are saying this is something that happens in Rwanda; is that right? 
A.	It is frequent in Rwanda.  If you come to Rwanda, I will give you other examples.  If parents have children they can give the names they want to.  If you give the same name to twins, boys or girls it is to avoid jealousy between them.  And I don't think we need to dwell on that.  If the father of the children could come back to life, he would give you the explanation.  You must understand that I cannot give you sufficient explanation because I am not the person who gave those names to those children.  When I was born, I found them bearing the names they bore.  I cannot answer in the father's stead.  
Q.	When you told us yesterday, late in the day, well, a tiring day for you, I understand.  Your explanation was that this was a twin with the same Christian name, I was taken aback.  I wondered perhaps there was a cultural difference.  Can you just explain this to me.  Why is it that any Rwandese I have spoken to about this finds something to laugh at?  Is that a reaction that you would expect from Rwandese who know your culture or is the truth of it that this was a final desperate attempt by you to explain something that couldn't be explained except only one pointed way?  
A.	I don't know if you have already spoken to any Rwandan to discuss this with them.  If you want to be really sure, I invite you to Rwanda.  I know you go there to seek information, and if you want to meet me, I am prepared to meet you, and I will show you people who have the same name.  If you investigate, anyone will tell you.  If you put questions to that person who was chasing us during the genocide and wanted to end our lives, who wanted us dead -- don't just satisfy yourself with the information that person gives you.  You have to put questions to Hutu and to Tutsi and compare the information they give you and then you will know the truth.  You know, there is a group of people who do not bear similar hearts in Rwanda, and if you get your information from that group you might err.  So you have to get your information from both different groups and then you can compare the results and then you will know the truth.  
Q.	Well, I know.  We have heard a little about your story and I quite accept that you suffered greatly during the genocide with the loss of your family, and I suggest it doesn't entitle you to come up here and cook up a false story.  I can understand that in a way, that is the difference you see between us.
  
Now, I am going to ask you to look at a final document at this stage.  
MR. HOOPER:
And there are copies for everyone?  The booth had got these, I think, yesterday.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And the document is headed Audience Publique du dix septième Novembre '97, if I can use the Belgian French.  In other words, the public hearing -- record of the public hearing of the 17th of November 1997.  And this is just eight weeks after you made your statement, your first statement to the United Nations.  And I am going to hand you a photocopy of the Kinyarwanda, you'll see as best you can -- and if we can look at the -- 

So, in the Kinyarwanda handwritten notes of evidence of the 17th of November '97, the relevant portion that I am going to refer you to, and you will see in a moment, appears at the very bottom, the bottom three handwritten lines of the first page and it then goes over to the second page and concludes six lines from the bottom where there is a Republique Rwandese Premier Instance, Butare Tribunal, the Premier Instance Butare stamp on the photocopy.  So, I want you to look at this document and you will be helped with the relevant portion of it.  And I would like you to look at the second page and if it can be pointed out to you.  Next to the stamp there is a signature, is that you?  Is that your signature?  
A.	I don't sign like that.  
Q.	So, that is the third document now that you don't recognise; is that right?  We had the PV from the Gatera case; we had the judgment that we have just been referring to from the court from Butare, both those documents in a form came to the Prosecution and now this document, you look at the signature and you don't recognise it; that is right, isn't it?  
A.	I do not recognise this document.  
Q.	If we go through the statements you have given to the Prosecution, we can see that your signature -- and I am not going to do the exercise now, because we are not qualified to do it.  But your signature obviously varies a lot, but they are, I suggest, in those documents signatures similar -- very similar to this one.  

Now, on your oath, Madam, before this International Tribunal, a world court, we are all giving evidence of the most serious crimes.  Is that or is that not your signature?  
A.	It is not my signature.  You can give me a sheet of paper that I will sign and you will know my signature.  I tell you these documents can be manipulated as one wishes.  They can be copied as one wishes.  This is what I have constantly said.  
Q.	Can I invite the gentleman from the booth, please, to come to the witness and perform a final translation exercise, reading the document into the record?  It is just a small passage of eight lines, I don't need the whole document translated.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we have a copy of the document with the signature?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document is that?  
MR. HOOPER:
It's a document like that. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Fry, it might be more convenient to let the interpreter read from somewhere where you are sitting than in the witness box, it's just a suggestion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, we have seen it.  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. Interpreter, I am sorry I have forgotten your name. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mr. Furufuru, Leopold.  	
MR. HOOPER:
I suggest that you sit in one of registrar's seats.  Could you do that please.  And, in fact --  do you have the statement, sir, in front of you? 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, sir.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  And if you go to the first page, the first page to the record has at the top, two numbers, 
61 and 7.  It has got the date, the 17th of November '97, and to the left, it has got Audience and a record number.  Then there is a stamp on that, two thirds down the page -- and then there is a reference to a maître -- friends.  And then the bottom three lines again, a meeting -- the names as best you can as you go along, though you can leave the name Rurangirwa, if it appears.  Could you read slowly for translation from the bottom three lines and over the page until I intervene.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
At the first page, Counsel?  
MR. HOOPER:
First page, just 7 on the top, the bottom three lines you will see the name similar to the witness's name and if you can read from there, a meeting -- omitting the witness's name, just giving you blank, blank or your reference as you did before.  Thank you very much.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter read the name of the father of the witness, and the Kinyarwanda booth says perhaps that is improper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we will step over that.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
You can put as much sense to it -- into it as possible, given that those names that are missing, XY or - 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
This is identification part.  
MR. HOOPER:
So, what you are saying is that there is a formal identification of the person there, who has use of family names and associations; is that right?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
That is correct, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Perhaps we will step over that because I don't have a translation of that, but if you can go over the page so that we are now on page -- the page that has 62 and below that 8 on it.  And I think there is a series of questions and answers there, and if you can translate those first, please.  Thank you.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
"Whom are you accusing amongst these three men?  That is the question.  Answer:  "I accuse Rurangirwa."  Question:  "Tell us what you know about him during the war?"  
Answer:  "That you, Rurangirwa, that you say there behaved very badly.  He went to Kabuga, Sahera and learnt to use a gun.  When he finished, he killed an innumerable number of people."  
Question:  "Do you accuse him of having had a gun -- what type of gun are you talking of?"  
Answer:  "I don't know the type of gun it was, but it was a long gun inasmuch as I saw him very well.  He hence went to kill my little sister with that gun, my little sister named -- I don't know the names of his other victims.  I only saw the corpses.  At that time I was hiding, he was pushing people ahead of him leading to the roadblock and other people who were hiding in the sorghum field were also flushed out.  Whereupon I left that place and fled, inasmuch as I was also hiding in the sorghum field, I did not see what happened afterwards."  
MR. HOOPER:
And does that then purport to be signed by that witness?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
According to the document, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  And just because there was a stepping over of the name, can you just repeat the sentence where the sister's name appears, without referring to the sister's name.  I think it starts, "in fact, he killed."  Can you repeat that please, for us?  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
He went to kill with that gun my little sister named...  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if that's an appropriate moment.  I am very much more.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the mid-morning break now.  
(Court recessed from 1039H to 1105H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so, Madam Witness, returning to the document that was just read, there was a passage that was read immediately before it on page 1, you may recall the interpreter when he came to read it quite properly and appropriately pointed out that there were family details there, and, indeed, I suggest that what we find there is not only your name, but the name of your father, your mother and where you live, and then the words appear stating that you take your oath; you speak there on your oath.  

Now, in this statement, as we have heard, you refer to your sister as appears in our document, at number one and again in number 7, in that spelling, the one we are familiar with, the one that you say was killed at the hospital.  And it says there that on your oath you state that it was Rurangirwa that killed her.  In your view, you and I, Witness, and he killed her with his long gun.  What's your comment in respect of that?  
A.	As I explained yesterday on several occasions, I told you that the sister who was killed at the hospital has almost the same name as the person who was killed by Rurangirwa, and my understanding is that where my name is written -- I think the mistake was made.  I see another name here.  It has been indicated that I had three names.  I would like the name that appears in the third place be read out to me because I don't know where this name is coming from.  This is a name that is between the first and the last name.  
Q.	Now in the document -- the Prosecution document that I showed you yesterday that came from the Gatera trial, and which you looked at and immediately said that is not my signature and you wouldn't accept that document.  There is a name that appears there as being your elder sister taken at the hospital, remember, the name was ******, and that has been in open session.  There is no difficulty with that because you say that is not the name of your sister at all, right?  Are you sure you don't have a sister with that name, or, rather, I should say sadly, did you have a sister there?  
A.	In my family, as far as my father's children are concerned, I never knew a person whose name was **********. 
Q.	So, throughout this evidence the name, the one we are familiar with, of your sister killed at the hospital appears in these statements and you say that is a misspelling.  But you say it is a misspelling because there was this twin sister with the same Christian name, and there has been a confusion between these two.  But in your statement here you refer to her as your little sister and yet in your evidence in respect of the hospital, you refer to helping your elder sister.  Can you explain that, please?  
A.	This is the reason for which I am going back to these documents that you say that it doesn't concern my junior sister, but my older sister there is a confusion, the drafting in these documents.  I cannot accept things that took place in our home, in our family.  My little sister who was killed is our younger sister.  I don't have other young sisters.  
Q.	I understand that, but tell me this.  How do you get one twin who is an older sister and another twin who is a younger sister?  
A.	There were both my elder sisters, they had been born by the time I was born.  You will understand that there is a complicated confusion here that can not be easily explained.
Q.	Well, I agree with that, you can't explain it, can you?  But anywhere there is your answer.  

Now, I want to ask you about an answer you gave me in the previous trial, because I asked you about this case.  It's not a surprise that I am asking you about this case today, is it?  You have known, as you said in your evidence, you said to me you have got the dossier, haven't you?  So you have had a lot of time to think about this.  But this is the question I put to you on the 11th of December 2003, and I have been asking you about the case and you have been saying you didn't understand my questions.  You said that you never made a claim yourself relating to persons who participated in the massacres at Kabakobwa, this is at page 14 of the 11th of December 2003, and then this question was put to you:  "Question:  And you never claimed that Rurangirwa murdered your sister; is that right?  Answer:  I never said that."  That was a lie, wasn't it?  
A.	I could not say so whereas my sister hadn't been killed at Kabakobwa.  You have produced those documents.  In 2003 while I was giving evidence, I think that was in the month of December, you already had those documents with you.  You are the one who knew from where you had gotten them.  You did not ask me questions concerning those documents.  You didn't ask me many questions on documents and therefore to give me the opportunity of giving you answers thereto.  I think you were waiting for those documents to be manipulated or doctored for you to be able to put questions to me on them.  I therefore did not recognise those documents that you have produced because they bear signatures that are not mine.  When I went away from Kia in December 2003, or by the time I left, you did not ask me questions on those documents even though you had them.  Why, therefore, did you not ask me about the documents even though you had them with you?  Had you been taken by surprise during that trial?  
Q.	Let me read again the question that was put to you.  "And you never claimed that Rurangirwa murdered your sister; is that right?"  Your answer:  "I never said that."  Why did you lie?  
A.	I did not lie.  
Q.	It is plain that you did.  Why did you?  What were you hiding?  
A.	I do recall that I did not talk at length about that issue that you are raising.  When you asked me a question concerning Kabakobwa, I started answering and you told me that that didn't concern me.  I do recollect that you put aside that page.  In any case, for now you are putting questions to me.  If we were to reread the transcripts, we would realise that you did not ask me questions on that subject the way you are doing now.  Do you have documents that you are using now or you did not have them then.  
	I am under the impression that you were waiting for those documents to be doctored in order for you to put questions to me, the ones you are putting to me now.
Q.	Well, then let me just put in context the question that I did put to you, and I am going to read slowly from the transcript.  "Do you have any sisters who survived the genocide?  This is page 13 of the 11th of December in English.  You said, "I am the only one and the only survivor; the others were killed during the massacres and God protected me.  It wasn't anything else and that is why I am here able to testify about these facts."  

"Question:  All right.  Have you ever made a claim or has a claim been made on your behalf for the death of your sister whose name we know from the statement and your brother --," name given.  I think we have heard the name in the statement.  "Have you ever made claims against people concerned with murders in the secteur of your home?"  It starts with this:  "Have you ever made a claim for the deaths of your sister and brother in respect of that?"  Answer:  "The question is unclear to me."  "Questions:  It's all right.  Well, let me try and make it clearer to you.  There was a case in Butare with the names of three defendants, Natawani, Gahiza and Rurangirwa, do you know anything?  Do you remember that case being before the Court in ********** of 1998 and before ********* of 1998 concerning events in your secteur?  Do you remember that trial taking place in Butare?"  Answer:  "I still don't understand your question." 
(Pages 12 to 20 by Sithembiso Moyo)












1117H 
BY MR. HOOPER: (continuing)
Q.	"Question:  Did the names Ntawangaheza and Rurangirwa mean anything to you?  Answer:  These -- those are the names of persons who participated in the massacres in Kabakobwa, but I never made any claim myself.  The Prosecutor's office generally does that, not individuals. Question: And you never claimed that Rurangirwa murdered a sister, is that right?   Answer: I never said that.  Question: And you know of no claim for compensation for the deaths of the brother and sister that are named in our second statements, you know of no claim for compensation in respect of their deaths in that case?  No, I'm not aware." 

And in that way, you, Madam Witness, closed the door really on that line of questioning, as you well know.  Now, why was it that you denied ever saying that Rurangirwa murdered a sister, when it's as clear as day that you went to that Court -- went to that Court and alleged that on your oath? 
A.	I'm going to answer your question.  I did not answer those questions because I was appearing in the Rwamakuba trial. In my country in Rwanda, you do not go back to trials that were over, unless somebody appears before a Tribunal.  He only talks about a single trial and forgets about the others and the reason for which I accepted to answer your questions is because the President of the 
	Trial Chamber has ordered me to answer your questions.  Otherwise, in my culture, we do not go back to completed cases.  And when that judgement was given, you were not there.  You do not know how it was rendered and when I came before the Trial Chamber, I answered the questions relating to the trial at hand in the Trial Chamber.  

Mr. President, I'm -- I've been here before you since Monday and I am under the impression that he's asking me questions and that we go back to the same questions -- to the questions.  And I'm beginning to be tired.  There's nothing new.  You realise that the counsel keeps going back to questions that he asked me on Monday.  He is trying to wear me out and to confuse me.  But I am enjoying the support of the good Lord.  I am not going to stray from the truth -- the truth that I witnessed. 

If I were to talk about events that I didn't witness, I would not be in a position to continue.  I am relating to you events that I witnessed during the genocide.  I am not used to such long questioning and it is before this Tribunal that I have learnt to be subjected to such questioning. Mr. President, this is a request that I'm making to you. 
Q.	Well, I haven't got many more minutes of questioning of you.  But I suggest what you just said about it being your culture is not true.  It's nothing to do with your culture.  It's the difference between knowing what's a lie and what's the truth.  And there's no cultural difference between us about that, is there? 
A.	I did not come here to lie.  I am only telling the truth and only the entire truth before this Tribunal. I didn't leave my home in Rwanda here to come and give testimony on events that I didn't witness. 
The war took place in the open and everybody witnessed what happened.  People died.  If somebody claims that that war did not take place, the person needs to prove it.  But I am confirming to you that that war took place and that people died.  I am not here to tell lies.  If I'd come here to lie -- well, I've just spent three days in this Chamber and I wouldn't have had anything to say before this Chamber if I'd come here only to tell lies. 
Q.	All right.  In -- in the Gatera statement that I assert you made and you say that's not your signature and I fabricated it, but in that statement you refer to your sister, a different name and your brother, in the same name, being taken.  And you say that you don't know where they were taken to, "Only Gatera will know that." 

It's quite obvious that you're saying you didn't know where they were taken.  And I just want to go through a few of your answers that you've said before and we know what you've said in this trial, but very briefly, and I want you to listen carefully to this.  On the 11th of December 2003 you were asked at page 60, "What happened to the people who were taken?"  And you said this:  "Later on the people who were taken below the maternity to the IRST got there, but there was another place below the clinic where a pit had been dug and that is where they were thrown in.  Did you actually witness the incident when people were being thrown into the pit?  Answer:  Yes, I saw that with my own eyes." 

A little later, you were asked by the Prosecution to look at a photograph and you identified the photograph in this way.  "Answer:  Here we are behind the clinic where the bodies were being thrown." 

Then you were asked about the man who was killed in surgery.  "What happened to his body?"  Page 7 of the 11th.  You said:  "The body was put into the pickup and was thrown into a pit, which was behind the maternity at a place called IRST, I-R-S-T.  Is that something you saw yourself?  Yes, yes, I did see it with my own eyes." 

And at page 24, you said this:  "I told you that I witnessed the execution of only one person and I saw the other persons being taken away in vehicles or rather in a vehicle.  The vehicle made several trips or rounds, but what I saw with my own eyes is that people were taken away and killed at the pit.  The Interahamwe killed them there at the pit." 

Did you see people being killed at the pit?
A.	I will say what I said again.  Those people were put in a van -- a pickup truck and were taken to a place behind the maternity.  Now, concerning the pit, we discovered it after the war and that pit is located between the maternity and the IRST? 
Q.	Did you see people or bodies being thrown into the pit as you said repeatedly, as I have just indicated, or not? 
A.	I am under the impression that you are taking back to issues that have already been discussed.  If we continue to do what you're doing, I think we'll never conclude this trial.  Are you trying to say that there were no victims or do you recognise that there were victims during that war? 
Q.	I'm not going to be very much longer with you, but please listen to the question -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, if you answered the questions that you are being asked, it's likely that you will be finished much quicker. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you see with your own eyes bodies or people being thrown into that pit? 
A.	I saw the vehicle taking them to a place behind maternity. 
Q.	And did you see the bodies thrown into the pit?  That's the question.  
A.	No, I wasn't a witness to that. 
Q.	Because that pit is quite out of sight of the maternity, isn't it?  You can't see it.  Is that right?  It is quite out of sight from where you were anywhere in the maternity building.  
A.	Well, if you care you can come to Rwanda and I will show you that pit.  If you are in any doubt that bodies were thrown into that pit and I would also show you a pit that is located very close to the pool where the bodies of -- the human bodies were unearthed. 
Q.	And on another smaller point but -- you told us yesterday you were never confronted by anyone in terms of who you were, your identification; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	So I'm just going to read a bit of what you said previously at page 41 on the 11th of December:  "When Dr. André came to separate the woman -- the women, did your sister already have her child?  Yes, she already had a child.  Did your sister show or present her ID card?  Yes, she presented her ID card.  Was her ID card torn apart?   Yes, it was torn.   Were you present?  Yes, I was present.  Were you close to the place?  Yes, I was near the place.  Was your ID card asked for?  No, I explained to them I didn't have one.  And you were not taken away?  No, I was not taken away.  It was God who protected me." 

So at the very moment your sister is taken, according to what you've said before, that absolutely crucial moment, you were asked for your ID and you said, "I don't have one."  And you weren't taken; is that right? 
A.	I won't answer.  You are speaking of identity cards, indeed, people were asked to show their ID cards before being killed.  They were asked to show their identity, the cards were torn up.  We saw the pieces of ID cards.  We discovered a list on which were the names of the Tutsis that had to be killed.  

If I said I had no ID card -- I remember the question you asked me yesterday, whether someone had asked me whether I was a Tutsi.  I remember well.  Did I tell you that Rwamakuba asked me if I was a Tutsi?  

If you have any proof, you should show it.  One can make a mistake in what one says before or after a certain time, one can forget -- what one has said.  But did you -- have you seen any document anywhere that I said that Rwamakuba asked me whether I was Tutsi?  That's what we discussed yesterday.  Please remember, if you can, I don't have any more memory.  My memory is exhausted -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Or something like that. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  Just two other matters:  You told us that you saw the killings in the surgery, the man in the bed with the axe and all that, you remember that I'm sure, dramatic and terrible sight.  And you told us that you were in the corridor; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  However, I just answered your question but I asked you to explain to me whether in 2003, in my statement, I had said that André Rwamakuba had asked me if I was a Tutsi.  I said many things and it is true that I can forget what I said after so long, but I asked you just now, to explain to me or tell me whether Rwamakuba -- whether I had said that Rwamakuba had asked me to tell him what was my ethnicity, whether I was Tutsi.  You haven't yet answered my question. 
Q.	No, it's not for me to answer it, I'm afraid, it's not how it works.  At page 52 -- 
A.	In that case, you base your question on an untruth. 
Q.	At page 52 relating to the last matter, you just said yes, you were in the corridor when you witnessed those killings and you were asked this:  "The killing you saw in the surgery, you saw from the corridor not from inside the surgery; is that right?"  And this was your answer:  "No --"
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Listen please.  "No, you can't see from the corridor.  You can't see what's happening inside the ward from the corridor, that's impossible." 
A.	No.  Regarding that corridor, I said that inasmuch as the ward was not closed, I could see what was happening inside the ward, but I was not near the attackers because I was afraid they would see me.  But I did specify that we were following what was going on very closely.  There were corridors one after the other and the doors to the wards opened on to the corridor.  You can be near the door and see a doctor putting a bandage on a patient or talking to a patient.  If you're following what's going on, you -- you can't not see what's happening from the corridor. 
Q.	You may remember that though you then lengthened your estimate, when you were first asked by the Prosecution the distance you were from those events, you put it as two metres, which is just a little bit more than you are tall, and you know what your height is, I'm sure.  Two metres.  That was untrue, wasn't it? 
A.	I did not specify the distance and I did not give any precise distance, I gave an estimate.  I'm telling you the truth.  I think you should perhaps re-read the transcript to see what I said yesterday.  I gave an estimate.  I said that it was during the genocide we were not in school or in class to give precise distances and dimensions.  I have the impression that you are repeating the same questions, coming back to the same topics and you did that on Monday and Tuesday and now today. 
Q.	My last matter I'm going to ask you about -- we did touch upon yesterday again, but just so we're quite clear.  In this trial, you've told us how you see André Rwamakuba on the 20th or the 21st and that very afternoon your brother was taken away on his instructions, and that must have been a terrible event for you to witness.  And the next day, in the morning, your sister and her baby was taken. Two years ago, your evidence was that you saw André Rwamakuba on the 20th and that same day your sister was taken.  And the next time you saw him, an unspecified time, and your evidence varied on this, same day, next day -- unclear, you say he took your brother.  

Now, even with all the terrible events that you were caught up with, you couldn't mix up whether it was your brother or your sister who was taken away under your eyes -- first, could you?   It's not something you're going to forget or confuse, is it? 
A.	I think that what you're saying is different from what I testified yesterday.  I told you the whole truth. 
	I've answered all your questions, in spite of the fact that you repeated them while trying to confuse me.  I answered your questions according to how you put them and in conformity with this Tribunal's rules and regulations.  In fact, in truth, I have tried everything to answer you.  

Tell me, do you deny that André Rwamakuba participated in the genocide?  Well, he behaved badly in Butare and moreover, in an issue of Imvaho, the weekly Imvaho, he was spoken of.  I, myself, bought that issue and he is spoken of in it, that he made himself sadly conspicuous in Butare.  

You can buy that issue of Imvaho and read it for yourself.  It's issue 1596.  Issue number 1596 of Imvaho and you can read it yourself to understand the cruelties perpetrated in Butare by your client.  He made himself sadly famous in Butare, where he had studied there and he had -- has a very bad reputation.  Infamous -- he is infamous in Butare. 
Q.	When -- when did you buy that?  I've never heard of this, but when did you buy that Imvaho, please? 
A.	I bought it in April. 
Q.	And you've kept it with you, have you? 
A.	Of course, I have a copy of that issue of Imvaho.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Imvaho is spelt I-M-V-A-H-O, says the Kinyarwanda booth. The witness adds:  
THE WITNESS:
I'm in the habit of having a copy of the Imvaho issue with me wherever I go, so that I have something to read. 

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Something to read.  And you bought this in April of 1994, is that right? 
A.	No, it's recently, I bought it on the 11th commemoration of the genocide. 
Q.	So it was something that was published this year, is that the position? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The number of which you carry around in your head; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I remember the number. 
Q.	And Imvaho is the official government newspaper of the Rwandese government; is that right? 
A.	I can't answer that question.  Imvaho is a newspaper which anyone can buy, which circulates.  I can't go into how the newspaper operates. 
Q.	It's the government's gazette, isn't it? 
A.	Sorry? 
Q.	Did someone give you that document?  Did someone give it to you? 
A.	No, nobody gave it to me.  I bought it myself; it only costs 100 Rwandan francs. 
Q.	And finally, *************, your colleague, is she as truthful as you are? 
A.	I cannot answer for what my colleague ************ says.  We do not discuss our various versions of the events.  We have not discussed that.  Each one of us speaks of their own experience.  The rules prevent us from speaking of our respective testimonies.  So I don't know if she's -- was telling the truth or not.   When she made her statement, I was not with her.   And moreover, when she testified I was not with her.  Moreover, I did not read her statement so as to determine its veracity and I believe that that she -- nor has she, I believe, read my statement. 
Q.	Well, thank you, Madam Witness.  Those are all my questions.  Thank you. 
A.	I thank you equally. 
MR. HOOPER:
There are quite a number of exhibits to -- to go in but, with the Chamber's leave, perhaps I can address that at a later time when everything is properly sorted out.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
At a later time today or?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we can do it later today at an appropriate moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall -- 

Thank you, Mr. Hooper. 

Madam Witness -- 

THE WITNESS:
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence is not quite finished yet, because you're going to have to answer a few other questions from the Prosecutor.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
No problem, I have no problem with that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I want to return to a few issues -- topics raised in the cross-examination.  Even if I do take some time, it won't be as long as the cross-examination was. 

I would like to come back to your statement of the 11th of September 1997 and I think that it was after ********************************* that you made this statement.  I should like you to specify where the investigators took this statement. 
A.	Inasmuch as I met the various investigators, I can't remember where the interview took place.  You know, this is quite some time ago. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I have your statement before me, the statement of the 11th of September 1997, and if I tell you that where the place where the interview took place was ***************************, would you accept that? 
A.	You mean the place where I was interviewed when I made that statement? 
Q.	Quite. 
A.	Yes, I remember now. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sure my friend will observe the -- the rules.  I mean, there's margins of tolerance and she's been occasionally even tolerant of me.  But if it could be avoided -- a leading question like that when the witness has indicated uncertainty. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, the -- the witness had perhaps not understood the question I put to her.  When I had -- I had her statement in hand, which she accepts that it was at *****************************, she did say, "Now I remember it was at **********************." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, that was a leading question because you put an answer that the answer was "yes".   

Now, it's not a big issue at this stage, but all that is being requested is that you remember this is your witness and not the witness that you're cross-examining. 
MS. FALL:
Quite, Mr. President.  Thank you very much. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness --  
A.	Present. 
Q.	When the investigators came to see you at ************************, for how long had you been ********************************? 
A.	I had been an employee there for -- since a few days. Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Much has been said of things absent from your statement of the 11th of September 1997, and at no time was reference made to the answers you'd given.  I should like, in turn, to refresh your memory and ask you whether when you made your statement -- 
MR. HOOPER:
This is your witness.  I'm sorry, this is the Prosecution's witness. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think a certain number of things have been said here in respect of the witness's credibility.  I think it should be possible to re-establish certain facts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, you are entitled to re-examine to re-establish a witness's credibility, but you used the phrase that you were about to refresh the witness's memory from a statement; that's not an accepted procedure. 
MS. FALL:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. HOOPER.
Just -- I hope, interrupt helpfully, to indicate that when I come to enter exhibits, I will exhibit all the statements and transcripts of this witness, so the Court will have, as it already has, all the statements before it.   And in due course, those can be points of reference. It's not appropriate in my submission for the Prosecution to take or seek to take a witness to their original statement at this stage. 
MS. FALL:
I'm very sorry, Mr. President, but Counsel Hooper's readings operated -- let us say, changes to what the witness said.  The -- he ascribed several answers to the witnesses (sic), that he claimed were in the transcripts and I want to come to that to show that it is what it was.  And I think I am free to do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In re-examination you are entitled to clarify issues that were raised in cross-examination.  So if you are dealing with issues where you are -- want to -- to demonstrate that there were inaccuracies or incompleteness in what was put forward, you are perfectly entitled to do that. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you were reproached for not having made -- when interviewed by the investigators in September 1997, did you not on several occasions specify that the 1997 statement was incomplete because the investigators had not -- was incomplete, is that not correct?  

I won't dwell on this statement.  I should like to come back to one of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, it was not the fact that -- of the topic that's -- that's the problem.  It's the way the question was put.  It's actually putting words in the mouth of the witness. 
MS. FALL:
I -- I shall move on to the transcripts, with the President's permission, to straighten out some things put by Mr. Hooper.  And the first thing I should like to speak of is the people who were killed and carried away in the pick up. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Counsel Hooper specified that you personally stated that you saw with your own eyes those people taken away and thrown into the pit; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct. 
Q.	He did tell you that you, when he read the document that you -- and saying what Counsel Hooper said.  I'm not saying that's what you said, that you had personally seen with your own eyes those persons thrown into the pit.  I should like, at this point, since you do have the transcript, refer to the transcript of the 11th of December 2003, page 9.  The question put:  "The man you say was in the surgical ward, what happened to the corpse of that man?  It was -- Answer:  It was loaded into -- on a pickup and thrown into a pit behind the maternity and - "
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel repeat, it's too -- 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	The answer was:  "The corpse was loaded on a pickup and it was thrown into a pit behind the maternity at a place called IRST.  Question:  And were you an eyewitness of that?  Answer:  Yes, yes, with my own eyes.  Question:  In your second statement you say that later you learned that there were mass pits -- graves behind the maternity, you learnt that later, you didn't see it with your own eyes."  
Do you remember having stated that in 2001?  You said, "I learnt later that there were mass graves behind the hospital."  Do you remember having said?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That witness's answer was the following, Mr. President:  "Those pits were not far away.  It would not be as far as Arusha to Kigali.  We knew where it was.  We could see the vehicle parked there, but we could not go there because we might also be killed there.  It is not far away.  So I think that is very clear", as regards to the witness's answer. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, in respect of what I have read, you were told that it was impossible from the maternity to be able to see the mass graves.  Can you specify how many mass graves there were at the hospital, if possible? 
A.	Regarding the pits from where we exhumed bodies, these are the pits that were found behind the maternity and another one, which was behind the clinic. 
Q.	Can you make it clear to us where exactly was the pit that was near the maternity? 
A.	It was located behind the maternity building. 
Q.	Can you tell us if from where you were, you could see a vehicle going to that location or to that spot?  
A.	Yes, I saw a vehicle go there. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  Now, I will move on to another matter concerning the witness about whom was discussed with you and who is a protected witness, and that you say you know because you were together during the events. 

Do you remember that witness?   Unless I'm mistaken, that is the witness that will be in number 5 -- number 7 on the list as was presented to you.  
A.	Yes, I do remember her. 
Q.	Can you tell us what was your relationship with that person? 
A.	Both of us were at that location as refugees. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether you stayed with that person during the entire period that you were at the hospital? 
A.	I was with her. 
Q.	Did you go together to the same places? 
A.	No, we were not together at all times. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not you had the opportunity of witnessing the same events? 
A.	Yes, we were witnesses to the same events at certain times. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you have the occasion subsequently to discuss the events that you witnessed at the Butare University Hospital together? 
A.	Yes, we talked about them. 
Q.	Can you tell us at what time you talked about them? 
A.	I do not quite recall when I have had to discuss those events with her. 
Q.	You have talked to us about events.  Have you had the opportunity or the occasion to discuss with her about the things you have been discussing here at the Tribunal? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Madam Witness, when you made your statement on the 11th of September 1997 were you alone when you were being interviewed? 
A.	I was alone. 
Q.	Other persons who were ********************************************** have been talked about.  Now, can you tell us the exact number of the staff of **********************************? 
A.	I cannot know the number of employees of that institution because there were so many people working there. 
Q.	Since you do not know the number, are you in a position to know all the persons working at ******************************* ? 
A.	It would be difficult to know their names; I do not know their names. 
Q.	Today, would you be in a position to tell us the number of all the services existing in ***************************************? 
A.	No problem there. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you were given a list of names.  I do not know if you have those names on your mind, can you tell us if you worked with this or that person in the same service? 
A.	I did not work with any of those persons whose names were given to me on a list. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you recall to us at what time you saw Dr. Rwamakuba in the company of a Dr. Twagirayezu? 
A.	On the 21st. 
Q.	You were questioned at length on the fact that you saw him accompanied by Dr. André Rwamakuba when he was committing certain acts; is that correct? 
A.	Twagirayezu used to go about with Rwamakuba, but I do recall that yesterday I told you that I wasn't a witness to his actions and gestures. 
Q.	So you indeed confirm what you stated in your statement to the effect that at no point do you remember having seen Twagirayezu take part in the killings? 
A.	I wasn't a witness to that.
MS. FALL:
I am -- I will go back to the transcript, Mr. President, and which the Defence counsel -- on which the Defence spent quite sometime saying that the witness said that she was in a small room and that she remained in that small room for three days, which is a me- -- which is a measure (sic) inconsistency with what she stated.   And I would like to refer to the transcripts of -- of Thursday 11 December 2003, and on page 41 thereof -- 

MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt, just for clarification, I never suggested as far as I can recall that that was something that was said in the transcript.  Where it appears, I think is predominantly in her fifth statement of the 12th of March, where she says that "I managed to escape the killings again because I hid in small rooms inside the maternity ward for several days", at HF-31.  I -- I don't think it came from a transcript. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Counsel, for that clarification.  I therefore would like to cite the record by saying that a significant clarification was made by the witness, which shows that probably there was an error when the statement was being drafted. 

I would like to recall that that was on the 11th of December 2003, on page 41 thereof, towards the end of the page.  "Question:  So you did not go to the small rooms of the maternity?   Answer:  No, I did not go there on the first floor.  Question:  Madam Witness, in March 2003 during the last statement you made to the investigators you stated that and I read:  I was able to escape the killings because I hid myself in the small rooms of the maternity block for several days.  Question:  What is the exact indication?   Did you hide yourself there for several days or you didn't hide yourself there as you've just told us?   Answer:  I repeat to you that I've come here to explain to you while communication is being made in several languages and the -- the language that is being used is one that is unknown to me.  Answer -- of the witness:  You cannot stay in the room for several days, you are likely to die.  How would you -- believing I have to go to the toilet or to go -- and I have to leave the toilet at a certain point, so we cannot stay in the same location at the same place for several days." 

I think this was the exact answer of the witness in respect of the question that was put to her. 
MR. HOOPER:
Just for the record, I think that was a cross-examination conducted by Maitre Weyl on behalf of Ngirumpatse. 
MS. FALL:
But in the Karemera, you -- when she made her statement, all the four accused persons were there and this witness has always appeared against André Rwamakuba.  It is true that she was prosecuted by all the four -- that she was cross-examined by all the Defence lawyers of the four accused persons; that is a clarification I wanted to make. Thank you. 

Mr. President, I would also like to take up again in order to establish -- let's say, to straighten out certain things insofar as the witness's statement is concerned, because the impression was that she was just fabricating things, she's -- to the effect that she's always said that she always saw André Rwamakuba when he left the faculty of medicine with axes.   And if we read the records, you will see that 
Counsel Hooper tried to state that there was an inconsistency, because the first time around she talked about machetes.  I think we can refer to the transcripts, and I would like to read the witness's answer, first of all, on the 10th of December 2003.  "Question --" Counsel Hooper:  "I'm going to ask you the question.  So Witness, you say that you saw André Rwamakuba leave the faculty of medicine with axes; is that what you stated? Yes.  Question:  Did you realise or can you tell us if there was a significant number of axes?  Yes, there were many axes.  And, according to you, what were those axes used for or what were they to be used for?  These axes were to be used to kill Tutsis." 

At no point here does she mention machetes. 

Statement of 11 December 2003 -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, I -- I don't know how appropriate this process is.  Can I just put it on the record, if it's necessary to do so, that this witness plainly did refer to machetes at one point, and when we went to the transcript, I read that part and then the correction to axes.  So the full text of the original statement that it was machetes and her correction was read into the record yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I know it might be unnecessary to say this, but this is not a jury trial.  We are professional judges and you can be assured that we will make an appropriate study of the transcripts.  It would be sufficient to highlight the points and -- and you can rely on us to -- to study the transcripts appropriately. 
MS. FALL:
I'm convinced, Mr. President, about that, but simply since as was the case with Counsel Hooper, I just merely wanted to read passages that had to deal with the witness's credibility.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are perfectly entitled to do that, that's not the point I was making. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm going to go back to all those documents that were submitted to you this morning concerning the judgements in Rwanda, and I believe that you were consistent in your attitude in that you refused to recognise the signature -- signatures; is that correct? 
A.	That is what I said. 
Q.	Can you explain to us, if possible, why you refused to recognise that signature? 
A.	The reason wherefor I do not recognise or acknowledge the signature is that I realised that it's not mine.  I haven't changed my signature for a long time. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I wanted to ask, isn't it possible that at a certain point or another, one may change his or her signature? 
A.	As far as I am concerned, I have not changed my signature. 
Q.	It is true that for the moment only a graphologist, if it were necessary to ascertain your signature to do that, but you told us that it was possible for us to give you a piece of paper in which you can append your signature to show that the signature in the documents was not your signature.  Do you think that would be enough? 
A.	That's no problem with that. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, can a sheet of paper be -- or several sheets of paper can be provided to the witness so that she can append her signature therein, so that we can ascertain whether there has been any change in her signature. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  But I don't know if you expect us to act as an expert and I hope you are not going to ask us to act as an expert.
MS. FALL:
Well, I did say that a graphologist can do this, but I said a piece of paper can be given to her to see if her signature has changed or not, and which is why I suggested that two pieces or three pieces of paper be given to her. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted. 
MS. FALL:
Please can you provide her with two or three sheets of paper.  Yes, two -- three sheets of paper.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, you didn't use your microphone.  Can you repeat what you just said in the lead microphone?  
THE WITNESS:
Do you merely want me to append my signature on the paper or to write my name as well?
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	It would be good for you to put your signature on it and also write your name because if we had to submit that to a graphologist, we should be able to compare letters and how they are curved.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, may I invite the witness to do it eight times.  It's a small signature; she can do that eight times, please. 
MS. FALL:
Until proven otherwise, I think this is my re-examination and I am asking the witness to write down her signature and to write down her name on each sheet of paper that's been provided to her. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I -- I hope I'm assisting, but if the Prosecution are going to resort to a graphologist then the graphologist will want at least eight signatures and also some free text -- that is, some sample of writing that has been done.  She may have a document with her that is less likely to be contrived. 
MS. FALL:
Have you ever consulted an expert, Counsel, to be in a position to know exactly what they would want?
THE WITNESS:
I'm done. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to tender this document to be entered as a Prosecution exhibit and that they be placed under seal. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I invite the Prosecution to consider two things:  First of all, once these are exhibited, they remain with the Court under seal.  If any graphologist that the Prosecution have in mind wants to inspect them, then they can only inspect them here at the court.

If the Prosecution are taking this course, then with respect, they should consider obtaining from this witness, and now is a good a time as any, a sample of her handwriting because from one's experience, graphologists -- handwriting experts are not very happy with photocopies.  

In fact, they don't even like biros.  But, so if this is going to be an exercise the Prosecution are meaning to follow -- to consult a graphologist, which I earnestly invite them to do, then they're going to need a proper sample and not a photocopy of the handwriting from the witness.  But I leave it entirely, of course, to my friend. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, how much longer do you intend to be? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think if it is time for us to take our break, we might as well do so, because I'm not done with the witness yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an idea of an approximate duration?  That was the primary objective of my question.  But it is still of interest to know, if you have an idea, of how long you are going to be.  
MS. FALL:
I can't really say, but I think I will take less time than Counsel Hooper did for cross, in cross. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that is to be expected because you are in re-examination.  
MS. FALL:
Do you want me to give a specific time or probable time? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know it's impossible to give a specific time in these matters.  But you must have an idea of how many more topics you have to address and roughly what type of duration you anticipate it to last.
MS. FALL:
Approximately I should say about two more hours after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I hope that you don't break the rules as to what's permitted in re-examination.  Two hours seems a very long time for re-examination. 

We will take the adjournment now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we rise, can I invite this witness, if I provide the paper, if this is an avenue that's going to be  followed, to provide for my purposes five signatures. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we will come to that.  You will probably have an opportunity to ask that question at the end of the re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I don't think it would be appropriate to interrupt the Prosecutor's re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I just thought over lunch -- all right.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are going to take the adjournment for lunch now, and as on previous adjournments, I remind you that you are still a witness and you are not to discuss the case with anybody during this or any other adjournment while you are in this capacity. 
THE WITNESS:
I will follow your instructions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

We will now adjourn for lunch. 
(Court recessed at 1237H)
(Pages 21 to 36 by Jean Baigent)






(Court resumed at 1420H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Before the break, I had the witness sign three documents, and I ask to -- sought to tender them as Prosecution exhibits.  It is true that only a graphologist might identify the signature, but I did not formally indicate that we would use the services of a graphologist.  So I would like to tender these documents as Prosecution exhibits.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence, under seal.  
MS. FALL: 
Registrar, might I be reminded of the exhibits number, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, it is P.  55.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 55 admitted, under seal) 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Before we went for the break, Witness, we talked about proceedings that were carried out in Rwanda.  I do not know whether you can talk to us about that, but could you tell us whether these proceedings are different from the ones that you have experienced here?  Could you tell us how these things happened in Rwanda, how hearings are organised? 
A.	In regard to the proceedings in this Tribunal, as compared to these proceedings, in a trial in Rwanda, you do not mix trials.  You do not mention trials that have been conducted in another country.  So this is a first experience for me here.  
Q.	Witness, when you gave testimony last year, do you remember at any time having referred to -- to the twin of the sister who was in hospital and who had just had a premature baby? 
A.	No, I didn't mention her in my testimony. 
Q.	Last year when you were asked why you did not say that Rurangirwa had killed your sister, you said "no".  Could you tell us which of your sisters you were referring to at the time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, it's a small matter, but are you referring to 2003, by last year?  

MS. FALL: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President, yes, it is indeed 2003.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I suggest, with respect, that this is spoon feeding the witness a possible answer that the witness herself hasn't given, and I'm concerned about that.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I am not leading the witness.  I am putting this question as something that arises from Mr. Hooper's cross-examination, which suggested that the witness had answered "no" to the question as to why she didn't say why -- that it is the other twin who was killed by Rurangirwa.  This is a question that arises from the cross-examination that was conducted by Mr. Hooper.  May I proceed, 
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may answer the question.  
THE WITNESS: 
I didn't follow the question, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I shall repeat the question then.  

I put a first question to you regarding whether or not you referred to the name of the twin sister to the one who gave birth prematurely at the hospital, and you said "no".  Whereupon I asked you when you were questioned about the fact that you had answered no to the question pertaining to why you did not say that Rurangirwa had killed one of your sisters and the question to what sister you were referring.  
A.	I'm going to give you the name of my sister who was killed by Rurangirwa. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness has pronounced the name.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you are a protected witness.  You have been told before that you mustn't speak out the name.  
A.	I'm sorry, I forgot. 
Q.	Is it -- the name that you mentioned or that you gave us today when you gave testimony, were you then referring the twin, to the one of your sisters who was in -- at the hospital and who had given birth prematurely? 
A.	The name I gave is the name of the twin sister of this other sister.  And, yes, I have, in fact, given the name before. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us approximately at what time, that is the twin -- your twin sister -- the twin sister who was killed by Rurangirwa, can you give us the approximate time that this happened? 
A.	If you are referring to the one who was the twin to my sister who died at the hospital, well, she was killed in May. 
Q.	Witness, you have made many statements.  You have testified twice so far before this Court or before this Tribunal.  Can you remember word for word everything you said during your statement -- in your statements and during your testimonies? 
A.	No, I cannot remember all of that word for word. 
Q.	Witness, between the statements you gave the investigators and the testimonies that you gave before this Trial Chamber and the Trial Chamber that you testified before last year, what do you think is the most important between your statements and your testimony? 
A.	Are you talking about what is more important?  I really don't understand.  
Q.	Would you say that it is the statements that were given to the investigators or your testimonies before the Trial Chamber?  So between the statements and the testimonies before the Trial Chamber, what do you think is more important? 
A.	I consider that my testimony before the Judges is of greater importance. 
Q.	As I have recalled, and as we've had to emphasise here, you gave testimony in December 2003, you also gave testimony in 2005, that is from three days ago, and the transcripts are there.  Do you think that between those two periods you gave truthful relation of events that you witnessed in the Butare university teaching hospital? 
A.	The relation of the events that I have made reflect what I personally saw.  That is what I said before the Chamber. 
Q.	Madam Witness, while you were at the Butare university teaching hospital in 1994, did you see 
	André Rwamakuba tear up or choose patients and Tutsi refugees and take them away on board a vehicle? 
A.	Yes, I was witness to that. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you -- and once again I'm asking you this question because you are under solemn declaration -- did you give a truthful relation of the events that you witnessed in the Butare university teaching hospital? 
A.	Yes, I have faithfully related what I saw personally.
MS. FALL:
At this stage, Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Fall.  

Now, Mr. Hooper, you had raised the question about graphology.  Now, you have heard Ms. Fall say that she does not intend to engage a graphologist.  Do you wish to do more on the subject?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, it's not a matter that lies, as it were, in my camp.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I've still got exhibits to deal with but I can deal with that in the absence of the witness.  She doesn't need to be present 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think -- there is nothing controversial in this as far as I'm aware.  
MR. HOOPER: 
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you have now come to the end of your testimony, and you are now excused and free to return to your home.  We thank you for coming to give evidence before the Tribunal, and you are now excused.  Now, I notice that you wish to say something.  Yes, you may speak.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you, Mr. President, and the Chamber.  I would like to say something about my personal safety.  In December 2003, I came here and gave testimony before the Trial Chamber.  You say that our security as witnesses is protected, but when I arrived at ********, I realised that my name was known; in other words, my security is in Rwanda is not protected -- is not taken care of.  I had security problems in the area in which I live, and today I live at the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal).  This shows that the witnesses who come here are not sufficiently protected.  I would therefore like to request that my name not be revealed or disclosed and that where I go when I leave this Tribunal should not be made known.  I would therefore like this to be made so that my safety or my security is ensured.  That is what I wish to say and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those arrangements are already in place, and to assist in the completeness of the protection, I'm going to ask the registrar to strike from the record the indication of your home address, which you have just mentioned in open session.  That will be struck from the record and kept under confidential cover.  I think -- I think that the arrangements that's -- there is already, in your case, a protective order which has made provision for exactly the point that you have raised and others.  Is there anything else that you wish to -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I would like to add that when we leave this Trial Chamber, the Defence makes the names of witnesses public, as was the case with my name.  I almost died and it is thanks to God that I'm still alive today.  This trial has had to be re-opened, but my identity was disclosed and I was tracked down.  The security services of my country are well aware that my security was threatened after I had left Arusha.  I, therefore, would like to request that the names of witnesses should not be disclosed because this actually makes it possible for those hunting us down to kill us to identify us.  I believe that if this were done I would have problems when I go to Rwanda.  I would therefore like that the Defence be requested to abstain from disclosing the identity of witnesses so that people in Rwanda should not know them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, and we have taken note of what you've said.  You are now excused.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, there is one thing that in fact I forgot.  The witness made mention of a copy of Invaho, and -- in the course of her testimony, number 1596, of April this year which she says she carries with her.  And I'm wondering whether I could prevail upon her because I can't speak to her directly, if I could borrow it and have a photocopy and I will return it to her.  If that could be arranged through the -- through the witness protection, and I will get it back to her within half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, Defence counsel has requested that you lend him the copy of Invaho so he can photocopy it.  Are you willing to do that?  
THE WITNESS: 
I think I cannot lend him my copy.  The interpreter, on the other hand, may read the contents thereof to him, and the newspaper can be given back to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not going to be part of the trial; it's not going to be read into the record.  Basically if you'd like somebody else to make a copy for him, you can arrange through the witness protection section to have a photocopy made and given to him.  Is that what you are saying?  
THE WITNESS: 
I think I have said what I said by telling him the issue of that magazine so that he can try to consult the records of that Invaho so -- and himself seek to obtain that issue of Invaho if he really needs it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  Well, you are excused now.
(Witness excused)  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, before the next witness is called, the Prosecution indicated at lunch time that they were going to be about two hours with the witness this afternoon.  As result of which I have had to put an 
all-station alert out for Mr. O'Shea, who is going to take the next witness, and who, I think, was obviously counting on -- on having some more time to busy himself.  But in the meantime, hoping that he'll emerge while I'm doing it, I can perhaps address the exhibits in the last -- in the last matter.  That should take a little time anyway, if that's appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it was clear that when Ms. Fall said two hours she could not have been serious.  I think perhaps she was mistaking me for you when she made that remark.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I did check afterwards and she maintained that position.  But I see Mr. Webster is now ready, so --  but perhaps we -- as I say, it would be unfortunate if -- if Dr. Des Forges were to start, as it were, without -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time are you asking for?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, we'll go through the exhibits and we'll see how we are.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But how much time do you need?  I don't want you to just protract the exhibits just to --
MR. HOOPER: 
No, no, I'll do it quickly and then Ms. Pouplard's been out looking for the professor, but without -- without success.  But I saw him last at about half past one and he was sober and coming this way, so I don't know what's happened to him.  He may be in the office and -- he is not in the office, right.  Well, I will make a call for him in a moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, you may --
MR. HOOPER:
Can I deal with the exhibits?
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- deal with the exhibits.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  

The first exhibits -- Mr. Fry, can you remind me which number we are up to for D exhibits?  
MR. FRY:
The next number would be D. 54, and if you could go slowly, please.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
D. 54 is the statement in England -- English and French of HF, dated the 12th of March 2003, under seal, if that's satisfactory. 
(Exhibit No. D. 54A and D. 54B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	Exhibit D. 55, under seal, will be the statement of Witness HF in English and French, dated the 6th of February 2001.  
(Exhibit No. D. 55A and D. 55B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	Exhibit , again, under seal, is the statement of HF, dated the 11th of September '97, in English and French.  
(Exhibit No. D. 56A and D. 56B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	The next exhibit is with the registry and it's the tick list of names of those employed at the institution and/or witnesses that were known and recognised by HF -- sorry, it's come back.  Yes, that's the original HF.  That's under seal, and it's Exhibit D. 57.
 (Exhibit No. D. 57 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	D. 58 is a sheet of paper with writing of Defence counsel on it, recognised by Witness HF as being the name and nickname of Witness RJ, and that's under seal and D. 58.  
(Exhibit No. D. 58 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, with your leave, sir, may I see the document?  I do not quite remember the document in question.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  The next exhibit is Exhibit D.  59, which is a copy judgment from the court in ********* in the Sahera case.  In fact, I will retain that, subject to the Court's views, but submit a Prosecution document with K number K0285655, which is the same document but has the advantage of being the Prosecutor's provenance.  And that was the document that came to us, having been served in the Muvunyi case.  And it's the same as the document that was referred to and shown to the witness, which will be exhibited at a later point in the trial.  I suppose that document should be under seal.  Yes, because it has the name and details of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 59 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER: 
There is also available in respect of the extracts of that, the specific extracts and bundle which were distributed to the Judges and other parties and the witness for their convenience in Kinyarwanda, English and French, and that would be D. 60, and will be under seal.  I believe -- I think the registry would have it, it's -- 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, regarding the English and French translations, I would like to know the authors of the translations if they are official.  In order to avoid any problems, we had suggested that the interpreters do the translation.  I think that is found in the transcript.  So I think that it is the translation that was done by the interpreters that should be the one retained.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, we've had the advantage of the interpreters' assistance in this on the relevant pages and that will take priority, but these were documents that were seen, they were aids, and they are no more than what they are.  And the author of those documents is Celestin Bahuru, again, who, I think I mentioned earlier and in the context of those translations.  But those were the three documents that went in as a bundle and I ask that they be exhibited.  But I take my friend's point.  We've had the advantage of the testimony in the trial that was read in and that is the principal source in this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will admit the documents in evidence.  The -- as has been said the -- the -- we have the -- what's on the record, the relevant parts have been translated and it would be -- enable us to make comparisons if necessary.  
(Exhibit No. D. 60A, D. 60B, and D. 60C admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER: 
And, again, in respect of the second Sahera document, that was the record of the witness's testimony as asserted by the Defence of the 17th of November 1997.  And, again, what is to be submitted there, are the several pages in Kinyarwanda, the English translation of that that accompanied that document, and the French translation that accompanied that document.  Again, translations provided from Kinyarwanda by Mr. Bahuru, and from -- into French and from French into English by the authorship of Mrs. Pouplard and Mr. O'Shea.  And, again, those have been read -- or the relevant parts of them have been read into the transcript and they take priority over the translations, but the translations are there as an aid, but again, under seal.  Thank you very much.  

So those documents will be D. 61.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 61A, D. 61B, and D. 61C admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	The next document is the original -- the PV provided by the Prosecution, dated the 5th of May of 1998 from the Gatera trial, bearing the disputed signature of Witness HF, and its contents.  There is a French translation that was done which is marginally different to the preferred translation proffered by the Defence.  And, Mr. President, you said earlier that it will be best if both the French and the English translation of that document could be agreed within the language section and, therefore, it's only the Kinyarwanda at this stage that I'd ask to go in, if that's appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What steps are you taking to get the translations?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm afraid we haven't taken any steps yet but we'll put that in hand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the issue of us having the Kinyarwanda document without the translations doesn't help us in our adjudicated process.  
MR. HOOPER: 
No.

MR. PRESIDENT:
So somebody has to make a request to the language section.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, yes, very well, that will be a process that will have to start anew.  In the meantime, we have those parts in the relevant testimony that were referred that were translated in court and read into the transcript.  So at the moment that's all that assists the Judges.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we will admit the Kinyarwanda document, but I was expecting that you'd give an undertaking to make a request from the translation department.  
MR. HOOPER: 
We would do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. HOOPER:
Both in English and French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  So the Kinyarwanda should go in, if the registry, I hope, has got it as D. 62, and under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 62 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	And, finally, aside from the translations yet to come, five copies of CDs of transcripts of HF's testimony in the case of Karamera and others of December 2003, which would be Exhibit D. 64 -- 63, I'm sorry.  I don't think there is any closed session on that, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't recall either.  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, but there is the name of ************ that was spoken of in that case, but perhaps at the moment -- yes -- and the names of the -- names of ************** at that stage.  So I'm a bit --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you recommending under seal for this document?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Given what the witness said as she left, I think so, yes; puts us beyond criticism.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  The -- Mr. Registrar, that goes under seal.  
MR. FRY:
So noted, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. D. 63 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER: 
All right, so D. 64 then, the next exhibit that I'd forgotten about, is a list drafted by counsel, Defence counsel, of comparative names as used in this case and in the Sahera judgment and court hearing.  Which, again, I think the registry will have a copy of that; under seal, of course.  

That's all right, it goes into two pages instead of one, but that's all right.  
(Exhibit No. D. 64 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	And, again, with the registry at the moment, I believe is a piece of paper upon which the witness wrote the name of the twin sister today.  And that should be under seal, and will be Exhibit D. 60 -- 65, yes.  
(Exhibit No. D. 65 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	And then going back some time to Witness GAB, we have Witness GAB, GAB's statements in English and French, first of all, of the 24th of June '99, which will be Exhibit 66, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 66A and D. 66B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	And his statement of the 4th of November 2004 in English and French, under seal, which will be 
Exhibit 67.  
(Exhibit No. D. 67A and D. 67B admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	And, finally, two documents, both tick lists, which have been agreed with the Prosecution, the originals having been misplaced, they have been agreed with the Prosecution as accurately showing the recognition -- the knowledge of particular named persons by the respective witnesses, first of all, GLM.  GLM's tick list should be Exhibit D. 68, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 68 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
And the tick list of AVD, under seal, D. 69.  
(Exhibit No. D. 69 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
	And I think with the one exception of the translations of the 5th of May, PV, I think that brings us up to date entirely with Defence exhibits.  That will follow when we get the translations.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  

Could we now call the next witness.  
Good afternoon, Madam Des Forges.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are about to commence your testimony and, in the usual form, the registrar will invite you to take the oath as a witness. 
(Declaration made by Alison Des Forges in English)
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, do I address mister or Madam Prosecutor?
MR. WEBSTER:
	Mr. Prosecutor, this afternoon.

	Good afternoon, Your Honours.  Good afternoon, Mr. O'Shea, and Mr. Hooper and to the registry.

	Mr. O'Shea was going to make an objection, I take it or?
MR. O'SHEA: 
I want to get in early.

Your Honour, I'd just like to draw one matter to the Court's attention and to the parties, because I believe it may assist my learned friend in how he proceeds with this witness.

On the side of the Defence, we do not dispute that Dr. Des Forges has expertise in Rwandan history or violations of human rights during the course of 1994 in Rwanda.  I hope that assists in terms of how we proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, it does assist.  I'll still go over a bit of Mrs. -- madam-- excuse me, Dr. Des Forges' CV.  And I would ask that it be handed up to her at this time.  I believe it was served on CMS last week or yesterday at least.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
-- particularly as this is not controversial, couldn't Dr. Des Forges simply identify the CV and have it tendered?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's what I'm planning to do, Your Honour.  I have asked that it be handed up to her.
ALISON DES FORGES,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon Dr. Des Forges.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	What's been handed up to you is a CV, which you should recognise, since I assume that you wrote it.  Could you recognise it for us, please, and then sign it and then we'll proceed from there? 
A.	Yes, I do recognise it. 
Q.	I'm still going to ask you a few background questions that -- with information recorded in the CV.  Could you tell us if you are currently employed, by whom, and what your title and duties are, please?  
A.	I am senior advisor to the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, an international organisation for the defence of human rights, based in the United States. 
Q.	And how long have you been so employed?
(Pages 37 to 48 by Gifty C. Harding) 

















	1515H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And how long have you been so employed?
A.	I began the investigations on a voluntary basis for Human Rights Watch in 1991, and became a paid member of the staff in 1996. 
Q.	And what do your responsibilities entail? 
A.	I am responsible for overseeing the documentation and writing of reports; based upon that documentation, treating human rights abuses in Rwanda and Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  And for carrying out advocacy activities designed to attempt to persuade persuasive abusive authorities to stop those abuses. 
Q.	Now, I see from your CV that you have an undergraduate degree from Radcliff College and the Doctorate of history from Yale University; that is correct? 
A.	That is correct.  And also a Master's Degree in African Studies from Yale University. 
Q.	All right.  Can you explain to us how you developed your interest in the African Great Lakes region?
A.	When I was an undergraduate at university, I had the opportunity to teach for a number of months in a refuge camp in western Tanzania.  The refugees at that camp were from Rwanda, people who had fled the violence after the 1959 revolution.  I found their history considerably more interesting than the history of African -- the history of Europe which I had been studying until that point.  So, when I returned to the United States, I decided to make that my field of professional study. 
Q.	Would you be able to state how many times you visited Rwanda over your lifetime, or visited the region of the African Great Lakes?
A.	One period of four months, two periods of somewhat more than a year each, and then in additional 30 times ranging from a week to three or four weeks, so many times. 
Q.	Okay.  And if we were to confine ourselves to the period of 1990 to 1994, could you estimate how many times you visited Rwanda during that period? 
A.	1990 to 1994, four times, I believe; perhaps five times. 
Q.	Do you have any familiarity with the Kinyarwanda language? 
A.	I have considerable passive knowledge, but I express myself poorly. 
Q.	Okay, maybe you can explain to us a bit by what you mean by passive knowledge?
A.	That is I can read documents and I can understand conversations, unless the persons engaged in the conversation wish me not to understand, in which case I may or may not be able to follow it. 
Q.	And I see from your CV that you also speak French? 
A.	Yes, I have no difficulty functioning in French. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you are recognised as a scholar on the African Great Lakes region.  Can you tell us why that is? 
A.	The recognition of my scholarship has to do with my teaching experience at a number of universities, including Yale, the State University of New York, the University of Beijing, and most recently, at the University of California, Berkeley.  It rests also upon my scholarship and publications, including Leave Known to Tell the Story, which was acknowledged by a number of prizes.  It rests also by my presentations at various scholarly colloquia including those of the African Studies Association and that of the American Historical Association.  Also upon various appearances I had made before national and international panels, investigating a situation, particularly in Rwanda, and then the Great Lakes more generally, including that of the United Nations investigation into the Rwandan genocide, that of the Eminent Panel of Persons of the organization of African Unity, that of the French National Assembly of the Belgium Senate, of the US Congress; and, in addition to that, considerable exposure through the media in both a scholarly and an activist role. 
Q.	Thank you.  Dr. Des Forges, I have just gotten a little note reminding us that we both speak very quickly, so we have to slow down a bit.  I speak quickly and, I guess, you do as well.  But can you go on and tell us what -- you mentioned that your book, Leave none to tell the story, garnered a prize.  Can you tell us what the prize was, and if you, personally, have received any awards of distinction for your scholarly work and what they were, please? 
A.	Leave none to tell the story was honoured with the Lempkin Award of the Institute of Genocide Scholars as the best work on genocide produced in the years 2000 and 2001.  It was also honoured by the Bruno Kreisky Award of the institute in Austria.  And I, personally, received the MacArthur Distinguished Award, which gave me support for my work for a period of five years. 
Q.	And that award is colloquially known as the genius award, I believe; is that correct?  
A.	It is called the genius award in part because it is a prize given -- it is an unsolicited prize, unlike many scholarships or prizes where one applies.  This is a prize which is bestowed by a group of scholars chosen by the MacArthur Foundation. 
Q.	Do you recall how many times you have testified as an expert witness before this Tribunal? 
A.	I believe this is the ninth time. 
Q.	And you prepared an expert report with regard to this trial, the Rwamakuba trial?
A.	I did. 
Q.	Can you describe a bit the methodology that you used to prepare that report? 
A.	I drew, of course, upon the research and analysis which had also underlain the book Leave none to tell the story.  And in addition to that, I have had the opportunity to consult other documents and sources which were not available to me when I wrote Leave none to tell the story, including having the opportunity to read most of the interviews done with former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, and consult the diaries and other writings of other government officials which were not available to me at the time I wrote the book. 
Q.	Thank you, very much.  We will go into the substantive aspects of your testimony now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Before we do that, may I have Dr. Des Forges's CV marked for identification and exhibited?  I don't know what the next number is, but since Mr. O'Shea -- 56.  And I would offer her as an expert witness on the history of the African Great Lakes region, particularly Rwanda, and human rights abuses in the region.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, that is P. 56, right?  
(Exhibit No. P. 56 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, in the light of Mr. O'Shea's comment earlier, it may be appropriate at this stage just to formally, acknowledge -- accept the witness as an expert in this field.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, I think I would like to play it like this, if I may: I have no difficulty with the question of expertise.  As things stand at the moment, I have no difficulty with the question of impartiality either.  However, I would like to hear Dr. Des Forges's testimony before a final resolution of her legal status as an expert is resolved.  And I say that only from the point of view of impartiality.  At the moment that is not an avenue I intend to go down, but it just seems to me to be wise to wait until the conclusion of her testimony to resolve that issue.  

However, we do admit that she is an expert, in the sense that she has expertise in human rights violations in Rwanda and that she is an expert historian in that region.  I'm not putting the Court on notice here that impartiality is an issue, but it just seems to me that it is premature to make a finding on that particular aspect of things. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, quite frankly, I have a problem with that formulation.  It seems what Mr. O'Shea is giving with the right hand he is taking back with the left.  Now, if it's the issue of competence and qualification, we have covered that ground, I can go over it again.  The issue of impartiality does not rise -- does not arise in the question of qualification of an expert.  

If the Court would like me to go over her qualification and her publications and her experience with this Trial Chamber and with government bodies and policy formulating institutions, I will do that.  And that is where the criteria of expertise -- that is how the criteria of expertise is going to be established.  It has nothing to do with impartiality or lack of it, so on and so forth.  I thought Mr. O'Shea was expediting matters when he rose to his feet this morning.  I would request the Court to make a decision based on the submission, and based on the examination that I have just completed.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, Your Honour, I'm quite happy to accept the expertise of this witness.  That is not and will not be a matter in issue.  It is, therefore, not necessary for my learned friend to trek through the elements of expertise of this witness.  

The only point that I am making is that, at this point in time, not having heard the witness, we do not at this stage know how she is going to come across.  That has nothing to do with her expertise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a criminal trial --  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and the Court will not impose any pressure on a party -- 
Mr. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- to consent to anything.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Understood, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are quite free to object if you wish to.  But from what you have just stated, it doesn't seem to me that you are objecting to her competence to testify as an expert, which, basically, involves allowing her to give evidence of opinion. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
That is right, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, appointing her -- or accepting her as an expert -- as an expert witness, does not pre-suppose the level of acceptance of her testimony that the Court will make.  That will be evaluated as we evaluate the testimony of any witness. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  Your Honour, I entirely accept that distinction.  However, what I say is that the fact that the witness does have expertise does not touch on the question of impartiality; the question of impartiality can touch upon the question of competence.  So, I'm not sure what the right expression is here, but we are prepared to accept that Dr. Des Forges has competence to give evidence as an expert in that she has the appropriate expertise.  But we reserve our right to come back to the issue of impartiality, if it becomes an issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you always have that right.  I don't see -- my problem is this:  I think that as to the issue as to whether she is an expert or not is preliminary or is precedence to her giving testimony, because she would not be able to give evidence of opinion if she was not an expert.  So if -- if we are to adjudicate in the normal sense, then we should here, at this stage, give you an opportunity to cross-examine on the issues which will impinge on whether she is identified as a court expert.  Making such a finding, in my view, does not stop you from challenging her impartiality at a later stage if it is an important part of your Defence position. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Well, I think we are ad idem.  I felt it was important to make the record clear as to what I was saying.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Mr. O'SHEA:
So, Your Honour can make that finding in the terms Your Honour has indicated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Webster, I would not have wanted to make the ruling of expertise based on consent which was not wholehearted, but the witness's competence and CV is evidenced by her CV -- her competence and qualifications are evidenced by her CV.  The Defence has not challenged it.  And we think it is appropriate at this stage to make the ruling that she is an expert witness in this trial.  So, you can proceed on that basis. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, very much.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, would you kindly begin by reviewing, very briefly, the emergence and the structure of state authority in Rwanda over the last century.  Do you recognise any lineage between pre-colonial Rwanda and the state structure that was in place under Juvénal Habyarimana`s second republic? 
A.	Rwanda was exceptional in this part of Africa for the sophistication and extent of control of state structures at the beginning of the colonial period.  Those state structures were very complexed, involving overlapping kinds of authorities, charged with different mandates, but all under the control of the ruler, who was known as the marme (phonetic).  

An important part of the structure involved military institutions which had more than simply military significance; they had, also, political, judicial, educational significance as well.  In addition to the formal institutional structure, there was a system of personal relationships known as a clientage relationships, which helped to facilitate the exercise of power by those people who had wealth, and access to the court.  It was a complex and dynamic system.  

With the arrival of Europeans and the imposition of colonial rule, the essential elements of the state remained, but were somewhat distorted or twisted by the colonial administrators who wanted to use the state but, we could say, clean it up a little bit, make it a little bit simpler, a little bit more direct, a little bit more in conformity of their own conception of bureaucratic organisation.  So, they simplified some of the institutions. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Sorry, Dr. Des Forges, I don't mean to interrupt.  I would just like to ask, if possible, if you could go a little more slowly because I am taking a note.  And I understand that it is difficult when talking about these sorts of matters, but if you could try we would be grateful. 
THE WITNESS:
The impact of the colonial administration was to simplify the state and to re-enforce the control of the central focus of power on areas that had not previously accepted central control completely, and at the same time, to allow the state to extend its power downwards into a much more intensive control of people's daily lives.  This took the form of increased demands for taxation and services.  

So the arrival of the colonial layer, on top of the existing state layer, was to add to the weight of the entire system upon ordinary people.

At the same time, the power -- the persons occupying power changed somewhat in their identity, because the state, as it existed before the arrival of the colonial administration, included people whom we would today identify as Hutu, as well as women in some positions of power.  The Europeans, and here I speak both of the Germans, who were the first colonial administrators and the Belgians when they arrived, in part, because their own vision was limited by their own prejudices, they saw the occupants of power as being largely, and in some cases, exclusively Tutsi.  And because that was -- that matched their own preconception of who should rule, because Tutsi physically looked more like them, they eliminated from positions of power, persons whom we would today call Hutu, as well as women.  And so the result was the creation of a more repressive state structure.  At the same time, that the control of that state was limited to Tutsi rather than being more accessible to people of other groups.

In that connection, the colonial period meant that the demarcation of the Tutsi as a ruling elite became much sharper.  And, in part, this was because the colonial state imposed a system of population registration where each adult was required to identify himself in terms of an ethnic group.  These classifications had previously been fluid and flexible, but with their reduction to writing and particularly the imposition of a system of identity cards, those distinctions became far more rigid and sharp. 

So you had an elite increasingly demarcated by fiat, by administrative decision.  And at the same time, you had a growing solidarity among the ordinary people who saw themselves excluded from access to power and saw themselves as increasingly subject to the demands, both of the Tutsi elite and of the colonial administration.  So it was really a 20th century phenomenon, in part, the result of colonialism, in part, the result of the growth of the Rwandan state itself, which led to the creation of the groups we call now Tutsi and Hutu in a -- in the sense of groups that had political importance.  

The terms have existed for centuries, but they applied to individuals, not to groups.  So the sense of a group of Tutsi having an identity as Tutsi, or Hutu having an identity as Hutu is a 20th century phenomenon in that sense.  

The third part of the Rwanda population, the Twa, is quite different in their history because they were scorn by both Hutu and Tutsi over a period of centuries.  So their sense of being separate and a group apart, predates the colonial experience by considerable time.

But to move to the ultimate objective of the Prosecutor's question, what this then led to in terms of the Habyarimana state was, first of all, the pattern of a centralised, hierarchical, political structure which incorporated a very dynamic element of power relationships in a clientage sense that operated, sometimes within the state, sometimes parallel to the state.  And along with that, also, the importance of the military playing a role in civilian affairs.

And with Habyarimana's ascension to power, many of these same trends were accentuated, and the control of the state was pushed down to the level of ten households.  And this, indeed, represents a level of control, that in my experience, exists only in China, in terms of other examples in the world where you actually have a person responsible for every ten households and able to account to the next level of administration about what those people are doing.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  We have covered a lot of ground.  I would like to go over a few items with you individually.  I would like to begin with the inception of the colonial administration.  Can you give us a date for that, or a year?  Can we place it temporarily; when did colonialism start in that region of Africa? 
A.	The Germans arrived in 1897 and established a residency, as they called it, in Rwanda in 1900.  They would be replaced by the Belgians in 1916, at the end of the first world war. 
Q.	Now, you have described a process of identity formation between Tutsi and Hutu and Twa in relation to the state authority, but in most popular conceptions of those terms, there is a correspondence between the way people look and their ethnic identity.  Can you explain why that is or how does that, you know, sort of vulgar understanding of ethnicity combined with your more sophisticated analysis of political structures?
A.	There are times when I wish I had studied biology more carefully, because there are certain concepts having to do with gene pools and combinations of physical characteristics that I'm not able to describe with any degree of mastery.  

But we do know that the population of Rwanda is a combination of groups of people who came, ordinarily in small numbers, from a variety of different locations.  And each one of those groups of people had its own gene pool, which then was reflected in certain physical characteristics.  There was considerable intermarriage between groups over a period of centuries, but the ultimate shape of the population was such that you had a group of people, generally identified as Tutsi, who looked one way and a group of Hutus, who generally looked another.  But it is important to stress that there were variations.  In the same way that if you take, say, a European and someone says what does a European look like?  Well, some people might think of a Scandinavian person and some people might think of a Sicilian person.  And they would look different in people's imagination.  But it is possible to have Sicilians who are blond and have blue eyes, in the same way that it is possible to have Scandinavians who are dark haired and dark eyed.  

So the identity between our image of physical type and the person sometimes doesn't fit for one reason or another.  But the type of Tutsi being tall, slender, narrow features, of Hutu being shorter, stockier, was the general image that people carried.  But there certainly are Hutu, for example, who come from north western Rwanda who are quite tall; and there are other Hutu who come from southern Rwanda who are quite short, so the variation of physical types does not always conform.  And this is all the more the case because the affiliation of groups was passed on in the male line; but because of cases of intermarriage, you might have someone who looked more like his mother, say someone who looked like his mother if the mother were Hutu, according to that stereotypical image, yet his legal category would be Tutsi.  And there were people killed in the genocide, for example, because their identity card said Tutsi even though, in fact, they looked Hutu.  And, conversely, there were people whose identity papers said Hutu, and who were killed anyway because the killer believed them to be Tutsi with false papers, because their physical resemblance conformed to that stereotype of what Tutsi looked like.  So, there is no easy way to explain how this complicated biological and physical characteristics came about.  We are not really sure.  But we do know that there is stereotype of what these people looked like that is the result of long, historical developments. 
Q.	Thank you.  And can you explain to us if there is any difference culturally between the people we tend to identity as Tutsi and those we identity today as Hutu, and whether there are any linguistic differences between those two ethnic groups?
A.	Hutu and Tutsi speak the same language, and generally share the same culture, in the sense of the -- that is in the pre-colonial period, the same religious conceptions, the same conceptions about the organisation of the universe and so on.  The primary difference being that the Tutsi were more generally association with cattle raising, the Hutu more generally associated with cultivation.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
At a convenient time, it may be time for a break. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is fine, Your Honour.  We can start up again whenever the Court tells us.  I assume it is               15 minutes, or 20 minutes?
MR. PRESIDENT:
About 15 minutes.  We will take a short break -- short afternoon break, Madam Witness, and we will resume in about 15 minutes' time.

(Court resumed at 1622H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can resume now, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I believe when we left off we were talking about culture, and I simply recall you were saying that between Hutu, Tutsi and Twa, they share the same culture and they share the same language.  
A.	Yes, that is true, but if you add the Twa to the grouping, there were some differences of language that was specific to the Twa.  So they were part of the general Rwandan culture, but they had a sub-set, shall we say, both in linguistic terms and in terms of life style that set them apart. 
Q.	Well, can we speak about -- I mean, is it an accurate, fair way of talking -- to talk about original inhabitants of the region of Rwanda or what would you make of that as a proposition?  Can we talk about the original inhabitants -- in some of the speeches that we will look at later on, there is mention of sending the Tutsi back to Abyssinia.  Maybe you could explore that for us and talk about who are the original Rwandans?  
A.	As best we know, the original Rwandans were the Twa.  It seems that given the population patterns for all of East Africa, the groups like the Twa were the earliest people found in this region and in a crescent stretching down through Southern Africa.  The arrival of groups of cultivators and groups of pasturalists is much harder to delineate because people came by relatively small groups and then overlapping ways, so that there is no way in which you can say that Tutsis came after Hutu, who came after Twa, which was, in fact, the general statement and a misstatement of historical fact for a very long time -- the one that I grew up with as well.  

	But we have since learnt that that is not the case, and, indeed, if you look even at the written records for the early colonial period, you will see that people are still moving into Rwanda and that some of the people moving into Rwanda are cultivators who would be called Hutu and other people moving into Rwanda at that point are pasturalists, who would today be called Tutsi.  So there is no easy way to say who was here first, Hutu or Twa, but because of the gloss of European colonial thinking, the presumption became that the Tutsi had arrived last and had arrived as a conquering military group who had subjugated the Hutu, and because if you are arriving -- you have to arrive from somewhere, the place they were said to arrive from was northeastern Africa.  Sometimes this was said to be Somalia or Ethiopia, sometimes it was said to be Egypt.  

	The notion that Tutsi came from outside was an idea that Tutsi themselves took up and espoused because it was yet another way to emphasise their distinctive and supposedly superior nature.  This was turned on its head after the revolution of 1959 when they lost power.  And when that idea of people who came from the outside became instead an accusation, instead of a credential of worthiness, and thus it was that in the period leading up to the genocide, the idea became consciously propagated by some agents of the administration that Tutsi had no right to be in Rwanda, and that they should, in fact, be expelled and sent back where they came from which was, again, generally identified with the area of northeastern Africa.  And if you read documents of this period carefully, you will find in a number of cases the term "the Rwandans" or "the population" used in a way equivalent to the Hutu, meaning that Tutsi are not really Rwandans; they don't really belong in Rwanda.  
Q.	Now, we started our substance of discussion within Rwanda, and what I am wondering is, do the borders that we currently identify with mark Rwanda as a modern state?  Approximate pre-colonial borders of the state structure that you began this discussion with and what is the relationship between those two?  And if you could also mention what the relationship between Rwanda and Burundi is, because we tend to speak of those two countries with a single breath.  How do you distinguish between the two and how do you make sense of the political borders that we know today as Rwanda and Burundi?  
A.	The Rwandan state was an expanding state at the time when Europeans arrived.  It was one of the most powerful of a cluster of states in this region and it was engaged in frequent warfare with states to the north, in what today is Uganda or states to the east, or states to the south, which included what is today known as Burundi.  

	In a rough sense, the present-day borders of Rwanda coincide with the recognisable kingdom of Rwanda as it existed in 1900.  But as I mentioned earlier this afternoon, there were some areas of the northwest that were not tightly controlled by the court and a few pockets in the southwest also that were not tightly controlled by the court, until the colonial power came along and gave them the additional resources to, in fact, impose a more uniform kind of rule.  But, in a general sense, you can say that present day Rwanda is roughly equivalent to the Rwanda of 1900 or say the Rwanda of 1890 to predate any European arrival.  

	The relationship between Rwanda and Burundi, despite the similarity and demographics between the two countries, has been until the twentieth century a relationship of general hostility.  They regarded each other as rival states and engaged in frequent warfare.  So it was, in a sense, ironic that when the colonial regime was established -- that is, the Belgians grouped them together and made them a single trust territory, called Rwanda-Rundi 
Q.	Now, when you talked about their similar demographics, I assume you are talking about the relationship between the population -- the group we identify as Tutsi and the group we identify as Hutu.  
A.	That is correct.  The proportions of population are approximately the same.  
Q.	And could you tell us what those are please, as you understand them?
A.	Well, if we are speaking of the present day, the population of Tutsi would be generally in the vicinity of 10 percent to 12 percent in both countries.  The percentage of Twa in Rwanda is very small.  I think they are now only 30,000 Twa.  In Burundi it would be slight larger, perhaps as much as 1 percent of the population, and the remaining part of the population -- that is, more than 85 percent in both countries, would be what are classified as Hutu. 
Q.	And linguistically, the general distinction that you would make between Burundi and Rwanda.  
A.	Linguists differ on the issue of whether they represent two different but very closely related languages, or whether they are in fact a single language with dialectical variations.  In any case, the similarity is closer, say than between Italian and French, I would say because a speaker of Kinyarwanda can ordinarily make himself understood quite easily in Burundi.  
Q.	Now, Dr. Des Forges, in -- I am still trying to understand the difference, I am trying to elicit from you if there was a difference in Rwanda from other regions in Africa that are in the process of decolonisation.  I think it would be fair to say that in some of the West African states, for example, there was an anti-colonial movement that grouped large -- they brought masses of the population against the European coloniser.  Whereas in Rwanda, I get the impression that something quite different happened.  If that's so, can you explain it to us, please?  
A.	That is correct.  The pattern in Rwanda was exceptional because the earliest anti-colonial sentiment was among the elite, those who would have the advantage of education; those were part of the colonial administration, that is to say, the Tutsi.  While the larger part of the population who had had less opportunity for education and whose leaders had been educated largely in church seminaries, tended to be -- tended to continue a closer relationship with the colonial power.  

	So the majority of the population was not distinctly anti-colonial; it was the elite that was anti-colonial, and at the time of the 1959 revolution and the subsequent end of the colonial period, it was the Tutsi who wanted the Belgians to go home, and it was the Hutu who wanted them to stay, in rough terms, because the Hutu recognised that the power in balance was such that an end to the colonial period, without some redressing of that balance, would leave them at a serious disadvantage, so they were ready to continue colonial administration for a somewhat longer period of time in order to allow themselves to obtain greater education and greater access to posts within the administration before the colonial power actually left.  And partly because the Hutu proved to be more willing to allow continued Belgian presence, the Belgians then shifted their backing from the Tutsi elite, which had been their favoured proxy to the Hutu.

	So that you had a situation where as independence approached, the Hutu majority became identified or was able to benefit from greater support from the Belgians, so that when the first incidents of violence took place in 1959 and the Belgians called out the troops, they called out the troops basically to support the Hutu side not the Tutsi side.  So that the revolution which eventually, of course, in historical mythology becomes for the Hutu, a grand and noble revolution was, in fact, not so grand and noble because it was, in fact, an assisted revolution, where the Belgians assisted the Hutu in arresting a larger portion of control from the Tutsi.  
Q.	You have used this term several times as the social revolution or the revolution of 1959.  Could you elaborate on that a bit and explain to someone who is not familiar with the history what you mean by that and how it is configured in Rwandan history?
A.	Again, there has become a mythic version of the 1959 revolution which has exaggerated and idealised the role of the Hutu leadership at that point.  In fact, what happened was relatively small scale.  There was an initial skirmish where a Hutu sub-chief, who had been installed in the administration by the Belgians was insulted and slapped by some Tutsi.  This then led to violence against Tutsi and to Belgian intervention after a period of some restrained violence.  

	It was not tens of thousands of people we are talking about.  It was more like hundreds or perhaps a thousand people, although there was more widespread property damage than there was loss of life.  But as a result of that, the Belgians made a drastic change in the colonial administration and replaced approximately half of the sub-chiefs and chiefs with people who were Hutu as opposed to Tutsi.  This then facilitated the development of a Hutu political leadership who were able to declare an end to the monarchy and to basically drive away the Tutsi power holders and their immediate clientele, which included sometimes Hutu and Twa, as well as Tutsi.  And once having made that change to a republican system, it was the Hutu who took over the positions of power in the new administration.  

	It was not a revolution in the sense of the change in patterns of political power, because the patterns of political power and, indeed, the structures remained very much the same except for the overturning of the monarchy.  What changed was the nature of the power holders who became Hutu instead of Tutsi.  So it was a change within the system without fundamentally changing the system.  It was a reversal of the pyramids, so to speak.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us how Rwanda exceeded to political independence?  What political party came to the fore and who were the leadership that took Rwanda through the process of political independence?  
A.	I -- towards the end of the colonial period, there were four political parties that formed, two of them were multi-ethnic in a general sense; one was identified virtually exclusively with Tutsi and one identified virtually exclusively with Hutu.  That identified with the Hutu was the Parmehutu party, whose leader was Gregoir Kayibanda, and it was that party which took the fore and which one -- which swept the first round of elections and took over after independence and gradually expanded its control in such a way that it became, in fact, a single party state, eliminating the other contenders.  

	During this period, the attempt to make a multi-party coalition work, that is, to make parties that were multi-ethnic function in that situation, collapsed and the polarisation -- the political polarisation between Hutu and Tutsi political parties became quite sharp.  
Q.	Thank you.  What year did Rwanda become politically independent, do you recall?
A.	It became independent in 1962.  The period immediately after independence, I should also draw some attention to because it was during this period that the violence against Tutsis, which had initially been relatively limited to power holders and their immediate circle, but after the period of independence, particularly in the period 1963 to 1967, the circle of violence widened.  And it widened in part because the Tutsi who had fled the country in the company of the king organised a series of reprisals of raids against Rwanda in an attempt to regain political power.  

	As they did so, this then provoked further killings and attacks against Tutsi within the country so that the greatest period of bloodshed between Hutu and Tutsi was not 1959, the year that's remembered as the year of the revolution, but rather in the period after 1962 and going up to 1967, when as a result of the Tutsi raids into Rwanda, there were reprisal killings within the country of Tutsi, and these killings, as I say, widened the circle of people attacked.  In part, this was because local power holders who were Hutu found it to their advantage to use the Tutsi attacks from outside as a way to increase their local power.  They were having a hard time making their authority recognised locally and to the extent that powerful Tutsi could be attacked and driven away.  To that extent they became more powerful and particularly because in driving people away their lands became vacant, and that land then went into the control of the local political authority who could distribute it.  

	So there was a phrase that became important during the genocide period.  It was a phrase "The gains of the revolution", and that should be understood not just in the sense of political gains; that this was a time in which Hutu acquired control over the political process, but real material concrete things, particularly for ordinary people in the sense that they got more land.  And this is an agricultural country, heavily populated, the most densely populated in Africa where there was never enough land.  And during this period the gains of the revolution served to temporarily assuage the thirst for more land on the part of the vast number of Hutu farmers.  

	So in that sense, that period after 1960s was very important because, first of all, it established the pattern of a Tutsi attack from outside resulting in reprisals within the country against Tutsi civilians who, in all likelihood, had nothing to do with the attack.  This then results in the increased availability of both wealth and power for local Hutu authorities who can then increase their own power base through the distribution of these benefits that they have acquired.  

And a final element that was characteristic also of the later period was the use of central government officials, particularly ministers, who went down to the local base, returned to their home regions to incite violence against Tutsi.  
Q.	Now, there are a couple of words that generate a great deal of passionate debate, and it is all in the context of -- it arises in the context of this cross-border raids.  And one of those words that come to mind for me is Inyenzi and the other is Inkotanyi.  Can you explain how those words arose in the context of these raids and what they came to mean after 1990?  
A.	Inyenzi is literally cockroach, and according to a number of sources, was a term originally used by some of the Tutsi militia groups themselves that launched raids against the country in the 1960s.  So, in other words, it was a term that they adopted to describe their own actions.  

Inkotanyi is purportedly a name of a military unit known at the time of Rwabugiri, who was -- that's R-W-A-B-U-G-I-R-I, who was the king at the end of the nineteenth century, who brought Rwanda to its greatest territorial extent.  I, myself, have never been able to find a military unit named Inkotanyi, but many people assert that there was such a unit.  

After 1990, the term "Inyenzi" became a term of reproach of a programme directed against Tutsi in general, as well as against combatants of the RPF.  At that time, that is after 1990, the RPF did not refer to itself as Inyenzi, but as Inkotanyi, which was a far more distinguished kind of title.  But the distinction became important and there is even one notable propaganda speech which we may touch on later by Leon Mugasera in November 1992, in which he said, "Do not call these people Inkotanyi; they are Inyenzi."  So that interpolates the difference here between the early usage of the term and the later usage.  And after 1990, it becomes a term of criticism and indeed of scorn, referring back to the origin of the term -- that is, the insect nature or the sub-human nature of the people referred to by that term.  
Q.	I would like to move on now to the discussion of Juvénal Habyarimana's rise to power.  You had mentioned two periods of reprisals against the Tutsi in 1959 and 1963 to '67.  I believe there was a third period in the early 70's.  Maybe you could address that and then tell us how Juvénal Habyarimana came to power.  
A.	The original 1959 revolution involved two regional centres of Hutu political activity, one in the northwest, in Ruhengeri, and one in the central part of Rwanda, in Gitarama.  And it was the combination of these two centres that helped to make the political changes possible.  But Rwanda being a poor place and the state being a small pie, the different actors who had perhaps originally expected to share in the pie -- in equal parts, were in the -- out and the group from the north became increasingly disaffected from the group in the centre.

So a regionial split developed within the group of Hutu, where the Hutu of the north reproached those of the south, for basically taking all of the -- the wealth for its own benefit.

In that context of regional rivalry, it's important to note that the north-west was also much more the base of people with military power, whereas the south or the centre part was dominated by people who had access to administrative and political positions. 

The -- there was violence -- massive violence against Hutu in Burundi in 1972, which led to the outpouring of a lot of Hutu refugees into Rwanda, and at the end of 1972 and early 1973, there was an increase in tension between Hutu and Tutsi within Rwanda. 

It appears that in that regional confrontation between two Hutu groups, the north-west and the centre, that one or the other of those groups displaced their struggle onto the backs of the Tutsi. 
In other words, instead of dealing openly with the rivalry between Hutu, they sought to refocus all of their hostility against the Tutsi and to argue, "In fact, it's not that we, in the south are taking too much of the pie, but that, in fact, the Tutsi remain still too wealthy and still too powerful." 

It's unclear at this point whether it was the northerners who initiated the strategy of making the Hutu -- the Tutsi the scapegoat, or the people in the centre.  Although now it seems more likely that it was the northerners who initiated that.  

Whatever the trigger was, there was a period of harassment, persecution and, in some few cases, violence.  This was not a case of thousands of people being killed, it was a case of hundreds of people being killed, but of thousands being displaced from their jobs, and their places in school.  And this period of anti-Tutsi activity led to the outflow of a new refugee generation who went to swell the ranks outside the country and also provided the context in which Habyarimana could ride in on his white horse and claim to be -- figuratively, of course, because people don't ride horses in Rwanda -- but ride in as the saviour of the country and proclaim himself the person who would restore order.  

With the help of a number of military officers, he then executed a military coup and took power as the head of state in July of 1973, saying that he had come to restore order and to end violence against the Tutsi.  And this, I think, is suggestive of one possible set of political forces that might also have been operational in 1994.  

In other words, that by creating violence against Tutsi, one opened the door to the possibility of a military takeover and an assertion of power by people coming -- claiming to come to restore order.  We don't know that, but that is, indeed, a possible explanation for some of the events of 1994.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, I believe you said that the Parmehutu was the party of Kayibanda.  Juvenal Habyarimana, when he took power in 1973, would have introduced another political power.  Can you tell us what that is, and when the second republic was born and what form it took and if it was any different from the government that it replaced? 
A.	The state that Habyarimana established or the regime that he established resembled that of Kayibanda in many ways.  After an initial period of military rule, he created a political party which became known as the MRND:  The National -- National Democratic Revolution of -- the National Democratic Movement, right, the MRND -- the National Democratic Revolutionary Movement which, in fact, became a single party.  That was even more than a single party, because it proclaimed itself a movement which all Rwandans had to belong simply by the fact of being born Rwandan. 

So it was not a political party in the more limited sense of an organisation that one could choose to join or not join.  Everyone was part of the MRND and the MRND enjoyed a -- what should we say, a Siamese-twin kind of relationship with the -- with the state in such a way that Habyarimana, who was the head of the state, was also head of the party and at each level down in the administrative hierarchy, the local administrative official, for example, the préfet, the head of the préfecture was also the head of the local MRND structure and this was true all the way down to the lowest level of organisation.  

As I mentioned earlier, it was also Habyarimana who created the post of nyumba kumi or the person responsible for 10 households, and thereby carried the -- the control into even a lower level. 

It was also true, by the way, in salaried positions that people who worked in enterprises or who worked in government offices also were part of a MRND-structure, so that the head of a company, for example, was the head of the MRND unit that mirrored that company. 
Q.	Two other terms that come to mind -- that usually come to the surface when we discuss the MRND party-state, one of them is animation -- animation and the other is umuganda.  Can you explain what they are and how they worked in the context of the MRND-party state? 
A.	The party state had essentially two objectives.  One was control and the other was mobilization, and the mobilisation was for the purpose of economic development and the -- as well as for the glorification of the head of state. 

In that context, umuganda, U-M-U-G-A-N-D-A, was instituted as a form of communal labour, unpaid for the benefit supposedly of local communities or the nation -- building roads or repairing schools, constructing clinics.  And everyone, in principle, was required to do umuganda once a week. 

There were also sessions of what was called animation, which we could probably translate best as propaganda meetings, where people would come together to praise the head of state, to rival each other in dance, song and poetry, all of it to glorify the MRND and President Habyarimana. Yeah. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, sir.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	How did that mobilise the population? 
A.	Well, the structure of the party combined with the structure of the administration meant that basically all aspects of the movement and resonance of citizens could be and, in fact, was tracked.  

One of the remarkable features of the Habyarimana regime was that the bourgmestre -- the local administration officer -- and there was about 145 of them in Rwanda at the time of 1994 -- the bourgmestre was required to submit a report every three months on the population of his commune, which detailed births, deaths, movement into the commune, people who moved into to live there and people who left there to live elsewhere.  And these statistics were broken down by age, sex and ethnic group. 
So that it was, in fact, possible at the national level -- because all of these were submitted up the chain as far as the ministry of interior -- it was possible at the national level to know, for example, how many 7-year-old Tutsi girls were in a given commune, at the end of -- at the end of March 1994.

Anyone who came into a commune for other than a brief visit was supposed to be reported to the authorities.  So that there was a remarkable extent of control over localising people, knowing who they were, knowing where they were.  And in addition to this, of course, the measure requiring all adults to carry identity cards meant that there was an additional way of ensuring that the administration could know where people were. 

In terms of the mobilisation of the population, the nyumba kumi the person at the level of the 
10 households, basically kept attendance on who attended umuganda and who didn't or who came to the animation sessions and who didn't, so that the means of exerting pressure on the entire population through fines, through public criticism, or alternatively through rewards was very considerable. 
Q.	Thank you.  Well, was there any -- was there ever any political resistance to the system?  What you described seems pretty oppressive.  Was there any domestic political opposition to Habyarimana and could you describe its contours as to how it -- how it developed? 
A.	If we look at the historical context of the years -- the first years of Habyarimana's rule -- that is, the 1970s and the early 1980s, it was a period when the single-party state was not unusual in the African context or, indeed, in a number of other contexts.  And where the focus was more on economic development, the idea being that the state that can provide for its citizens can leave political dissent or open political activity to a later stage of its national life.  Because Habyarimana was, in fact, remarkably successful in the first years -- in the first decade and even the first decade and a half of his rule in providing for an expanding national economy, there was relatively little open dissent from -- from his increasing control.  

But towards the end of the 1980s, there were several changes.  First of all, in terms of the context of the general atmosphere throughout Africa, in many places the single-party state was being contested with increasing vigor by various groups within societies.  

At the same time, donor nations were beginning to believe that to encourage economic development without encouraging political change was essentially not productive and so you saw an increasing tendency on the part of donor nations to encourage the development of more open political systems.  And at the same time, within Rwanda itself, you had a downturn in the economy.  The result, in part, of market forces, particularly the fall in the price of coffee, which was the main export crop, but also a decline in the price of tea, which was another major export crop. 

This being a country that had no resources, really, where agriculture was the primary sustainer of life for  90 percent of the population, and where these export crops provided the little bit of money needed for school fees, for medical care, for -- for small expenses. 

With the decline in the economy, the stagnation in the economy, at the same time you had increasing publicity about corruption within the governing circle.  For a long time, it had been the case that Habyarimana and his immediate cohort of supporters had got the lion's share of benefits.  But as long as the pie was continuing to expand, that was not such a major issue.  

But when poverty became more -- a more pressing issue, when economic -- when the economic decline became more -- more sharp, then that wealth of that little circle became a more visible target for other -- other political actors in the system, who began to ask questions about why it was that this small group was getting so rich while everyone else was getting increasingly poor. 

And as I say, it was in a context where in other parts of Africa as well, there were contestations being raised -- protestations being raised about single-party rule.  And so the Rwandan political effervescence within the country was encouraged by and fed off of similar kinds of developments in other parts of Africa and the encouragement of donors. 
Q.	Thank you.  Well, 1990 seems to have been a pivotal year for Rwanda's political evolution.  Is there a reason for that and perhaps you can use that as a benchmark for talking about the developments between 1990 and 1994.  
A.	1990 was a turning point in two regards.  First of all, because at -- it was in that year when it became increasingly clear that the single-party state was going to have to give way to a more open political system.  Initially, Habyarimana thought this could be postponed perhaps for a year or two, but the essential concession was made in July 1990 with the establishment of a commission -- a national commission to investigate the possibility of a more open political system.  

The second turning point in 1990, of course, was the RPF invasion of October 1st, which -- 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if I could interrupt you for one second. The interpreters and the court reporters are having a hard time in keeping up.  So maybe we can just take it a little bit slower. 
A.	The second turning point in 1990 was the RPF invasion of October 1st, which was perceived, it seems, by Habyarimana as both a risk and an opportunity, but more opportunity than risk in the early stages. 

The RPF was a political military organisation composed largely, but not exclusively, of Tutsi refugees. The Hutu component is important to note because the leader of the Hutu adherence of the RPF was a Rwandan military officer named Kanyanrengwe, K-A-N-Y-A-N-R-E-N-G-W-E (sic).

Colonel Kanyanrengwe had been a rival of Habyarimana's and had been forced to flee the country in 1980 because he expected to be accused of plotting a coup against Habyarimana.  He subsequently joined the RPF and became its president. 

So in the eyes of Habyarimana, the RPF represented a risk in part because it was, of course, a military organisation that had crossed its borders and had begun combat.  But also because it had in its ranks an important Hutu-Rwandan military officer who was thought to be still popular among a significant number of other Hutu military officers from his home region of Ruhengeri.  

And here, we won't get into the details of it, but there is a general block of north-western Rwanda, which is identified as a stronghold of Hutu political and military power, but within that block, there were important rivalries between Gisenyi -- Habyarimana's place of origin and Ruhengeri.  And Kanyanrengwe was part of the Ruhengeri crowd. 

So when these guys came cross the border and Habyarimana understood that his old-arch rival, Kanyanrengwe, was part of that group, this caused him probably more concern than the Tutsi nature of that force.  Particularly, because there is a fear that some Hutu military officers could go over to the RPF and follow Kanyanrengwe, but also there was a fear that the growing political opposition within the country, which was predominantly a Hutu political opposition, could choose to associate with Kanyanrengwe and through him, with the RPF.  
And, indeed, there is a document from January 1991 where the préfets of Rwanda meet and come to the conclusion that the Kanyanrengwe effect, as they call it, is, in fact, a major threat to Habyarimana's power and one that must be actively combatted. 

So if we tried to understand what was the reaction of Habyarimana to this invasion, I think we have to understand it as, yes, a military invasion led by many Tutsi, but also as a potential political threat in terms of drawing off even more dissatisfied Hutu away from his base of power. 

In those circumstances, to increase his base of power among Hutu, to solidify -- to stop the erosion and to solidify his hold, it made good sense for him to depict the enemy in ethnic terms, because by doing so, by saying "These people who have attacked us are Tutsi", the Tutsi being associated with the monarchy, with oppressive rule, any Hutu who thought he might go to that side would find himself in a difficult position because he would then be seen as supporting those ethnic -- that ethnic element  that wanted to come back to undermine the famous gains of the revolution and to restore the ethnic power of the Tutsi. 

So from the very early days of the invasion, Habyarimana and people around him focussed upon the Tutsi nature of the RPF and the specific threat that Tutsi wanted to restore the monarchy.   And there was even a demonstration organised in Butare very soon after the start of this invasion, where people paraded with placards saying, "No more monarchy", "Down with the royal drum" and a number of other phrases indicating that they certainly identified this RPF -- not as a new force aiming to create who knows what kind of purported multi-ethnic government, but rather as a purely Tutsi ethnic force that was going to restore the monarchy, undo the gains of the revolution, and the gains the revolution meant not just that they would lose political power to the Tutsi, but that they would lose that land that they were living on. 

So that this became a strategy adopted very early on by Habyarimana and the group around him to try to counter the erosion of his own base among Hutu by depicting the enemy as necessarily Tutsi or identified with Tutsi-power interests. 
Q.	Thank you.  Tell us how successful was that first military campaign, the one you described taking place or starting on the 1st of October 1990?  In military terms, how successful was it? 
A.	It was a failure.  And, I think this also was obviously part of Habyarimana's calculation.  He was quite sure it would be a failure because he knew he had allies who would come to his defence and they did.  And those allies were France, Belgium and Zaire.  

Now, Belgium and Zaire soon withdrew from the scene, but France stayed there and became the important military bulwark for Habyarimana until January 1993 -- actually, February 1993.  And, as we'll see a bit later on, it was the extraordinary military success of the RPF and their advance of 
February 1993 that persuaded the French that this was a losing game and that they could not sustain Habyarimana without a continuing and serious French military presence.  

And because of internal French domestic politics at that point, that was simply no longer in the cards and that then left Habyarimana sufficiently weakened.  That, along with other considerations, financial -- international financial considerations, he was forced into agreeing to the Arusha Accords.  

But from the first invasion until February or March 1993, he knew he had the support of the French and that gave him a margin of security in manoeuvring to meet the RPF threat. 
Q.	All right.  Well, if the first invasion was a military failure from the RPF perspective, when did things start to change?  I mean, how many invasions were there before we get to 1994? 
A.	The history of the war is like any war -- complicated and probably not something we want to go into in great detail.  Suffice it to say that after this initial defeat the RPF changed tactics and moved from a classic military posture into becoming a guerilla force.  And that happened in the early months of 1991.  And except for their attempt to take over Ruhengeri, the town of Ruhengeri, which they did briefly for one day in January 1991, they more or less resorted to a series of raids and attacks of -- from 1991 until June of 1992, when they made their first major substantial territorial gain in north-eastern Rwanda and caused the forced displacement of several hundred thousand people. 

They made a second major military advance, as I mentioned, in February of 1993.  So it was a kind of forward and back sort of process in terms both of combat and in terms of the peace negotiations.  Because from the first weeks after the invasion, there were various peace negotiations, ceasefires made, ceasefires broken until the final conclusion of the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	So what was happening domestically politically during this period?  If we start again in October 1990, presumably the Habyarimana regime reacted militarily towards the RPF in the north.  But what was going on in the domestic political situation within the country at around the same time? 
A.	As I said, the -- by July of 1990, even before the RPF attack, Habyarimana had more or less conceded the need to open up the political system to some extent.  

By 1991 -- by June of 1991, this readiness to open up the system led to a new constitution and to the official acceptance of multi-party -- of a multi-party state.  

So beginning in June 1991 various groups of political opponents of the MRND organised into a series of 16 political parties, only three of which, I think, we need to pay attention to here, one being the MDR, which drew upon the heritage of the Parmehutu.  So in other words, this was a predominantly Hutu party, based largely in the central part of the country in Gitarama.  And it was, in fact, the major rival to Habyarimana's party.  

A less important party was the PSD, limited in its importance, in part, because it never really grew out of its southern base in Butare.  So it was more of a regional party.  Also a party that drew support from a certain number of intellectuals, teachers, people associated with the administration, lawyers, judges also.  

And then, the Liberal party, which had an even smaller constituency, but one identified largely with urban areas, particularly Kigali and Butare-town and which drew mainly from commercial and sort of free-enterprise kinds of business-thinking people, many of whom happened to be Tutsi.   So the Liberal party was the one who had more Tutsi members than other parties. 

Once their structures became legal -- in other words, once they were able to organise legally, they did so and began to turn people out for demonstrations in the streets.  And having that additional leverage of being able to cause popular protests, they forced Habyarimana eventually to agree to the creation of a coalition government. 

The first coalition government we can put to one side, because it was not a real coalition, in any sense.  The most important step came in April of 1992, when you got the first real multi-party government.  

This had several immediate consequences.  One, because these other parties now had a seat at the table of the government, they were able to force Habyarimana -- and this was another pressure upon him, in addition to the pressure that would become important from the French, they were able to push Habyarimana into the direction of more serious negotiations with the RPF. 

The second important consequence of their joining the government was that they got a share of the pie and they were able to redistribute, for example, the positions of préfet or governor and redistribute a certain number of ministries among their adherence.  

So the state continues to be the source of wealth and power.  Private enterprise being very insignificant in the national scene, but for the first time, really, since independence, other parties are able to open the door to those resources in an effective way.  So that gave them increased leverage and benefits and rewards to distribute to people who could join them. 

They used this leverage to push their organisational efforts further down the scale towards the communes and the local-level control, which everyone knew was the sine qua non to winning elections.  
The important thing was to control the communes, because he who controls the communes controls the vote.  Why?  Because the bourgmestre is the most important figure in terms of the lives of most people.  For one thing, he controls land.

1715H
THE WITNESS:(continuing) 
So this becomes a very important issue in that rivalry, in that period of rivalry -- and we are talking here of 1992 and 1993 in particular.  There was a very negative development in the sense that political parties also developed the pattern of using violence against each other in order to increase their political base.  So they would use intimidation or outright attacks against members of other political parties in order to increase their own hold over a region.  And during that period, there were approximately 200 people killed in these contests between political party actors.  

And who were the political party actors?  They were militia, including the militia that becomes best known at the time of the genocide, the Interahamwe, that was associated which the MRND.  But it was not the first and it was certainly not the only party militia because the other political parties also had their groups of young people who attacked rivals or who defended the adherence of their own parties. 

The Interahamwe were the most powerful because, first of all, they were associated with the most powerful political party, the MRND; and, second, because the majority of military officers were sympathetic to the MRND and therefore assisted the militia, sometimes on their own, sometimes at direction by their commanding officers, assisted the Interahamwe by giving them military training and eventually by providing them with arms.  

Under the multiparty regime, military officers were not supposed to be members of political parties, but, in fact, they had -- each one had his own loyalties, and many were loyal to the MRND.  But also as a consequence of multiparty activity, some military officers began to affiliate with the other parties and this became a major cause of concern for Habyarimana and the MRND because they saw fissures, splits and divisions in that military structure which they had always relied upon, and now they were finding they could not relying upon it to the same extent because there were some military officers who were pro-MDR, others who were pro-PSD, a few who were pro-PL.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Right.  You've been talking a bit about the political conflicts and you've even mentioned political violence.  But earlier on, you had mentioned that there were attacks against the Tutsis in the early 1990s. Can you tell us about those, and what were those causedly connected to, I mean, why were these attacks against the Tutsis taking place?  Tell us what they are, where they occurred, when they occurred and what provoked them.  
A.	As I mentioned, the incentive for identifying the RPF as the enemy in ethnic terms had to do with the internal political dynamics of Rwanda at that time, so that immediately after the RPF invasion, authorities incited the first attack on Tutsi civilians.  That was in mid-October 1990.  Approximately 
	300 people were killed at a placed called Kibilira, K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A. There then followed 15 further case of attacks, either exclusively against Tutsi or against Tutsi and members of the political opposition, which took place between 1990, October, and the beginning of the April 1994 genocide.  There were repeated attacks in Kibilira; there were repeated attacks in the northwest against a subgroup of Tutsis known as the Bagogwe, B-A-G-O-G-W-E -- excuse me, I was going to sneeze. 

There were -- there was very serious attack in a place called Bugesera, southeast of the capital Kigali, in March 1992.  There were attacks in Kibuye in 1993, and each of these attacks had certain elements that resembled each other in such a way that it looked like a pattern.  First of all, the attack took place at a time when the national government was threatened, either militarily or politically.  Second, it involved preparation of the population by the spreading of rumour and propaganda, which created a sense of vulnerability on the part of the population and persuaded them that they needed to act to protect themselves, that there was an element of self-defence.  

Thirdly, that it was local authorities who incited and organised the attacks, either civilian administrators or political leaders.  Fourthly, that the objects of attack were predominantly Tutsis, and in many of the attacks, exclusively Tutsi.  Fifthly, that the consequences of the attacks were no punishment for the assailants, even though in some cases the attacks elicited considerable international disapproval.  And those elements were repeated in each of the series of 16 events between October and April 1994.  And those elements are found in the genocide itself that begins on April 6th. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, did you see any relationship -- or was there any relationship between the political opposition and the RPF, how did they relate one to the other during this period? 
A.	As I mentioned, as early as January 1991, we have documentary evidence showing that Habyarimana and his circle identified this as a real danger, the idea that the political opposition would unite with the RPF. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if I can ask you to slow down -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Try to moderate your responses a bit.  
A.	The initial public contact between political -- the opposition political party and the RPF began in early 1992 and resulted finally in a public meeting of the MDR, PSD and PL representatives, with the RPF, in May 1992.  But the situation is complicated because by that time, they were also members of the government.  So we speak of them loosely as opposition parties, but by that point they were not a classic opposition party because they were part of the government.  What they were was an opposition party in the sense of opposed to the MRND.  So there are -- they formed a -- a collaborative relationship with the RPF in May 1992, and were then instrumental, as I mentioned, in pushing the MRND and the Rwandan government as a whole, into the actual negotiations that became the 
	Arusha Accords.  

The group around Habyarimana was faced with a dilemma because in theory, they conceded the right to political organisation and said they were prepared to open up the political scene.  But, at the same time, they wanted to be able to stress that any of these members of opposing political parties who were willing to work with the RPF, were necessarily enemies of the nation.  And so they adopted a -- an ambiguous and double discourse in which on the one hand they would praise democracy and say of course, dissenting voices are legitimate, and on the other hand they would say opposition parties are basically assisting the RPF, the creation of a multiparty system has opened the way for an RPF takeover.  So it was a political game that was being played with considerable nuance on both sides as the various actors took positions in a dynamic situation.  

But throughout the period of the Arusha negotiations, what you had essentially was three centres of power.  You had Habyarimana and the people loyal to him, you had the political opposition inside the country which was a multi-ethnic opposition, but still who largely were Hutu just by the demographics of the situation, and then you had the RPF which also was predominantly Tutsi-led but which liked to make a great deal of its purportedly multi-ethnic nature.  

So you had three players on the scene throughout that period from April, May 1992, through the final date of the Arusha Accords, in August 1993, at which point the political scene begins to reorganise itself.  So that those three actors still constituting identifiable blocks in August 1993, are already beginning to dissolve, so that the structure of Arusha was built upon, since they were already starting to wash away.  And by October of 1993, those three power blocks had been reorganised into two, and the situation became dangerously bi-polar.  
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, you get a sense from the literature that's been produced about this point in history that the Habyarimana regime felt very threatened by the Arusha Accords.  If that's so, why is that?  What was the Arusha Accords doing that upset the balance so drastically for those that controlled the state previously? 
A.	The gradual loss of power, that is, of control over institutions, had begun for Habyarimana with his acceptance first of multi-partism and then with the coalition government because at that point the MRND had to share power with our political -- other political actors.  With Arusha -- with the Arusha Accords, the RPF also got its share of the pie, and the size that was left for Habyarimana was looking for thin indeed.  So that the Arusha Accords put the seal on the cession of his political power to other forces within Rwanda, as well as putting the seal on his cession of political power to the RPF.  So his complaint was not just that the RPF now was going to enter the government and take part of the power that used to be exclusively his and that of his party, but that other actors as well, by the Arusha Accords, had once again staged claim to what used to be his turf.  
This was true in an institutional sense because he and his party were left with only five ministries.  It was true in the sense that the government had become by that point a government incorporating a prime minister, instead of being exclusively presidential, and now here again the post of prime minister is -- enshrined in the Arusha Accords.  

It was true also in the sense that the army becomes an integrated army where the RPF has a very significant share, 40 percent of the total forces, and 50 percent of the positions of command down to the level of major.  

But at the same time, as well as these institutional concessions, there are also personal concessions being made, not just by Habyarimana, but by administrators and military officers who know that the terms of the Arusha Accord puts their jobs in danger.  So, senior military officers knew that the demobilisation was going to force their retirement, and men in the ranks knew that approximately half of the army was going to be demobilised.  It was an army that had grown very rapidly after October 1st, 1990.  It had originally had only about 7000, and by 1994 it was more than 30,000.  So in that brief period of time a lot of people had begun used to having a government paycheck or to having access to guns so that they could acquire whatever they wanted by waving the gun around, and those people were now being told, "You are going to give that up."  And what is your future in an economic situation which at that point was very, very bleak?  At the same time, the Arusha Accords provided that there was going to be a review of administrative personnel, so that very many ordinary administrators were facing a prospect that they were going to be reviewed out of their posts.  

So there were personal responses for resenting that arrangement, as well as whatever general political nationalist kinds of sentiments might have existed.  And at a further level, that of the ordinary person, the Arusha Accords left somewhat ambiguous the situation of refugees who would return.  In theory, it was only those who had been gone only ten years who could reclaim their lands for sure, but it was unclear what was going to happen to all of those other people who came back in terms of where they were going to be settled.  So that for ordinary people as well, for the ordinary cultivator, once again, you had the specter that his very survival could be put into existence -- could be put into question by the problem of would he have enough land to feed his family once those people return from the outside.  

So it was this that made the Arusha Accords an arrangement that was hardly welcomed at whatever level of the Habyarimana structure, but which also caused some serious concerns among other people.  And the eventual decision to pick the pen and sign what was an arrangement that he himself personally was not satisfied with, that decision was motivated, in part, by knowing the French were no longer going to back him, and if you're out there alone he knew his army could never face down the RPF.  And second of all, he was under such sever pressure in financial terms.  The cash drawer was empty, and the donors were saying, "Accept this, move towards peace or there would be no further international aids."  And under those circumstances, even knowing the extent the opposition within his own ranks, Habyarimana signed the accords. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we are past 5:30.  How much longer do you think you will be?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think I have at least another two hours, Your Honour, looking at the situation realistically.  I think I can finish by the middle of tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think in that case, I think we should take our normal break now and resume tomorrow morning.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will break now, Dr. Des Forges, and resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Before the court rises -- just one -- sorry to interrupt the rise.  I would ask, please, that Dr. Des Forges -- I think she knows that.  She -- she's had lots of experience here, but if she could be -- please be asked not to discuss her evidence with the Prosecution or with us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Dr. Des Forges, I'm certain you are familiar with the rules that even during the adjournments you remain a witness --
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- which requires that you discuss -- do not discuss the case with anyone. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was just slipped a note here which reminded me that we intend to -- that we will be able to file a decision on the will-say motion tomorrow.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Most grateful, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1740H)
