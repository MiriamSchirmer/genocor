         1                    disqualification of judges Laity Kama, 

         2                    Navanethem Pillay and William Sekule who 

         3                    were a part of the bench yesterday.  Even 

         4                    though the presiding judge was allowed, 

         5                    pursuant to Article 15, to enter on such 

         6                    motion and to decide on it's relevance, we 

         7                    decided yesterday, out of conscience, out 

         8                    over concern as being criticised as being 

         9                    player and referee and, again, in 

        10                    reference to Rule 15 (d) of the Rules of 

        11                    Procedure and Evidence to refer the motion 

        12                    for disqualification to the Bureau of the 

        13                    Tribunal. 

        14                    

        15                    I further wish to state that Madam Pillay, 

        16                    the president of the tribunal and myself, 

        17                    the presiding judge, are members of the 

        18                    Bureau, but then, for the same reasons, we 

        19                    decided to stand down and allow the other 

        20                    members of the Bureau to rule on the 

        21                    relevance of the motion.  They did so and 

        22                    they handed down a decision and I will ask 

        23                    the Registrar to read out the said 

        24                    decision. Registrar?

        11                    is now available on 18th of November -- is 

        12                    not available on 18th of November, 1999, 

        13                    to consider the motion in question due to

        23                    circumstances relied on by the Accused did 

        24                    not warrant their disqualification from

         1                    decided, out of an abundance of caution, 

         2                    and in the interest of justice to refer 

         3                    the matter to the Bureau for consideration 

         4                    pursuant to Rule 15(b). 

         5                    

         6                    This rule provides that the Bureau shall 

         7                    determine matters of this nature if it 

         8                    deems it necessary. 

         9                    

        10                    5.  Judge Kama and President Pillay 

        11                    elected to recuse themselves from the 

        12                    Bureau for the determination of this 

        13                    matter. 

        14                    

        15                    6.  On the disqualification of Judge Kama 

        16                    the Accused submitted inter alia that:

        18                    6.1. On 30th of June, 1998 Judge Kama 

        19                    ordered his transfer in the absence of 

        20                    reasonable and probable grounds that the 

        21                    said transfer was a matter of urgency as 

        22                    envisaged in Rule 40. 

        23                    

        24                    6.2.  On 10th of August, 1998, the Accused 

        25                    requested Judge Kama to declare his arrest

         2                    judge refused the said request. 

         3                    

         4                    6.3. Judge Kama extended the Accused's 

         5                    provisional detention in the absence of 

         6                    circumstances which warranted such 

         7                    extension. 

         8                    

         9                    6.4.  On 16th of July, 1998, Judge Kama 

        10                    did not observe the provisions of Rule 

        11                    62(ii) when the Accused made his first 

        12                    appearance in court. 

        13                    

        14                    7.  Under disqualification of Judge Sekule 

        15                    the Accused submitted inter alia that 

        16                    Judge Sekule denied him an opportunity to 

        17                    move his motion challenging the legality 

        18                    of his arrest and detention before 

        19                    entering a plea to the judges in the 

        20                    indictment.

        22                    Number 8. After having reviewed all the 

        23                    relevant documents, the Bureau finds that 

        24                    the claims of the Accused are unfounded 

        25                    and without merit and determine that:

         1     MR. ROACH:

         2                    Thank you.  Good morning to the panel.  

         3                    

         4                    Before proceeding further I should like to 

         5                    ask for an opportunity to have a review of 

         6                    the decision of the Bureau for the 

         7                    following reason: 

         8                    

         9                    Yesterday we served an application which 

        10                    was in the nature of a notice of a motion 

        11                    for the recusal of the panel. 

        12                    

        13                    What we did was simply to serve the notice 

        14                    of motion. 

        15                    

        16                    We had asked no intention to make our 

        17                    complete presentation in writing and would 

        18                    have expected, like this particular motion 

        19                    now, that we may be hearing, which is the 

        20                    substantive motion, we would follow with 

        21                    an oral argument. 

        22                    

        23                    I had indicated to my colleague, Mr. 

        24                    Webster, that it was my intention to have 

        25                    an oral motion and I was not aware that in

         1                    these kinds of matters one has no 

         2                    opportunity, if this is the case, to make 

         3                    a full representation and have one's case 

         4                    fully put, because the notice of motion 

         5                    was not the entire and complete submission 

         6                    that was intended to be made and, for 

         7                    example, although the Notice of Motion 

         8                    does comprehensively cover all of the 

         9                    issues that needed to be, that would have 

        10                    been raised, it does so only in an 

        11                    indicative form.

        12     MR. PRESIDENT:

        13                    Mr. Roach.

        14     MR. ROACH:

        15                    Yes.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:

        17                    Mr. Roach, the Tribunal is of the view 

        18                    that it serves no purpose continuing with 

        19                    those arguments. 

        20                    

        21                    You do recall yesterday you did agree that 

        22                    once disqualification was being sought we 

        23                    would no longer be in a position to listen 

        24                    to your arguments because you were seeking 

        25                    the disqualification of the bench.  I did

         1                    say, also, that for reasons of integrity 

         2                    we felt that this matter should be 

         3                    referred to the Bureau.  You made no 

         4                    comment, it's not the first time that we 

         5                    have had to seize the Bureau with this 

         6                    matters.  The Bureau has decided and now 

         7                    it lies with you.  We have to now hear the 

         8                    motion.  Please do submit your motion.  

         9                    You would then subsequently do whatever 

        10                    you want to do but for now we want to hear 

        11                    your motion.

        12     MR. ROACH:

        13                    Very well.  Would you permit me just to 

        14                    put on the record the balance of my 

        15                    submission, because although I totally am 

        16                    content with the decision that was made to 

        17                    review the matter, to have the matter 

        18                    reviewed by the Bureau, what I am now 

        19                    referring to is an opportunity for a 

        20                    continuance of the substantive motion and 

        21                    this opportunity would give me the chance 

        22                    to have this matter reviewed by the 

        23                    Bureau.  So what I'm asking now is not 

        24                    that you deal in any way with the 

        25                    application for the recusal.  I'm not

         1                    revisiting that.  I am asking that there 

         2                    be a continuance or an adjournment of this 

         3                    matter so that I might have the 

         4                    opportunity to seek a review of the 

         5                    decision on the basis that I was not 

         6                    allowed full opportunity to give my entire 

         7                    submission.  So, this is what I am seeking 

         8                    at the time.

         9     MR. PRESIDENT:

        10                    I also wish, for the record, for the 

        11                    record, I wish to say clearly that 

        12                    yesterday the presiding judge, who 

        13                    received the motion and who had 

        14                    jurisdiction, was allowed to consider it 

        15                    in tandem with the other judges that are 

        16                    members of the Bureau.  But that presiding 

        17                    judge decided to refer the matter to the 

        18                    Bureau and there was no objection to that 

        19                    decision yesterday.  And let me repeat, a 

        20                    decision has already been made by the 

        21                    Bureau and that that disqualification is 

        22                    without merit.  I hope this is clearly put 

        23                    in the record.  That stated, sir, could 

        24                    you now go to the motion itself?

         1                    I have a feeling that I have not made 

         2                    myself clear, because I am in concord with 

         3                    what your Honour has said.  I don't 

         4                    disagree with anything that you have said, 

         5                    but the pit and substance of what I am 

         6                    saying, at this time, I do not believe, 

         7                    has been dealt with and this is -- I am 

         8                    asking for an adjournment of this motion 

         9                    so that I can make an application to have 

        10                    the application for recusal reviewed and 

        11                    this is simply what I'm asking, because it 

        12                    appears to me that what you have said is 

        13                    not responsive to my concerns at this 

        14                    time.  So I hope that I have made my 

        15                    position clearer.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:

        17                    You have confirmed what you've just said 

        18                    and I wish to confirm what I have said, 

        19                    for the record.  As for the adjournment, I 

        20                    don't think we want to adjourn.  We are 

        21                    prepared to hear your motion.  Of course 

        22                    if you don't want to take the floor we 

        23                    will confine ourselves to the written 

        24                    motion you have submitted, but you do have 

        25                    the floor to further elaborate on your

         1                    written motion.

         2     MR. ROACH:

         3                    One moment, please.  May I have the 

         4                    court's indulgence?

         5     MR. PRESIDENT:

         6                    Yeah.

         7     MR. ROACH:

         8                    As I have been instructed --

         9     THE INTERPRETER:

        10                    Your microphone, sir. 

        11     MR. ROACH:

        12                    I have been instructed to proceed with the 

        13                    substantive motion on the understanding 

        14                    that proceeding at this time does not form 

        15                    any impediment to the further actions that 

        16                    we may take for review of that decision, 

        17                    as I believe your Honour has indicated. 

        18                    

        19                    If I should summarize the substance of 

        20                    this application in the briefest way that 

        21                    I could, I would say that the arrest of 

        22                    the applicant, Professor Ngirumpatse, was 

        23                    brought about by a letter from the 

        24                    prosecutor's office which contained a 

        25                    manifestly false and, in our submission,

         1                    intentionally false statement which 

         2                    misrepresented to the authorities that 

         3                    there was pending an indictment before 

         4                    this tribunal and confirmation of that 

         5                    indictment was imminent. 

         6                    

         7                    The fact is that there was no such 

         8                    indictment and this was known to by the 

         9                    writer of the letter, Mr. Muna, acting for 

        10                    the prosecutor. 

        11                    

        12                    Now I should like to refer you to the 

        13                    letter itself. 

        14                    

        15                    And if the honourable justices would turn 

        16                    to the prosecutor's response you would 

        17                    find there a copy of the letter which is 

        18                    dated the 27th of May, 1998 and in the 

        19                    last sentence of the letter you would 

        20                    observe that it was represented to the 

        21                    Minister of Justice of the Republic of 

        22                    Mali that procedures had already been 

        23                    initiated before the tribunal and 

        24                    confirmation of the indictment was 

        25                    pending.

         1                    

         2                    Now, now, we know now that there was no 

         3                    indictment and it would be several months 

         4                    before any indictment would be produced.  

         5                    Were it not for this false representation 

         6                    the applicant would not have been 

         7                    apprehended and our appeal to this 

         8                    tribunal is not to countenance 

         9                    deliberately false statements in order to 

        10                    achieve the arrest of a suspect.  And this 

        11                    tribunal ought to sanction such behaviour, 

        12                    because the representation or 

        13                    misrepresentation cries out to the high 

        14                    heaven for relief.  Were there not to be 

        15                    any relief in a situation where an arrest 

        16                    is procured through this kind of untruth 

        17                    then the flood gates would be open for 

        18                    further manipulation of facts in order to 

        19                    secure the arrest of suspects and to 

        20                    sanction this kind of behaviour, which 

        21                    goes to the very heart of fundamental 

        22                    justice, would be to set at a high level a 

        23                    very iniquitous precedent for future 

        24                    prosecutors and for nation states.

         1                    Now, you would notice that in the response 

         2                    to the application there has been no 

         3                    denial of our allegation that the 

         4                    statement was false and, in fact, the 

         5                    proceedings would show the date when the 

         6                    application was submitted.  But I should 

         7                    like to refer to the submission of the 

         8                    prosecutor because it sets out the facts 

         9                    in a detailed way and it shows the 

        10                    chronology of the development of this 

        11                    matter. 

        12                    

        13                    On the first page you would see the 

        14                    statement of facts as set out and you 

        15                    would see, also, even though they are not 

        16                    totally comprehensive, you would see also 

        17                    that at paragraph number 5 the Office of 

        18                    the Prosecutor filed an indictment against 

        19                    Ngirumpatse and seven other persons with 

        20                    the registry on the 26th of August, 1998. 

        21                    The indictment was confirmed by Honourable 

        22                    Judge Navanethem Pillay by order dated the 

        23                    29th of August, 1998, and filed with the 

        24                    registry on the 31st of August, 1998.

               NGIRUMPATSE & OTHERS


         1                    Now we accept that as a fact and you can 

         2                    see that clearly that does not concord 

         3                    with the letter which we referred to under 

         4                    the signature of Bernard Muna dated the 

         5                    27th of May, 1998, that I just referred 

         6                    to. 

         7                    

         8                    Now, I should like to move on to another 

         9                    issue, but the issue of the arrest being 

        10                    obtained by fraud upon the government of 

        11                    Mali by the prosecutor's office is, of 

        12                    course, the foundation of our submission 

        13                    to you that the remedy be given, which is 

        14                    a declaration that the arrest was false 

        15                    and an action to follow that of a quashing 

        16                    of that arrest. 

        17                    

        18                    But what I should like to do now is to 

        19                    move on to what happened following the 

        20                    arrest, with respect to detention. 

        21                    

        22                    In my submission there were a number of 

        23                    violations of fundamental justice and even 

        24                    the statute and the rules of this 

        25                    honourable tribunal and these are set out

         1                    in our written submissions under the law. 

         2                    

         3                    In the interest of time, it is not my 

         4                    intention to slavishly read this 

         5                    application --  submission under section 

         6                    number 2, the law, but I should like to 

         7                    point out some highlights which would 

         8                    demonstrate to you that following the 

         9                    arrest, the detention, itself, was flawed 

        10                    in such a way that the fundamental rights 

        11                    of the Accused was or were violated. 

        12                    

        13                    Now, Article 17-4  of the statute of the 

        14                    tribunal demand that an indictment 

        15                    containing the concise statement of the 

        16                    facts should be prepared and that should 

        17                    have been transmitted to the court. 

        18                    

        19                    Now, the allegation here from the 

        20                    prosecutor, as far as I can understand, is 

        21                    that there were urgent circumstances.  But 

        22                    you would notice that there's no factual 

        23                    basis that supports this allegation of 

        24                    urgent circumstances.

         1                    What were the urgent circumstances that 

         2                    were being relied upon?

         3                    

         4                    There's no indication, save and accept, 

         5                    now, in the prosecutor's response to this 

         6                    application in which it would appear that 

         7                    what the prosecutor was saying that it was 

         8                    necessary to act quickly because of the 

         9                    likelihood of flight. 

        10                    

        11                    But we can see no indication that that was 

        12                    ever made until long after the fact, not 

        13                    before. 

        14                    

        15                    May I submit that the proper procedure to 

        16                    be followed by a tribunal of this nature, 

        17                    or any court dealing with criminal 

        18                    matters, is that there be, in the absence 

        19                    of finding an accused flagrantly 

        20                    committing a crime, a warrant for that 

        21                    person's arrest.  And there should be, 

        22                    there ought to be something in the nature 

        23                    of an ex parte hearing in which the 

        24                    prosecutor would submit to a justice the 

        25                    grounds upon which lead that prosecutor to

         1                    believe that on offense was submitted by a 

         2                    particular person. 

         3                    

         4                    In this case what we find is that the 

         5                    prosecutor went out and without a warrant 

         6                    and on a false letter, as I said, made an 

         7                    arrest denying the procedure and 

         8                    subverting the procedure of the Tribunal, 

         9                    which is set out in Article 17, and those 

        10                    procedures that we see in the rules, like 

        11                    under Rule 40 bis, those procedures, if 

        12                    they are read in conjunction with the 

        13                    statute itself, do not override the 

        14                    statute, but those procedures must be 

        15                    interpreted to work along with the 

        16                    statute. 

        17                    

        18                    Now, in our submissions, in writing, which 

        19                    were initially submitted by the Accused, 

        20                    Mr. Ngirumpatse, himself, he has a 

        21                    particular interpretation and which I do 

        22                    not deny, but, as his counsel, I might 

        23                    advance a different interpretation. 

        24                    

        25                    He composed these written submissions and,

         1                    just as an aside, I might say his 

         2                    background is he was a law professor and 

         3                    he was one time Minister of Justice.  And 

         4                    where he, he says that there's some 

         5                    conflict between the Articles, 17 and 18 

         6                    of the statute, and the Rule 40 bis, which 

         7                    he submits is not reconcilable. 

         8                    

         9                    I would say that that's arguable because 

        10                    the way in which the rule, the rule is 

        11                    written is certainly not a model of 

        12                    clarity.  However, I would take the 

        13                    position that if we can, at all, read 

        14                    meaning into the rule, which is consistent 

        15                    with the statute, we should do so and in 

        16                    this case, where we find that there is any 

        17                    doubt or any ambiguity, that ambiguity 

        18                    should be resolved in the favor of the 

        19                    Accused person.  And so while we look at 

        20                    Rule 40 bis and we look at Article 17-4 of 

        21                    the statute, together, and as a whole, we 

        22                    submit and I urge you to find where there 

        23                    is any ambiguity that 17, Article 17 

        24                    prevails.

         1                    Now we also are saying that the continued 

         2                    detention was a violation of fundamental 

         3                    rights because the warrant, which was 

         4                    accompanied by the indictment that was 

         5                    attempted to be served on the Accused, 

         6                    was, in fact, that package was, in fact, 

         7                    in an improper form.  It was a great many 

         8                    redactions and if I might just stop to 

         9                    interrupt myself here, I might say that 

        10                    the facts that we are dealing with are 

        11                    facts that pertained at the time of the 

        12                    filing of this application. 

        13                    

        14                    Of course since then there have been 

        15                    developments and things have changed, 

        16                    certain things have changed, but I urge 

        17                    you to look at what the situation was at 

        18                    the time of the filing of the application 

        19                    and in putting yourself in the position as 

        20                    if it were heard then. 

        21                    

        22                    At that time there was substantial 

        23                    nondisclosures or redactions. 

        24                    

        25                    Now, it is my submission that that ought

         1                    not to be so far as an Accused person is 

         2                    concerned.

         4                    An Accused person must be served the 

         5                    indictment without any redactions and this 

         6                    is what the rules, themselves, provide, 

         7                    because if you look at the rules carefully 

         8                    you would see that what is referred to, so 

         9                    far as non-disclosure is concerned, 

        10                    there's the public at large, not the 

        11                    accused persons.  It seems not 

        12                    unreasonable, at all, that an accused 

        13                    person should know if he is charged with 

        14                    conspiracy, with whom he is charged with 

        15                    that conspiracy.

          1    MR. ROACH:

          2                   In essence, what I am contending is that 

          3                   this defective indictment, defective in 

          4                   the sense that many portions and many 

          5                   names of various people, places and times 

          6                   were removed, and that indictment, which 

          7                   continued to be in that form until 

          8                   recently when all of the nondisclosed 

          9                   parts were ordered to be disclosed, that 

         10                   indictment was ersatz.  It was not 

         11                   effective to comply with the Rules.  

         12                   

         13                   And it is my submission that that is not 

         14                   a minor matter.  It cannot be said that 

         15                   there is no substantial miscarriage of 

         16                   justice, if you refuse to grant an 

         17                   accused person the full benefit of 

         18                   knowing what the case is before or at the 

         19                   soonest time.  And the soonest time, we 

         20                   think, would be -- the soonest time under 

         21                   normal cases, if things are proper, is at 

         22                   the time of his arrest or shortly after.  

         23                   

         24                   In fact, the accused person, Mr. Matthieu 

         25                   Ngirumpatse, made two appearances in

          1                   court before he was eventually served 

          2                   with the indictment.  But with respect to 

          3                   the Rule that I just referred to with 

          4                   respect to redactions, I should just like 

          5                   to visit that with you for a moment.  

          6                   It's Rule 53.  You'd see in paragraph 

          7                   (A), that the nondisclosure is to the 

          8                   public.  In paragraph (B), the public is 

          9                   also mentioned here.  And in paragraph 

         10                   (C), in the French version, you would see 

         11                   that it's nondisclosure to the public.  

         12                   It appears that -- if you look at the 

         13                   whole section as a whole, all the parts 

         14                   together, that (C) in English as well 

         15                   would be nondisclosure to the public.  It 

         16                   doesn't say nondisclosure to an accused 

         17                   person.  And there is no other provision, 

         18                   in our knowledge, that would exempt the 

         19                   accused person from not getting a full 

         20                   disclosure of the indictment against him. 

         21                   

         22                   Now, there have been a number of

          1                   him in which he had challenged the right 

          2                   of the Prosecutor to obtain further 

          3                   extensions of his detention.  

          4                   

          5                   Now, His Honour, the President of the 

          6                   Court, had heard those and is familiar 

          7                   with his arguments, but there were some 

          8                   extensions.  There were at least two 

          9                   extensions before the final indictment 

         10                   was ready.  And you would see, in the 

         11                   written submissions that we have here, 

         12                   the reasons which were followed in those 

         13                   appearances when the applicant made the 

         14                   submissions himself.  You would see that 

         15                   there is an argument that those 

         16                   extensions were against the Statute.  

         17                   

         18                   And here again is where we have some 

         19                   argument as to whether there is a 

         20                   concordance between the Article and the 

         21                   Rule.  But suffice it to say, that even 

         22                   though Your Honour, Judge Kama, had 

         23                   reviewed this, I am sure you can revisit 

         24                   this with an open mind, freshly.  

         25                   Although, from my reading of the 



                              SHANNON FLEMING - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER
                                       ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          1                   transcript, there was really not the same 

          2                   kind of circumstances for consideration 

          3                   of this point as we have today.  So I 

          4                   feel that this issue of the extension of 

          5                   time and detention could be revisited 

          6                   with a fresh mind, and revisited in the 

          7                   light of Rule 40 bis as opposed to the 

          8                   Statute; revisited to the extent of 

          9                   saying, is there a viable -- or is there 

         10                   a reasonable difference or distinction 

         11                   between these Rules, or are they the 

         12                   same, and if there is some reasonable 

         13                   ambiguity to give that interpretation 

         14                   that is most favorable to the accused 

         15                   person. 

         16                   

         17                   Now, there are some other points that are 

         18                   mentioned here by the applicant himself.  

         19                   I would just keep, however, to the 

         20                   question of the search and seizure.  And 

         21                   this would be the last area of my 

         22                   submissions.  

         23                   

         24                   Again, we would like to go back to our 

         25                   colleague's submissions.  You would see

          1                   the Prosecutor's response.  You can see 

          2                   here a list of the matters of all the 

          3                   items that were seized.  

          4                   

          5                   Now, I have no doubt that my colleagues 

          6                   on the other side would collaborate with 

          7                   us in the examination of these items if a 

          8                   date and time can be had.  But we go 

          9                   further than just the question of 

         10                   examination of the items.  

         11                   

         12                   I have been assured sometime ago that if 

         13                   the time and place can be arranged, it 

         14                   would be accommodated to see these.  But 

         15                   what we want is something more than that.  

         16                   There are certain items that are going to 

         17                   be kept as evidence that might be 

         18                   introduced in the case.  And we are not 

         19                   asking for the return of those, but we 

         20                   should like to have reproductions or 

         21                   photocopies of all these documentation.  

         22                   Some of the matters are clearly not 

         23                   matters of evidence.  And I might tell 

         24                   you, in my role as Officer of this Court, 

         25                   that some personal items like a passport

            NGIRUMPATSE & OTHERS                       18 NOVEMBER 1999


          1                   of the applicant's wife and daughter, 

          2                   those were returned.  But save and except 

          3                   those items, we should like to have a 

          4                   return of all these items.  

          5                   

          6                   On what basis?  We should like to have a 

          7                   return of them if you find that the 

          8                   arrest and the subsequent search and 

          9                   seizure was false.  But if you find it 

         10                   was not false, it is not false.  If you 

         11                   somehow see your way to grace the false 

         12                   statement with validity, enough to 

         13                   constitute a proper arrest, then we would 

         14                   like to have the photocopies of every one 

         15                   of these documents that were taken.  

         16                   Otherwise they should all be returned.  

         17                   

         18                   And this brings me then to the relief 

         19                   that we are seeking from this honorable 

         20                   Tribunal. 

         21                   

         22                   As I said before, we should like you to 

         23                   rule that the arrest was unlawful because 

         24                   it was brought about by a knowingly false 

         25                   statement misrepresenting the facts to

          1                   the Government of Mali.  And we want you 

          2                   also to declare that the search, which 

          3                   followed that arrest, was based on that 

          4                   false and misleading statement as well.  

          5                   And that in those circumstances the 

          6                   search and seizure were unreasonable.  

          7                   

          8                   And those are the two declarations that 

          9                   we are asking.  And the following relief 

         10                   is that the accused person be, for those 

         11                   reasons, be released, and all items 

         12                   seized be returned. 

         13                   

         14                   I have already stated an alternative 

         15                   position.  However, I wanted also to ask 

         16                   that there be an order or declaration 

         17                   that the continued detention in the 

         18                   circumstances that we have complained 

         19                   about was also unlawful.  

         20                   

         21                   Now, subject to questions, those would be 

         22                   all my submissions at this point. 

         23                   

         24                   Thank you.

          1                   Thank you, Mr. Roach. 

          2                   

          3                   Prosecutor has the floor.  

          4                   

          5                   Obviously we received your written reply, 

          6                   consequently, we ask you to be as brief 

          7                   as possible and to answer some of the 

          8                   questions that have been raised by 

          9                   defence, if possible. 

         10    MS. OJEMENI:

         11                   Thank you, Your Honour. 

         12                   

         13                   I really do not intend to take much of 

         14                   your time, but most of the issues raised 

         15                   on the floor will be taken by my 

         16                   colleague, Don Webster.  

         17                   

         18                   But basically, I'll crave your indulgence 

         19                   to point out some of the salient issues 

         20                   on the submission we have already made to 

         21                   you in our response dated 4th April, 

         22                   1999, in which we have stated the facts 

         23                   of the arrest and detention of the 

         24                   accused in paragraph 1 to 9.  And then 

         25                   the issues raised in his application,

            NGIRUMPATSE & OTHERS                       18 NOVEMBER 1999


          1                   we've also highlighted in paragraph 10 to 

          2                   11.  And we have also indicated that we 

          3                   vehemently oppose the application.  We 

          4                   stated the grounds in paragraphs 12 to 

          5                   24. 

          6                   

          7                   However, I'd like to point out these 

          8                   facts to the effect that one, the accused 

          9                   was arrested in Bamako, Mali, by the 

         10                   Government of Mali upon the request,  

         11                   written request -- like my colleague has 

         12                   admitted, that a letter was written -- by 

         13                   the Prosecutor.  And there's nothing in 

         14                   the Rules, really, that says that a 

         15                   letter is not acceptable for such 

         16                   requests.  And we've stated in paragraph 

         17                   13 that -- I mean in paragraph 12, Your 

         18                   Honour, that what transpired during the 

         19                   arrest, and all the procedures laid down 

         20                   in Rule 40(A) was -- the arrest was in 

         21                   conformity with the provision of Rule 

         22                   40(A).  So there is nothing unlawful or 

         23                   any act that vitiates the -- or there's 

         24                   no act that states that that warrant 

         25                   should be, you know, produced at the

          1                   arrest.  And it is stated in paragraph 

          2                   12.  The arrest is, therefore, not 

          3                   vitiated in any way.  

          4                   

          5                   And as regards -- on the 12th June, 1998, 

          6                   we made a request under Rule 40 bis for 

          7                   the issuance of the order for his 

          8                   transfer.  And that order was granted on 

          9                   10th of August, 1998.  And the time 

         10                   period within which this should be done 

         11                   was duly observed and is in conformity 

         12                   with the procedure under 40 bis.  

         13                   

         14                   The indictment was thereafter confirmed 

         15                   on the 29th of August, 1998.  And the 

         16                   defence counsel has also admitted that at 

         17                   the time the request was made for his 

         18                   arrest that there was a different 

         19                   procedure for the indictment during that 

         20                   period.  There was actually a global 

         21                   indictment which was later on -- which 

         22                   was being developed at the time.  So the 

         23                   indictment, as at that time, was -- the 

         24                   procedure for the indictment as at that 

         25                   time is different from what it is now.

          1                   

          2                   And as at the time of the arrest, like I 

          3                   stated, the global indictment was being 

          4                   developed and which was subsequently 

          5                   dismissed.  But this issue would be dealt 

          6                   with by my colleague.  

          7                   

          8                   Another issue he raised which is the 

          9                   urgent circumstances stated in the letter 

         10                   which warranted the arrest is also 

         11                   copiously explained in paragraph 14 of 

         12                   our reply.  And I wouldn't want to bore 

         13                   you on that issue.  

         14                   

         15                   As regards the items recovered -- seized 

         16                   from the accused, we have already stated 

         17                   that the Office of the Prosecutor has no 

         18                   objection in allowing the defence counsel 

         19                   to go through the items with us.  And 

         20                   since the investigation is ongoing, it 

         21                   will not be proper to allow to return 

         22                   some of the -- I mean return the items to 

         23                   the accused.  So we will also petition 

         24                   upon his request, we will petition this 

         25                   Chamber to -- for a date to allow the

          1                   parties to go through the items and then 

          2                   decide on what to do thereafter. 

          3                   

          4                   Your Honour, we've in paragraph 18, 

          5                   stated that the arrest, detention and 

          6                   transfer of the accused, we are -- I 

          7                   mean, from what I have read out now -- 

          8                   conformed with the laid down procedures 

          9                   in the Rule and Statute.  And they were 

         10                   all done also within the time limit, and 

         11                   they cannot in any way be seen to be 

         12                   unlawful.  And we urge Your Honour to 

         13                   deny the application. 

         14                   

         15                   We further submit that any delay in the 

         16                   initial appearance of the accused is 

         17                   beyond the control of the Office of the 

         18                   Prosecutor.  And it's within the province 

         19                   of the Registry to schedule the initial 

         20                   appearance if there was any such delay.  

         21                   I mean, it's for the Registry to schedule 

         22                   appearances.  So it's beyond our own 

         23                   control.  And all the other issues that I 

         24                   have not highlighted will be taken care 

         25                   of by my colleague, Don Webster.

          1                   

          2                   Thank you, Your Honour. 

          3    THE PRESIDENT:

          4                   You have the floor, Mr. Don Webster. 

          5    MR. WEBSTER:

          6                   I am going to be brief.  I'm just going 

          7                   to mention one or two points raised by 

          8                   Mr. Roach during his presentation.  

          9                   

         10                   I'll begin with the allegation that there 

         11                   was some sort of fraud perpetrated on the 

         12                   Government of Mali by the Office of the 

         13                   Prosecutor.  That is a strong statement.

         14    THE INTERPRETER:

         15                   Could he be asked to be a bit slower for 

         16                   the interpreter.  Could he be asked to be 

         17                   a bit slower for the interpreter.  Your 

         18                   Honour, could the Prosecutor be asked to 

         19                   be a bit slower for the benefit of the 

         20                   interpreters.  

         21                   

         22                   Thank you, Your Honour. 

         23    MR. WEBSTER:

         24                   -- it clearly states, I believe the line 

         25                   in that letter that raises so much

          1                   concern.

          2                   

          3                   The line in the letter that seems to 

          4                   raise a lot of concern states:

          5                   

          6    Through the Interpreter: 

          7    

          8                   Did they consider that person as a 

          9                   suspect before the Tribunal, and his 

         10                   being indicted, or an indictment is being 

         11                   prepared against him.

         12                   

         13    By Mr. Webster:

         14                   The theory of the Prosecution in this 

         15                   case is that it was the genocide in 

         16                   Rwanda that was organized by the 

         17                   government, that it was coordinated and 

         18                   planned long in advance of the events 

         19                   that started to take place in the 

         20                   beginning of April.  At the time Matthieu 

         21                   Ngirumpatse was president of the MRND, 

         22                   which is the political party governing 

         23                   Rwanda at the time, his activities as a 

         24                   member or as the president of that party 

         25                   contributed significantly to the actions

          1                   and the directives of the interim 

          2                   government that was put in place on the 

          3                   8th of April, 1994.  

          4                   

          5                   This office had proposed a larger 

          6                   document, which we refer to within the 

          7                   office as a "global indictment", in which 

          8                   28 persons were jointly accused.  I'm not 

          9                   sure if -- I can't say it for the record 

         10                   that Matthieu Ngirumpatse was a named 

         11                   party on that global indictment, but he 

         12                   was certainly anticipated in the text of 

         13                   that indictment.  I believe the actions 

         14                   of the MRND, or the leadership of the 

         15                   MRND, was clearly spelled out in that 

         16                   global indictment. 

         17                   

         18                   When that indictment was presented to 

         19                   Judge Khan for confirmation, it was 

         20                   rejected on jurisdictional grounds.  

         21                   There was nothing about the substance of 

         22                   the allegations or the text of that 

         23                   indictment that we are rejecting.  But on 

         24                   a matter that was purely procedural, that 

         25                   indictment was rejected.  And as a

          1                   consequence, this office began to prepare 

          2                   a series of indictments that were 

          3                   derivative of that first instrument which 

          4                   we refer to as a global indictment.  

          5                   

          6                   So when the Deputy Prosecutor states that 

          7                   procedure of confirmation was in place, 

          8                   that sentence refers to more broadly 

          9                   define, or that statement anticipates a 

         10                   broader procedure than simply drafting a 

         11                   document and submitting it to one judge 

         12                   in particular.  

         13                   

         14                   This office at that time was still 

         15                   conducting investigations.  The office is 

         16                   presently conducting investigations.  The 

         17                   office is still working on these 

         18                   instruments.  So there are a series of 

         19                   indictments that are being prepared and 

         20                   submitted for confirmation.  

         21                   

         22                   With respect to the indictment that 

         23                   charges Matthieu Ngirumpatse, it's a 

         24                   joint indictment.  There were eight 

         25                   parties on that indictment.  When

          1                   Mr. Ngirumpatse was arrested there were 

          2                   four persons that were named on that 

          3                   indictment that were arrested on the same 

          4                   date.  The other four persons were still 

          5                   at liberty.  When Mr. Roach reproaches 

          6                   this office for making certain redactions 

          7                   to the indictment, those redactions were 

          8                   not substantive.  The redactions concern 

          9                   only the names of those suspects who had 

         10                   not yet been taken into custody.  

         11                   

         12                   I'll state at the outset that any 

         13                   discussion of the factual matters 

         14                   attendant to the arrest of Matthieu 

         15                   Ngirumpatse stop, for the purposes of our 

         16                   examination, on the 29th of August, 1998, 

         17                   when the indictment against him was 

         18                   confirmed.  I mention the issue of the 

         19                   redactions simply for purposes of 

         20                   clarification.  The redactions, I 

         21                   believe, the redacted indictment was 

         22                   served in October.  But for the purposes 

         23                   of examining the circumstances of his 

         24                   arrest and the legality of his arrest, 

         25                   there is no need for this Court to look

          1                   beyond the 29th of August, 1998, when the 

          2                   indictment was confirmed by Judge Pillay. 

          3                   

          4                   I believe there was an allegation by the 

          5                   defence counsel that the arrest was 

          6                   improper because it was not accompanied 

          7                   by a warrant.  That statement is 

          8                   inaccurate.  The terms of the Rules in 

          9                   the Statute of this Tribunal do not 

         10                   require a warrant in order to take a 

         11                   suspect into custody.  There was in fact 

         12                   a warrant.  The warrant was issued the 

         13                   day after the indictment was confirmed on 

         14                   the 29th of August.  I believe the 

         15                   warrant is actually dated the 31st of 

         16                   August.  But the issuance of the warrant 

         17                   has nothing to do with the legality of 

         18                   the arrest.  The arrest for all purposes 

         19                   became perfectly legal when the 

         20                   indictment against Mr. Ngirumpatse was 

         21                   confirmed.  

         22                   

         23                   With regard to the issue of search and 

         24                   seizure, I believe the provisions in Rule 

         25                   40 bis and Rule 40 were clearly observed.

          1                   The property that was taken into custody 

          2                   by the investigators of this office was 

          3                   properly vouchered.  An inventory of the 

          4                   property was properly prepared.  The 

          5                   property was sealed in the presence of 

          6                   Mr. Ngirumpatse.  There is a written 

          7                   inventory which bears his signature at 

          8                   the very end.  Not only have we supplied 

          9                   a photocopy of that inventory, but I 

         10                   believe in the French -- in the English 

         11                   language text of the Prosecutor's 

         12                   response, there is an -- if you indulge 

         13                   me for one moment.  Let me withdraw that.  

         14                   There is a photocopy of the actual 

         15                   indictment that was prepared at the time 

         16                   that the property was vouchered.  

         17                   

         18                   So on the basis of these submissions, I 

         19                   think that the Prosecutor has amply made 

         20                   out the elements that -- or the factual 

         21                   scenario that led to the arrest of 

         22                   Mr. Ngirumpatse, and in all respects the 

         23                   Prosecutor complied with the Statute and 

         24                   the Rules.  There is nothing improper 

         25                   about the arrest.  The indictment was

          1                   confirmed well within the time guidelines 

          2                   of Rule 40 bis.  

          3                   

          4                   And in that basis I submit to the Court 

          5                   that it should rule against the defence 

          6                   and dismiss his motion in all respects.

          7                   

          8                   Thank you. 

          9    THE PRESIDENT:

         10                   Thank you, Prosecutor.

         11                   

         12                   And I give the floor to the accused 

         13                   should you have additional information to 

         14                   give us.

         15    MR. ROACH:

         16                   In response to what was said by the 

         17                   Prosecution, I would just point out that 

         18                   we must not confuse this global 

         19                   indictment, which we don't even know 

         20                   about.  It's not before you as a fact.  

         21                   You have to have facts upon which to 

         22                   decide this application.  The facts would 

         23                   be either because they are factual 

         24                   matters in the record itself, or matters 

         25                   agreed upon by the parties, or before you

          1                   in the form of an affidavit.  

          2                   

          3                   My friend says he does not know if Mr. 

          4                   Ngirumpatse's name was on that global 

          5                   indictment.  He hasn't said that at the 

          6                   time of this arrest, at the time of the 

          7                   arrest, we are talking about June, or at 

          8                   the time of the presentation of the 

          9                   letter in May of 1998, such a global 

         10                   indictment was before this Court waiting 

         11                   confirmation.  

         12                   

         13                   But in any event, and to save time, I am 

         14                   going to ask you when you retire to look 

         15                   at the brief transcripts of August 10th 

         16                   and July 16th of 1998, in which you see 

         17                   that the applicant said that Mr. Muna was 

         18                   present at the time of his arrest.  He 

         19                   was there in Mali -- or shortly after his 

         20                   arrest.  And when I asked to present a 

         21                   warrant he said the warrant was there.  

         22                   It would be sent to him by the next 

         23                   plane.  So this has to be a warrant that 

         24                   was special and particular to the 

         25                   applicant, not any global warrant which

          1                   we don't know much about.  

          2                   

          3                   A few points which were raised in 

          4                   response.  I should like to urge this 

          5                   Court to embrace the principle that no 

          6                   one should be arrested without a warrant 

          7                   unless that person is found committing 

          8                   the offense, or unless there are certain 

          9                   circumstances -- we can't always foretell 

         10                   what circumstances -- that would make it 

         11                   impossible to apprehend the person unless 

         12                   there is a warrant.  

         13                   

         14                   So we don't know in these circumstances 

         15                   that there were such circumstances.  

         16                   There was a situation in which there was 

         17                   that urgency.  I have raised the matter 

         18                   of urgency, and I said there was a dearth 

         19                   of information as to what that urgency 

         20                   was.  I said also that the first we've 

         21                   heard about the urgency or the nature of 

         22                   the urgency is in the submissions of the 

         23                   Prosecutor's office.  And this is many, 

         24                   many months after.  This is April of 

         25                   1999, practically a year after the fact.

          1                   And so this issue of urgency should be 

          2                   brought before justice if that Rule 

          3                   should be applied.  

          4                   

          5                   The Prosecutor must not take the law into 

          6                   his own hands, arrest first and then 

          7                   investigate after; and then get a warrant 

          8                   for arrest, and serve the warrant for 

          9                   arrest months after. 

         10                   

         11                   With respect to the point that my friend, 

         12                   Mr. Webster, for the Prosecutor, made 

         13                   that the -- just one moment, please.  

         14                   Yes.  That the Rules do not or the 

         15                   Statute does not say that a person cannot 

         16                   be arrested on the basis of a mere 

         17                   letter.  What I was asking you to do is 

         18                   to look at the laws of nations.

         20                   In the laws of nations you see that 

         21                   people are not arrested on this kind of 

         22                   tenuous basis.  And this Court is going 

         23                   to be a historical a model, a model of 

         24                   what the law should be.  And you should 

         25                   not countenance arresting people without

          1                   warrants or without some kind of 

          2                   superintendence over the situation unless 

          3                   you have before you compelling 

          4                   circumstances that indicate that a 

          5                   warrant would, or getting a warrant would 

          6                   obviate the whole process. 

          7                   

          8                   With respect to the Prosecution's 

          9                   position that the names that were 

         10                   redacted -- this is what was said -- that 

         11                   was not a substantive redaction.  

         12                   Remember what we have here is conspiracy, 

         13                   a charge of conspiracy, acting in concert 

         14                   together to commit a crime.  And it can 

         15                   hardly be said that knowing who you have 

         16                   conspired with is not a material or 

         17                   substantial matter.  In fact, it's the 

         18                   essence of the whole case; knowing who 

         19                   you are alleged to -- and the times and 

         20                   the particulars.  So saying that 

         21                   redaction of these names was not a matter 

         22                   that affected the essence of the 

         23                   indictment so as to violate the Rule is, 

         24                   in my opinion, not sensible in cases of 

         25                   conspiracy.

          1                   

          2                   And if I might have your indulgence for 

          3                   one moment, please. 

          4                   

          5                   Those are all my submissions.  It seems 

          6                   as though my client may want to make a 

          7                   few remarks about some facts that were 

          8                   mentioned with the permission of the 

          9                   Court.

         10    THE PRESIDENT:

         11                   Prosecutor, you have the floor. 

         12    MR. WEBSTER:

         13                   I want to make one observation, Your 

         14                   Honour.

         15                   

         16                   First of all, my understanding is that 

         17                   this hearing would be an argument on the 

         18                   law on the basis of the submissions that 

         19                   were made by counsel in their motion 

         20                   papers.  If Mr. Ngirumpatse wants to 

         21                   address the Court and raise factual 

         22                   issues, then he should be sworn and 

         23                   subject to cross-examination.  

         24                   

         25                   Furthermore, Mr. Roach raised additional

                                                 51



            NGIRUMPATSE & OTHERS                       18 NOVEMBER 1999


          1                   factual issues a few moments ago which I 

          2                   would like to respond to.  I think there 

          3                   was an allegation that the Deputy 

          4                   Prosecutor himself was present in Mali 

          5                   and communicated with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

          6                   That is not an established fact for this 

          7                   Court to consider.  It has not been 

          8                   offered on the basis of a sworn 

          9                   statement.  A witness has not taken the 

         10                   stand to offer that statement to the 

         11                   Court.  And if this Court is going to 

         12                   look beyond the motion papers and 

         13                   discussion arguments on the law and 

         14                   entertain factual issues that can only be 

         15                   established by testimony from a witness, 

         16                   then we'll have to call witnesses and 

         17                   swear them and submit them to 

         18                   cross-examination.  

         19                   

         20                   Thank you.

         21    THE PRESIDENT:

         22                   I give the floor to Judge Dolenc who has 

         23                   a question to pose. 

         24    JUDGE DOLENC:

         25                   For Prosecution, one question.

            NGIRUMPATSE & OTHERS                       18 NOVEMBER 1999


          1                   

          2                   Are there any regulations that are 

          3                   directing the conduct of the Prosecution, 

          4                   any provisions about search, seizure of 

          5                   items and subsequent procedure with these 

          6                   seized items?

          7    MR. WEBSTER:

          8                   The only regulations that I am aware of 

          9                   are those that are contained in the Rules 

         10                   and the Statute themselves.  In terms of 

         11                   the internal procedures of the Office of 

         12                   the Prosecutor, most of or investigators 

         13                   are from Canada, from -- I'll withdraw 

         14                   that.  I'll simply state that we are 

         15                   guided by the principles of law 

         16                   enforcement that are recognized by 

         17                   established legal systems in all parts of 

         18                   the world.  

         19                   

         20                   I'll also add that our investigators do 

         21                   not affect the arrest, and do not 

         22                   actually command the search and the 

         23                   seizure of property.  Our investigators 

         24                   work with local authorities in the 

         25                   national jurisdictions where the arrests

          1                   are made.  They are present, but they 

          2                   work under the guidance of the local 

          3                   authorities, in this context, Mali.  

          4                   

          5                   In regard to the appropriate standards 

          6                   for the legality of a search and a 

          7                   seizure, those standards and the 

          8                   procedures that are engaged would be the 

          9                   standards and procedures of the national 

         10                   jurisdiction.  Our investigators do not 

         11                   have the authority to override the 

         12                   national authorities in their conduct of 

         13                   an arrest or a search or a seizure.

         14                   

         15                   Thank you.

         16    JUDGE DOLENC:

         17                   Just one question.  

         18                   

         19                   And after, when you are in possession of 

         20                   the items here in Kigali or in Arusha?

         21    MR. WEBSTER:

         22                   Once the property is vouchered in the 

         23                   presence of the accused, it is sealed.  

         24                   It is then transported, I believe, either 

         25                   to Kigali or Arusha.  And from there it

          1                   is sent to The Hague where it is kept 

          2                   under control.  It is not opened unless 

          3                   it is opened in the presence of a court 

          4                   officer or some sort of court official.   

          5                   I have never opened a pouch with 

          6                   evidence.  In order to do that it 

          7                   presents a logistical challenge in terms 

          8                   of bringing it from the evidence unit to 

          9                   this court.

         10    JUDGE DOLENC:

         11                   Just about rules, rules of the 

         12                   Prosecution.  Do you have any rules 

         13                   after?  

         14    MR. WEBSTER:

         15                   I believe the Office of the Prosecutor is 

         16                   simply guided by the Statute and Rules of 

         17                   Procedure on those points.

         18    JUDGE DOLENC:

         19                   Thank you.

         20    THE PRESIDENT:

         21                   Thank you, Judge Dolenc. 

         22                   

         23                   My understanding, if correct, is that the 

         24                   accused wanted to take the floor.  And 

         25                   the counsel had made a submission.  We

          1                   took the entire motion.  And I had asked 

          2                   for brief interventions to be made.  

          3                   

          4                   I would like to call on the accused to 

          5                   let us know the content of the submission 

          6                   he wanted to make, because whatever he 

          7                   wanted to say has been clearly stated by 

          8                   the counsel who represented him.  

          9                   

         10                   And this is in line with what you had 

         11                   written and what your counsel had 

         12                   written.  I do not see what else you want 

         13                   to talk to us about.  You have a counsel 

         14                   who has represented you most ably.  And 

         15                   he had given us a brief.  If you want to 

         16                   give a brief intervention, I give you the 

         17                   floor.

         18    THE ACCUSED:  

         19                   I thank you, Your Honour.  

         20                   

         21                   I do not want to contest the brilliant 

         22                   manner in which my counsel had 

         23                   represented me.  I just wanted to refer 

         24                   to the urgency with which I was arrested

          1                   authenticated, which were really 

          2                   unfounded.

          3    THE PRESIDENT:

          4                   Well, the fact that an arrest warrant was 

          5                   not presented and the fact that you felt 

          6                   that the search was not regularly 

          7                   conducted, all of these are reflected in 

          8                   your paper.  I don't see anything else 

          9                   you want to elucidate further on. 

         10                   

         11                   This hearing could allow everybody to 

         12                   make a submission, and your counsel has 

         13                   done it most ably.

         14    THE ACCUSED:  

         15                   But Your Honour, if you had allowed me to 

         16                   conclude, maybe I would have concluded.

         17    THE PRESIDENT:

         18                   Yes, you concluded by saying that you 

         19                   wanted to say that the conditions under 

         20                   which --

         21    THE ACCUSED:  

         22                   No.  You asked me a question as to what I 

         23                   wanted to talk about.  And I replied as I 

         24                   have just replied.

         25    THE PRESIDENT:

          1                   No.  I said that if that is what you 

          2                   wanted to talk about, your counsel had 

          3                   amply elucidated on it, and we have your 

          4                   report in writing.  It is very clear.

          5    THE ACCUSED:  

          6                   Well, if you feel that I cannot add 

          7                   anything -- and I had thought that after 

          8                   the intervention, the submission of the 

          9                   Prosecutor, I should shed light on a few 

         10                   issues.  There is a misunderstanding, as 

         11                   my counsel said, that is likely to affect 

         12                   this issue of urgency.  I had agreed with 

         13                   my counsel.  He asked me. 

         14    THE PRESIDENT:

         15                   Did he explain to you his understanding 

         16                   to you?

         17    THE ACCUSED:  

         18                   Yes.  Permit me to say it to him, Your 

         19                   Honour, and he can say to you all.

         20    THE PRESIDENT:

         21                   If yes, then there is really nothing you 

         22                   want to talk about.  You want me to 

         23                   consult with the judges and give you the 

         24                   floor on this misunderstanding only?

          1                   The bench agrees to give you the floor on 

          2                   this matter.

          3    THE ACCUSED:  

          4                   Thank you, Your Honour, for your 

          5                   kindness. 

          6                   

          7                   I just wish to dwell on the matter of 

          8                   urgency on the basis for which I was 

          9                   arrested.  

         10                   

         11                   Firstly, Prosecutor made mention of the 

         12                   fact that I saw Prosecutor Muna.  It is 

         13                   true I saw Prosecutor Muna.  He came to 

         14                   see me on the day after my arrest, at the 

         15                   Gendarmerie Camp in Bamako where I was 

         16                   detained.  I clearly asked him, 

         17                   specifically asked him where was the 

         18                   arrest warrant and the indictment.  He 

         19                   questioned it to investigators who were 

         20                   with him, and he said you will have all 

         21                   those documents in the next plane.  

         22                   

         23                   Of course the Prosecutor raised a matter 

         24                   of finding out whether there were 

         25                   witnesses who would need to testify.  I

          1                   worked in good faith with the Prosecutor.  

          2                   If he says that's not true, that doesn't 

          3                   really change anything because the 

          4                   statement made in his letter does not 

          5                   identify with reality.  That's one.  

          6                   

          7                   Secondly, Your Honour, mention is made of 

          8                   an attempt to escape or assist others to 

          9                   escape.  I wish to state that in Kinshasa 

         10                   -- and I said so before Your Honour on 

         11                   the 10th August.  In Kinshasa I lived 

         12                   under my real identity.  I was professor 

         13                   in two universities in Kinshasa.  I did 

         14                   not falsify my documents.  

         15                   

         16                   In Bamako I indicated, Your Honour, to 

         17                   you that I was a victim of harassment by 

         18                   the UN High Commission for Refugees.  My 

         19                   papers were withdrawn because I was told 

         20                   that the Tribunal was looking for me.  

         21                   And so there was no urgency.  And I 

         22                   informed the investigators of the 

         23                   Tribunal of my real identity.  I gave 

         24                   them a photocopy of the attestation I 

         25                   received from the UN High Commission for

          1                   Refugees in Bamako with my real name.  

          2                   

          3                   It is rather the identity that came in 

          4                   the letter or mentioned in the letter of 

          5                   the Prosecutor that was wrong, because he 

          6                   says I was born in 1954, which is 

          7                   definitely not the truth.  And I thought 

          8                   I should clarify this matter, Your 

          9                   Honour.

         10                   

         11                   For the seven months while I was the 

         12                   victim of harassment, if I wanted to live 

         13                   in Bamako, I would have done so.  But 

         14                   that is not my character.  I wanted to 

         15                   come here, explain myself before you.  

         16                   

         17                   As I told you on the hearing of 8th 

         18                   April, which was presided over by 

         19                   Honourable Judge Sekule, I just want to 

         20                   be reassured by the Tribunal.  And he 

         21                   granted my wish, so I cannot escape.  I 

         22                   wanted to explain for myself and for 

         23                   history.  It is most important for me.  

         24                   

         25                   So the issue of urgency does not really 



                              SHANNON FLEMING - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

          1                   stand.  It has no grounds.  I wanted the 

          2                   Prosecutor to say that there was no 

          3                   indictment.  In fact no indictment 

          4                   existed.  If the activities that I 

          5                   engaged in as a party person within the 

          6                   indictment, if those facts are there, 

          7                   it's not in reference to me.  I'm not 

          8                   Ngirumpatse.  I'm not involved there. 

          9    THE PRESIDENT:

         10                   I think we should conclude, Prosecutor.  

         11                   I think the last person to speak would be 

         12                   the accused.

         13    MR. WEBSTER:

         14                   The accused is raising additional --

         15    THE PRESIDENT:

         16                   Please, please, I'm the one speaking.  

         17                   That's not the way Court proceeds.  We 

         18                   can't continue on until tomorrow.  Each 

         19                   time the accused speaks you have the 

         20                   reply.

         21    MR. WEBSTER:

         22                   -- the point you are making, Your Honour, 

         23                   but when the accused of the opposing 

         24                   party raises additional factual issues, 

         25                   then I would think that the reasonable

          1                   thing to do would be to allow the 

          2                   Prosecutor or the opposing party to 

          3                   respond.

          4    THE PRESIDENT:

          5                   The accused has just replied to something 

          6                   that you said yourself.  You questioned 

          7                   the fact that Muna was there and he has 

          8                   answered.  So the matter is over.

          9    MR. WEBSTER:

         10                   -- introduced by Mr. Roach and the 

         11                   accused.  If that is a matter that this 

         12                   Court is going to take into 

         13                   consideration --

         14    THE PRESIDENT:

         15                   Please, I am the one speaking.  You have 

         16                   had an opportunity to answer.  There is a 

         17                   statement made by the accused.  That one 

         18                   is over.  The accused has made a 

         19                   statement challenging what you said with 

         20                   respect to the presence of Mr. Muna.  So 

         21                   the matter is over.

         22    MR. WEBSTER:

         23                   The accused went into a discussion of 

         24                   specific things that Mr. Muna allegedly 

         25                   said to him.  If his representation to

          1                   this Court is going to form a basis for 

          2                   your decision, then it is something that 

          3                   the Prosecutor should be able to comment 

          4                   on. 

          5    THE PRESIDENT:

          6                   But you just said that you doubted -- you 

          7                   were challenging the fact that Mr. Muna 

          8                   was present in Bamako.  So we have heard.  

          9                   We have listened.  Let me just tell you 

         10                   this is not the way this Court proceeds.  

         11                   There are limitations.  Otherwise, we are 

         12                   going to be here until tomorrow.  It is 

         13                   the applicant who has the last word, 

         14                   always.

         15    MR. WEBSTER:

         16                   Your Honour, but if he says something 

         17                   that raises a factual issue, then I am 

         18                   stating --

         19    THE PRESIDENT:

         20                   Now, if you make a comment, I am going to 

         21                   give the floor to the accused again.  The 

         22                   accused has the last word on this 

         23                   specific point. 

         24                   

         25                   You can't be consulting with -- you will

          1                   be allowed to take the floor on a 

          2                   specific point, that is, on the presence 

          3                   of the Prosecutor in Bamako.  You have 

          4                   the floor on that point.

          5    MR. WEBSTER:

          6                   The presence of the Prosecutor or the 

          7                   Deputy Prosecutor in Bamako and anything 

          8                   that the Prosecutor made have said or 

          9                   allegedly said to the accused has nothing 

         10                   to bear on the legality of the procedure 

         11                   of the arrest.  The Prosecutor is not 

         12                   under any obligation, legal or moral, to 

         13                   communicate with the accused.  

         14                   

         15                   The requirements of the Statute with 

         16                   regard to Rule 40 is to make a request to 

         17                   the State to effect an arrest.  There is 

         18                   no requirement in the Statute that an 

         19                   arrest warrant be prepared or be 

         20                   communicated to the accused before he is 

         21                   taken into custody.  An arrest warrant is 

         22                   issued upon confirmation of the 

         23                   indictment.  That was done in this case.  

         24                   The indictment was prepared within the 

         25                   guidelines of Rule 40 bis.  And on that

          1                   basis the Prosecutor submits that the 

          2                   arrest was legal, and this Court should 

          3                   deny the accused's application in all 

          4                   respects.  

          5                   

          6                   Thank you.

          7    MR. PRESIDENT:  

          8                   That is what I fear, you have just 

          9                   repeated exactly what you have said.  

         10                   That is not the way these proceedings go.  

         11                   You have just repeated what you had 

         12                   stated earlier.  You are going back on 

         13                   something you had already elaborated on.  

         14                   That is not the way things should 

         15                   proceed.  

         16                   

         17                   I will give the floor again to Mr. 

         18                   Ngirumpatse to express his  --

         19    THE ACCUSED:  

         20                   Thank you, Your Honour.  And I thank you 

         21                   a lot considerably for your kindness.  

         22                   

         23                   When the Prosecutor says that the Deputy 

         24                   Prosecutor Muna was not bound to see me, 

         25                   I agree in fact.  But I didn't call him.

          1                   I didn't invite him.  He came on his own, 

          2                   and he made a false statement.  And I 

          3                   duly noted that, and I have merely 

          4                   communicated this to the Presiding Judges 

          5                   who have to rule on these proceedings.  

          6                   

          7                   Thank you.

          8    MR. PRESIDENT:

          9                   In which case, therefore, the proceedings 

         10                   are over.  We now move on to 

         11                   deliberation.  A decision will be handed 

         12                   down subsequently to the parties.  We 

         13                   stand adjourned.
