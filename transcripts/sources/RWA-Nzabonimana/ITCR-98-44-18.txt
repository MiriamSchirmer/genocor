because of that, there has to be some

to alert the Court that that has been done.

11
12

The third item before calling the witness is

13

that I indicated that we would deal with it

14

on a witness-by-witness basis and that is

15

there are some corrections or clarifications

16

which we need to be made between the English

17

and the French and I didn't bring this to

the Prosecutor's attention before because

19

the person who had done the comparisons is

20

Mr. Baragahoranye and he has just returned

here and I had an opportunity to consult

22

with him over the weekend as we were going

over the witness statement.

25

There are about just three areas that we
KELLY ALLEMANG - OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER

10

KAJELIJELI

need some clarity because the differences

between the French and the English in terms

of the meaning is significant enough that we

feel that we need to know what is the

witness saying with respect to those

6

provisions.

indulgence, I would just like to point those

8

three areas out to the Prosecution team and

maybe they can give us some clarification

three items that I want to bring to the

have you already indicated the discrepancies

to the Prosecution?

our attention, we will certainly attempt to

raising what my learned friend has said with

the Prosecutor at an early date.

that very promptly if my learned friend

discrepancies in witness statements.

11

same provision, and indicate what he

translates that to be.

MR. BARAGAHORANYE:

14

Thank you.

15

"During the period when he was not

16

bourgmestre, in addition to having

17

participated actively in the training of

19

word "training."

20

21

this is the confusion that needs to be

22

clarified.

23

That sentence in French reads:

Does training mean
So

PROFESSOR HINDS:

24

The issue is whether or not the witness is

saying that Mr. Kajelijeli trained the youth

says.

think that is what Mr. Fleming has.

4

am told in the French, it is he established

5

the -- or founded -- established or founded

6

7

if we're dealing with training or what

precisely is the witness saying with respect

to that?

10

That is what I am looking at.

I
Or, I

We need to know

MR. FLEMING:

11

I am informed by my expert that information

12

can mean either of those, so we can expect

13

it from the witness himself.

14
15
16

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
PROFESSOR HINDS:

17

My understanding is that the witness did

18

not, in fact, speak French and so I wanted

19

to know what he said.

20

speak French.

21

That's what I am told.

22

not what the translator said, it is what the

23

witness said.

24

saying they really don't know themselves,

25

okay.

The witness did not

He spoke Kinyarwandan.
So the question is

But if the Prosecution is

That's fair enough.

the afternoon of the same day, he went to

5

that that is not what that statement says.

Mr. Baragahoranye.

7

We are now in the third

In the French, I am told

MR. BARAGAHORANYE:

8

In the French version, in the fourth

9

paragraph, first line says:

"In the

10

afternoon of the same day he went close to

11

or near Kajelijeli's bar," which is totally

12

different from what appears in English.

13

English it says "he went to Kajelijeli's

14

bar," whereas he went close to or near.

15

MR. FLEMING:

16

Again, I am informed that the French can

17

mean he walked close to the bar.

PROFESSOR HINDS:

19

Okay.

So therefore what we have in the

English is incorrect, meaning that he went

to the bar.

MR. FLEMING:

The English is the translation and the

translation has been shown to be incorrect

on at least two occasions in this particular

one, which of course says nothing about the

credibility of the witness.

Yes, maybe Professor Hinds would like simply

with regard to your first issue, the Trial

17

Chamber simply notes that on the information

18

that we, I think we can go beyond that,

except to assure that those who appear
