(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding; Judge Hökborg; and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 1st of December 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor verses Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appearances are the same?  

I would just like to apologise for our late start this morning, and I wouldn't try to explain that the reason why we are late was because I was earlier than usual. 

In regard to the matter that was brought to our attention just before we broke yesterday afternoon, we have decided to allow the question -- we decided to allow the question to be answered.  We feel that we should say that, in our view, the weight that will be attached to this matter, or to these matters, will be affected by the way in which the witnesses, who it is being sought to discredit, were questioned in cross-examination, the witness who it is now being sought to discredit.  So this will affect the weight that we attach to this line of evidence. 

The other comment I want to make is that we have noted that too much time has been spent on the issue of objections and counter-arguments, and we want to suppress that as much as possible.  So we want to suppress it as much as possible.  So we are going to request that if objections are required -- if objections are required, they are made very briefly, and that any responses are also made as briefly as possible.  And we would prefer it if there was not a continuous argument on these issues, unless we requested further information from counsel. 

Madam Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  I have to remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began giving your testimony yesterday.  Counsel will continue examining you.  
WITNESS 7/18,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you please be provided with the document you had yesterday?  I'm afraid that's not the exact -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's one other comment I should make.  Mr. Morley, we would consider it legitimate to draw our attention to questions that were not put in cross-examination to the relevant witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
I don't want to interrupt the proceedings too much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but we would consider that to be a legitimate -- for us to be -- for our attention to be drawn to that. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps we can start with (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), the first on the list, before I move on to the other witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just mention that we were in closed session for these questions yesterday.  Are we still in closed session this morning?  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, can I invite you to invite the witness as to her preference -- the witness, her preference?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think we should start out -- objectively, if it's not needed for closed session, we should start in open session.  If the witness expresses a difficulty, then we will deal with it. 

Madam Witness, we are in open session.  If the questions that you are being asked, if you think that the answers to them are likely to leave -- reveal your identity, please draw my attention to it, and we will take what action is necessary.  

I should mention that yesterday afternoon I asked the Registrar to make some enquiries because we thought that there was a name of a person who -- in relation to whom we had made a modification of the protective orders.  That name had been mentioned by counsel in open session in circumstances where we wondered whether it should be redacted.  

MR. FRY:
Your Honour, the Defence informed me that they thought that was unnecessary. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. MORLEY:
I think I know the name Your Honour has in mind, and I think it was mentioned in closed session, so I think the problem doesn't really arise. 
MR. O'SHEA:
It was mentioned in open session, but it was mentioned in a way that the connection could not be made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
MR. MORLEY:
A thought occurs to me that it may be that it's a Prosecution application, that these questions about reputation of other witnesses are in closed session, because they do potentially affect the standing of those witnesses if any of them become identifiable subsequently if these allegations, which are, as we mentioned yesterday, not substantiated with detail and were not put in any detail to the witnesses originally, are made public knowledge.  So it would be my application, thinking about it on my feet, that we should continue in closed session as we were yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we accept what you said, but only to a limited point, that if the answer is likely to reveal the identity of the protected witness, then that should be in closed session.  But if it is just attached to a pseudonym or to a number which is the relationship to the individual is not clear, then we think it should be in open session.  But if the question evokes an answer which could reveal the identity of the witness being spoken about, we think that it should be in closed session.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, you may continue. 
MR. HOOPER:
I dealt with (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) yesterday.  I'm going to move on to another witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In this instance, it would be preferable if you could use the number on your list, rather than the pseudonym of the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we redact (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I couldn't understand what Mr. O'Shea was saying to me just now.  Can I have that reference to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have just made the order.  
MR. HOOPER:
You have, thanks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The reference to the pseudonym should be redacted. 
MR. HOOPER:
To number 1.  Before I move on from him, I am inviting the Prosecution to indicate if -- what, if any, allegations were not made or were made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Hooper, I don't think that's necessary. 
MR. HOOPER:
I thought you indicated that you preferred that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  I said the Prosecutor would have the right.  I had suggested that they should not interrupt.  But I thought that drawing our attention to allegations which were not made in cross-examination would be legitimate.  So I told him that what I said did not refer to that.  But that's only if he wishes to do it. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, you've got that list in front of you.  Can you do me a favour and tick the four names that you ticked yesterday, because the original document isn't available, and we need to just have that marking on there.  I think you ticked number 1.  Can I invite you to do that exercise again?
A.	I don't have a pen.
Q.	You dealt with number 1.  Can I take you to number 8, please, and ask you about that man's general reputation for truthfulness and any particular aspects of his behaviour that you know about that may reflect on that? 
A.	I know of number 8.  I knew him well before the war.  He's a former member of the Rwandan Armed Forces.  He was a conseiller of the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) secteur.  I'm sorry. 
MR. HOOPER:
We will redact the name of the secteur, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order is made. 

MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness, to interrupt you.  Are those all your comments on number 8?  Have you finished with that?  
A.	I can say that number 8 is not a good person.  Sometimes he holds -- or he held meetings wherein he persecuted people; he caused people to be put into prison.  He's a thief.  He stole money from various locations and committed other offences that cannot be counted in different places. 
Q.	Number 9, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
For Your Honour's assistance, none of that was put. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't think that's right.  He was a thief, we said, and that he'd been in prison in Rwanda for embezzlement when he was *********** (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't need to adjudicate on these issues now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I don't know the basis on which the Prosecution are making the statement they just made. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will -- we will verify it in due course.  It gives us something to look for. 
MR. HOOPER:
Okay.  Well, our word is "embezzlement". 
MR. MORLEY:
Can we redact reference to the person's occupation?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we make the order. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, and can we come back to the Prosecution shortly, just for verification of what's said? 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Number 9, please, Madam Witness.  Do you know number 9? 
A.	Yes, I know the number 9 very well. 
Q.	How do you know him? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Can -- the interpreters did not hear the question that was put by counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  The witness obviously did because she's answering it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, there is a request that you ask the question again. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I will.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Madam Witness.  We are going to start that question again because it got lost a bit in the translation.  The question is -- you answered the first question, "Yes, I know number 9."  And then I asked you -- this is the question:   How do you know him?  In what circumstances, please? 
A.	I know him very well.  He is my neighbour.  This is somebody who doesn't tell the truth.  This is a person who held many meetings and has created small groups of people to accuse others unfairly.  He has threatened many people, telling them that if they didn't give to him something, he was going to have them put into prison.  That's all I can say so far as number 9 is concerned. 
Q.	Are you *********** that person? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Again, this will be redacted.  This next answer will be redacted and in closed session.  

	How ************* him, please? 
A.	Are we still in closed session?
Q.	The answer you are about to give will be redacted, I anticipate, but we will hear the answer first, and then Mr. President is in a better position to determine -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it is a matter which invokes it, then we should go into closed session.  
MR. HOOPER:
Then we should.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will go into closed session now.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now in open session.  Madam Witness, you have been referred to a list of names, and you have indicated four names on there, and you've told us something that you know about them.  I want to ask you this question, if I may:   When did you first mention your knowledge of these people to anyone associated with the Defence team in this case; can you remember?  When were you first asked about those people, that you can remember? 
A.	I cannot remember. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I just mention number 10, allegations in cahoots with his brother, not put; no allegations, as I recall it, who is my witness, of that level or type of dishonesty. 
MR. HOOPER:
My recollection, for what it's worth, is that he was asked whether he knew of any killings by the RPF.  He was not able to assist.  When specific names of people who had been murdered was put to him, he was not able to help. 
MR. MORLEY:
But that is not the same thing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but now our attention has been drawn to it, we will review it at the appropriate time. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, do you remember on the 23rd of November this year being shown that list -- being shown that list by me? 
A.	Yes.  I remember that the counsel showed me that list.  Actually, my understanding was that it had to do with all the persons that had come to see us before the counsel came to see me; otherwise, I do remember that the counsel showed me that list. 
Q.	So, let me then ask -- go back -- well, not go back.  Let me ask you this question:   Aside from being shown those names by being shown that list a short time ago by me, can you remember if, before that date, you had given anyone else associated with the Defence team that information, or not? 
A.	No.  No one else in the Defence showed me this list.  I met (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) of the Defence, but I do not remember that he showed me this list. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  I want to ask you now about André Rwamakuba.  You told us a little about him, when you'd last seen him.  Did you know a member of the family called Michel Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know whether André Rwamakuba's father played any part in the death of Michel Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Michel Ngirumpatse died when we had already fled.  We were no longer in ********.  But before that, people who cannot be believed said that it was his father-in-law who delivered him over to the enemy.  But during the gacaca sessions, people clearly explained the circumstances under which Michel Ngirumpatse was killed. 
Q.	And as your understanding is, what were the circumstances that you've learned through the gacaca? 
A.	The assailants took him out of the house, took him outside, and they killed him with machete blows.  That is how he died. 
Q.	Do you know which house he was taken from? 
A.	His wife, his children and the public say that the assailants took him from the house to kill him. 
Q.	Is that his own home, or another home? 
A.	They took him from his own house where he lived.  But there is another version to the effect that he had first gone to seek refuge at the home of his father-in-law; that his wife came and fetched him from his father-in-law's place, put him in his own house, and that is where the Interahamwe found him. 
Q.	And did Michel's children survive? 
A.	Yes, all his children survived. 
Q.	Now, from all you learned then at the time, and we've heard your history, from the discussions that you've told us about at the Rutare camp, in the discussions since then over the past 11 years and from the gacaca hearings that you've attended, from all that, have you ever heard anyone make an allegation against André Rwamakuba in respect to the events in Gikomero commune? 
A.	I heard no one talk about him, either in the camp of Rutare where there were many displaced persons who could exchange information, or elsewhere.  In Rutare, we talked about the vehicles who came to our homes, and soldiers, and any other person who may have come to our place, but we never talked about Rwamakuba.  

	When I returned to my home, I never heard Rwamakuba discussed in connection with the massacres.  Some people heard about his arrest on the radio and were surprised by this -- the indictment that followed.  Up until now, people still wonder about it. 
Q.	Indeed.  Thank you, Madam Witness.  Just wait there, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam, the rules, I think I mentioned to you earlier, require you to answer the questions of the designated legal officer.  You now have to answer the questions put to you by counsel representing the Prosecution.  I think you will be questioned by Mr. Morley.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Madam Witness, you made a statement to the Defence on the 21st of July of 2004; do you remember that? 
A.	I do not remember the date. 
Q.	Can you remember the person you met who was helping the Defence? 
A.	I met two people.  First I met (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and afterwards I met with the Defence counsel who is here in Court. 

MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask that (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), and an earlier reference to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) be redacted at this stage for reasons known to the Chamber and which I can go into in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Redacted. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you met with the first person, where was that? 
A.	He found me at my home. 
Q.	When you met with him, was your husband present? 
A.	He was not there. 
Q.	Did your husband ever meet with that first person? 
A.	He met him, but I don't know when this meeting took place.  I don't know the date. 
Q.	If your meeting with the first person was the 21st of July, did your husband meet with the first person before you, or after you? 
A.	I don't remember.  You know, I didn't pay attention to that detail. 
Q.	Did your husband meet with the first person the day after you met with the first person? 
A.	No.  My husband did not meet him the following day because he was not present the following day.  I am certain of that.  They did not meet the day after my meeting with the person in question. 
Q.	If there exists a statement dated the day after yours from your husband to the first person you met, you would say that statement cannot have been taken on that day; is that right? 
A.	I cannot accept that, because I know where my husband was the day after I met with the person in question.  Considering where my husband was at the time, he would not have been able to meet that person the following day.  So I cannot agree that there is a statement which was taken the day after I gave my own statement. 
Q.	But you don't know what we know; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I do not know all you know, but as concerns that date, I know perfectly well that my husband did not meet this person. 
Q.	Any statement dated the day after your meeting would have to be in some way a misrepresentation; would that be right? 
A.	Yes, that is true as far as I'm concerned.  I wouldn't accept the existence of such a statement which  is -- was purportedly taken the day after my own statement was taken. 
Q.	You are quite clear that your husband did not meet with the first person on the same day as you; that would be right, yes? 
A.	It's true. 
Q.	Your statement is four pages of typed typescript long.  Have you seen it since it was taken? 
A.	I did not see the typed statement.  As I told you, this man came to my home, and he put questions to me while taking down notes in writing -- by hand, I beg your pardon.  He went away, and I did not see any typed statement after that.  I never met him again. 
Q.	Is it right that you have no idea what that first person has written down as being what you said? 
A.	I have no opinion to give on the matter.  He may have made some mistakes in the statement.  That is understandable.  But if he did make any mistakes in writing out my statement, in typing it out, that is, well then, I can correct these mistakes if they are brought to my attention. 
Q.	What mistakes do you think he's made? 
A.	You have not yet told me about the contents of my statement, so I cannot discuss it.  I am telling you about my statement to this man on that date.  But I cannot answer your question because you have not read out my statement that I gave to this man so that I can confirm or contradict it.  What I am saying is that it is possible that a person who is taking notes could make mistakes.
Q.	Have you been told that there may be mistakes in your statement? 
A.	No, no.  I am answering your question.  You asked me what I would say if the situation was this way or that way, so I have asked you to draw my attention to the contents of my statement.  And when I have perused, or got to know what it is that is in my statement, then I can confirm or deny what it says. 
Q.	How many times have you met with counsel, Mr. Hooper? 
A.	I met him twice.  The first time was in Rwanda, the second time was here. 
Q.	We know, from Mr. Hooper being helpful a moment ago, you met him here on the 23rd of November.  Can you help us when it was when you saw him in Rwanda?  Was it in July of this year? 
A.	I don't remember.  I didn't take down the dates.  In any case, there have not been many years since our meeting in Rwanda.  Just please note that I did not take down the date so I would memorise it. 
Q.	Have you really no idea when you met Mr. Hooper in Rwanda?  Can you give us no idea at all? 
A.	I think that it was in the course of this year, but I do not remember the month.  As I have already told you, it's not been a space of years since we met in Rwanda.  I think it was this year, but I really don't remember the month because I didn't take down the date and the month. 
Q.	Did you meet Counsel Hooper at your home or at another location? 
A.	We met in Kigali. 
MR. HOOPER:
I can give the date from a photograph I took at the time.  Its date is 25th of July at 10:48 a.m. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Had you met any lawyers in any other cases before you met Mr. Hooper? 
A.	No, none. 
Q.	It must have been a memorable moment, meeting Mr. Hooper. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In your testimony yesterday, you have helpfully told us a variety of dates, do you remember, about what happened in 1994? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	You were asked to put forward dates in respect of what happened in 1994 when you met with the first man on the 21st of July of 2004; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, I follow. 
Q.	You offered a variety of dates drawing on your memory from more than ten years before; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	You cannot remember at all the month in which you met, memorably, Mr. Hooper.  All you seem to remember is that it was sometime this year; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	It is strange, is it not, that you cannot remember even the month that you met Mr. Hooper? 
A.	It's not that strange, no. 
Q.	That may be for others to judge.  Let's move on to another matter.  

	Whilst you're here in Arusha, are you staying with your husband? 
A.	We are together. 
Q.	When he was giving his evidence, were you together in the evenings? 
A.	Here in Arusha?  No. 
Q.	Perhaps I misunderstood you.  While you are here in Arusha, are you staying with your husband? 
A.	Are you referring to our residence, the place where we are lodged?  Are you saying that we are living together in the same house, in the same building?  Or are you saying that we meet here in Arusha?
Q.	Well, you tell us.  
A.	We are here in Arusha as witnesses, both of us, but we do not spend the night together.  We are not in the same residence.  Besides, I don't know where he is lodged. 
Q.	Have you met with him whilst you've been in Arusha? 
A.	I saw my husband before he came to give testimony here before this Trial Chamber.  But from the time he began to give evidence, I did not see him again, and I do not know where he is. 
Q.	Where did you see your husband before he gave evidence? 
A.	I met him in the house where he is lodged.  He came here before me.  Some days afterwards, I met him in the house where he is living, but this was before he began to give testimony before this Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Who took you to meet him? 
A.	You know, I do not know the vehicles that are here, and I do not know the drivers who drive these vehicles.  I came here, I was taken to a place where I was supposed to be lodging, and I do not speak the same language as these people.  So I went to this place; I saw my husband; he was lodging there.  I did not stay there many days because we were separated afterwards. 
Q.	How many days did you spend with your husband? 
A.	I think it was four days.  I'm not very sure. 
Q.	You were both here to give evidence before this Tribunal; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you were in the same residence as your husband for four days, were either of you, or both of you, ever visited by any of the Defence? 
A.	I met the Defence counsel after my husband had left.  When my husband left to go and give his testimony before the Trial Chamber, nobody ever came to meet my husband in my presence.  I never saw my husband meeting anyone whatsoever of the Defence team.  Rather, I am the one who met the Defence team, and this was only after my husband had left to go and give his testimony before the Trial Chamber. 
Q.	When you were together for four days, did your husband meet the Defence team during that period? 
A.	I have just explained to you that I have never seen Defence counsel who came and met my husband in my presence.  I have told you that my husband came here before me in Arusha.  He was here for a week before I came.  And when I got here, we stayed together for a number of days, and then he went to appear before the Chamber to give his testimony.  And it is after he had left that I personally met the Defence counsel. 
Q.	Did your husband move from the residence together when he was giving evidence? 
A.	From the time he was brought here to appear before the Trial Chamber, I never saw him again.  He did not come back to the residence or to the house in which we were, and I can't tell you if he is still here in Arusha or not.  I don't know where he is at the moment. 
Q.	During the four days before he gave his evidence and moved from the residence together, while you may not have seen or been present for a meeting between your husband and the Defence, do you know of whether one took place? 
A.	No.  I am not aware.  You see, we were together with other persons who had lodged in the same house, and it would have been difficult to mention those things in the presence of all those other persons.  But to my knowledge, since my arrival here -- since my arrival in that house, he never met a member of the Defence team. 
Q.	All right.  Now, we will move along.  Your husband was about to give testimony, and for the four days beforehand you and he are together.  We're agreed on that, are we? 
MR. HOOPER:
I doubt if I can assist because this would not be a matter that the witness would know about.  Her husband arrived at the beginning of this session as a witness.  He was here for the -- our first week, which was the 7th.  So he'd been here some days before that in a safehouse for -- and his wife was brought to Arusha for the subsequent week, so to be here for the week of the 14th.  It's probable, if she was brought by a UN Beechcraft, that she came on a Friday, she'd have been put in, and was put in, safehouse four.  

Her husband was due to give evidence and was brought here to give evidence, but I think he was here for four or more days before he gave evidence.  But my recollection is that WVS then placed him in a different safehouse from that point.  So it wasn't just at the time he gave evidence or started giving evidence, but my recollection is, and it could be confirmed by WVS, that it was several days before.  They separated them as soon as he was brought here as a witness, even though he wasn't effective, because of the delays we had, until the end of the week.  

As far as I know, from then on, as is the practice, the common practice, WVS keep witnesses who are giving or have given evidence separate and apart, in a separate safehouse.  I'm not sure which safehouse he was in after that.  There was a problem concerning the ************** of these witnesses, and WVS liaised between them in respect of that.  I don't know where her husband is now, whether he is here or back in Rwanda.  But I stress, the policy of WVS is active witnesses are separated.  In his case, I think that separation was several days before he actually became an active witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  That's of assistance. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So what did you talk about, the two of you, for four days before your husband went off to give evidence?  Did you talk about the events in Rwanda? 
A.	There were many people in that house.  And by the way, even though we are married, we could not spend a night together.  

	Concerning the events of Rwanda, these are events that are known to all of us.  They are not events that we broach in our day-to-day conversations.  It was not necessary for him to ask me questions on the events.  And besides, he had not yet started giving evidence to the extent that he could tell me how things were going on before the Judges.  Therefore, I can tell you that we did not discuss those matters. 
Q.	You're not dealing with day-to-day events, if you're in Arusha, both of you, preparing to give evidence; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The purpose of coming here was to tell of events in Gikomero commune in 1994; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	The events of Gikomero commune in 1994 would have been on both of your minds; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.  We had that present in our minds, but we didn't have to wait to be here -- to come here, to have those things on our minds.  We could have talked about them in our homes.  Besides, we knew that we were going to come here as witnesses.  It was therefore not necessary for us to discuss those issues in front of everyone, in front of all those people.  Besides, it wasn't a matter of priority in our conversations.  He had not yet started giving evidence, and therefore had nothing to teach me.  Well, I've told you that we had those -- well, you see, we had those matters on our minds because we are here, but that's not true.  We have always had those things on our minds.  Even while we were back home in Rwanda, we have had to discuss those events.  We therefore did not have to wait to come here to discuss them. 
Q.	You discussed them together, maybe with nobody else present, but surely you discussed the events in Gikomero commune together in 1994? 
A.	Are you alluding to a discussion that I would have had with my husband here?  No, in that case.  While we were at the residence here we did not broach that subject.  But in Rwanda, I will say this to you:  We thought about those events, we discussed them, and as far as we are concerned, these are events that we cannot forget. 
Q.	Have you discussed the Kayanga health centre together? 
A.	Yes, we discussed them in Rwanda.  You know, at a certain point in time we were together, and for the period that we were together, it wasn't necessary to discuss the period since we saw what we did together.  But prior to his arrival in Kayanga, there were things that had happened, and we discussed what had happened.  I told him what had occurred.  We were together in Kayanga.
Q.	There is no mention in your statement of the 21st of July of 2004 of what you have given evidence of yesterday as happening at the Kayanga health centre; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I understand. 
Q.	It is a fact that in the statements made by your husband, three in number -- one in 1999, one on the 5th of April 2004, one allegedly on the 22nd of July 2004 -- there is no reference to what happened, consistent with the evidence you gave yesterday, at Kayanga health centre; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, I do understand that. 
Q.	When did you each start remembering about Kayanga health centre? 
A.	Actually, I have never forgotten those events, but at the time that the events were occurring, I store them -- I have them in my memory.  They are bleak events that you cannot forget.  It is easy to forget the good things that befall you in life, but it is not easy, or it is not that easy to forget the misadventures or the bad things that befall you.  I therefore have a very strong memory of those events. 
Q.	You may not be aware of it, but the most significant part of your evidence relates to the Kayanga health centre here at this Tribunal; do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	Who helped you to remember what happened at the Kayanga health centre; was it the Defence? 
A.	But how do you expect the members of the Defence team to help me remember what had happened when they were not present at the time of the events?  You know, I kept a diary in my underwear at the time of the events, and when (unintelligible) took place, that was calm -- when the RPF troops, especially at Gasabo, I recalled what had happened because my memory was alive at the time, and I wrote down the incident that had just occurred.  That is the reason, wherefore, I cannot forget what happened at Kayanga.
Q.	We would like to see the diary, please.  Can you produce it? 
A.	I don't have that small diary.  When we left Kayanga, I was in the hands of RPF troops.  I kept that diary in a pair of shorts that I was wearing under my loin.  And when we got to a location, we were shot at.  The soldiers were on the Zurcal (phonetic) hill, which was Habyarimana's hill, whereas we had our clothes that we had put out to dry, so we ran away leaving our clothes behind.  There are even some people who left even their children behind in trying to save their lives, and that is where I left my diary.  However, the events are fact that I had written down in my diary and remained etched in my memory.  
Q.	So why did your memory not extend to describing what happened at the Kayanga health centre in your statement of the 21st of July 2004, in the same way that you did yesterday? 
A.	The person who put questions to me, that is the one who took my statement, did not ask me detailed questions as did the Defence counsel during the examination that we had here.  I therefore gave the investigator answers that are not as detailed as the ones that I gave here.  And you would understand that I was giving answers depending on the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	Your explanation for the difference -- and we will come to the differences in a moment -- between what is in your statement and what your evidence was yesterday is:  "It's all the investigator's fault, he didn't ask me about Kayanga," is that it? 
A.	You've just told me that my evidence is different from what I gave.  I stated to the person who asked me the questions the first time around, and my answer is that that person did not ask certain questions.  And I would like to add that here in the courtroom there are certain things that may come back to mind, depending on the questions that are put to me.  

Now, as concerns my interview with the investigator, he asked me questions to which I gave answers relating the events and telling him what the various locations that I went by or passed through.  I was not able to give lots of details, but when I started giving evidence yesterday, specific and detailed questions were put to me, and this made it possible for me to give more ample details.  And that is why you are able to see the difference between my statement and my evidence. 
Q.	You don't have a clue what the difference is, do you? 
A.	I remember in broad terms what I told investigator.  You probably should draw my attention to the inconsistencies or contradictions between my statement and my evidence, and thence forward I will be able to give you my opinion or point of view on the differences in opinion. 
Q.	Your basic proposition a little earlier was that the investigator hadn't asked you about Kayanga.  Do you remember saying that a few minutes ago?  And if there were any problems, it's because the investigator didn't ask the right questions.  That's what you were suggesting.  Do you stand by that? 
A.	What I said, rather, here is that the investigator asked me very few questions.  I did not say that he didn't put questions to me in respect of Kayanga.  He did put questions to me on Kayanga because that is where I was able to survive and that is where RPF troops found me and saved me.  I am convinced that, in my statement, the investigator must have mentioned that.  He did put questions to me on Kayanga.  I cannot forget that episode of Kayanga, nor can I forget the day or the date on which I was saved. 
Q.	You remember, then, that you were asked about Kayanga when you made your statement on the 21st of July; are we agreed on that? 
A.	I do recall that. 
Q.	What did you tell him? 
A.	I haven't quite understood the meaning of your question. 
Q.	Five words:   What...did...you...tell...him? 
MR. HOOPER:
May I intervene, I hope?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'd prefer it if you didn't at this point. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you may not, but I'm addressing the Chamber. 
MR. MORLEY:
The difficulty here is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we ask the witness to take off her headphones, please?  
MR. MORLEY:
My concern is perhaps predictable.  It is often helpful to have Mr. Hooper explain things, but not at this stage.  What I'm concerned about is we are now about to have another explanation where Mr. Hooper knows are inconsistencies within the statement, which will amount to evidence, effectively, explaining away a difficulty for the witness, but not evidence which is subject to cross-examination, and based on reports to Mr. Hooper, who has the protection of counsel's robe rather than the witness box. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I object to the form that the questions are taking at this stage of the witness.  This is not a memory test.  It is a distinct unfairness to treat a witness in this manner.  In my submission, the appropriate way in which to approach it is for my friend to put the statement into the witness's hands and, indeed, to distribute it so that we all have the statement in front of us and he can take us to the discrepancies and the witness. 
MR. MORLEY:
Inevitably, that is what's coming.  I'm trying to establish from this witness, now that she says that she remembers talking about Kayanga, what she remembers saying about Kayanga.  And it will help with the context then of what will be apparent on the face of the statement. 
MR. HOOPER:
We are talking of a statement taken a year and a half ago, "What did you say in your statement taken a year and a half ago," and the witness has already told us she has never seen.  She may be able to answer the question, or try to, but wouldn't it be fairer to put the statement to her?  And if there are discrepancies, which is the point here, if there are, let us all see them, share them, and let's invite the witness's comment in respect to them.  She has given the answer in any event. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can answer the question.  She might not be able to remember.  If she can't remember, she doesn't remember.  You can put the question. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Madam Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 10:30 now, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm very sorry.  I normally keep my eye on the clock.  I do apologise.  Convenient moment?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  In fact, this morning, though, we need to take two breaks.  We will take a very short break, a five minute break now, and at 11:30 we will have the normal morning recess, or just before 11:30.  We will break at 11:25.
MR. MORLEY:
So, five minutes now, and then a break at 11:25.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short recess now.

(Court resumed at 10:48H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Yesterday in evidence you told us the brigadier intercepted you, excluded your husband and took you overnight to Rutunga marketplace; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I do remember that. 
Q.	You told us that at Rutunga marketplace, you and others were made to get out of the vehicle and the brigadier ordered Interahamwe to kill you; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	You told us that you and others dispersed, you entered into someone's house, the door was locked but the Interahamwe broke down the door; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	A bomb fell in the Rutunga marketplace, causing the Interahamwe to disperse; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I recall. 
Q.	You told us that you were loaded back in a vehicle and taken to the Kayanga health centre; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated). You told us that at the Kayanga health centre you were told that you would soon be put in a mass grave; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	You told us you stayed outside of the Kayanga health centre and watched people being brought out to be killed; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	Yes, I said so. 
Q.	You told us that when your turn came, you ran off and intercepted the bourgmestre ambulance and he tried to find you shelter; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I made that statement. 
Q.	You told us that an accountant refused you shelter and a decision was taken to take you back to the health centre, where the director placed you in the maternity ward and went to find your husband; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	You told us that you were joined by your husband.  And the next day you observed, through a window, a vehicle arrive with Interahamwe in it; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I stated that Interahamwe came in a vehicle, but that that vehicle remained outside of the health centre. 
Q.	You told us that you then observed, through the window, some unfortunate Pentecostalists being dragged out from their hiding place and being killed before you; do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I recall. 
Q.	Did you tell any of this to the investigator on the 21st of July 2004? 
A.	I don't quite recall.  I have told you that I was answering questions that were put to me.  They asked me a few questions and we discussed various subjects.  I don't quite remember, I don't know if we broached that subject or not. 
Q.	In your statement you make no reference to being taken to Rutunga marketplace; do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand you.  I believe that I mentioned that point.  We dealt with various subjects, and it has been a long time since then.  I did not think that it was going to take this much time to come and give evidence on the subject.  But I think I have given clarifications regarding the subject. 
Q.	In your statement, you describe the bomb falling in front of the Kayanga health centre; do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand you, but you should understand, I don't know if it is a bomb.  When you talk of an explosion or of a shell, I don't know what kind of shell it is.  From the explosion of the shell, the policeman who was at this spot fired a shot. 
Q.	In your statement you describe the reason for your escape from death at Kayanga health centre was because a bomb fell, or a shell fell at the health centre; do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I survived because the RPF arrived at the location.  And especially thanks to that vehicle that moved me, or carried me, otherwise the explosion of the shell caused people to disperse; otherwise, I can't explain exactly how I survived at Kayanga.  The situation was chaotic.  We were at the time of war. 
Q.	In your statement there is no mention of seeing the murder of the Pentecostalists; do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I understand you, but I still would want to say that I was only answering questions that were put to me; no more, no less.  And by the way in -- this is the same manner in which I am answering your questions as you put them to me.  If the investigators did not put questions to me on that subject, I then didn't answer questions in respect thereof or to -- nor did I discuss the subject with him. 
Q.	In your statement there is no reference to seeing any killings at the Kayanga health centre; do you understand what I have said? 
A.	I cannot forget what happened at the Kayanga health centre.  I do not know why that issue or that point was not dealt with in my statement.  How can I forget the events of Kayanga whereas there were killings there, especially as it was at Kayanga that I survived?  It has been a long time.  The investigator asked me questions, to which I gave answers.  There are issues or points that I might have forgotten but you have the original statement and you can refresh my memory. 
Q.	In your --  
A.	And I'm still ready to answer your questions. 
Q.	In your statement, you describe arriving at the Kayanga health centre on the 14th of April; do you understand what I have said? 
A.	No, it was instead on the 15th that I arrived in Kayanga; on the 14th I left my hiding place in Gishaka.  I spent the night in the bush.  And on the morning of the 15th I left my hiding place.  And that is the date on which my husband was told that I was not dead; this was in Gishaka parish.  And the person, who told my husband, sent his son to fetch me.  And we left the hiding place to go to Mucuyu.  

And on the 15th we went opposite the hospital where people were gathered, where people were being killed.  And that is where the vehicle that helped me to flee was located.  So that was on the 15th.  It was on the 15th that I got to Kayanga, I had already left Gishaka.  I did not know whether the person who took down the statement took it down correctly. 
Q.	Well, shall we look together at just how many mistakes the investigator has made, allegedly?  I'm going to read to you, in French, I will be corrected by my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, if I fail to read the appropriate section? 
MR. HOOPER: 
May we have keep copies, please, or have access to copies of the statement?  
MR. MORLEY:
My understanding, and it may be mistaken, is that Your Honours have copies of these statement. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And we would be asking --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we do have access to them. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Right, so no one wants a hard copy? I would prefer a hard copy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
One hard copy would be helpful. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, very much.  And can the witness have one?  I know it is in French, but still -- if she is taken to a passage, it still helps to see the kind of document; even through it is not in a language that she reads.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, if you turn, please, to the last page? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, my eye is on the first paragraph on the last page, beginning (French spoken); I'm just pausing to establish that we are all in the same place.  Last page.   
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Last page, Madam Witness, last page? 
A.	But I don't understand French. 
Q.	Thank you.
A.	I cannot understand this passage. 
MR. HOOPER: 
It is still helpful, but it is the last but one page; it is the last paragraph, but the last but one page. 
MR. MORLEY:
Oh, I'm sorry, you are right.  Well, we will see how we go. 

I'm going to read it in my schoolboy French.  I hope the interpreters will bear with me, the paragraph beginning:  "This is what the investigator has recorded" so Madam Witness, if you would like to listen; "A Hutu lady, a Hutu lady --" (French spoken)? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel would read sentence after sentence and pause, then I would be able to interpret after he has read every sentence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At least there was no criticism of the way that you pronounced the words. 
MR. MORLEY:
It will count.  I will start again. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	"A Hutu lady, whose first name was Constance, who is currently working in the Gikomero district, found me in Kayanga and we hid together.  Actually, we were hiding from the RPF.  

On the 14th of April the militiamen got us out into the courtyard in front of the health centre to kill us all.  Constance tried to save me in vain.  Luckily, a bomb fell right in the courtyard where the Interahamwe were preparing to finish us off.  Everyone scattered.  

And at that point, I went into the ambulance of the bourgmestre Rutaganira, who was with his wife Bamurange, Florida.  We roamed between Kayanga, Gikomero and Gasabo, before taking a final decision to stay at the Kayanga maternity where, at least, the RPF would be so kind as not to send bombs.  At that time the Interahamwe were escaping on foot, preferring to use the bush pathways because the main roads were covered by RPF soldiers."

Next paragraph: "It is on the 17th of April 1994 that the RPF found us."

Do you understand what has been read, Madam Witness?  
A.	Yes.  I understood what you read.  May I speak?  
Q.	I always hesitate to interrupt a witness; if the witness wishes to speak, then, of course.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have been permitted to speak, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I am surprised.  The passage, or its contents that you have just read, surprise me.  I do not understand whether this is my own statement or whether this is the statement given by Constance.  You have to edify me on that. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You think this is not your statement; is that right? 
A.	Many of these things didn't happen.  I am very much surprised and I am sad.  Regarding Constance who purportedly stated that we met near Rutunga, I agree.  She was never persecuted by Interahamwe.  At one point, she did leave me.  When we got to Kayanga -- when I got to Kayanga where Interahamwe and many other people were gathered, Constance was not there; she had strayed from me.  She was standing near the men.  To say that she was chased at the same time as I was, is not true.  

In my statement, I said that each time there was shelling I would flee, just like the Interahamwe did.  At some point you said that I stated that -- that I was on the same vehicle with this lady, Constance; that is not true.  I have told you that one cannot say everything.  

I asked the children also to move with the crowd because I was at the roadblock, and the Interahamwe had stopped me.  My children waited for me, but in Kayanga went away from me.  If you investigate the matter, you will realise that I was never with Bamurange.  The person who was on the vehicle with me was a trader, and there were also policemen.  I did not see this woman again once I got to Kayanga.  When they Interahamwe were killing people, this lady was off to the side.  When these people were around the common grave, I was not with this lady.  When I was at the veranda, this lady was not present.  This is a long story, this lady wasn't present.  

In any case, this statement, in this part of the statement surprises me greatly.  When we were put on board of that vehicle, this lady was not there.  How could I have said that I was hiding in the maternity, and at the same time I would be moving around with the Interahamwe?  That is not correct.  This lady, Constance, was not with me.  I couldn't move about with Interahamwe.  

The time for fooling me was over.  I knew that the RPF was very close to where I was.  I really don't know what to say about this passage, but please understand I cannot tell lies.  Moreover, I cannot like someone who hated Tutsi.

This is not how things happened.  If it were possible for people who say such things to come here and be confronted with us, it would be of some assistance to us.  Things did not happen that way.  
Q.	Have you finished?  Is there anything else that you would like to say by way of explanation? 
A.	What I can add to my statement is that the RPF, indeed, found us there where we were; but to say that I was with the person in question on board this vehicle is not true.  Unless I am crazy, the person who came to put questions to me gave me good, clear questions to me, and I answered them.  You put questions to me and I have answered your questions, following the sequence of events.  You yourself will see this.  I am giving clear and consistent testimony before this Trial Chamber.  The passage that you have just referred to surprises me.  So what shall we do?  Look, I don't come here to tell lies, and I never lie.

What I have told you is the truth.  Perhaps, there would be memory lapses due to the events that we have experienced in Rwanda, but there are some things that one cannot make mistakes about.  
Q.	Have you finished?  Is there anything else that you want to say by way of explanation? 
A.	Yes, unless you have other questions to put to me, I can continue with my explanations. 
Q.	The investigator has got wrong the date, the person you were with at the health centre, the person you were with with the bourgmestre, where the bomb fell, how you escaped with your life, has not recorded anything about what happen to the Pentecostalists, you being present with your husband in the maternity ward; the version of events which appear in this statement, you would agree, is very different from what you told us yesterday, yeah? 
A.	It is true that some details in the written document are not correct.  If you add one little letter or a zero after a figure it might be something entirely different.  But when it is said that an extra person was with us, who accompanied us; it is not true.  If I were to say that, then I would be lying, and I am not lying.  I know that lies have negative consequences, so I wouldn't lie.  I can only say that the investigator included incorrect details in the statement.  It is true that I heard an explosion.  I'm an ******************.  I cannot tell you that this is a bomb.  All I can say is that it was just an explosion.  But let me tell you that the explanations I have just provided to you are the right ones. 
Q.	If we look at the bottom --  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, before you move on, can I just interpose to say this? 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, how about her headphones off, perhaps?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, please.

Throughout her response it is plain, I think, from her response, that this witness having had a passage read to her, believes that it says in it that she is with Constance in a vehicle, it doesn't say any such thing.  And it is misleading to the witness, who doesn't have the document in a form that she understands in front of her, to be allowed to give that response that she has done at great length under that misapprehension.  It would be fairer to make it plain to her that it is not said in this statement that she is with Constance in the vehicle.  It is unfair to expect her to respond on what was a plain misapprehension.  It should have been clear to her.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour may agree that the misapprehension is on the part of Mr. Hooper.  The witness has described how she wasn't with Constance at Kayanga and how she wasn't in the bourgmestre's vehicle with his wife Florida.  So, where he is referring to not being with the woman in the vehicle, it has been my understanding she is saying that she wasn't with Florida. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I notice the time; I will just merely add this:  She quite plainly has said that Constance was there and stood by the men, quite plainly.  Why can't you let this witness deal fairly with what is, in fact, contained in this statement?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the break.  It is now 11:25. 
MR. MORLEY:
Before Your Honour rises, I would say that I would hope that there is no thought on the part of the Bench that I have been unfair.  The witness has been invited to give her long responses.  There has been a misunderstanding by the witness, that is unfortunate, but it is not because I have been unfair. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can assure you if we have a strong view on the subject we would have expressed it.  What we will do, though, we will probably just review the transcripts over the last few minutes when it comes to this stage. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I know you are in a rush to go, I request can I release my next witness, who is not a protected witness, until half past 2:00. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think so. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how long do you -- are you unlikely to finish before 12:30? 
MR. MORLEY:
Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much more do you have, just an estimate. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm really bad at this here.  About an hour, possibly less; I'm hoping to skip through the remainder of this quite quickly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I still think after the luncheon break would be fair.  We will rise now.
(Court recessed from 11:27 to 12:06) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, during the break we reviewed the draft transcript.  We think it was a storm in a teacup.  It is quite clear that there was a mistake on the part of the witness.  But it is -- but her evidence is quite clear and we will be able to make (inaudible). 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  With Your Honours' leave? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Madam Witness, we are talking about this paragraph in your statement; do you remember that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You thought, at one point, that the statement might be the statement of someone called Constance; do you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I had a problem with Constance. 
Q.	You will agree, however, that the references to your husband within this statement suggests that it is not Constance's statement, it is yourself? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth asked that you should repeat your question, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, it was clear from the witness's statement that she -- from the evidence, from our review of the transcript, that what the witness understood from your reading of the statement was not exactly what was in the statement.  So she did not understand exactly what was stated, was the content of her statement.  So she was answering your questions on a misapprehension of what was in the statement.  

So if you are going to pursue -- continue this line of questioning, you will have to put the statement back to her again, because it is quite clear that she misunderstood what was stated.  Her answers made that quite clear. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, when Your Honour says, "She misunderstood what was stated," what do you believe she misunderstood?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know, but she was denying certain things which were not in the statement.  She was giving explanations which were not consistent.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is the point, so she misunderstood what was said to her.  
MR. MORLEY:
It doesn't follow that she misunderstood what was said to her.  She certainly gave explanations which were inconsistent with what was in the statement.  It doesn't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, she did not know.  Her only knowledge about -- you have not shown the statement to her in a language which she can understand, so the only knowledge she has is what she heard you say.  So what was misunderstood was what you told her.  That was the misstatement. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, but as Your Honour raised it, I read about 12 lines from the statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is saying that she misunderstood what was put to her. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I told you that I reviewed the transcript.  I get a realtime feed from what transpired, and I reviewed exactly what was said by yourself and the witness.  And I was giving you an opinion that I formed from that.  I didn't think it mattered very much in terms of what has happened up to now, but you are pursuing the same line of questioning.  And I think it would be fair to the witness to read the statement to her again. That is all I am saying.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm not pursuing the same line of questioning.  Your Honour has made observations before the next question.  All I want to establish is what appears at the bottom of the statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was only my comment.  I thought you were pursuing the same line and if necessary, it would have been fair to put it to her again. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I see that, if I were going to pursue the same line, yes.

Perhaps, if the witness might put the headphones back on.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Madam Witness, if we look at the bottom of this statement, it reads, and I will read it in French;   (French spoken).
"Testimony taken or statement taken on the 21st of July 2004 and jointly signed by the witness and the investigator."

This statement records that you signed it.  Did you sign it, the notes which were made by the investigator?  
A.	I really don't remember. 
MR. MORLEY:
Is Mr. Hooper able to assist?  Were the investigator's notes signed, please?  
MR. HOOPER: 
As far as we can tell, no. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, what does that mean, "As far as we can tell," do we have the notes to be able to say they weren't signed?  
MR. HOOPER: 
The answer is no.  The answer is no to was it signed. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Within the statement, can you recall how long you spent with the investigator? 
A.	Are you referring to the investigator who took my statement?  
Q.	Yes, I am referring to the investigator who took your statement.  How long did you spend with him? 
A.	He found me at home.  I think we spent about an hour together because he seemed to me to be in a hurry. 
Q.	What language was being spoken, Kinyarwanda?  Was there an interpreter?  How was the interview conducted? 
A.	We talked in Kinyarwanda, there was no interpreter with him. 
Q.	So the investigator was able to speak to you in your language; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Within the statement you refer to there having been MDR meetings in the Gikomero commune.  Do you recall that there were MDR meetings in the Gikomero commune? 
A.	I wasn't much interested in political rallies because we were not members of any political party.  All I remember, and all I told him was in response to the question he put to me about whether I had seen Rwamakuba.  And I answered that I had seen Rwamakuba come to that place.  I do not know whether I should continue with my explanation in closed session because I am worried that my identity may be revealed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One moment, please, for a discussion. 

Thank you very much for the time.  We can proceed. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	We probably don't need to go into closed session.  You agree that Rwamakuba came to the area to attend MDR meetings; would that be right? 
A.	No, I never saw him come to the rallies. 
Q.	You yourself did not attend the rallies; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	No, I never took part in any rally. 
Q.	You were aware, though, that Rwamakuba would attend some of those rallies; would that be right? 
A.	I didn't hear about it because I didn't move about much.  But I was going to explain to you the circumstances under which I saw him, just the once.  I would also tell you the reasons why I did not go to these rallies; that is why I asked for a closed session. 
MR. MORLEY:
Unless Your Honour is interested in this, I'm anxious to avoid going into closed session.  It is not relevant to my line of examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam, the particular question that was asked can be answered without revealing your identity.  So, if you can try to give a short answer, it may shorten the proceedings. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You were aware of vehicles with microphones and loud speakers on them traveling through the area, calling people to MDR rallies; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I heard these vehicles go passed on the road.  Since we lived on the top of a hill, I could hear these vehicles going passed, calling people to come to rallies.  They were doing this through the megaphone.  I also heard people say that when the people who were returning from rallies went passed them; the refugees threw stones at them.  I wasn't present, I just heard about it from other people. 
Q.	There being refugees throwing stones, the incident you are referring to, would it be right, would have been late 1993, sometime earlier in 1994, some months just before the genocide? 
A.	I don't remember the year very clearly.  All I remember is that it was before the war and that these vehicles bearing megaphones went around calling people to take part in these rallies.  That is why I was asking for a closed session so that I would better explain why I did not feel the need, or the inclination, to take part in these rallies.  
Q.	You know the Rwamakuba family; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, I know the Rwamakuba family. 
Q.	You know Rwamakuba's mother and you knew his father; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You knew Rwamakuba's sister and her husband Michel Ngirumpatse?
A.	That is right. 
Q.	You know the children of Michel and Rwamakuba's sister; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	You know that Rwamakuba has an older brother; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You know that Rwamakuba would sometimes spend time with his older brother in Kigali; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Have no idea.  All I know is that I remember telling the investigator that the older brother had built a house in his native village, and that during baptisms and other ceremonies Rwamakuba would come.  Although he didn't come very often, but when there were ceremonies, the entire family would gather and celebrate in the house that had been built by Rwamakuba's older brother.  Apart from that, I do not know about his visits to his eldest brother in Kigali. 
Q.	You are aware that the Rwamakuba family were running a school in the local area; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I know. 
Q.	You would recognise their house; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You have known the family for many years; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	I have known the family since I got married.  I know the family.  I have known their family for more than 30 years. 
Q.	You like them, don't you? 
A.	I don't hate them, but I cannot say that I have any special relationship with this family. 
Q.	You are aware that for various ceremonies and family festivals and family events, all of the brothers and sisters would come back to the parents' home; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, all of the children of the family would meet at their parents' home. 
Q.	During the genocide, you would imagine that members of that family would be concerned for each other; wouldn't that be right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	That you would expect members of the family to try and help one another, wouldn't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You would expect members of the family to try and use whatever influence they might have to ensure the family is all right; would that be right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Rwamakuba, at the time of the genocide, became a minister; you know about that, yes? 
A.	I have already told you that I heard people talk about it.

1230H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You would not expect him to abandon his family, would you? 
A.	He couldn't abandon his family, but the fact that he did not get to his native village to evacuate them, well, it means something.  If he had got to his village, he would have evacuated his family and his brother-in-law would not have been killed, perhaps. 
Q.	But his family was not under threat, was it?  It was Tutsi families under threat.  When it comes to evacuation, it would be all about evacuating Tutsis.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	That is the case.  Rwamakuba is not a Tutsi.  But if he had got to his village, he would have evacuated his mother because his mother was very old, and it is he who was looking after her.  If he had got to his village, he would have evacuated Michel's children because some of Michel's children, the older ones, fled right to Zaire.  Some lived in Kigali, and who -- they went into Zaire in exile.  If Rwamakuba had met them, he would have helped.  

They got to Goma.  When they had learned that the RPF was already in Gisenyi, they returned to Rwanda.  They were also with their sisters. 
Q.	You've just said that Rwamakuba was responsible for looking after his mother.  Do you remember saying that a moment ago? 
A.	Yes, that's what I just said. 
Q.	As the someone responsible for looking after his mother, you would expect him to make regular visits to his mother.  That's about right, isn't it? 
A.	But at that time what he did was to send money to his mother so that work could be done on the house.  His father was still alive.  Even the household staff said that all he did was send money to his mother so that she could use it if she needed it.  That is why he didn't come to their home very often.  
Q.	Last question before the break.  

So not only do you know the family, you know the household staff, do you? 
A.	I've told you that I do not meet the family of Rwamakuba regularly.  As to the workers, they were working in their farms, and there are no more of these workers.  There are not quite as many as there were before.  Actually, some come and go because today the family does not have the wherewithal to pay the staff, the workers.  They can only give them bunches of plantains or other foodstuff as remuneration.  They do not have the financial means to pay them.  

But I must emphasise that I did not see these people often before the war; that is, I did not see the family.  
Q.	Supplementary last question.  

So you know about their finances and about what financial shape they're in as a family; is that right? 
A.	Today, the family does not have enough money.  Before the war, the family had enough money because the sons -- the sons gave money.  For example, today, the house of the old woman is in a sorry state.  It needs repairs, and she does not have the means to have her house repaired.  
MR. MORLEY:
Is that a convenient moment?  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just before you rise, to save time, I was going to ask leave of the Chamber to permit a Kinyarwanda speaker to read the statement to the witness over the luncheon adjournment to save time later this afternoon when, otherwise, it would be done then -- I'd request that it was done then -- so that I can ask her questions about it.  But she's had the opportunity of having it translated, because it hasn't been done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objections?  
MR. MORLEY:
No objection to the act of translation, but no lawyers to be present.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Fry?  Mr. Fry?  
MR. HOOPER:
As a -- as a practical means of doing it, the witness will be taken for lunch.  And there are Kinyarwanda-speaking WVS at the safehouse, and so I -- it may be that, if one invites the witness to take the statement with her, she can also use the luncheon adjournment to invite one of these persons to translate the statement to her.  I don't need it to be done very formally, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We've already -- the registrar has already agreed to make appropriate arrangements. 
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what we were discussing -- so that was done very quickly.  So I think that is already in place.  

The -- we were just discussing our meeting at 2 o'clock.  It's just a meeting for the litigants.  It's not going to be on the record, so we don't need the court reporters or the translators to be here until 2:30.  So we meet at 2 o'clock, and then we -- the session will resume at 2:30 this afternoon.  We think that should be enough time to complete our business.  

Madam, I just remind you that during this adjournment, as we break for lunch, that you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  We have made arrangements for the registry to allow you to have access to the statement that Mr. Morley was referring to in your cross-examination and for somebody to translate it to you in Kinyarwanda so your memory can be refreshed as to its contents.  So that will be done during the luncheon break as well.  

We take the adjournment -- 

Yes, I am reminded to confirm that we will actually use this space at 2 o'clock.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But informally.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed from 1240H to 1445H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  We can now resume our session.  Counsel will continue cross-examining you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Would it be right to suggest that you know the Rwamakuba family well, "I have come here to try and help the family"?
A.	That is true.  
Q.	When you were asked yesterday if you had seen or met Rwamakuba, your answer was to deny ever having met him.  But what you meant was during the genocide.  Do you remember that yesterday? 
A.	I remember. 
Q.	Would it be right to suggest that you understand the purpose of your evidence here is to persuade the Tribunal that Rwamakuba did not go to Gikomero commune during the genocide? 
A.	During the genocide he did not come to Gikomero.  You asked me if I know his family very well.  That is true.  I do.  But that is not the reason driving me to defend him.  Even in cases of crime, I testify that I did not see him in our area.  
Q.	And what you would suggest is that, although you didn't see him, if he had been in the area, you think you'd have heard about it.  Is that basically your position? 
A.	There are things.  You can hear people speaking of what happened.  And, secondly, I tell you, I did not see him in the area, as far as I'm concerned. 
Q.	The people who were murdered at the Kayanga health centre, the Pentecostalists, you told us yesterday that you saw them being dragged away and killed; is that right? 
A.	Originally, the people were hit with machetes at the beginning.  They were dragged away.  We could see it.  We were present on the spot. 
Q.	And when you say "we," you're referring to you and your husband, aren't you? 
A.	I'm referring to my children, because my husband -- when my husband came, the people were not in the courtyard, when we were already in the hospital.  I'm referring -- when I say "we," I mean our children.  My husband had not yet arrived.  He was still in Gikomero. 
Q.	You told us yesterday that you and your husband looked out an opaque window and saw what happened to the Pentecostalists.  Do you remember telling us this? 
A.	Yes, I told you when we were inside the building, my husband was present.  That was in the maternity ward, and it was on the 16th. 
Q.	And you told us that you were able to observe these people being dragged away and killed; is that right? 
A.	I could hear when these people were being assaulted, battered.  They were being dragged, and my husband pulled aside the curtain and took a look.  And I did as much -- I did the same thing.  And I saw them being dragged away, the assailants dragged them away to kill them. 
Q.	And you told us that your husband removed the window so that you could both look out through the opaque glass.  Do you remember telling us that?  
MR. HOOPER:
Correction.  If we can go back to the transcript, she didn't say that.  As I heard it in the English, she said something to the effect that that which was -- made the window opaque was peeled away, or words to that effect.  I think that's how it translated. 
MR. MORLEY:
I accept that.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	But the point is, is that, as I understand your evidence yesterday, your husband made it possible to look through the window so that you could both see what was happening.  Is that right? 
A.	We were inside the building.  We heard the people screaming with pain, especially the young lady I mentioned to you.  At one point the screaming stopped.  We raised the curtain to see what was going on.  We looked out, and, as I was afraid, I lay back down again on the bed in the building where we were.  
Q.	You told us yesterday you saw these people dragged away and killed.  Now, is that right or wrong? 
A.	I heard when they were being battered, assaulted, because the people were screaming with pain.  And I saw them being dragged away, but then fear and panic drove me to lay down again.  
Q.	You told us that you saw a vehicle arrive with Interahamwe in it.  Do you remember telling us that? 
A.	I didn't see the vehicle.  I heard the motor, the engine noise.  It stopped outside, but I subsequently learned that it was Michel Donet's vehicle that had been requisitioned. 
Q.	Why did you not mention any of this, about the Pentecostalists, to the investigator? 
A.	(Microphone not activated)...after having explained to me the contents of this statement, I noted that there were certain points that I hadn't mentioned.  But I was merely answering the questions put to me.  And, especially, we didn't have enough time.  

And, moreover, I didn't mention the fact that I fell out of the tree.  I didn't mention the fact that it was dogs drove me out.  It depends on the questions put to you.  I didn't say everything.  And, moreover, I didn't say everything to the second investigator.  And, again, what I said depended on what questions were put to me.  
Q.	Who was the second investigator? 
A.	I don't remember his name, but I think Defence counsel could assist -- assist me.  (No interpretation)

I got to know the name of the first investigator.  And the second time I was questioned by Defence counsel, and the third time I was again questioned by Defence counsel.  
Q.	You've told us that you saw people being hit with machetes before your husband got to Kayanga health centre.  Do you remember saying that a few minutes ago? 
A.	I do recollect that my husband had not yet arrived, so that my husband only witnessed the killing of the Pentecostalists. 
Q.	The only person you refer to being killed or hit with a machete in your statement is said to be your eldest son.  Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	I will provide some clarification on that.  When the first investigator questioned me, I told him he was a young man by the name -- it was a young man by the name of Rwiwaliza (phonetic), who was driven out of the house and hit with machetes and killed in the yard in front of our house.  

Perhaps the one who took the statement made a mistake.  It is true that our eldest son is dead, but he did not die at home.  I was referring to a boy from a -- from a family of friends near the house.  They found him under the bed when they came to steal the mattresses, came to loot the mattresses.  So the investigator made a mistake.  Our son died, but he did not die in the course of that incident.  
Q.	Do you agree that the only reference to anybody being hit on the head, or anywhere, with a machete in your statement is perhaps a mistaken reference to your eldest son, that there's no other reference to your seeing anyone struck with machetes anywhere in your statement? 
A.	I told you that other people were hiding at my place.  There was that young man.  There was a man and a woman's family.  I spoke of a boy who was killed, but there was another boy who was also slashed but did not die.  He's still in Rwanda.  
Q.	Do you agree there is no reference to you referring to seeing anybody struck with machetes at  Kayanga health centre? 
A.	At Kayanga health centre, one person was slashed -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness is pointing to some part of the body.  
THE WITNESS:
-- slashed here, and somebody else was slashed.  I don't know.  I could say that people weren't slashed when I saw them being slashed.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Do you agree that the only time you've mentioned seeing anybody struck with a machete at Kayanga health centre was a few minutes ago?  You didn't even mention it yesterday.  
A.	Don't -- don't you remember that yesterday I said that people were thrown into the mass grave?  There were people killed in Kayanga.  It's not the first time I've spoken of it.  We were asked for information on those people who were the victims of the killing, and we denounced the Interahamwe responsible for those deaths.  In the gacaca sessions, we provide that information.  
Q.	Why is there no reference to machete blows at Kayanga health centre in your statement? 
A.	I've told you that, as regards the statement in question, the investigator had his method of putting questions.  He was putting questions to me on the Interahamwe.  He put questions to me in respect of André Rwamakuba.  There were many points you did not touch upon.  

And, moreover, I can always give more ample information.  The genocide lasted over several days.  There's many events one doesn't mention.  One gradually reveals them.  It comes to them one after the other.  

I must say, death is a frightening thing.  When one is -- one's life is in danger, one is afraid.  Sometimes one forgets some things, and then there are things one recalls more easily.  It depends on the date.  I can remember bit by bit other things.  
Q.	Why is there no reference to seeing people thrown into a mass grave at Kayanga health centre in your statement? 
A.	I gave a long statement, and if you want to, you can go and check in Rwanda.  You'll see I made a long statement.  I can remember some things and mention them bit by bit as I recall them.  You must understand, there are some complicated things in respect of the genocide.  I could perhaps be asked why I didn't mention certain events, but I can always provide an explanation.  One doesn't always say everything.  
Q.	The only person you describe being killed in your statement is that poor boy at your home.  Now, I suggest that you seeing large numbers of people, or any number of people, attacked with machetes at the Kayanga health centre and dumped in mass graves, if you'd really seen that, that would have appeared loud and clear in your description of what you saw during the war.  Now, do you understand what I'm suggesting to you? 
A.	I understand you, but the investigator put questions to me about Rwamakuba.  He asked me whether Rwamakuba often came to Nduba.  Those questions were not put to me.  I'm saying this because the -- that was the subject the questions were put to me on.  You asked me to give you explanations on certain things.  The others did not.  
Q.	In your statement, you recount what happened to you and what you saw after the beginning of the genocide on, you say, the 10th of April of 1994.  In it, you describe the terrible event at your home.  You describe fleeing.  You describe hiding.  You describe the difficulties you had.  You describe being separated from your family.  You describe being intercepted by the brigadier.  You describe the way your husband is excluded.  You describe your movements with the brigadier.  You describe going to Kayanga health centre.  And there is no mention anywhere in that statement, as we have established, of what you say you saw there.  Do you understand what I'm suggesting? 
A.	I understand, and I have explained.  I don't know whether you can't agree with me that we arrived in Kayanga on the 17th of April.  All depends on the questions put.  We have it for the Trial Chamber.  And for you to understand better, you can put all the questions you wish to me.  

As to the investigators, they put questions to me, which I answered.  And as far as you're concerned, I'm only answering the questions you put to me.  The fact is that I've referred to real events that really occurred, and if you want, you can make enquiries, and you will see that I am not lying.  

Moreover, the director of the health centre is presently detained, and you can ask him.  And he would not be speaking the truth if he doesn't agree that I arrived at Kayanga health centre and did not see the witness -- was not an eyewitness of the deaths of the victims at the health centre.  Everything that I have told you is true.  
Q.	Would it be fair to suggest that being outside the health centre, watching people being slashed with machetes, being thrown into a mass grave, waiting your turn, expecting that was about to happen to you and your family, as you could see it unfold in front of your eyes, that would be pretty memorable and have made a strong impression on your recollection of the events in Rwanda?  
A.	One does not forget what happened in Rwanda.  I personally cannot forget, but one can forget some details.  And I'm not the only one to be in this state of mind.  Some people, moreover, are traumatised to the point that they'll forget the people who they were with, as you've just said.  

I'm sorry.  These are serious events, especially when one asks oneself how on earth one survived such events.  And it is, therefore, very difficult to remember, to recall, every detail.  But, in any case, we make a great effort when you realise what happened. 
Q.	You -- you don't know what happened at the health centre the day before you arrived.  You didn't see anything there because you weren't there.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	How can I know what happened the day before, the day preceding my arrival?  I wasn't there yet, and I did not witness it.  
Q.	How many people did you see thrown into a mass grave? 
A.	Regarding the number of people who were thrown into that mass grave, since I was scared and since I was awaiting my turn to die, I saw women, I saw the persons that were being dragged behind the building for them to go and meet their death, I, therefore, could not count all those who were being dragged to go and be thrown into the pit, whereas I, myself, was waiting for my turn to die.  As a human being, you, yourself, should understand that, when you are waiting to die in turn, you cannot keep count of all those who are being taken to their death.  
Q.	Give us some idea, please, number.  You avoided answering the question.  What number? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you an approximate number.  Probably those who disinterred those corpses would be in a position to know the number of victims.  I saw those who were near me.  I saw women who were wailing in pain.  I saw somebody whose leg had been cut off, or amputated.  I saw a woman, part of whose head had been cut off.  I, therefore, did not carry out any investigation to know the number of persons who were thrown into that mass grave.  Probably those who exhumed or disinterred those victims and who reburied them in dignity would be in a position to know the number of victims who were put into that mass grave.  
Q.	I'll ask one final time.  Give us some idea the number of people you say you saw being dragged to their deaths and being hit with machetes.  
A.	I have talked to you about the persons that I saw and who were being struck with machetes.  I have told you that I saw people from afar and others who were before me and who were dragged behind the building.  There were whistles that were blown.  There were people who were wailing, or crying out in pain.  I was scared, and I was scared for my life and for the lives of my children as well.  My husband was not with me.  So, please, don't ask me to tell you the number of people who were dying, whereas I, myself, was waiting to die in my own turn.  When you ask me questions, I think you're making things difficult for me.  
Q.	And you never told any of this to the investigator, is this right, because he simply didn't ask you the right question? 
A.	I didn't talk about it to the investigator.  

By the way, it has been a long time.  Even if my memory were to be refreshed by reading out my statement to me -- I think it was good to read it out to me.  I told you that I did not spend much time with the investigator.  You, yourself, can see that I have spent several hours discussing with you.  If I'd had this much time with the investigators as I've spent with you, probably I would have told him many more things, compared to what I told him before. 
Q.	In your testimony there are three features of horror which you have described:  the attack on your home and the murder of one of those boys; secondly, waiting to die as people are being slashed and murdered with machetes at the Kayanga health centre before your husband arrived; and, thirdly, the death of the Pentecostalists on the 16th of paragraph, which you say you heard and, to some extent, observed.  How is it that the two features of what happened in Kayanga have never made it into any note prepared by people asking you questions of what happened to you? 
MR. HOOPER:
That's -- should be rephrased. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend's right, yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
It's not in my note because I have my note of what she said to me.  And, as I'm on my feet, can I -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Can we have your note, then, please, as you're volunteering to tell us that she's talked to you about this and you're offering an explanation to the question.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah, we'll consider that.  

Throughout this witness's evidence, we have referred to this document as her statement.  It is not her statement.  It is the interviewer's note in another language and one which was unsigned.  So in -- perhaps from now on, we can give it its appropriate status, as so much is being made about it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps we can have the original notes, as the interviewer conducted the whole interview in Kinyarwandan.  Didn't need the assistance of an interpreter.  Was able to speak plainly with this lady, and she's been able to speak plainly with him. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm not going to attract the eye of the President by getting up, I hope, merely to say one observes, indeed, that this is a note not in Kinyarwanda but in French, a note, if you like, or statement, for consumption by others than this witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend misses the point.  I'm -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen, everything that has been said is obviously on the record.  Let's get on to the evidence, please. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You have volunteered opinions about people who have given evidence before this Tribunal.  You remember doing that earlier today?  
A.	Yes, I do remember. 
Q.	Do you have a shred of independent evidence with you that anything that you've said is true? 
A.	Now, listen.  Nobody persuaded me to come and give testimony in this trial.  I think I've said this to you before.  I believe in God, and I believe that God chastises or punishes the wicked ones.  Nobody could have convinced me or persuaded me to come here to tell lies before this Trial Chamber.  

By the way, I believe that anybody who has lived in Rwanda should not allow him or herself to be influenced to come and tell lies before this Trial Chamber. 
Q.	I suggest to you that you are a partial witness, a person who is attempting to assist the Rwamakuba family, whose memory is flawed, whose versions of events to others previously has been different, and that you are biased.  Do you disagree with me? 
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  I am not biased.  I am not partial.  I have -- I have told you that I'm not a friend to the Rwamakuba family.  We have no family relationship with the Rwamakubas.  If I were partial, I would rather be on the side of the Tutsis, since I am a Tutsi.  If I wanted to, I would have -- and chose to be partial, I would rather be on the side of the Tutsis, and I wouldn't be coming here to speak on behalf of the Defence.  I am telling you the truth because I am a Christian and I am a believer, and I know that God would punish me for that.  

Nobody can compel me to become partial.  If I were to choose to be partial, therefore, I would be on the other side instead.  I, therefore, cannot be partial and choose to be on his side.  If he had committed crimes, well, I wouldn't be on the side of a criminal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Madam, you'll have to answer a few more questions from Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Hooper, how much longer -- how much time do you -- are you going to take? 
MR. HOOPER:
Twenty minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, before we start, I think that we would let you complete your examination and then take a brief recess before the next witness comes on. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  If you could just give me one moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly. 


RE-EXAMINATION  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, it -- it wasn't put to you, and so I'm going to put it to you, that the Prosecution case here is this:  Firstly, that André Rwamakuba came to Gikomero commune within the six months leading up to the genocide, and, in particular, November, December, January, and held many meetings for the MDR, and, in those meetings, exhorted the local people to arm themselves against the Tutsis and to exterminate the Tutsis.  That is their case in respect of the era that you know well.  

Now, let me ask you this:  Did you ever hear, or have you ever heard, of André Rwamakuba participating in that way at all? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the question is answered, my learned friend could see I was on my feet -- 

If the witness might take off her headphones, please.  

I respectfully submit that that is a -- an inappropriate question in re-examination.  I haven't put that scenario to the witness for the very simple reason the witness had made it clear she did not attend any of these rallies.  She was aware that rallies had taken place, and, for the purposes of cross-examination, that is enough.  

What my learned friend is seeking to do is open up a different avenue of enquiry in respect of re-examination not arising out of cross-examination.  I understand why he does it, but it's not right.  
MR. HOOPER:
It's the duty of counsel for the Prosecution to put their case to the witness.  I'm putting that case.  It wasn't put to the witness.  And I'm going to invite her comment in respect of it.  In my submission, that is proper and admissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend misrepresents, though not deliberately, the position with regard to putting one's case.  There is no direct conflict of evidence, effectively, between this witness and the description of the Prosecution version of events.  She didn't attend the rallies -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that speech is not necessary now. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think you trumped yourself with your first statement, that the Prosecution did not put this to the witness.  This is re-examination, and this is your witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
The allegation wasn't put to this witness by the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what I'm -- so then you're raising a matter which is not in cross-examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
It should have been.  The -- the witness is entitled -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you can't sort of know the Prosecutor's case for them. 
MR. HOOPER:
It was an admission, as it's been an admission with witness after witness, with the Prosecution failing to put their case to -- to witnesses.  The witness is entitled, whichever part it is, to address the central issues that involve the Accused.  It is usual for the Prosecution, the party who brings allegation, to put that to the witness.  It hasn't been done here, and I make amends for it by putting it for her, to invite her comment in respect of that allegation, so that neither she nor the Chamber are left in any doubt as to what this witness's position is in respect to that allegation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but that's not the function of re-examination. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May the Honourable President speak into the microphone, please, thank you, so the booths can hear him better.  

Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we have not allowed the question because we don't think that's a function of re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, can I sit down again and invite the Prosecution to put their case, as they properly should, to this witness and to invite her response to it?  And may I invite them to do so regularly, to each witness, as is appropriate, and as they've distinctly failed to do with each and every witness that's been called by the Defence.  

I'll give them the opportunity to put their case or not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you'll sit, I will know you're not closing your re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, not closing yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I'm not stupid, in the sense that there are certain questions that one has to weigh during the course of cross-examination.  It's pretty obvious what this witness might say -- 

Can the headphones come off the witness, please.  

It's pretty obvious what the witness might say.  But for the purposes of cross-examination, all I need to do in order to maintain the Prosecution case is to establish that this witness does not conflict overtly with the Prosecution case.  And that is established by reason of the witness answering that she didn't attend the rallies, although she knew there were rallies taking place, but she can't remember exactly when.  

And she remembers, for example, that there were microphones and loudspeakers in cars going around the area.  Comment is still available to the Prosecution, help the witness, thank you very much, but she doesn't know what was going on in the rallies.  I don't have to then blunder about, asking for this witness's opinion on what she may or may not have heard and whether she would or would not have heard it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if you put it that way, the Prosecution witnesses on this issue also hadn't attended the rallies, and they gave evidence about what they heard. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, and we elicited specific evidence about what they positively heard.  What this witness would say is the reverse.  It's negative information, namely, "I didn't hear."  And -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How do you know that's what she will say? 
MR. MORLEY:
Instinct.  And that's why Mr. Hooper is asking the question at his end of the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you each have a different instinct -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Oh, it's the same instinct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and we don't know what she would say. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it's not a question I'm -- I need to ask in terms of putting my case.  

If there was a direct conflict, for example, if the witness said, "I was attending all the rallies, and André Rwamakuba was my best friend and we used to go to everything in Gikomero and he never said anything anti-Tutsi," then I would have to challenge her because it's direct conflict with the Prosecution case.  But insofar as she said, "I didn't attend the rallies, and I didn't hear anything said about him --" 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did she say that?  You see, that's the -- that's the question Mr. Hooper wants to ask. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, she has said that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible).  That is the question that he's asking. 
MR. MORLEY:
In examination-in-chief it was said very early on, very early on.  It was one of those -- if you remember the -- it was almost the first question my learned friend asked.  

So on the -- on the narrow point of putting one's case, it doesn't arise on -- in the way Mr. Hooper wants it.  And I understand why he wants it that way, but he can't have it.  It doesn't arise on the issue of the rallies. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. O'Shea thinks I trumped my suit as well because I didn't advance the correct argument, and I think he's right.  And the correct argument is that these were matters that were raised in cross-examination, the rallies.  And so it arises -- my question arises out of the questions that were put and left hovering indistinctly by the Prosecution without them putting their case, a disingenuous sort of implicitness of approach, which the witness is entitled -- or, the Chamber is entitled at this stage to have clarified. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say, that if the question did arise in cross-examination, that would answer my -- my position.  Because my position is very simple on the issue that I -- I would not normally allow re-examination on matters which did not arise in cross-examination, even if they were relevant to the Defence.  So that's the point.  So the question is -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the line is "charged in the indictment re rallies."  Or, I should say, allegations in respect of rallies, subject to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but that's a matter of examination-in-chief -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Of course, of course. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
-- if that's your case, you bring it out in-chief.  You only re-examine on matters arising from cross-examination.  So you simply have to point me to the question in cross-examination which opens this question in re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER:
Right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Once that can be done, it's allowed. 
MR. HOOPER:
The question is in respect of rallies, which you'll find about 20 minutes ago.  
(Pages 31 to 45 by Ann Burum)



























1545H
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is allowed.
MR. MORLEY:
Insofar as the question is allowed, Your Honour is invited to remember the questions in relation to rallies were that they had occurred, she hadn't attended any, she remembers microphones on the tops of the cars.  My learned friend begins his question with a long, leading preamble, inviting the witness to disagree with it.  If my learned friend wants to explore what the witness heard about the rallies, he might ask the open question:  what did you hear about the rallies, rather than tell the witness what to disagree with.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Madam Witness, if you can remember the question, you can answer it, please. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
May she have her headset on first, Counsel?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, apologies to you.  I don't know if you can remember the question that dealt with rallies in your area and the nature of those rallies, and whether you heard that at those rallies there was a cry for extermination of your people.  But if you can, can you help us at all in respect of that?
A.	Regarding the rallies, I have told you that I never attended rallies.  I do recall just one occasion, and it's been a long time now.  He came to our house in the cabin of Gasana.  He didn't speak much.  The rally did not last a long time, because there weren't many people.  The MDR members complained to the effect that the MRND members or supporters were looking at them with an evil eye.  

Another rally that took place -- well, took place while I was very far away, but I heard people say that a rally was going to be held, and I heard the sound of a vehicle that was moving about and on which was installed a loudspeaker.  And I heard, when they returned from the meeting, from the rally, that MDR supporters or members, including the Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, met assailants who threw stones at them.

What I would say is that I do not see how I can testify in the defence of a person who would have incited people to kill Tutsis, whereas all members of my Tutsis were exterminated.  You see that this is inconceivable; I cannot testify in favour of such a person.
Q.	All right.  Let me move on to other matters.  You were asked, at great length, about your statement that you had made to an investigator dated the 21st of July of 2004, 18 months ago.  Madam, from what you've said, would I be correct in saying that over the adjournment this morning you had that statement read to you in Kinyarwanda, a language that you understood?
A.	Yes, it was, or my statement was in -- my testimony was interpreted into Kinyarwanda, and I did understand the purport or content of the said testimony.
MR HOOPER:
Now, this statement, for the record, we have, and I will ask it to be exhibited. 
MR. MORLEY:
So would I.
MR. HOOPER:
It is, I think, a five-page statement which on a laptop word check comes to just over 1400 words and comprises about 1350 words in French in respect of the history.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I appreciate you don't read French, but again, for the record, I'm going to go through this statement and then we can see perhaps better where we are with it.  And I've used the word "statement", but in fact it's not signed by you.  And as I understand it, the first time it was read to you was today; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Hooper, I hope you don't intend to go through the entire statement.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm not going to read through it, no.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's going on the record; it is going to be admitted into evidence?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And it will be sufficient if you dealt with those areas where alleged inconsistencies arose.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.
MR. MORLEY:
And just as my learned friend starts, Your Honour may recall, earlier I did make an enquiry of Mr. Hooper.  Is he prepared to give us the original notes of the investigator from which he has compiled this statement in French?
MR. HOOPER:
I don't have those, of this witness.  I have them of her husband and I have my notes from the safe house, which I can exhibit, if you wish them to be exhibited.
MR. MORLEY:
How is it then, I ask through Your Honour, my learned friend is able to say on the record that the original notes have not been signed?  The French statement records that the interview giving rise to the statement which my learned friend has, that that was something which was signed for by the witness.

Now, what I anticipate may have happened is that the witness has signed the original notes, probably in Kinyarwandan, of the Kinyarwandan investigator, which has been summarised in French to facilitate all of us to be able to read what is said to have happened.  My learned friend put on the record that this witness has not signed the investigator's notes, but he can't know that unless he has got the notes, and the statement shows that the notes were signed.
MR. HOOPER:
I'll come back to that.  If there was a misunderstanding between myself and Mr. O'Shea, who is looking now in the notebook of the investigator -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, your 20 minutes have elapsed, and probably only two questions have been asked.
MR. HOOPER:
I know.  I'll get on with it then, quickly.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	The first page, that deals with Rwamakuba, as does the second page of the statement; the third page of the statement, which also deals with the two matters you've just given evidence about in respect of meetings.  Then there is the attack on your house, where it's recorded that it was your eldest son who was killed.  You've given an explanation as to that.  There's then reference to an incident at a barrier near your home, which has not been the subject of evidence in this case.

There is then evidence in respect of being at Gishaka.  And there's no reference there to Interahamwe waving their machetes, or of your uncle, or of being provided a room, or of your uncle being murdered, or of your cousins being murdered.  But you did give evidence about that, and is your evidence true?
A.	Concerning the Gishaka incident, I confirm that it is true.  When the Interahamwe came, we ran helter-skelter, but I got into somebody's house -- a person who was living near that location.  There are several witnesses that can corroborate what I'm saying here.
Q.	Very well.  I'm not going to ask you to go through it again in detail.  We can see the statement; we can see your evidence in respect of detail.

And then we come to Kayanga.  And there's, I think, 15 lines of script relating to Kayanga, and from your evidence you were there for three days; is that right?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I don't know why we're not getting the Kinyarwanda.
THE WITNESS:  
I got to Kayanga on the 15th, and I left the same location on the 17th.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Now, let me just go to the discrepancies that were put to you, and I'll come to the question of dates in a moment.
First of all, was there a woman called Constance in your presence at any time during the time you were at either -- well, during the time you were at Kayanga?  What's the position with Constance?  I don't need a very lengthy reply; just very briefly, what was the position?
A.	I think I have talked about this to you already.  I was with Constance, and I told you that at a certain point in time I was stopped at a roadblock and she gave me assistance.  But once we got to the Kayanga health centre, she went away from me, she didn't come close to me any more, but when we got to Kayanga, she was with me.  But when we left her at Rutunga -- we were a little further than Kayanga -- than Rutunga -- but at the time I was with Constance.
Q.	Now, dealing with shells or bombs, how many times were you shelled or bombed?
A.	There is a shell that fell at the health centre, and there was a second shell that fell a little further.  And, subsequently, or immediately people ran away helter-skelter.
Q.	Now, you were asked about dates, and how, in your evidence, you are sure of dates.  And you referred to an agenda or -- well, I won't say "diary".  Can you tell us what kind of thing it was in which you were -- and what you did, what kind of thing you entered into it?
A.	It was a small booklet which I called a diary today.  Normally, I had that small booklet wherein I would write down biblical verses and other lessons that I heard during our prayer sessions.  I have told you that I lost that booklet.
Q.	And, finally, I want to ask you about this.  I think it was being suggested -- I wasn't clear from the questions that were being put to you -- that you and your husband had sort of put your heads together.  If I'm wrong about that, then I'll withdraw the question, but I don't see the Prosecution objecting to the way I've put that.

May I ask you, in respect of that, you told us that you and your husband had discussed things, but not whilst you were here, and had discussed the events.  Are there any -- are you aware of any differences in recollection between you and your husband in respect of things?
A.	Actually, my husband reminded me of the events of the 9th.  That is the only date he reminded me of, of which I wasn't certain.  And she's (sic) one who told me that the events that took place at our place, or at our home, took place on the 9th, and that is the date that she (sic) gave me.
Q.	In respect of the Pentecostalists on the 16th, is there any difference that you're aware of between you in respect of that?
A.	I did not know if he got the date right, but personally, I remember that the date was the 16th.  I do not know what he said on that subject concerning the event, but I personally believe that the date was the 16th.  I do not know the date that he gave, but I would suppose that he gave the date of the 16th, and I personally know that the event took place on the 16th.
Q.	Now, in your evidence a moment ago to my friend you referred to a statement in Rwanda.  Can I ask you what you mean by that -- a long statement, I understood you to say, that you'd made in Rwanda?  Which statement was that, can you clarify that, please?
A.	Regarding the statement that I gave in Rwanda, for instance, in Kayanga, people had to come and question me, other people gave account of the events.  Indeed, questions were put to us to find out those who were targeted by the Interahamwes.  Such information is given at Gacaca hearings.  Specific questions are asked of us.  We were asked who were the Interahamwe, we were asked who were the targets of the Interahamwe so that all such information can be recorded in the Gacaca registers.  That is what happens in our area.
MR. HOOPER:
Right, thank you.  Those are all my questions.
MR. MORLEY:
Well, before my learned friend concludes, we're still waiting, I think with possibly bated breath.  Were the investigator's notes signed?  Because my learned friend has put on the record that they were not, and if that is not correct, as a matter of propriety he should correct it.
MR. HOOPER:
It's not signed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, this is the end of your testimony now.  We thank you for coming to the Tribunal and giving evidence in this matter.  Now your evidence is ended, you are excused and you may return home.
MR. HOOPER:
May this witness have leave to visit Dr. Rwamakuba? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We probably could address the exhibits immediately after the recess.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short recess now.  
(Witness excused)
(Court recessed at 1606H) 
(Pages 46 to 50 by Maureen Dunn)









(Court resumed at 1632H)
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. MORLEY:
In respect to the exhibits of the last witness, can we defer that until the very first thing tomorrow morning?  My learned friend, Mr. O'Shea, has been good enough, and I put it on record to say that I will be allowed to inspect a photocopy of the investigator's note in respect of the last witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
We will see to exhibit it tomorrow so we will all have the benefit of it. 
MR. O'SHEA:
May I add that I have also asked Mr. Morley if he could kindly provide us a list of alibi witness, and I believe he is honourably looking into it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me?  I'm saying good afternoon to you. 
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me.  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming to give evidence at our Tribunal.  The first thing that will happen is that the registrar will administer an oath for you to tell the truth during your evidence.
(Declaration made by Edith van Wynsberghe in English)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the official languages of our Tribunal are French and English, and there are interpreters here in both languages.  Which language do you wish to use during your testimony?
THE WITNESS:
English, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very good.  You will give your evidence by responding to questions put to you by the person designated for that, and Mr. Hooper will begin, being the lawyer for the accused, André Rwamakuba. 
EDITH VAN WYNSBERGHE,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you give your full name, please? 
A.	Edith van Wynsberghe. 
Q.	Can I spell that as V-A-N-W-Y-N-S-B-E-R-G-H-E?  

	Can you give your address, please? 
A.	Broekstraat 43 (foreign language) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That was Broekstraat 43 (unintelligible).
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	(No interpretation), Madam, because we have no Flemish interpreter here.  As you know, we made efforts to get one, but there isn't one here in Arusha.  That's been explained to you, I know, and as you have indicated to Mr. President, you are willing to give your evidence in English, even though you don't feel entirely at ease in English, and it may be no surprise to us if, in the course of your evidence, you speak French or even Flemish.  So I think we all understand that position.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	I also know that you have a slight hearing problem and that you prefer to see people talking to you than not seeing people talk to you.  Can I ask you this:   Are you able to hear through the earphones, or is that making things more difficult? 
A.	I can hear you very good, thank you. 
Q.	All right, very good.  In fact, we do have a witness identification sheet which contains your details, but I think we can read it into the transcript.  Broekstraat is B-O -- sorry, start again:  B-R-O-E-K-S-T-R-A-A-T 43 and that is (unintelligible) code 3110 Roteslaar:  R-O-T-S-E-L-A-A-R, and that's in Belgium and you're--
A.	I am staying in Belgium, yes. 
Q.	And we can see your date of birth, in 1944.  You were born in Belgium and you've lived there all your life; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You're a married woman with two children? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you're married to Hugo Scheldemann, S-C-H-E-L-D-E-M-A-N-N, Hugo Scheldemann, and you have been married happily for many years.  You are still married to him; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he is a retired journalist? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you are a retired primary school teacher? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Recently retired, I should say? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	As you know, this trial is concerned with a man called André Rwamakuba. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that, we understand, is somebody that you know? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us how you first came to meet him? 
A.	He was hitch-hiking from Leuven to Brussels, and I took him in my car. 
Q.	And can you remember -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are observing that the witness is having difficulty with the microphone.  I am wondering if it could be moved to the other side. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Counsel, could you pace the question/answer a bit more slowly because it is all into French.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I forgot. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You were saying that you met André Rwamakuba when he was doing autostop, hitch-hiking, I think, as we know? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on the Brussels to Leuven road.  In which year was that? 
A.	I think '73. 
Q.	And over the last 32 years, have you kept in touch with him? 
A.	Off and on. 
Q.	Now, when you -- so, you gave him a lift in your car? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I suspect there is no dispute at all about any of this:   You, in fact, took him home, met your husband? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Helped André find an address in Brussels? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at that time what was he doing in Belgium, André? 
A.	He was a medicine student. 
Q.	Do you know which university it was at? 
A.	At Leuven. 
Q.	Now, over the next several years, what kind of degree of contact did you have with André?
A.	In '73-and-4 and so on, I took him to look for places in Belgium, like a tourist, because there was a programme in Brussels that asked for Belgium families to take exchange students to see the environment, and that was what I did with André and the children. 
Q.	Did there come a time when André returned to his country, Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I think in '74 or '75.  I do not recall. 
Q.	And did you remain in touch after that, and if you did, to what extent? 
A.	He only sent a card at Christmas, and one day there was a sister who brought me a little gift from André.  That's all I had. 
Q.	When was the next time you saw him? 
A.	He has come back to Belgium in '82 to study in La Neuve.  That's a section of Leuven, but in French. 
Q.	That's L-E-U-V-E-N, and it's La Neuve, is it?  L-A N-E-U-V-E.  Is that a part of Leuven university? 
A.	No, they are separated, a Flemish part and a French part. 
Q.	I know Mr. O'Shea knows it very well.  

	Now, so he's -- what were the circumstances of your meeting again in 1982? 
A.	He phoned me and he asked to come over to visit us, and there he told me his wife was carrying a child, and at the night of the birth of the child, his elder brother phoned us, and we went to give him the good news of the birth of his daughter. 
Q.	Do you know the family, his wife and children? 
A.	Now I know them, yes. 
Q.	And even in recent years, since André's been arrested, have you been in contact with them? 
A.	Many times.  I visited them. 
Q.	You needn't say where they are because that's a protected fact.  But you visited them in Europe? 
A.	Yes, and we sent e-mails and we were on the telephone all the time. 
Q.	In 1982 his oldest daughter, whose name is -- 
A.	Mariaj (phonetic). 
Q.	Mariaj is born and she is now, I think, 22 or 23, or about that age.  After 1982, did you remain in contact with André?
A.	Like before, we sent the card and sometimes a letter also, to say how it was with the family. 
Q.	When was the next time that you saw him? 
A.	The next time I saw him in Antwerp.  He has come back to study at the Tropical Institute of Antwerp. 
Q.	Do you know when that was? 
A.	In '93, in September. 
Q.	Do you know how long he remained in Belgium? 
A.	Yes, into March.  The last time I saw him was March 18. 
Q.	That's 1994? 
A.	1994. 
Q.	Very well.  Well, we will go through those months with you in a moment.  Now, just generally, over that period, from September of 1993 until March of 1994, how often -- how many times did you see André?
A.	Maximum ten -- ten times. 
Q.	And these ten times, were they bunched together, all together, or were they over several dates, or what? 
A.	They were over several dates, because he was studying at the weekend.  Sometimes he came over, and during the week or when I was in Antwerp I went to visit him. 
Q.	Now, amongst those visits, those opportunities of meeting with André, and that is a long time ago now, are you helped by any written record today as to when any help -- when some of those visits occurred? 
A.	Yes, I have bills and papers that reminds me the exact dates. 
Q.	Now, I think a month or two -- about two months ago, Ms. Dior Fall, who sits to your right there, together with her colleague who sits behind, together with a Belgian policeman, paid you a visit at your home; is that right? 
A.	At my son's apartment in Leuven. 
Q.	Did your son keep a contemporaneous note of the conversation? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very well.  In the course of that interview, did you produce a copy to the Prosecution of the documents that you're going to refer to now? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And we have --
A.	My son brought it to the policeman, and he said he will send it here. 
Q.	Very well.  So we have some copies of those documents which I hope will be distributed, and you can help us through them.  You have your own there, do you, somewhere? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I think in those circumstances I would ask you to take them out, please, and look at them, one for each of the Judges, one for the registry, and I assume the Prosecution have their own documents.  Now, we are reminded from your evidence, of course, that these represent only, whatever it is, I think five particular visits amongst the ones that you remember.  
A.	Okay. 
Q.	So, let's do it in order, and which is the first document that we should look at? 
A.	The sewing machine. 
Q.	Right, the sewing machine. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Has that got "Vandenborg" on the document? 
A.	No.   These I found later.  I don't think you have a copy of this. 
Q.	All right.  So the wheels have come off.  I'm sorry.  So I don't have a copy of that document.  
A.	But you can have it. 
Q.	Yes.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Incidentally, while that's coming up to me, I only learned recently from you that, of course, your name, Edith Vanwynsberge, is your maiden name? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You're married to a Mr. Scheldemann? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But in Belgium you carry on using your maiden name? 
A.	For official documents, yes. 
Q.	And in situations like this.  Very well.  What I'm going to do, Mrs. van Wynsberghe, is just pass this up to the Judges so they get some idea of the document that you are now going to discuss, and so the Prosecution, who I think you provided this to, can also appreciate it.  I think there's probably no harm, as those documents are circulating, if you just tell us, unless you need the document in front of you, what that -- what memory that document provokes.  
A.	The sewing machine was delivered by my -- by my sister who lives in Antwerp, but a week before that, I went to order it.  And afterwards I have visited André and my sister also, to say there will be a machine delivered, so (unintelligible) for me. 
Q.	So who was the sewing machine for, in fact? 
A.	For me.
Q.	It was for you.  
A.	But I couldn't take it with me the same day, so I have to fetch it later. 
Q.	Right.  And your sister lives --
A.	In Antwerp. 
Q.	So having gone to Antwerp, you went there for the sewing machine, did you, or to order it, or what? 
A.	I went to order it and to learn to use it, and afterwards I bought it, but I couldn't take it home.  So I asked them to deliver it to my sister because that was nearby, and I can collect it when I have time. 
Q.	Now, was it an occasion when you saw André that you remember? 
A.	Yes, from a week before, I think, or a fortnight before.  That I don't remember exactly.  Before the 8th of December.
Q.	So sometime towards the end of November, 1st of December, that kind of time, this helps you recall a visit you paid to André.  And where was he on that occasion that you remember? 
A.	In the Cartenstraat (phonetic) in Antwerp. 
Q.	Right.  And can you spell that for us, please? 
A.	G-R-B-D-E-N (sic) street, straat. 
Q.	And what was the Cartenstraat; is that where he was living or a place you met? 
A.	That was where he was living. 
Q.	What kind of accommodation was that? 
A.	It was like a home for students. 
Q.	Now, the document you've produced, can we keep it?  Do you mind if we have it? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Because that will become an exhibit.  Thank you very much.  It can be passed to me and I will have copies made by tomorrow.  The second time -- I say -- not the second time you saw him, the second time that any document that you have helps you, which is the second visit, or meeting, with André that you can remember by reference to a document? 
A.	The second one that I remember, I have no documents of it.  It was on his birthday. 
Q.	And can you give us the date of his birthday? 
A.	27th of December.
Q.	And can you tell us how that came about, that meeting? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the date, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
27th of December.
THE WITNESS:
I'm operated on my ear, so I have to do -- to go to the clinic regularly.  It's nearby Antwerp, and sometimes you have to wait a whole day, but at that day, after half an hour, I was released.  And then I thought, "Now I'm here, I will buy him a cake and surprise him for his birthday." 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So did you buy the cake, and did you surprise him? 
A.	Yes, I was lucky he was there because I didn't know if he was at home or not. 
Q.	So obviously this is just after Christmas and before the New Year? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, at any time during these six months, did André ever say to you, "Oh, I'm just popping off to Rwanda," or, "Oh, I've just come back to Rwanda, the family send their love," or anything like that? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So that's end of November, beginning of December, 27th of December.  When is the next occasion that you can be specific about? 
A.	That's in January, but I don't remember the exact date.  But in January he came to our home and he was looking for a second-hand car.  And my daughter knew a friend who has a car to sell, and we went there looking at the car, but André didn't buy it. 
Q.	And where did you go with your daughter and André?
A.	To Aarshot.  That's a town nearby. 
Q.	I think that's spelt A-A-R-S-H-O-T.  Can you be any more specific as to when it was in January? 
A.	It was after the holidays of Christmas in the weekend, but I don't know if it was the first or the last weekend, and my daughter don't recall it either. 
Q.	All right.  So that's January.  When is the next time you remember meeting André?
A.	I think in March. 
Q.	On this occasion, are you assisted by any documents? 
A.	Yes.  I have some documents where André bought medical supplies to take home.  I have also documents, he bought a car, but there I wasn't present. 
Q.	So, I think that is probably represented by most of the pages of the documents that the Judges have got, not the first -- from the third page onwards, I hazard, and did this involve a company called Orbi-pharma? 
A.	Yes, it was Orbi-pharma in Antwerp.  They sell second-hand medical supplies. 
Q.	And can you help us as to what date you went there? 
A.	We went there three -- three or two -- three -- 3rd March. 
Q.	Again, just remind us, we are not very familiar.  Where are Orbi-pharma, this company; where did you go to to go there? 
A.	The others?
Q.	Yes. 
A.	(Inaudible) straat 40. 
Q.	And in which town is that? 
A.	In Antwerp. 
Q.	And was André with you? 
A.	André was with me.  He asked me to drive him over, and there I left him to discuss the price and what he wanted, because I don't know anything about medical supplies, and I went for a walk, and afterwards I fetched him and brought him back to his room. 
Q.	And what was your understanding as to why André wanted this medical stuff? 
A.	He told me he would begin a practice of doctors in Rwanda with his friend -- I don't remember his last name. 
Q.	Dr. Charles? 
A.	Dr. Charles, yes. 
Q.	Do you know where Dr. Charles is today? 
A.	I know his address, but where he is, I don't know. 
Q.	Does he live in Belgium? 
A.	He lives in Belgium, but I think he travels a lot. 
Q.	All right.  So with that project in view, he goes to this company.  And we have one particular page I'd like you to refer us to, it's the third-but-last page of our bundle headed "pharma".  I don't know if you've got that page.  You have.  Looking at that page, if we look under -- on the facture at "no designation", it's dated the 2nd of March 1994.  Does that help you as to what day it was? 
A.	Yes, it was the 2nd of March. 
Q.	And underneath there we have, "An autoclave complais, 36 litre."  Do you know what that is? 
A.	That was a huge machine to sterilise medical supplies. 
Q.	And then after that we have, "Albusticks, uristicks and clinisticks".  
A.	I don't know what that is. 
Q.	Well, it can be checked, but I suggest that's to check urine, albumin, and maybe blood in clinisticks.  And at the bottom a "microscoop", which I suppose is microscope, is it?  
A.	Yes.

1700H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What happened, and the grand total of costs there is 40,494, and that would be Belgium francs at the time? 
A.	Yes, but he exported that not in Europe, so he does not have to pay the taxes. 
Q.	And, indeed, the retention of these documents, does that have anything to do with the VAT; do you know? 
A.	I know for another document that I have brought the taxes back. 
Q.	All right?
A.	But of this, I don't remember.  I think he arranged it himself to get it back. 
Q.	All right.  Now, this particular document -- can you help us as to what 40,000 Belgian francs represent in 1994? 
A.	I don't understand the question?  
Q.	Well, I suppose it is worth 40,000 Belgium francs.  Do you know how many Euro that would be today? 
A.	I'm not very good at that. 
Q.	We can come back to that? 
A.	One thousand Euro. 
Q.	1,000 Euro is 40,000 Belgian francs, as it were.  What happened to these items?
A.	I took them to auto club and the microscope, because they are huge things and he has only a little room, so I take it home to -- for him in safekeeping. 
Q.	When was the next time you met him that you can specifically date in relation to documents? 
A.	The day he left for Rwanda. 
Q.	And how were you assisted by a document for that? 
A.	A document from the customs. 
Q.	Is there a document here that helped you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Which document is that, please?  That is the one with Zaventem on it.  And can you tell us the relationship between you meeting Andre and this document?
A.	When he left for Rwanda, he wanted to take his medical supplies with him. So I drove to Antwerp.  We loaded everything in my car.  I only have a little car, and then arrived to someone at the embassy, so we have to remove everything from the car at the embassy.  And then we drove to Zaventem, the airport in Belgium.  There he checked in all of his belonging.  And after that I drove to Dr. Charles to say goodbye to Dr. Charles and his family.  And then we go to buy some clothes he wanted to give to his wife, Agnes. 
Q.	And Zaventem is spelt, Z-A-V-E-N-T-E-M, the airport.  Zaventem.

And after he brought the gift for his wife Agnes, what did Andre do?  
A.	We went to Zeventem and he left Belgium with the plane. 
Q.	Now, did you ever see him after that?
A.	Yes, once.  One morning I got a telephone call early in the morning and it was Andre who said he was back in Belgium, but he was on a transit.  But I don't know exactly where he had come from, or where he went to, I forgot.  So he wanted to buy a telephone with fax.  And he asked me if I knew an address.  And I said I will fetch him after school.  So at 4 o'clock, I went to the hotel where he was, and then we went to a shopping centre nearby and we bought a telephone and a fax.  And then I drove him back to Zaventem, and there I collect the money for the taxes.  And I went back to the shop to collect them. 
Q.	All right.  And if we look at our first page, which is the one headed Vandenbord (phonetic), that shows, is it right, the electric telephone that was purchased?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the date is in the top right-hand corner, the 18th of March 1994, 1653 p.m., obviously.

Now, that is five occasions that you can specifically refer to.  You have told us that there was a maximum of ten all together over that period of time.  
A.	I think so. 
Q.	Can you describe Andre to us? 
A.	Yes, he is an African man.  He is black.  He is taller than me.  He is slim, but he has large shoulders.  And I think he has a little scar on his face, but I don't remember where. 
Q.	Did he ever wear glasses that you observed? 
A.	No, I never saw him in glasses.  And he laughed when I got mine. 
Q.	Laughed when you got yours, all right.   What about the nature of the man that you could observe?
A.	I think he is an idealist.  When he was a student, he told me he never wanted to go to -- into politics, because he said politics was corrupt, and he didn't want -- he wanted to help his people.  And he said, "I know I never would be a rich man when I am a doctor, but I want to help them" and I appreciated that.  

And afterwards when he was in Antwerp he said, "I think I am going to go in politics."  And I said, "Why, you said you didn't want to go and it is dangerous, politics.  And some -- in some lands -- 
Q.	In some lands, some countries? 
A.	"In some countries in Africa."  He said, "Yes, but I want to help my people and they need good politicians.  And I asked him, "Yes, but how can you do that?"  He said, "I hope I will be elected and be minister of education."  And he wanted for secondary schools in Rwanda, that the secondary schools would be free without cost, like in Belgium.  Therefore, he asked me, can you provide books for secondary schools?  And in Belgium, there is an organisation who is called Teachers Without Borders.  And I said I will ask them if it is necessary, but I never get an answer.  He never was (inaudible)  the minister of education.  He didn't have the power to change the things, so I didn't send him books or so. 
Q.	In terms of his -- his character, his relationships with people, I mean, can you comment at all on that? 
A.	He was -- in my eyes; he was a very kind man.  My children, when they were little, they adored him.  My daughter, when he came to visit us, she was on his lap from the moment he went in, and he was very, very kind.  And he played with the children sometimes and learned them thing to say in Kinyarwanda, and they learned him things to say in Flemish.  So it just goes, I think, he was a very kind man.  And he was an idealist.  And he always told me about his parents.  He wanted to look -- to look to them, because in March when he returned, I said to him, "Can't you asked to bring your family here in Belgium and stay in Belgium?"  And he said, "No, I have to go back for my parents, and for my other family. 
Q.	Well, then there is a war and the genocide as we know.  And after that, we know that Andre leaves Rwanda.  Did you have any contact with him in the time when he was not living in Rwanda, before his arrest, and being brought here? 
A.	Yes, I have contact first with his wife in Ethiopia, and after that in Namibia, his wife and Andre himself.  At the time in Namibia he called me and asked me, "Can I send over my three children, can you look after them?"  And I said, "Why?"  And he said, "Yes, I want them to study."  And I talked it over with my husband, but he said, "Three children, that is a very large responsibility.  You can't do that, children belong to their parents.  You can't say, all right come over.  It is too big a responsibility." 
Q.	Did you subsequently discover that there may have been another motive, other than education, to send them? 
A.	At that moment I didn't know, because if I had known what I know now, I should have said, yes, please send them over, because Agnes told me that were -- there were two times an attempt to kidnap them, to bring them back to Rwanda. 
Q.	Now, since Andre was arrested and brought here in Arusha, in fact, was there a time when you paid him a visit here? 
A.	Yes, there was.  I knew he was here.  And he had phoned us once.  And afterwards, I have phoned him, just to say, hello and how are you.  And sometimes I sent e-mails to Dr. Hooper to ask him how is Andre in Rwanda.  And at the time doctor -- Mr. Hooper told me that Andre was very depressed.  And I don't know, I think, perhaps, I told you I was planning to make a Safari in South Africa with my sister.  And then Mr. Hooper wrote me, if you want to go on Safari, go to Tanzania, it is the best country to go there.  And I then thought, what shall I do, go with my sister, go with my sister or go to Tanzania.  And I said when I go to South Africa and I have to fly over Tanzania and knowing he is there.  Andre, he is so depressed, he has not had any visitors during four years.  And I said to my sister, "I will go to Tanzania."  So I went for a week here and after that I visited him in prison. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I have no other questions.  Thank you.  Just wait there for a moment, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Now the Prosecutor will have an opportunity to cross-examine you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
 MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I had been informed that it might be that Your Honour and Your Honours colleagues will be rising close to 5 o'clock today; if Your Honour is happy to sit to 5:30?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that must have been misinformation.  We could sit a little bit later.  Do you know how long you plan to be?  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't know but I am not going to be that long with this witness.  I'm certainly going to be longer than ten minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we -- if you could finish this afternoon, if it was part -- we could sit a little bit longer to make up for yesterday and the late start this morning, if that is not an inconvenience to you? 
MR. MORLEY:
We will see how we go, Your Honour.  Thank you.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	I can only imagine that you are enormously surprised to find yourself in Arusha before this Tribunal?
A.	You are right. 
Q.	Andre was a friend of the family?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you got to know about his children and about his wife and a little bit about his plans as a doctor, and a little bit about his plans, maybe, one day as a politician? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You have been in regular contact as a family -- with his family for sometime; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know what party Andre belonged to in Rwanda?
A.	No, I don't know.  Perhaps he told me, but it didn't interest me, the parties. 
Q.	Do you know about the war that was taken place in Rwanda?
A.	I read about it.  I saw it on television.  I saw Belgian politicians who made the declarations ten years ago, and I was very worried. 
Q.	Did Andre ever discuss the war with you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did Andre ever discuss the arrival of multipartyism in Rwanda?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did Andre ever discuss the growth of a party called the MDR? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did Andre ever discuss the history of the people in Rwanda? 
A.	Not really.  He once told me that the president, not Kagame, who was here who was murdered, that when he came on duty -- can you say that,  he has done terrible things; that I remember because I thought he was very fine man.  And so that is the only thing I remember.  He discussed politics with my husband, but I didn't take part of it. 
Q.	Did he discuss why the later assassinated president was a bad man? 
A.	He never said he was a bad man.  He only said that most of powerful men had done things that isn't quite regularly (sic). 
Q.	Did Andre ever discuss with you the problems of power sharing amongst the ethnic groups in Rwanda?
A.	No, not with me. 
Q.	Did he ever discuss with you the president's plans to share power with other ethnic groups in Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	When you saw Andre sometime in late 1993, and you helpfully have shown us various receipts, was it then that he was telling you that he might like to get involved in politics? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was it your impression that it would be a big step for him and a new adventure? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Was it your impression that his plan was to get involved in politics, but he wasn't yet involved?
A.	I think, I think it was his plan, but he wasn't yet involved.  That is my opinion, you know. 
Q.	And it appears that he mentioned to you he would quite like to be the minister for education? 
A.	Yes, but that is true.  I think it was because his children went to secondary school.  He was --  
Q.	Well, it must have come as a big surprise to you that within a few months of saying that he was hopeful of going into politics, he actually became the minister for education? 
A.	Yes, and I was very worried. 
Q.	He never really let on to you how busy he was in Rwandan politics?
A.	No, he was studying and he has to make papers at the time in Antwerp. 
Q.	Did you know his ethnic origin when you met him, within the context of Rwanda? 
A.	Once he told me his father was from Congo, and he has a grandmother who was Tutsi and he has a mother who was Hutu, and that he was a mix of ethnic groups. 
Q.	Did you see him with any African friends when you saw him from time to time in late 1993 in Belgium? 
A.	Yes, I only saw him with Dr. Charles. 
Q.	I mean, for example, when you popped in with a birthday cake, was there a party going on?  
A.	No, not at all.  He was all alone in his room studying. 
Q.	Have you ever seen him in the company of somebody who is of the ethnic group Tutsi? 
A.	I only saw him with Dr. Charles Sindabimenya when he was in Antwerp.  And I think that the wife of   Dr. Charles is Tutsi. 
Q.	Did you know who his African friends were apart from Dr. Charles?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did he ever talk to you about the RPF invasion of Rwanda in October 1990? 
A.	No? 
Q.	Did he ever talk to you about the Arusha Accords, a proposal to share power with the Tutsi RPF?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did he ever talk to you about the fighting that was taking place between the different political parties in Rwanda? 
A.	He once told me, but it was in the beginning, that there has been a fight in Rwanda and that it was terrible for his children to hear clacking noise of arm -- (unintelligible).  He said he was rather worrisome for his children to hear noise made, you know, by weapons and arms and guns, et cetera, that it was very worrisome. 
Q.	Did he ever talk about an organisation called the Interahamwe?
A.	No. 
Q.	Did he ever talk about any youth movement organisation within other political parties in Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you been to Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	It would be fair to say that you never really learned his politics?
A.	Yeah, I never learned his politics. 
Q.	And it would be fair, would it not, in your mind to think Andre must have been a bit more involved in politics than he ever let on to me if he became the minister of education so soon after he mentioned that he might be interested in becoming a politician?
A.	I think so.  But it didn't interest me, politics, so. 
Q.	You very helpfully brought along a whole series of bills.  Can you help me; what was the rate, Belgium francs to the Euro?  Do you remember when it all changed, and the Euro became the currency in Belgium, one Euro?  
A.	One Euro is 40 Belgium francs. 
Q.	That is very helpful.  If you look at your bills, I have a helpful copy of a bill, dated the                         30th of December of 1994, showing a total of 49,924 Belgium francs.  And I'm assuming that this is something that you have been able to find.  Is this something that you produced?  Can you have a look at this?  I don't quite understand what it is.  
MR. MORLEY:
Show the witness, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you know what that is?
A.	Yes, that is something that I was sent to -- no, there was something he -- I don't know.  I don't know what it was.  Yes, I know.  In '95 he brought a car in Belgium. 
Q.	Uhm-hum.  
A.	And it was shipped off to Rwanda.  And afterwards he didn't collect it because there was war going on.  And the car had not reached Rwanda. 
Q.	I see.  
A.	And here the (unintelligible) of South Africa, that is an organisation who has shipped his car to Rwanda, and they have paid him back because they could sell it in Rwanda. 
Q.	I see, that is very helpful.  Just so that Their Honours have an understanding of what I am dealing with; that is effectively a shipping document, outbound, 30th of December 1994, return of money,             22nd of June 1995.  In relation to shipping cost for a car, costs almost 50,000 Belgium francs? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Well, have a look at the figures.  We will just pass the document around? 
A.	Yes, but that is Andre's account.  That is not mine.

Yes, that is the price of a car, a second-hand car.  
Q.	Just so I understand, is that the price of the car or of the shipping? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	You don't know.  And I think it would be right, would it, that 50,000 Belgium francs would have been, at the time of the conversion into Euro, somewhere in the region of about 1,200 Euro; something like that? 
A.	I have to -- 
Q.	Please don't worry, it is late in the day.  It is in excess of 1,000 Euro?  Would that be about right, 50,000 Belgium francs, 40 Belguim francs to the Euro means more than 1,000 Euro? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The next document I would like you to have a look at, which you helpfully produced, I can't quite understand.  Can I ask you to look at this document?  It is dated the 3rd of March?  Now, this is a document dated the 3rd of March?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you help me with what it is?
A.	Yes, instruments and other applications for medicine. 
Q.	Is it an invoice, a bill, a customs document?  What is that document? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Is that something you were able to produce or -- I can tell you that we got that from the Defence, so we are trying to work out if that is one of your documents? 
A.	It is something that I had (unintelligible). 
Q.	So, what is it? 
A.	I don't know.  When we went to Orbi-pharma, he had a lot of papers.  And he took copies of it and he said, I have to -- I don't have to pay taxes and so on, can you keep -- can you keep them so that you can see if they are paid back and everything.  But I don't know what it is.  At home, it is my husband who fetched everything with papers, I am only the (unintelligible) with them. 
Q.	All right.  Well, perhaps, if I can have it back? 
A.	Sorry.
MR. MORLEY:
There are a number of other bills, Your Honour, which I am going to go through.  I see the time, is this a convenient moment, or is Your Honour happy to continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, if you want to stop now we will stop.  If you can finish and it will take no more than 15 or 20 minutes, we will go on.  We wanted to try to catch up, if we can, on the time that we lost yesterday and this morning. 
MR. MORLEY:
That is very well.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, I have got another bill, with Mr. Issa's assistance, 1st of March 1994, a bill for 71,812 Belgium francs, paid in cash.  I wonder if I can just hand that to you and help me with what, that is that about? 
MR. MORLEY:
The witness, please, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	See whether there is any understanding of it? 
A.	Thank you.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what it is.
Q.	It is one of the documents you have produced; is that right? 
A.	I don't know, I don't have this document. 
Q.	Well, it has been handed to us by the Defence.  I was assuming it was yours? 
A.	Yeah, perhaps it was -- I sent -- at the moment they have asked me, "Do you have still those documents?"  And I took copies of them, and I sent them all, even some -- I don't know, I don't have them.  And I never mixed with Andre's bills.  It doesn't interest me what he bought or how much it cost. 
Q.	But that is one of Andre's bills; is that right?
A.	Was his name on it, is it one of his bills, I don't know. 
Q.	Well, it has come from you to us by the Defence.  We are assuming that that is one of Andre's bills? 
A.	Paid in cash.  That address is the same address where he shipped his car.  So perhaps he has -- he was in Antwerp.  I wasn't with him all of the time. 
Q.	It is one of Andre's bills, isn't it that is what I am trying to establish?
A.	I don't know.  I don't see his name on it. 
Q.	Why would you have produced that to the Defence if it is not one of Andre's bills? 
A.	I don't remember.  I don't remember that paper. 
Q.	Can I have the document back for a moment, please? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, could the witness be helped because there is his name on it, top right-hand corner, and please, that -- (microphone overlapping).  
MR. MORLEY:
Don`t worry.  If there is any confusion, it is my fault and not yours.  All right.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	All right, well on the face of it, this is a bill that you kept for Andre for 71,812 Belgium francs, paid in cash, marked on the 4th of March 1994? 
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	Yeah? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that is approaching 2,000 Euro, yeah? 
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	And then the next day, the 2nd of March of 1994 is the bill Mr. Hooper referred to, another one of André's for, do you remember, 40,494 Belgium francs, that is about 1,000 Euro?  
A.	Yes, it is that way, 33,605 because taxes wouldn't have -- must have been paid, so it is less than 1,000 Euro.
Q.	And that was for medical equipment? 
A.	Yes, that I know of.  I went with him to Orbi-pharma. 
Q.	The document that I showed you dated the 3rd of March, was that an export document to assist in the movement of goods from Belgium to Rwanda, I will show it to you again?
A.	I think so.  I think so, I saw Kigali so I think it is a shipment.  I don't know; I'm not sure.  Documents are not my strongest -- 
Q.	You might be able to help us with what is meant by the words in the top left-hand corner which seem to be (unintelligible).  I will just hand the document back to you with Mr. Issa's assistance.  I just want to know what the document is and what it means.
A.	"European", it means -- well (unintelligible) -- it was European community, I don't know.  It basically means (unintelligible).

1742H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Looking at the document again -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	-- is it an export document from the European community to Rwanda?  Is that what the purpose of it is? 
A.	Perhaps, yes.  Could be.  I don't know.  It's something I kept.  But at the look of it -- yes, it says "exporter" -- yeah.  So it's something that has to be exported. 
Q.	Thank you.  All right.  That's helpful.  That's very helpful.  

So that is an export document dated the 3rd of March, yeah? 
A.	Yeah. 
Q.	That's what we've just looked at.  We have another document, which you've helpfully provided, showing a bill for 76,160 Belgian francs, so somewhere in the region of just short of 2,000 Euro.  Can you help us with what that's about? 
A.	Yes.  I think that was the shipment of his car to Kigali.  It's the 7th -- the 7th March. 
Q.	Thank you.  It reads "7."  I thought it might read "4," but it doesn't matter.  You think 7th of March, yes? 
A.	Or 4.  Yes, 4.  Here is "4," so that -- that will be "4" also.  
Q.	We seem to have another export document dated now the 9th of March of 1994.  Can I hand that up to you again? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, how much longer are you going to take?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I invited Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the point is we didn't want to be unreasonable.  If you -- if you could finish now, we prefer to do it.  If you can't, then we'll have to come back tomorrow. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, why don't I just finish with this document, and then we'll come back tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
THE WITNESS:
That's the document of the customs in (unintelligible).
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Yup.  And it's the same sort of document we saw -- do you remember we had an earlier example dated the 3rd of March? 
A.	Yes, that's the same. 
Q.	So we -- 
A.	So I think he has -- he needed this to go to the customs. 
Q.	So on the face of it, we've got an export document on the 3rd of March and an export document on the 9th of March, yeah? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  
A.	So that -- that is what he got from Orbi-Pharma so he can go to the customs.  That's his bill, and that's the shipping. 
Q.	All right.  So what's the bill say?  How much money is on the bill?   
A.	Thirty-three six hundred and five. 
Q.	So 33,605 Belgian francs? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Very good.  So just short of a thousand Euro, yeah? 
A.	Yeah, yes. 
Q.	Okay.  All right.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps we leave it there, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Witness, we -- 
THE WITNESS:
I don't -- I don't know -- no, that I think the same.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, we are going to take the adjournment now, and we will continue tomorrow morning at 8:45. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should tell you that during this or any adjournment, while you're giving evidence, you remain a witness of the -- for the Chamber.  And you are not to discuss the case or your evidence with anyone.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.
