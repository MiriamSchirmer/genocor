ÉLIZIER NIYITEGEKA,
EXAMINATION-IN CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I hope you spent a lovely weekend and that you're in good shape.  
A.	No comment. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, we're going to carry on with what we were doing last week.  And through this series of questions which I am putting to you, as a matter of fact, I am examining all the -- all what might have been the outcome of the accusation of joint criminal enterprise against Mr. Nzirorera, specifically, and also all the other Accused.  

That is why I am in this line of questions which -- I'm sorry -- on this line of questions regarding issues which have often been contested or at least which -- the line of question of which the Prosecutor is in disagreement with the Defence.
MR. NIMY:
I want to point out this detail to the attention of the Honourable Judges of the Chamber to assure them that I will continue with the points which we had announced that the witness was going to deal with, 
Mr. President.  So my line of questioning is around the further detail that I want with respect to the 
joint criminal enterprise.
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, did you know Mr. Emmanuel Gapyisi?  
A.	Yes, I know Mr. Emmanuel Gapyisi very well. 
Q.	Would you kindly tell the Chamber under what circumstances he died? 
A.	Emmanuel Gapyisi, as I said, is someone I know.  I indeed know -- knew him because we're both 
	MDR members, the same political party.  He was a chairman of the MDR in the Gikongoro préfecture.  He had set up something known as the foreign democratic, which was a think tank.  

He was killed I believe, if my memory serves me well, on the 18th of May 1993.  He was shot at the entrance to his house.  It was at the entrance to his residence on the evening of the 18th of May.  He was accompanied by his wife.  He had probably been to visit somebody or he was returning from work.  In any case, it was on the 18th of May in the evening when he was shot down, shot dead by 
armed assailants. 
Q.	And in your view, Mr. Niyitegeka, what was the result of that murder on the cohesion of members within the MDR? 
A.	Well, firstly his death -- his murder, I must say, took us by surprise because we found it hard to take.  
And I need to tell the Chamber this:  The truth is that the day after his death I attended the burial.  While we were still in church there were rumours to the effect that -- how he had -- Faustin Twagiramungu, that is.  Faustin Twagiramungu was Emmanuel Gapyisi's older sister -- I don't know how you call that in French, what's the relationship, whether these were in-laws or not.  

But the rumour was that Twagiramungu had been behind that murder, and Twagiramungu was the national representative of the MDR and also the chairman in Cyangu -- in that area.  So you can imagine what that rumour -- what that rumour could have meant.  

And, curiously, the person who was fomenting that rumour was Gapyisi's sister, whose name was Freda.  I was at the scene and I am aware -- I was an eyewitness of her lamentations in church.  As a matter of fact, she even passed out on Twagiramungu saying he was the one who had assassinated her brother.

So you can picture this type of -- imagine this type of rumour.  Although it might not be founded, it definitely left something in the mind of the people who attended that ceremony.  
Q.	And, concretely speaking, how did that -- was that -- how did people react to that incident with respect to the cohesion within the MDR? 
A.	Now, this is a problem which can be faced by all political parties, not only bordering political parties, but all political parties which -- all political parties.  

We noticed that the personality of Twagiramungu, in spite of being the chairman of the party, was being contested.  His position was being contested by some members of the party.  And with that rumour, people started saying that Twagiramungu did not deserve to carry on being chairman of the party.  And also his attitude, which he started to manifest as from the time of that rumour, that from the time when Freda collapsed in front of him, Twagiramungu left the church.  He didn't continue to attend the ceremony.  He left the church and went away.  And we stayed there until the burial, but he had already gone.  

So that event changed something, somehow, in his behaviour and in the manner in which all the members of the political party perceived him, especially considering the fact that other people were saying with a little more, let me say, presumption that Gapyisi had certainly been killed by the 
RPF network.  Twagiramungu had his network.  These are things that people could hear from some people.  
Q.	And did you attend the Kabusunzu congress? 
A.	What congress are you referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	Kabusunzu's conference of 23 to 24th July 1993. 
A.	Is -- what you mean is the MDR congress?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Yes, I was there.  I attended that conference from the 23rd to the 24th. 
Q.	And, Mr. Niyitegeka, did that congress have any impact with respect to the cohesion of your party, the MDR? 
A.	Indeed.  That congress clarified -- rather, that congress highlighted divisions within the party.  
	For example, indeed, Twagiramungu, who was a president of the party, did not attend it, whereas the two vice-presidents as well as the secretary of the party attended it, that is, Dismas Nsengiyaremye, who was the first vice-president; Froduald Karamira, who was the second vice-president; 
	Donat Murego, who was the national secretary of the party; we, the members of the political bureau, as well as the other participants at the congress; whereas you also had people like Twagiramungu, the 
	national president of the party who did not attend the congress.  

There were other members of the party, which is a really small minority, which did not attend the party, whereas they had been invited to attend it. 
Q.	Now, could you tell the Chamber briefly what the decisions or the resolutions of the congress were, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	We were talking about resolutions.  I can't recall.  It is difficult to tell you what all the resolutions during that meeting -- which were taken during that meeting, that congress, were.  

But allow me to say that the most significant of the resolutions was to suspend from the party -- in any case, from the bodies of the parties -- of the party all congress -- all members of the party who did not attend the congress.  

What I'm saying is suspend people who -- all members who were invited and who did not attend from the bodies of the party and people who did not have valid excuses.  For example, 
Mr. Twagiramungu, Faustin, was suspended.  The national chair of the party, 
Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana, who was prime minister, attended the meeting but who subsequently left and made a statement recanting what she had stated and signed.  

That is a long story and I wonder if I am allowed to go into the details as to how she recant -- she withdrew her statement, because these are things that happened in the party.  But all members of the party who did not attend the congress by boycotting it were suspended from the party bodies. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I believe it may not be useless for you to provide the details about the suspension of Madam Agathe Uwilingiyimana. 
A.	Very well.  Uwilingiyimana, Agathe, was the president of the MDR in the Butare préfecture.  She was prime minister.  Prior to that, she had been minister of primary and secondary education.  In July 1993 she was prime minister.  

She arrived at the meeting in Kabusunzu.  We were happy to welcome her and acclaimed her.  The party was facing a problem because the Agathe government had been set up without the approval of the MDR political bureau.

The very Agathe had been appointed prime minister by the president of the republic based on the proposal by Faustin Twagiramungu and not on the basis of the proposal of the MDR political bureau, which was in contradiction with the statements of the party.  

There were other members of cabinet from the MDR party, especially the 
minister of primary and secondary education, the minister of information and the 
minister of foreign affairs who had been appointed to their offices as ministers without having been proposed by the party.  They had sorely been proposed by Chairman Twagiramungu without approval of the political bureau of the party, and this went against the statutes of the party.  And as a matter of fact, that is what led to the holding of that meeting in Kabusunzu on the 23rd and 24th of July.  

When Agathe Uwilingiyimana arrived there she acknowledged that the procedure for her appointments was indeed faulty and committed to toe the line of the party.  As a matter of fact, she signed a resignation letter.  She signed a letter resigning as prime minister.  She left because this was in the evening of the 23rd and everyone was leaving.  And on the morning of the 24th we heard over 
national radio that she -- claiming that she had been sequestrated and forced to sign that resignation letter.  

It was something hard for us to understand because we didn't have an army and we didn't have the means of sequestrating a prime minister who had a republican guard to protect her.  We could not have sequestrated the prime minister.  And I was there.  I was there.  I tell you, to be candid, she had not been sequestrated.  

But when she went back, Twagiramungu and others called when she had already signed that resignation letter -- learnt that she had signed that resignation letter.  They went to her house.  They threatened her, forcing her to recant and state that she had been sequestrated by the members of the congress.  She agreed.  And in brief that's what happened. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, all those quarrels within the MDR party and the diverging or divergent opinions, were they in any way related to the elimination of Tutsis? 
A.	I may not be a great analyst of things, but as far as I know, I do not see any relationship between these things and the elimination of Tutsis.  Agathe was not Tutsi, Twagiramungu himself was not Tutsi and the other members of government who were suspended from the structures of the party were not Tutsi.  So I do not see the relation that may have existed between those things and the elimination of Tutsis. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Niyitegeka, in October 1993, Melchoir Ndadaye, president of Burundi, was assassinated.  What were the consequences of that assassination within your party, particularly in respect of the peace process in Rwanda? 
A.	I believe that within our party there were no power (inaudible) distinct consequences as such.  But in general terms, in Rwanda the death or assassination of President Melchoir Ndadaye was actually felt to be a tragedy for Rwanda and for the entire region, but more specifically for Rwanda, because 
	Melchoir Ndadaye was of Burundi nationality but he did his secondary education at the Butare school complex in Rwanda.  He attended university studies in Rwanda at the National University of Rwanda.  And he came to Rwanda in 1972.  And from 1972 to 1990 he remained in Rwanda before returning to his country.

So he had somewhat become a Rwandan.  He studied in Rwanda.  He worked in Rwanda .  And he was like a Rwandan, although he was of Burundi nationality.  Yes, he was Hutu.  And when he was 
elected president in Burundi, a civilian president at that, who was taking over from Tutsi presidents who had been soldiers and who had been in power since 1965, well, you can imagine for yourself how people may have felt, both in Rwanda and Burundi and even in Congo and throughout the entire region.  

As for the MDR party, we also felt that it was an unfortunate tragedy, particularly given that 
Melchoir Ndadaye had been elected to replace a military president, a soldier.  And in Rwanda we were still struggling to overthrow the military government and replace it with a civilian regime.  

So you can see for yourself how we were all shocked by this total disappointment.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, the MDR power, was it an offshoot of that event or did it arise because of the assassination of Melchoir Ndadaye? 
A.	Now, Counsel, the concept of MDR power is a pejorative concept because the -- the concept of 
	MDR power in reality does not exist.  It never really existed as a faction or anything else.  It was actually a slogan of the MDR, that is MDR power, which means a party which has power and strength and force, but it wasn't defined as a faction of the party as such.  

This concept was examined during my trial, and the Judges even agreed that the Prosecutor had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that the MDR power existed.  The Judges were right on that score because the MDR power has never existed as such.  

And what I'm telling you is that this is a pejorative concept which, by the way, was simply a political slogan:  MDR force, MDR Nguvu.  These are the kind of slogans that are used in political parties like Chama cha, Mapinduzi, Nguvu, which is said here.  So this was a slogan like any other slogan that can be used by a political party.  Nobody can show you the president of the MDR party.  Nobody can show you the constitution of MDR power.  Nobody can show you the colours of the MDR party, or whatever relating to the MDR party as such -- MDR power as such.  So it is a pejorative concept. 
Q.	Now, what about the concept of Hutu Power? 
A.	That concept is also a pejorative concept.  I do not know where those concepts are drawn from, because what is Hutu Power?  You see, I know one:  TIP, which is the acronym of 
	Tutsi International Power.  TIP.  That existed.  But you cannot show me or tell me or represent to me where Hutu Power ever existed.  But as for TIP, Tutsi International Power, yes, that structure existed.  

Now, as for Hutu Power, I don't know who was its representative.  I don't know what its structures were.  I am Hutu.  But I don't know how a Hutu Power could have been created, and I would not have been part of it.  I say so because I have never been part of Hutu Power.  I'm mindful of the position I held in the country.  I should have somehow been associated to the Hutu Power, if it had existed.  And I would have been very surprised if any such thing existed without my being linked to it. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, Hutu Power, was it an ideology? 
A.	Counsel, maybe you're just hurting me for nothing, so don't even talk about this thing because it never existed, neither as an ideology nor as a slogan, to the best of my knowledge at least. 
Q.	I'm sorry to hurt you, even unto death, as such.  But let me proceed.  Was Hutu Power -- to use your own words, was it a slogan against the Tutsis? 
A.	Well, Counsel, if I die now it would've been by your own premeditation.  

Now, Hutu Power never existed as a slogan.  In all the meetings that I personally attended, one must say here that I only attended MDR rallies or meetings, and I dare say not all of them.  But all the meetings I attended, I never heard use of the slogan if it were Hutu Power.  Personally, I did not. 
Q.	Well, thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  I will abandon this line of questioning, even if it were only to spare 
	your life.

Let me now move on to ask you to tell us what you know about PL, Parti libéral.  
A.	The Parti libéral was one of the five political parties that made up the government of Rwanda from the 14th of April 1992.  The chairman of that party was Mugenzi -- Mugenzi, Augustin -- Justin, rather.  Justin, rather.  
Q.	That party also experienced divisions; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is true that there was a faction within the Parti libéral, because from the very beginning, and if my recollection is correct, the party was constituted or set up on the 14th of July 1991.  As for my party, it was the 1st of July 1991.  
And I believe that one week after, on 14th July 1991, the PL was created.  And at that time its membership was essentially made up of business persons -- business persons, both Hutu and Tutsi alike.  But when compared to the MDR, the PSD and the MRND, there were Tutsis in the Parti libéral, so much so that the impression was given that it was a Tutsi party.  As a matter of fact, the vice-chair of the PL, Landoald Ndasingwa, was a Tutsi and Justin Mugenzi was Hutu.  

So there came a time when members of the party, to represent the party at the national assembly, were to be designated or nominated to the broad-based transitional national assembly.  At that time, of the nine positions of the Parti libéral, the majority of persons nominated were -- was Tutsi, and 
Justin Mugenzi, the founder of the party, was not happy with that situation.  Let me say that this observation is only my interpretation of the events, but clearly he was not satisfied with that distribution.  So he called for nominations for members of the party to represent the PL at the broad-based national assembly.

So this situation led to -- to a lot of problems within the party, to the extent that one -- what is his name again?  He was director of cabinet at the ministry of justice.  I need to remember his name.  Well, I don't.  The name doesn't come to mind right away.  But that person, Ndasingwa, and other Tutsis were members of the party, and as a majority they were able to chase out Mugenzi from the party and to organise a congress of the party at which another committee was set up.  Another national committee of the party was set up.

So as you can see, this was a clear division within the party.  And contrary to what had happened within the MDR when people were saying that Twagiramungu had been suspended from the 
head of the party, what actually happened was that we did not dismiss him.  We simply suspended him as a disciplinary measure and the president -- or the chairman of the MDR was not replaced at that time.  

As for the PL, the divorce had actually been consummated, so to speak.
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, your understanding of that divorce, which you say was, so to speak, consummated on the political level within the PL with the departure of Mugenzi, did that divorce ultimately lead to a creation of a movement for the elimination of Tutsis in Rwanda? 
A.	No, not at all.  It was only a temporary divorce, a divorce which didn't last long, because the other political parties, particularly the FDC, that is, the Democratic Forces for Change, as well as diplomatic representatives and missions, they invited the representatives of that party to work towards reunification.  So in March/April 1994 the party was reunited, as far as I know.  
The connotation about the elimination of Tutsis, even though it may have appeared to be so with the eviction of Mugenzi, was no longer to be valid once the divorce was set aside and the party was reunited.  So there was no longer any such connotation obtaining as to giving the impression, the impression whatsoever, that there may have been any intention or any goals of eliminating Tutsis. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, let us now move on to the Arusha Accords.

Now, when the parties -- when the parties are dealing with the Arusha Accords around the RPF, what motivated those parties to join that discussion?  
A.	You know that there were several Arusha agreements, and I take it that you are referring to the 
	Arusha Peace Accords of 3 August '93 which put an end to the war; is that correct?  
Q.	Yes.  And you do well to point it out to me, Mr. Niyitegeka.  That is what I am referring to.  
A.	The Arusha Peace Accords of August 1993 were, indeed, very timely because they had effectively put an end to the three-year-long war.  That accord made provision for the setting up of a 
	transitional government, a broad-based transitional government, meaning that the MRND party and 
	five opposition parties, the FDC, that is the Democratic Forces for Change, and the RPF, were expected to join that transitional government which had a two-year mandate to be followed by elections.

As members of opposition parties, we were happy and satisfied with the Arusha Peace Accords, particularly because of the two-year time frame which would be followed by political competition and elections which we hoped we would win, so we were gearing up for the exercise.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, when you came to those negotiations of the Arusha Accords, were you approaching the matter as a political undertaking with the RPF?  Or were you thinking about some 
	joint criminal enterprise which sought to exterminate Tutsis some day? 
A.	I think it is evident that when you are in negotiation the idea is not to eliminate another.  There was no intention to eliminate Tutsis.  The Arusha agreements, as well as all the other agreements that were negotiated, were negotiated politically.  The late negotiator of these agreements was 
	Boniface Ngulinzira.  It is true that he was a Hutu, and it is also a known fact that he was murdered on the 7th or the 8th of April 1993.  He was also a victim of the April 1994 (sic) events.  I don't think that he would have negotiated those agreements, agreements that were meant to ultimately kill him alongside the other victims.  So it was political in nature, and, to be candid, it had nothing ethnic in nature. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, you must be aware that within the framework of the setting up of the 
	transitional institutions that President Habyarimana took the oath of office in January -- in January 1994, on the 5th of January, if my memory is correct.  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	In the afternoon the ceremony which ought to have taken place for others did not take place; is that correct? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber why that ceremony did not take place? 
A.	The reason is that part of the guests who were invited to that ceremony boycotted it. 
Q.	Is that all you know about it, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	Let me say that I wasn't invited to that ceremony.  But as a Rwandan and a person who was closely monitoring events, and that event was of major importance, it so happened that the deputies - because, as a matter of fact, the afternoon had been scheduled for the oath of office for the broad-based transitional government deputies.  And so it so happened that some deputies, some political parties, especially the RPF, did not send their deputies to that 
	afternoon's oath-taking ceremony.  And they are the ones who boycotted the ceremony, and that's the reason why the ceremony did not take place.  And so the morning had been meant for the president to take the oath of office.  The afternoon ought to have seen the oath taking of the deputies and members of cabinet. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, are you aware that Mr. Félicién Gatabazi was murdered on the 21st of February 1994? 
A.	Yes, it is true that is the day that he was murdered. 
Q.	After the failure of the planned oath-taking ceremony for the 5th of February 1994, another ceremony was scheduled on the 22nd of February 1994 for oath taking.  
A.	Yes, it would appear. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, what was the result, the consequences, of the murder of Mr. Gatabazi on that ceremony which had been planned for the 22nd of February 1994, if you know something about it? 
A.	You know, Félicién Gatabazi had been proposed to be minister of public works.  He also had to take the oath of office on the 22nd of February, whereas he got murdered on the eve.  And Gatabazi was not an ordinary person.  He was PSD national secretary, a party which had the greatest influence in the southern part of the country in Butare.  

So things were too tense.  Things were not moving on well.  A swearing-in ceremony could not have been organised on the day when the others were burying the people who ought to have been 
members of that cabinet, and especially in Butare, which was the stronghold office party.

And it was another shockwave, in addition to those who had come before it, and I am referring here to the murder of Emmanuel Gapyisi and the assassination of Melchoir Ndadaye, the former president of Burundi.  That was the third Hutu to have been murdered in that manner.  So people were wondering what was going on, who was behind these assassinations.  It created a lot of unease within the population.  
Q.	And Martin Bucyana, could you also talk about his assassination, while we are at it. 
A.	Let me say that Martin Bucyana was president of the coalition for the defence of the republic, and he was a native of the Kiambo (phonetic) commune.  And he was assassinated on the day following the murder of Félicién Gatabazi.  Both were former ministers, and you know Gatabazi was from 
	Butare préfecture, which was a neighbouring préfecture to Burundi.  Gapyisi Burundi (sic,) who had been assassinated, from the Gikongoro préfecture, which was also a neighbouring commune to Burundi; Bucyana, Martin, from another préfecture, which was close to Burundi, had also been murdered.  That created a lot of malaise within the country and in the region. 
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, was that malaise of a political nature or was it of an ethnic nature? 
A.	Clearly the malaise was beginning to become ethnic.  And I'm saying from the look of things it had begun to become ethnic because it was difficult to understand what was happening and people were beginning to whisper.  They were beginning to avoid each other, but it wasn't evident.  People were beginning to become suspicious of each other, indeed.  But clearly there seemed to be an ethnic connotation.  Up to that point it was political, but it was beginning to take on an ethnic colouring. 
Q.	So, Mr. Niyitegeka, what happened on the 25th of March 1994, a date on which a new ceremony for the setting up of transitional institutions was scheduled, as far as you remember? 
A.	Granted that on that day the swearing-in ceremony had been scheduled, and once more it was postponed or boycotted for reasons that were not very clearly stated. 
Q.	Did the RPF ever attend that ceremony? 
A.	The RPF boycotted that ceremony, but it did not give any -- state any reasons.  The reasons they claimed was the presence of one member of the CDR party on the list of deputies who had to take the oath of office.  But that reason was a lame reason because the problem had already been sorted out.  It had been agreed that the CDR should have one deputy within the -- in the assembly, one single deputy in the assembly.

Now, to have claimed that -- that the RPF deputies could not sit alongside one single 
CDR deputy -- deputy in our view was a lame excuse.  And indeed it was unfounded. 
Q.	Witness, since you're talking about the CDR, let us embark on that.  Tell the Chamber, as far as you are concerned, you, the MDR that is, what was the CDR?  What was the CDR?  
A.	That is a serious issue because if I talk about it as a member of the MDR -- rather, let me speak 
	as a -- this is going to be politics.  I wonder if you would allow me to go political. 
Q.	Well, you know, Mr. Niyitegeka, my goal in this line of questioning is attempting to show that in your relationship with political parties in Rwanda up until the signing of the Arusha agreements, and even beyond that, I'm trying to show the Chamber that all you had were political problems.  
A.	Indeed.  I was saying I ran the risk of becoming political because, of course, my political party was against the CDR, in the same manner as it was against the MRND.

Now, asking me to tell you what the CDR was -- 
Q.	Very well.  Carry on.  
A.	Okay.  I would tell you that it was a party that was close to the MRND, and -- and which I opposed.  I mean to say against which my political party was opposed. 
Q.	So your position in -- with respect to CDR was political, right? 
A.	Yes, indeed, purely political. 
Q.	Your position with respect to the CDR had nothing to do -- rather, did it have anything to do with the fact that the party was targeting -- was led against the Tutsis? 
A.	Granted, the CDR held radical positions in its speeches.  Its position was a radical position with respect to the Tutsis -- with respect to the RPF, firstly, but with respect to the Tutsis as a whole.

Q.	Thank you very much.  Mr. Niyitegeka, we have concluded this part of my line of questioning.  If I understood you well, the political parties which you represented alongside the MRND right up to the Arusha agreements had disagreements which were political in nature; is that correct? 
A.	The problems within political parties, as far as I am aware, were political in nature except at some time within the PL party, and that was a problem that was resolved very speedily.  But generally speaking and within the MDR, the problems were political in nature. 
Q.	Thank you.  If I understand you well, Mr. Niyitegeka, the CDR which had out -- that had shown itself to be in transition against the RPF did not -- and please correct me if I'm wrong -- did not actually abide or did not take the position of eliminating the Tutsis as an ethnic group; is that correct?
A.	But, Counsel, the CDR did not do so and could not have done so because they were not authorised to do so.  The law on political parties did not allow the setting up of a political party based on discrimination, be it ethnic, racial, or regional and so on and so forth or even religious.  So the CDR had to abide by the laws governing political parties. 
Q.	Lastly, in spite of the failures with respect to the setting up of the transitional institutions, no idea of a joint criminal enterprise was mooted within your various alliances against the RPF; is that correct? 
A.	But all the alliances and all the meetings that were held were concluded by communiqués.  If such an alliance -- if an alliance of an ethnic nature was held, that could have been seen by reading any of those communiqués.  But ask the Prosecution which has collected a large quantity of documents and even his investigators have even more.  Let them disclose even one document, just one communiqué of the political parties that refer to such an alliance with respect to elimination of the Tutsi.  I know nothing about that, and to be candid, I believe that we have to be transparent.

You have to have the courage to speak the truth.  In reality that did not happen.  I believe that we have come to a point where people need to face the truth.  That did not exist. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Niyitegeka, we are now on the 6th of April 1994.  President Habyarimana's plane was shot down at night.  Subsequent to that, there is chaos, disorder, killings.  And on the 9th of April, an interim government is set up.

Could you tell the Trial Chamber, in brief, how this government saw the light of day.
A.	As you say, on the 6th of April, the evening of the 6th of April 1994, the plane carrying the president of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, as well as the president of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, as well as Gapyisi, in all 12 people, was shot down.  The plane was shot down.

As we stated a while ago, you had the murder of Gatsinzi of Gikongoro, Gatabazi of Butare, the murder of Bucyana in Cyangugu.  You had had the murder, the assassination, of Melchior Ndadaye of Burundi.  And now this is the assassination of President Habyarimana of Rwanda, the president of Burundi, the army chief of staff of the Rwandan army, and other members of the delegation.

Everyone can imagine what would be the outcome of such a series of events, and everyone could wonder how could people have been in such a situation.  It was complete disorder.  So the first murders that occurred in February provoked people to start saying that this was of an ethnic nature.  And we need to face the fact that people in both communities -- I'm referring to both the Hutus and the Tutsis.  There were some Tutsis who were in CDR, extremists who were beginning to tell people that, "Now, this and that.  This is what you have done."

There were people who were fanning the flames.  You had Hutus who were also intolerant, who did not understand that they were not -- they did not lend a favourable ear to that sort of comments.  So the situation was fiery, and it exploded.  And the government was borne out of that explosion in which people had started killing each other.  It was complete chaos.   

That is the truth.  It was complete chaos, and the government is an offshoot of that chaos.  Political parties which were in the cabinet -- there were five of them -- got together, the officials of the parties, those who were alive, because some had been murdered.  Those who were able to be located got together and chose to set up a government, an interim government that is, which had a 6-week mandate -- and I need to insist on that, 6 weeks, 42 days, during which they assigned themselves three objectives. 
Q.	Witness, we will get to that, and we'll have the time to deal with that in detail.  But let me put the following question to you:  When the interim government is set up, does it act and behave as a government of joint criminal enterprise in view of eliminating the Tutsis?  Do you understand my question?
A.	Yes, indeed.  The government was set up on the 9th of April 1994.  And it was assigned three goals, and none of them was the elimination of the Tutsis.  The three assignments were clear, and it had a 6-week mandate only.  And after it was 6 weeks, it had to give way to the broad-based government which was enlarged to the Tutsis.  So the elimination of the Tutsi could not have been part of the assignment of the government and was never part of the interim government's assignments.  
Q.	Very well.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, it is half past ten, and I have this line of questions on the transitional government.  I would rather carry on with it after a mid-morning break if you do allow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1055H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, you may continue.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, let us proceed and talk about the 6th of April.  You have described the situation on that day -- killings, massacres, and what have you.  And then on the 9th of April, the interim government is set up.  And you have already told the Trial Chamber what the goals and objectives of that government were.

Now, let us proceed, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Now, when that first meeting of the interim government met on the 9th of April, that meeting actually held on the 9th of April; is that the case?
A.	Yes, indeed.  The government was sworn in in the morning of the 9th of April 1994.  And after 
	that swearing-in ceremony, we agreed to meet again at 16 hours in the afternoon for the 
	first cabinet meeting or council of ministers meeting.  
Q.	During that first meeting of the cabinet, what was the main agenda item? 
A.	The main agenda item was the prevailing situation in the country at that time.  We had already been assigned the three objectives assigned by the political parties that had set up the government.  And we were, therefore, charged with exploring ways and means of implementing those three goals.  

First we had to deal with the issue of security arising from the massacres, acts of violence, the looting, and all else that was happening in the country and particularly in the capital city because you know that the entire country was not yet affected.   But the capital city, Kigali, was facing security problems including also issues of displaced persons who were around the capital city, more than a 
million persons in the vicinity of the capital.

Then we also had to deal with the resumption of negotiations with the RPF for the setting up of the broad-based transitional government within a time frame of six weeks corresponding to the mandate of the government.  
Q.	Didn't you talk about issues relating to the general pacification of the country? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  The security issue had to be resolved through pacification, the call on peace, calm.  And that was what pacification of the country was -- 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, would you be so kind as to hand over to the witness document number 2 on the list of documents which I will use during this trial.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document? 
A.	Signed Marcel Gatsinzi?  
Q.	No.  That is not the document.  
A.	A press release signed by Marcel Gatsinzi?  
Q.	No.  It is the first meeting of the cabinet on the 9th of April 1994 at 4 p.m. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, is that indeed document number 2 on my list of documents?  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Is that the document, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  This is the first note from the first cabinet meeting.  
Q.	It is handwritten; right?  And are you the one who wrote it?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So you acknowledge this document; right? 
A.	Yes.  This is my document.  I am the one who took these notes. 
Q.	Very well.  In looking at those notes, would you say it corresponds to what we said a while ago with respect to the answer you gave me on the massacres, the pacification meeting with a 
	well-defined schedule for the préfets, the resumption of contacts with the RPF to carry on the process for the implementation of the transitional institutions?  Is that it? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	So if I understand, the document corresponds to all the answers that you gave me with respect to the meeting you held on the 9th of April, that is to say, three days barely after the assassination of President Habyarimana.  Is that it?
A.	Yes.  As you can see, on the first page it is stated that we had to launch a message of pacification and a halting of violence.  And below the chapter on urgent measures to be taken, a meeting with the préfets and a message of pacification and stop -- a halt of violence.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, may I pray you to allow me to have this document admitted?  Is it under D. NZ?

Mr. Issa, would that be 762?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, at this stage I would oppose the admission of the document.  I'd actually like to hear more about it.  This seems to be one page of what appears to be a notebook.  It's a copy.  

If this is the witness's document, perhaps Mr. Nimy can find out from him if there is an entire notebook of such notes on the meetings of the cabinet and if the witness has the original in his possession.  I note that it does not have an ERN number.  So this was not something that came from the Office of the Prosecutor.  

It doesn't appear to be a seizure that was recovered from the witness when he was arrested.  So can we find out more about the notebook itself -- where it is now, where it was when he was arrested -- and get some more background information about it before any of its contents are admitted in evidence.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  You heard what the Prosecution just suggested.  Could you provide those details to him. 
A.	Yes.  The Prosecution concerns are relevant, and I would like to tell him that this piece of paper is not part of a notepad.  Rather, I was taking notes on pieces of paper.  I did not have a notepad.  So I was taking the notes on a piece of paper.  And these notes were not part of the seizure documents, and these were part of the notes which are not part of the documents that were seized.  And these are notes that I had in my keeping, and I can provide you with the original if you require it.

The original has time one, but if you so desire, I can show you the original document from which this copy was made.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, my curiosity is actually how these managed to survive the witness's arrest.  Because had they been in his possession at the time of his arrest, they would have been seized and we would have recovered them in the Office of the Prosecutor and we would have processed them and analysed them.  

But the witness appears in court today for the first time.  I believe this is the first time he's ever testifying before the ICTR with a document that he claims -- or Mr. Nimy claims are notes that he took on the 9th of April 1994.  And I'd like to know where they were when he was arrested, how he's managed to get a hold of them since he's been arrested.  So I want to know more about the authenticity and the integrity of the document.  

So if the witness has the original, I'd like to see it.  And if the witness has other notes from other cabinet meetings, I'd like him to make those available as well.   
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, allow me firstly to draw the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that these documents were disclosed to the Prosecutor on the 22nd of February.  And so he has them in his keeping.  And as to the other fact, these were notes of the witness which were not seized, but that is irrelevant.  

They are his notes, and they are useful.  The witness has recognised them.  The Prosecution -- they were disclosed to the Prosecutor, and I can see how these would be a hindrance for these notes to be taken into account and entered into evidence, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we will wait until the cross-examination of this witness to decide on the admission of the document into evidence.  
MR. NIMY: 
Much obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, after the meeting of the 9th of April, the interim government met again the next day.
A.	Yes, indeed.  We met the following day because the agenda had not been exhausted. 
Q.	And the concerns of the government during that second meeting were still in connection with the security issues? 
A.	Yes, it was.  It was the agenda which had been drawn which we carried on with. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. Issa, would you kindly hand over to the witness document number 3 in my bundle of documents.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Now, as you said a while ago, this was a continuation of the preceding meeting.
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	During which you were asking the collaboration of the Rwandan armed forces to stop the killings.
A.	Yes.  This is a continuation of the agenda of the cabinet which had started on the 9th of April. 
Q.	Now, could you tell the Chamber in more detail what is the outcome of these minutes which you had in handwriting.
A.	Firstly, I would like to apologise for the notes.  They have the words "pacification" which I poorly spelled it -- wrongly spelled it.  Instead of writing "C", I put "SS".  

It is pacification, that is, the call for peace.  Now, to answer your question more directly, as I said a while ago, this was the continuation of the examination of the agenda which had been agreed on the previous day.  That pacification or that agenda, with respect to measures taken, we had to see -- examine the practical implementation of those measures which had been taken.

That is why, as you can see among the points that were -- the items on the agenda that are examined, we had to call on the Rwandan armed forces to collaborate entirely for the violence to come to a stop.  You need to say that some of the members of the Rwandan armed forces had also been involved in the attacks.  And we wanted them to also contribute -- to collaborate.  We wanted complete collaboration for this violence, for the violence to come to an end.

As you can see, we said the fact that -- we talked about the fact that Kigali was full of bandits.  You must say that the prevailing situation on the 10th of April that had been close to one week -- it had been five days -- that markets were closed.  Stores were shut down.  
People, especially bandits, had started looting.  There was nothing to eat and nothing to do.  There was no work.  People stayed indoors.  So thieves had started looting.  That is why we were saying that the government had to do everything in its power to instruct youth, especially who were involved in those lootings, especially the youth wing of political parties -- to call on them to cease the banditing.

And you had roadblocks that were improvised to encourage this looting.  Anyone could set up a roadblock just to take advantage of the chaos to still loot or seize others' property.  We said that these improvised roadblocks had to be lifted so that only roadblocks which were recognised by the conseiller, that is, the local authorities, that is, the commune conseillers and the responsable of the cellule.

And there's an item which cites a message of the apostolic nuncio in Kigali.  In that pacification message, he stated that what was happening during that period.  That is, the people of Rwanda could not be blessed by God because of what was happening at that time because it was horrible.  It was a regrettable situation, and we used that message and forwarded it to the people.

And as I said inter alia, our objective was to get in touch with the RPF to carry on with the negotiations in view of setting up a broad-based transitional government within a maximum period of six weeks.  And amongst other items that we discussed, we asked the minister of the interior as well as the minister of justice to pay more attention to security issues.  That, amongst other items, is what was discussed on the 10th of April 1994 during a cabinet meeting which led to a press conference that was planned for 
2 p.m.  And after -- so after the cabinet meeting, we had our first press conference, the first one for the prime minister. 
Q.	We will get there, Mr. Niyitegeka.

With respect to that meeting of the 10th of April 1994, with respect to your concerns as a government, you didn't talk about encouraging the elimination of Tutsis; right?
A.	Nowhere on the agenda does that issue occur.  The issue of eliminating Tutsi was never raised in any cabinet meeting in which I was in attendance and, as a matter of fact, for which I was the spokesperson.
Q.	Very well. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would love to pray the Chamber to have the second document admitted into evidence.  But I presume that for the same reasons the Prosecutor will object -- will stand, will get to his feet, because it is a handwritten document.  The witness has recognised it as he is the one who wrote it.  It is a two-page document.  Apparently it doesn't come from a notepad.  The document was disclosed to the Prosecution on the 22nd of February, and he is aware of it.

I don't know if in the meantime he has changed his mind and will not object to this document being admitted into evidence, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I haven't changed my position, but after the cross-examination, maybe it won't be an issue.  So if we can wait until then, it shouldn't prejudice Mr. Nimy at all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will defer our decision until after the cross-examination.  
MR. NIMY: 
As it pleases the Court, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, we are now at your press conference in the afternoon of the day of the meeting.  I believe this is important because you are no longer within the cabinet meeting between yourself, ministers.  But now you are facing the Rwandan public opinion, and you are speaking; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  It is exact.  It is correct.  That press conference -- I must say that that press conference had been recommended by the preceding -- the previous day's cabinet meeting, that is, the meeting of the 9th of April.

You can see on the second page of my note, it states that on the 9th of April, under item number 534 of the registry number, third point from the bottom, we're talking about the organisation of a 
press conference by the prime minister on Sunday, the 10th of April 1994.  Are you there? 

To execute that recommendation, I had made a radio communiqué inviting both the private and public press, the international and local, to come to a press conference.  And that is a press conference which was led by the prime minister at 2 p.m. on Sunday, the 10th of April. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like to request the assistance of Mr. Issa to hand over to the witness this 
	fourth set in my documents which deals with that press conference which the witness has just talked about in brief.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the documents, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Could you go to page 17 of that document.  Are you there, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I am, Counsel.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, would you allow me to ask my assistant, in order not to tire the witness, to read the passage or to ask the witness to read the passages I refer him to? 

THE WITNESS:
I am not tired.  I can read it if you so allow.  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, of course, if the President so allows.

Witness, the question was meant for the President.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So, Witness, go to page 17, the last paragraph, beginning with, "Ku wa gatanu".  
A.	Shall I start reading?  "On Friday the leaders of five political parties who were in the government met and declared as follows:  'Soldiers, you have done well to set up a crisis meeting.  However, we, the politicians here present, wish to collaborate with you.  

"'As expressed, according to the desires of the soldiers, we call on you to work together to set up the bodies that could allow us to set up the transitional institutions that would be enlarged to RPF and that this would be carried on.'"

So they met on Friday evening and decided that each party would present their candidates according to what was negotiated during negotiations between political parties, the government that was set up yesterday.  And in the evening the first cabinet meeting was held.  Today as from 9 a.m. that 
cabinet meeting carried on with its deliberations.

We decided that the media should be informed on the way that government was conducting its work.  We are not talking about journalists from a single press body.  It doesn't have to be government journalists but, rather, that all available journalists should have the possibility to come and ask questions to the prime minister.

With respect to responsibilities, the two items I just talked about, I did not say that that government had decided to do everything to resolve the issue of starvation which was still killing people across the country.  So there was an issue of security.  You had the matter of carrying through the 
Arusha negotiations and, of course, the issue of famine.  Of course, there are other issues.  And the government in power would try to resolve them.  
Q.	Okay.  You can leave it at that, Mr. Niyitegeka.

Up to that point, does the government talk about the extermination of Tutsis to the people?
A.	Clearly -- clearly, government is talking about peace, about putting a stop to the hostilities but never about the elimination of Tutsis.  Tutsis are not mentioned anywhere.  The concept of the elimination of Tutsis is not mentioned anywhere. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, I take you to page 19.  Please turn to that page with me.  And at line 4 where you have speaker, Prime Minister Kambanda, Jean, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you read that first line which starts with "Murakoze."
A.	"I thank you.  The minister of information has just told you that, as a matter of fact, the government that was set up by political parties was given three duties, three goals:  Namely, restoring security in the country, implementing the Arusha Peace Accords, and seeking assistance for those who are hungry in the country and particularly taking care of war-displaced persons."  That is all.   
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Now I would ask you to turn to page 20, line 3, starting with, 
	"Perezida wa republika".
A.	"The president of the republic.  People need to know, particularly foreigners, that the 
	president of the republic is not an ordinary personality.  He is not an ordinary person.  

When a president dies, you do not say that he has been killed by X or Y.  Because when a president dies, it is as if the head of a family has disappeared leaving behind many orphans, orphans who he loved or orphans who loved him or who do not love him.  This is what led to the unrest, and our desire is for people to understand this."  That is it. 
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  That message alludes to the death of the president of the republic.  Does it a call for the elimination of Tutsis?
A.	Negative. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, turn with me to the next page, page 21.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Please read line 1 from, "Muri mwe harimo".  Are you there?  
A.	Yes, I am, Counsel.  
Q.	Please proceed.
A.	"There are people amongst you who are wondering why the Arusha Peace Accords were not implemented, why the Arusha Peace Accords were not applied.  Since those Accords had already been signed, why were the political parties who had presented candidates to the president of the republic -- why were those parties not asked to propose candidates to the presidency of the republic given that the president had just died?

"In so doing, they would appoint a prime minister of the broad-based transitional government who will then be able to set up a government.  In so doing, we would not have understood reality which was not possible, in any event, for two reasons, the first reason being legal in nature.  

"Namely, from a legal standpoint, the Arusha Peace Accords did not provide for or did not foresee what has transpired.  The Accords did not foresee the death of the president prior to the setting up of the transitional institutions.

"The Arusha Peace Accords did not provide for a replacement of the president under such circumstances.  So that is not possible.  You cannot, therefore, replace somebody through an instrument which does not make provision for such replacement.

"The second point relates to the prevailing situation at the time.  The party which should have proposed a candidate to the presidency was the MRND.  But we have been informed that, according to the statements of that party, such a proposal would require holding a congress of the party.

"Therefore, the party would have had to invite all its members across the country to such a convention.  However, the situation prevailing in the country did not allow for such a convention to be organised quickly.

"And the third reason which I did not mention in my introduction relates to the setting up of the transitional institutions as a matter of urgency, particularly because the population were in an impasse and people had taken up killings and there was no one to advise and guide them and assist them.

"It, therefore, became necessary for the chairman of political parties working with military authorities to take the courageous decision to set up administrative structures pursuant to the 1991 constitution which provides that in the case of unavailability for any reason whatsoever of the president of the republic or head of state, he shall be provisionally replaced by the president of the national development council.

"This is what was done when the president of the national development council was appointed president of the republic provisionally.  He then appointed a prime minister pursuant to the 1992 accords between political parties.

"The prime minister met with the political parties and tabled before the president a list of candidates who should have been appointed to the positions of ministers.  There was agreement on that list, and a government was set up and three objectives or goals assigned to the said government."

"The three main goals of that government" are dash dash dash or dot dot dot.  But the three main objectives or goals was to restore security.  That is why I want to address this with you.  There is a message for the army, the national army.
Q.	Well, you can stop there, Mr. Witness, before we move on to the next segment.  But what you have just read reflecting the concern of the interim government occurred three days after the shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane.  
Does that amount to an aggressive criminal call for the elimination of Tutsis so far?
A.	Well, I believe it is for those listening to the message to assess for themselves what it means.  As for me, I am convinced that there is no line in this document which calls for the massacre or elimination of Tutsis in Rwanda. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, let me ask you a second question for the benefit of the Trial Chamber.  You are reading from a document in Kinyarwanda which is a language used by Hutu, Tutsis, and Twa.
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Is there any coded message in that document which can only be understood by Hutus and which would not be understood by moderate Hutus or Tutsis? 
A.	Well, this problem of coded language only seems to have emerged here at this Tribunal.  Coded language has never existed, at least not in 1994, because I was one of the actors and one of the witnesses to these things. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, Mr. Niyitegeka, having said that, I would like you to continue reading the next paragraph which begins with "ari ubutumwa".  
A.	There is a message for the Rwandan armed forces.  "It has been said that there are soldiers among those people who are killing.  Allow me to avail myself of this opportunity to explain the following:  Generally speaking, the armed forces do not kill members of the population.  And in general terms, they have continued to provide security for the people.  

"However, this does not mean that some members of the armed forces have been involved in some activities which lead people to think that the entire army has committed crimes.  They have lacked discipline and have killed members of the public and even looted.  These things happened, but we must assert that, in general terms, the Rwandan armed forces continues to provide security and to do their level best to maintain security.  

"It is for this reason that I call on the minister of defence, as I stated yesterday in my speech, to do his level best to restore security within the population.  We have asked him to issue directives to the armed forces so that any soldiers arrested for killings or looting should be punished severely and in an exemplary manner in order to point out to anyone whosoever who has the intention to do like they have done so that such persons may be frightened and deterred.

"This is what government thinks, and the minister of defence and internal affairs have promised us that they will implement this position.  We are pleased to inform you that this is already being implemented in some neighbourhoods."

There is another message for political parties.  "I would like to inform journalists that political parties have received and accepted this message.  This morning they held meetings to finally talk to the Rwandan citizens.

"This can be understood because those involved in the killings and looting are, in the majority, members of political parties.  In other words, those who can restore calm within the population are members of political parties.

"The political parties which are part of the government have worked with the ministry of defence to ensure that they visit all neighbourhoods of the city in order to sensitise political leaders in all neighbourhoods and to call on them to provide security and also to tell their members, whether they are involved in killing or looting, as well as tell other members of the population that they must stop in order to restore security.

"So in fact, it is the leaders of political parties, all leaders of the armed forces, who desire a quick return to security and that people should not engage in senseless killings.  What happened in Liberia should lead us to think about how to build up our nation rather than destroy it."  
Q.	Well, Mr. Niyitegeka, what are the preoccupations of the interim government as of the 9th of April as reflected in these messages to the population to Rwandans through Radio Rwanda by this 
	press conference? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  The press conference was broadcast live over Radio Rwanda on that day.

1200H 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to apply for admission into evidence of document number 4, the 
Radio Rwanda speech of Niyitegeka, 10th of April 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, Your Honour, this document is already in evidence.  It is D. NZ301.  Although the witness has been reading in Kinyarwanda, we do have the translation in English -- the official translation.  And for the benefit of the record and the interpreters, we have just been reviewing pages 11, 13, 14 and 15 in the English translation.  I don't have the page numbers for the French, but all three complete transcripts are in evidence under D. NZ301. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the Kinyarwanda booth, we were not in possession of the Kinyarwanda document, we did not have the French copy, and so this was a live interpretation of what the witness was saying from Kinyarwanda into French.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just offer a compliment to the interpreters, because it was an excellent interpretation as I've been following it in the written text.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We note all comments with approbation.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to sincerely apologise to the interpreters, and allow me also to congratulate them for working under these conditions.  My services will do their level best to make up for these shortcomings, at least in the future.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Now, Witness, let us proceed.  
A.	Before we proceed, Counsel, with your leave, let me make a comment on the document.  As you can see, this is the document relating to the press conference of 10 April 1994 in the afternoon.  I hope that the Prosecutor is not challenging the validity of this document.  That having been said, let me also underscore that the document clearly shows that on the 10th of April 1994, I was in Kigali where the press conference took place at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  In the afternoon of the 10th of April 1994, contrary to what a witness testified to in this case, and I'm referring to Witness AMM, who testified that in the afternoon of the 10th of April 1994, he allegedly saw me in Gisovu in Kibuye préfecture transporting arms in a truck.  

So you can see for yourselves that I could not have been simultaneously in Gisovu, which is 185 kilometres from Kigali, and simultaneously present at a press conference on that same day.  
I just wanted to point out that false testimony by that witness who was called in my case and who testified falsely under pseudonym GGH, and who again retracted when he was again called to the court.  He repeatedly said that he had seen me in Gisovu on that very afternoon.  

So, Mr. President, Your Honours, I believe that in order to avoid all possibilities of impunity, this Trial Chamber should impeach that witness, should take action against that witness.  And I am calling for this in my capacity as a witness under oath and also in my capacity as a victim of the lies told by that witness.  

Let me again reiterate my application to the Trial Chamber -- to this Trial Chamber.  I pray you to order proceedings against this witness because it is now amply clear that this witness gave false testimony, not only in my own trial, but also in this case.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I thought you had some remarks.  I was waiting for you to allow me to carry on speaking.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Perhaps I can assist.  I don't know if it's appropriate for the witness to address the Chamber in this manner.  The Chamber will respond with its own view, but I would offer for the benefit of the parties and the Chamber that this witness has filed five separate applications for review of his 
Appeals Chamber judgement in this case, and I believe several of those applications concern this very issue.  And the Appeals Chamber has rejected him on several occasions, not just once.  

So he was judged at the Trial Chamber level; that judgement was confirmed on appeal, and subsequent to the Appeals Chamber judgement, there were several applications to review the judgements of this Chamber, which would have included some of the lines of protest that the witness just articulated.  So I think the Tribunal, as a whole, is well aware of his concerns and has already addressed them.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, simply a few remarks.  What the Prosecution has omitted to the tell the Chamber and that which maybe the present witness does not know is that the very applications were also presented by Mr. Karemera's Defence before this Trial Chamber.  And had the provisional decision that was 
made -- quite simply that the Prosecution states that the witness's application is not appropriate.  

I will leave it to the discretion of the Bench, but what I'll say here is that the present witness in the stand now has the Judges who had -- who listened to Witness AMM on this specific case and that it is normal for him to seize this unique opportunity, which he will no longer have to specify -- to remind you and to state the unbelievable itinerary of Witness I -- AMM.  I believe that this is very relevant, and I believe that this august Chamber needed to be informed about it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, the Chamber has taken note of the witness's comments -- his application and the comments of counsel.  We will consider them in due course.  

Mr. Nimy, you may continue.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President and Your Honours.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Witness, we're going to carry on with this series of meetings that the interim government held -- had been holding since the 6th of April 1994.  We are now at the meeting on the 24th of April 1994, and, to be more specific, to the interview that was granted to Radio Rwanda, and you are the one who granted that interview as you were the spokesperson of the government.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. Issa, would you kindly hand over to the witness document number 6 in my bundle of documents.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Do you have the document, Mr. Niyitegeka? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel.  
Q.	So this is the 24th of April 1994.  The interim government that was set up is trying to clarify all the situations, and, as far as it is possible, to best manage it.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is correct.  
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, I would like to refer you to page 17 of that document.  Are you there? 
A.	Yes, I am.  
Q.	And begin with the phrase, "...ndagira ngo Bwana Ministre..."
A.	Allow me to first of all state that the interview referred to here is the interview which I granted on the 23rd of April -- Saturday, the 23rd of April 1994.  It was not the 24th -- rather it was the Saturday, the 23rd of April.  This was after an audience that had been granted General Roméo Dallaire by the prime minister.  Roméo Dallaire is the head of the UNAMIR, and I had attended that meeting.  

So the journalist stopped me and asked me the reason for that meeting and about the prevailing situation in the countries -- country.  And let me read one of those questions as -- as you've suggested.  So I would like to specify that this was on the 23rd of April 1994.  

"Excellency, the minister of information, we are in our studios.  The government has often carried out acts to en -- to restore security and safety in the country.  After the setting up of this government -- or, rather, during which those -- the government has carried out its duty as the spokesperson of the government, I would like to ask you if you have something to request from the people so that all over the country the uprising can calm down and that peace and security can be restored in the country, and that subsequently the war can come to an end -- for everyone to resume the path to democracy that our country has decided to follow.  

"If you have something to ask the people, I'd like to request you to do so because power belongs to the people."  
Q.	When the journalist asked you such a direct question -- 
A.	Yes, I'll read the answer.

"Yes, as you just mentioned, the wish of the Rwandan government is to see an end to these disturbances.  No disagreements should -- should be found between the Hutus, the Tutsis and the Twas.  These people -- when these people do not attack the Hutus, there should be no disagreement between them.  We know they're people who took up arms to fight the Rwandan government, they're people who sent their children to swell the ranks of the Inkotanyi and those people do -- did so knowingly.  

"We are also aware that they're children who fled their families to join the In -- Inkotanyi ranks without any form of role played by the parents to send them there.  So if a child or someone has joined the ranks of the Inkotanyi, the mere fact that such a person is Hutu, Tutsi or Twa and that you consider that person to be an enemy, that is not correct.  

"In any event, Rwanda will be populated by the Hutus, the Tutsis and the Twas.  No ethnic group can decide to exterminate another ethnic group and believe that they can do so."
Q.	Very well, Mr. Niyitegeka.  Let me ask you the question once more.  This mess -- message that is 
broad -- that is broad -- broadcast over Rwandan radio, I mean, does this message -- does this message have -- is it an -- does it contain an encrypted message? 
A.	There is no encryption anywhere.  
Q.	Now, let me refer you to page 18 -- that is, the second page.  
A.	I am -- I have found it. 
Q.	Paragraph 2, beginning with, "Turashaka amahoro mu Rwanda..."
A.	I'd like to say that that is the continuation of my answer to the journalist.  
Q.	Yes, indeed.  
A.	So let me read.  "We are searching for -- in search of peace in Rwanda.  We are searching for complete security, so it is unfortunate that the government does not have enough soldiers to restore security, considering the fact that most of our soldiers are at the war front.  

"If the Inkotanyi could understand that and search for peace in the country and stop the war, we would have enough soldiers for all the préfectures, and they would thus assist us in restoring security.  Unfortunately, that is not what the Inko -- Inkotanyi want.  They carry on fighting.  They carry on fighting.  
We cannot stop the war for the Inkotanyi to take over power to take over the country.  We cannot take soldiers who are fighting to come and restore security; whereas, we know that if the enemy were to take over the country, there would be -- there would be no security.  

"That is the reason why we were saying that the Inkotanyi are a hand in the uprisings that we have in the country, and if such were the case, it means that they have something to gain from this disruption.  That is why we call on the people not to facilitate the task of the enemy; that they should avoid collaboration with the Inkotanyi.  

"If those Inkotanyi have any hand or any interest whatsoever in this disruption, if we are fighting the Inkotanyi and that we are determined to do so, we have to understand that we have to work 
hand in hand, be it Hutus, Twas, Tutsis in the country.  We have to combat that enemy who attacked us all.  That is all I have to say, and that is the message that the government is sending across."
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyitegeka.  So if I understand you well, the government's message is in the direction of all Rwandans, irrespective of ethnic group?  
A.	So even if there's an encrypted message, then it is meant for everyone, including Tutsis.  But to tell you the truth, there's no encrypted message in that message.  
Q.	Very well.
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, if you allow -- and now I am asking Mr. -- drawing the attention of Mr. Webster, if this document has not yet been admitted into evidence, I would pray the Chamber to allow it to be admitted into evidence.  It is it document number 6, Radio Rwanda interview -- interview of 24th April 1994.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness corrects, and says it is the 23rd.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Yes, you did correct it. 
A.	Don't leave it like that.  
Q.	Yes, it's crucial to correct those historical facts.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, we did have a look at this document, and as far as we can tell, it has not been admitted in evidence and we didn't find any translation for it.  I believe in the bundle that Mr. Nimy provided, there's some sort of French summary at the end of the Kinyarwanda.  But since the witness has read all of the contents that seem to be of importance to Mr. Nimy, since the witness has read them into the record, I wonder what is really achieved by putting the transcripts in now.  But beyond that, we have no objection. 
MR. NIMY:
The objective is to demonstrate that this is a government which is responsible and that was set up -- set up after the assassination of President Habyarimana and that is concerned with substantial -- substantive matters of the security of the country, and which instructed the MDR, as a party, to carry on with the installation of the transitional institutions.  And as the guarantor of public order and security is seeking to end the -- to find a solution, a finality to the people who are causing problems, be it the Inkotanyi.  And that is the crux of the matter, Your -- Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Whereas we've taken the point made by Mr. Webster, we've decided to admit the document mostly in terms of context.  

Mr. Issa? 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be D. NZ762.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ762 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, the number is a major argument against admission.  
MR. NIMY:
The number -- I didn't quite understand.  I didn't quite grasp the scope.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, we have decided to admit the document.  All I'm drawing your attention to is that we're admitting a lot of documents into this trial.  That's all.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you for drawing my attention to that, Mr. President.  

May I remind the -- draw attention to the -- the -- the number? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I already gave a number.  It was D. NZ6 -- 762.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  That is what I also noted.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there is a lot of chattering from the Defence bench.  If you could kindly ask people to stop talking, it is interfering with the interpretation.  
MR. NIMY:
Can I carry on, Mr. President?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, I've been asked to draw to the attention of the Defence counsel that the chattering on the bench is getting into the system and interfering with the ability of the translators to -- to do their work properly.  So that should be -- should be cut out.  

You may continue.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, my apologies on behalf of the Defence. 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Niyitegeka, we are going to carry on.  It appear -- appears that it is useful for the Trial Chamber to have a very, very clear understanding of the nature of your government, and this exercise seems crucial to me to that effect.  And so I have come to your interview -- still to Radio Rwanda.  You were addressing Rwandans, and this was on the 28th of April 1994.  Do you recall having granted any interview to Radio Rwanda on the 28th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I did so after a cabinet meeting.  
Q.	And during that meeting, you -- no doubt in your capacity as spokesperson expressed what was said and discussed during the cabinet meeting.  
A.	The cabinet meeting had started its deliberations on the 27th of April, and it carried on on the 28th -- and even until the 29th.  So I granted the interview on the evening of the 27th, and there was another interview that I granted also on the 27th of April to brief the journalist about the outcome of the meetings of the 27th and 28th of April.  I remember that, yes.  
Q.	Very well.  Now, we are going to carry out the exercise of explaining that meeting -- meeting of the 20 -- meeting of the 28th of April, subsequent to which you had a meeting -- a -- granted an interview to Radio Rwanda.  
MR. NIMY:  
Mr. President, it is half past 12.  Would it be a useful thing for us to carry on or maybe we should do so after the break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, you gave an indication of your anticipated extent of your examination-in-chief.  You've already gone way beyond the estimate.  What are we looking at now? 
MR. NIMY:
In truth, Mr. President, I have to tell the Trial Chamber that I indeed on Thursday gave a minimum estimate.  I didn't think that I would be overtaken myself by the density of what we have just dealt with.  I would like to say that indeed my assessment has somehow been surpassed, and that is why unfortunately and regrettably I find myself in a position where I have to carry on, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, how much longer do you anticipate you have to carry on for? 
MR. NIMY:
Well, Mr. President, I still have six quick points to deal with as for the adjudicated facts, and then I will be done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're thinking approximate -- or 30 minutes or so? 
MR. NIMY:
Well, let's put it at 45.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Nimy.  

We take our luncheon adjournment now.  

Thank you.  
(Court adjourned at 1232H)
