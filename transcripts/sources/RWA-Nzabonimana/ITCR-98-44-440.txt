MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  Sorry for that slight delay.  We have problems with our CaseView.  

Yes, Registry.  

Registry, could you come and -- could you come over, please.

We still have a problem with the CaseView, so we regret the delay.  But we have decided to proceed while the technicians come around to rectify the problem.  

Could we have the appearances of the parties, please. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance of the Prosecutor is as before.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearances of the Defence bench are the same.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are resuming the proceedings and we would like to remind you about the oath you made to tell the Trial Chamber the truth.  

Learned Counsel, where should we begin this morning?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
We will proceed with a closed session, and then -- after one or two questions, then we go back to 
open session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Registry, could you arrange for a closed session, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.

(Pages 1 to 2 by Lisa Smith)
































MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session.  Be careful not to give information or names that may identify you.  If you have any difficulty answering any question, don't hesitate to alert the Chamber of any difficulty.

Yes, Counsel 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, do you know a person by the name of *************************?  That name is on the spelling list:  ********************************************.  Did you know of that person? 
A.	Yes, I know that person. 
Q.	Did you come to know that at *******, he challenged Callixte Nzabonimana to shoot him and other Tutsis because he said that he had seen that Callixte had come there armed with a gun?  Did you come to hear of that? 
A.	I did not hear of any such thing, never.  I never heard of an incident where that person defied the minister.  But in his testimony, ************* mentioned **************, but the incident in which this person defied the minister was not raised. 
Q.	Witness, did you come to know from your informers that, indeed, after that meeting 
	Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana drove off to Remera where Kamali and one Vincent followed in a 
	Volkswagen vehicle?  Did you ever come to hear of that? 
A.	I did not hear about that.  If I had heard about them, I would have mentioned them in my statement. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
My learned colleague, as I crave your indulgence to interrupt, but I believe quite sincerely that given the venue, the place we are talking about and the persons we are talking about, the context in which the witness would have heard or not heard about all this -- all of this can be linked very easily to the witness, so I don't see why the Prosecutor asked us to go into open session on this very specific event. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, I do not think that the answer or even the question that I have posed to the witness can, in any stretch of imagination, be said that, be potentially disclose his identity.  I do not see that connection at all and I request the Court to overrule the objection that has been raised by my learned friend. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I would like to say something, but I would like the witness to be taken out first. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, wait, wait.  Registry, arrange for the witness to go out after the curtains have been drawn.

Witness, we have to hear out counsel, so bear with us.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, do you want to have the discussion in open session?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
No, I just wanted to say something, but I didn't want the witness to understand.  When the Prosecution witness, who testified on these events, was here, it was not in open session, we were in closed session on that event.  So we are in exactly the same circumstances as the case -- as was the case with the Prosecution witness.  I am not necessarily asking for equality between our witnesses, but we don't understand why the Prosecution should say that he needs a closed session for that event which is extremely specific and that the closed session should no longer be necessary when we have the rebuttal testimony on the same incident.  That is why I am saying that the Prosecution's position to me is not justified.  And that, of course, it was fair that his witness be heard in closed session, I am not disputing that. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Very briefly -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Final comment.  
MR. NG`ARUA: 
Very briefly My Lord, and final comment.  We are dealing with a very different situation here.  I 
	do not recollect exactly at what point during the Prosecution case when that witness 
	my learned friend mentioned testified when we went into closed session.  But in this case, that is before the Trial Chamber, I don't think that the witness is in any way in danger of disclosure.  I, therefore, say that the two circumstances are quite different.  They are distinguishable.  And the life situation that is here has not been addressed by counsel as to why and how the question and answer to these simple questions can cause any prejudice.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, can we go into a short closed session, please.
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.
