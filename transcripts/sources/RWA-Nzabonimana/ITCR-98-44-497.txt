MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 8th of September, 2010, for the continuation of the Defence case in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you, Mr. President.

You have just heard the order we have made.  I take it that that meets -- is consistent with your position. 
THE WITNESS:
Indeed.  Indeed.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell truth, and the registrar will now assist you in doing that.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. De Beule.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I believe that the Court clerk has put before you an identification sheet.  I would like you to go through that document, and should there be any error to point it out to the Court, then you date and sign the document so it can be entered into the records.  
A.	What is today's date, please?  
Q.	I believe today's the 8th.  
A.	Everything is correct and it's ready.

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
And I believe with the assistance of Mr. Issa, the document should be marked D. NG115.  I stand corrected. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes, you are correct.  Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG115 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. De Beule, we are both French speakers, and to facilitate the interpretation, I would like you to pause at the end of my question so my question can be fully interpreted and I will try to do the same at the end of your answer, again, so that your answer can be fully interpreted.  Speak as slowly as possible to enable the stenographers to follow you.  And whenever you know the spelling of names that you mention, particularly Rwandan names and names from other nationalities, please spell them, otherwise I will have to jot these down and we will spell them later on. 

Do we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Mr. De Beule, at the beginning of my examination, and as we normally do, can you tell the Chamber your educational background, schools you attended, universities, certificates obtained.  
A.	Yes, very well, Counsel.  I did my secondary school education at College Saint Joseph at Aarschot in Belgium.  Then I did building engineering, civil engineering at Aarschot.  Subsequently, I took a post-graduate course in economics at the Catholic University -- Université catholique de Louvain, and I also took courses in problems linked to construction and housing, and that is an area in which I specialised subsequently. 
Q.	Can you give dates to these various stages in your studies and when you obtained the certificates? 
A.	Yes.  I completed secondary education in 1967.  I obtained the engineering degree in 1972, and I continued my education at the Université de Louvain up until 1974. 
Q.	Now, please tell us about your career.  And, at this stage, I would like you to be a little more specific in terms of the positions that you have occupied, the dates and places you went.  
A.	At the end of my studies I took a job at Turnhout with a Belgian contractor and that until I went to Zaire, the then Zaire, and this was in November 1974.  I was employed in Zaire at the Gbadolite pilot development centre located in the equator province in the north-western part of Zaire and that until 1976.  In '76 I went back to Europe.  And in September '76 I started working in Tunisia in a rural development project in the north-eastern part of Tunisia.  I worked for three years there as an engineer, and I was more specifically in charge of the social housing component. 

I remained in Tunisia until 1979.  That was the year I got married, and I joined my wife in Rwanda.  She had been in Rwanda for two years, and I started working as a UN volunteer in a development project in Kabuye.  I was engaged in building activities as an engineer in the building -- in that building project for the FAO.  I did that work for two years, and I terminated my contract in 1981.  Yes, 1981.  

For several months I was a teacher in the Kigali French school, and I started working beginning -- beginning in 1982 I started working in public work department for the Belgian co-operation.  I was engaged in architectural research in relation to civil construction.  That I did until October '89.  That means seven years.  And then I took another -- signed another contract for the French -- Belgian co-operation in Kigali, but this in the teaching field and that from March 1990.  I was a teacher in construction at the official school -- official technical school of Kicukiro.  I remained in that position until April 1994. 

And then -- 
Q.	As part of your contract, the first one you got in Rwanda, did that give you the possibility to travel around the country, or did you remain solely in Kigali? 
A.	Indeed, it afforded me the opportunity to travel across the country -- an agriculture development centre and the livestock in a secondary centre in -- they had a -- sorry.  They had an outpost in Kigali and Kicukiro, and I had to supervise work in the three centres. 
Q.	Subsequently, since you are working in public works and for the Belgian co-operation, did you also have that possibility to move around?  I am just trying to find out whether you were locked up in an office, or if you had opportunity to get out of the office and observe the reality on the field.  And if you can give examples to illustrate your -- to illustrate what you are going to say.  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Well, I am an engineer, a field engineer, and I'm all the time in the field, such that virtually on a daily basis I had to move around as part of my duty.  Very often I had to carry out studies also in the medical field:  Medical buildings, clinics, hospitals, maternity buildings.  And in that -- as part of that activity, I believe I covered the entire country.  

There was also construction of school buildings.  There was a unit that was focused on school buildings and we were called upon virtually permanently to evaluate technical evaluation of buildings on the field. 
Q.	You stated that you taught.  What subject did you teach?  And apart from the French school, which other institutions did you teach in? 
A.	I -- indeed, I taught in the diplomatic French school for a few months or a year, and I was also a replacement teacher in the Belgian school in Kigali.  That's where my wife taught.  

Now, subsequent to that, in 1990, I taught in the Kicukiro technical school in a subject that related directly to my training, that is, everything relating to construction:  Technical drawing, technical calculations; that was the kind of training that I was giving. 
Q.	Are you able to tell the Court if during that period, from what you said about your training and your position -- the positions -- the jobs you had, we would like to know if there were other technical assistants like you to help in Rwanda, and what kind of contact did you have with these various persons?  And during that period, was Rwanda assisted in its development objectives? 
A.	Yes.  During the entire period of my training in Europe, I focused on development, and that is why I accepted, even sought employment positions that relate to development in developing countries.  Sometimes it appears a bit naive, but I believed then, and I still believe today, that if there is solidarity among nations, we can build a better world.  That guided my youth, my younger days, and I think it is something that still guides me today. 

We have always been in work groups where we met national officials, Zaire, in Rwanda, and on each occasion we also had a group of expatriates that assisted in those activities. 
Q.	Are you able to clarify for the Chamber who was paying you when you took that co-operation contract to work starting March 1990? 
A.	My first employer was the United Nations where I was a volunteer, a UN volunteer, in a project for improvement of small livestock, and it was the United Nations that was paying me.  Now, between the United Nations and the Belgian co-operation, I was being paid by the French school and the Belgian school, which was a private institution.  The French school was under the French embassy. 

After that, from 1990 -- and that comes now to your question -- from 1990, I was employed by the Belgian co-operation and that means that I was being paid by the Belgian co-operation, but the status of Belgian assistant is relative, because as assistants we were part -- we were absorbed into the national organisation, which meant that we were answerable to the Rwandan authorities for the implementation of work.  The payment was separate, but we were fully answerable to the national administration and we followed the same rules as the national officials. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  During your stay in Rwanda, did you have other activities there you limited yourself to, the professional activities?  And I would like to know if, beyond your professional activities, you had other areas of interests, and please tell the Court about that.  
A.	As soon as I came there -- as a young boy I used to sing in a choir, so in Kigali I was a member of a choir.  We used to meet from various nationalities to sing for fun.  I was also very active in a cultural activity of people from Netherlands in Kigali.  

Later on -- and possibly linked up to this will for development -- we set up a multidisciplinary group in Kigali to encourage the locally manufactured -- local building materials in Rwanda, and that was one aspect of it.  The other aspect was a production of these materials.  And all these were intended to create in the rural areas non-agricultural activities.  The idea was to limit as much as possible the utilisation of imported materials which cost countries a lot through the production of these materials at the local level. 

In that work group I continued doing that, even when I was a teacher at the ETO.  And in that group, there were people from various nationalities and various backgrounds.  We had Rwandan -- or there were architects.  We worked with Rwandan architectural offices.  We had various co-operations:  French, Belgian, Swiss, German.  And on occasions we had contacts with people from the World Bank.  And there were various NGOs who were also actively involved and very often represented by national officials -- national offices. 
Q.	You pointed out that your wife was in Rwanda.  In which year did she arrive?  And please explain to the Tribunal if she had the same interests as you yourself.  
A.	Yes.  My wife arrived in Rwanda in 1976.  She was a teacher at the -- in the Belgian school.  Prior to that she worked in Burundi and then Zaire.  

Regarding her interests, it was similar to mine since she was a science teacher, and this also involved geography.  She travelled a lot.  So together we travelled across the country, and she will take photographs to support the courses that she was giving.  So together we travelled across the whole country. 
Q.	Did you not, at one point or the other, create a scout group or instruct -- led a scout group? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But who were members of these Scouts?  
A.	Our children who were in the school.  We tried to give them very good training, as much as possible, and this was an initiative that was taken in the Belgian school, together with some adults, to start that scouting group.  That group was made up of people from all -- students who were in the school.  They were involved in the activities during the war.  

This group of Scouts was also led by young persons in the school.  They undertook some activities together with the younger Scouts people, and it was in the course of those activities that I had the opportunity to meet the daughter of Mr. Ngirumpatse, who was one of the young leaders of the youth group. 
Q.	Thank you.  During that period -- I want us to focus on that period from 1979 to 1990.  Did you have any contact with the political authorities?  And how did this contact develop?  Was it positive, negative?  Were there obstacles? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  We had contacts with politicians.  Well, in fact, soon after my arrival in Rwanda, as an ordinary UN volunteer, I used to travel regularly in '79 with the minister of agriculture that I used to see regularly, because he had a project which was dear to him.  It was a project for livestock breeding or poultry breeding at Rubirizi, and he used to come to my desk and we would discuss as equals.  He was a very simple man. 

Also in the public works, we worked together for a long time.  We used to work -- I worked a lot with politicians at the level of the ministry itself, but when it came to the implementation of the project, the practice was that we had to go and see the préfet.  When you have a site somewhere, at least you made a courtesy call on the préfet.  And naturally we had close contacts with the bourgmestres.  So I had the opportunity to meet a lot of bourgmestres, and I was surprised to see how these bourgmestres had extensive autonomy when it came to development activities. 

I observed that these were people who, in terms of development, had interests that were familiar to my own.  And we used to get along very well.  I met -- and that's normal.  This depended on the kind of activities and the kind of site.  There were sites for the social ministry, and on that occasion I met Minister Gatabazi, who was in charge of social activities, who before then was minister of public works.  So through that I was able to meet a lot of political personalities. 
Q.	Please tell the Court if during that period, when you had the opportunity to immerse yourself in the Rwandan community, if you observed that you were meeting Hutus -- only Hutus and that the Tutsis were completely set aside or, as at that time, you had no indicators to be able to make an assessment? 
A.	Well, I must say that the ethnic issue in Rwanda was very dear to us.  And when I say "us", I am referring to my family.  You should understand that my wife worked in Burundi from 1969 to 1972, and as a teacher, she experienced what was referred to subsequently as the genocide of the Hutus in '72.  As a teacher she saw soldiers come to her class with lists coming to look for children -- Hutu children, and initially it was the most intelligent ones that were taken out and they never came back.  We were vigilant.  We monitored.  We were surprised that working in Rwanda, contrary to Burundi, there was a better acceptance of the various groups.  

This went -- this became better over the years, and the cohesion among the ethnic groups improved.  In my contacts I was not able to observe that there was an ethnic segregation in the country. 

On the one hand, we had the politeness or the sensitivity not to ask such questions.  So we generally did not ask such questions and generally did not talk about them.  Once in a while you may have a suspicion.  But until 1990, the ethnic issue was something that was on its way out, was disappearing. 
Q.	Please tell the Court about the colleagues that you worked with, whether there were suspicions, whether there were Tutsis who were your colleagues.  And here we are referring to that period that goes all the way to 1990.  
A.	Certainly.  Certainly.  In the ministry of agriculture, where I worked for the FAO, there were Tutsi colleagues.  There were Tutsi colleagues in the public works department.  I had very close contacts.  In the ministry of public health, where I worked often in construction projects, there were Tutsis.  So we could see that there were Tutsis in that ministry as well, and even at a higher level, in the teaching field.  There were -- the entire spectrum of the society was represented at all levels. 
Q.	Were you informed about the quota policy?  And were you able to observe that the quota policy systematically left out Tutsis in certain positions? 
A.	I think we have to make a distinction in relation to this thing that was referred to as quota.  I think from 1985, '86, there was a little friction within the society.  And from -- in our work group, there was -- I had a group of workers, and we were asked from the ministry of the interior to draw up a list with the ethnic composition and the qualification of our works, that is, our entire staff.  

	That was a bit embarrassing because we as foreigners did not look at them as such, and as foreigners that was not of direct interest to us.  But that was never -- there was no consequence to that, and it was at that stage that we observed that we had more Tutsis than Hutus in our groups. These were teams that worked in the public works department.  But quite often you have more Tutsis beyond the quota, and sometimes we were in the majority. 

Subsequently -- and now we go on to 1990.  I think that will be a different era. 
Q.	Now, to conclude that era, from 1969 to 1990, I would like to know if the contact or the relationship you had with Rwanda was spontaneously warm or whether you needed a period of adaptation?  And please explain how things happened.  
A.	Well, maybe now to come back to your previous question, Counsel, I told you about a list that we had to draw up.  But, to my knowledge, there was no follow-up to that list that was drawn up on an ethnic basis. 
Q.	I understood that.  You did say that you had -- finally you had more Tutsi colleagues than Hutus on the basis of this work that you were asked to do.  I stand corrected.  If I did not understand you clearly -- correctly, please correct me.  
A.	Well, there is a little correction I need to make.  In our work groups there were more Tutsis, but our workforce -- I am talking about our workers -- there, sometimes -- sometimes there were more Tutsis. 
Q.	Well, I understand.  Now, in the question I put to you about your contact, can you tell the Chamber how that happened, let's say up until October 1990.  
A.	I worked in Zaire -- I had worked in Zaire and I had worked in Tunisia, and on each occasion in the rural areas, so there the contact with nationals was very spontaneous.  Even in Tunisia, where I was told initially that it was a closed society, I was accepted into families without any restrictions -- cultural restrictions.  But in Rwanda, which was surprising, in spite of the fact that we lived in a neighbourhood which was almost exclusively Rwandan, that spontaneous contact was not there.  

	And to our regret, my wife and myself, we did not want to go and live in a European neighbourhood.  We lived in a neighbourhood -- a national neighbourhood.  But we never visited each other, but we just said "good morning" to each other and that was limited to that.  Of course, our children were able to go across the -- and play with children on the other side. 
Q.	What enabled that barrier or those barriers to collapse or to fall, if it did fall? 
A.	In 1990, Ugandan units invaded Uganda (sic) and there was a curfew over a number of days.  A number of Europeans and Belgian colleagues were evacuated to their various and respective countries, but we remained in the country with our children.  And strangely enough, from that time on, a series of barriers and obstacles and precautions dropped, simply collapsed.  

Now, Counsel, I think this is the crux of the matter now.  We were offended by the international community's reaction to the events of October 1990, and we made this very clear.  I believe that -- 
Q.	I am sorry.  I am sorry.  You said you were offended and that you expressed that feeling.  How did you do it? 
A.	How can I put this?  We were forced to live in our various homes, and we heard what was being said over various radio stations about the events in Rwanda.  At that time the Rwandan regime was depicted as a bloody, discriminatory regime and qualified -- in that many words, particularly in the Belgian press.  We did not at all agree with that picture of Rwanda because it was quite different from our own experience.  So we wrote a letter of support to the Rwandan people. 

Once the curfew was lifted, we took that letter to the bodyguards of the presidency.  And what we meant to do was to simply show our solidarity with the Rwandan people.  

Subsequently, my wife was able to co-sign a document, which was written by -- or, drafted by international technical assistant workers, which took more or less the same position as we had expressed in our own letter. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  How did the people, in practical terms, come closer to you?  And how did you have this rapproché with them?  Did you have to help and assist any persons during that time, or how did all that unfold? 
A.	Well, I am not going to revisit all of these things, but let me simply say that we usually had extra stocks, reserves, at home, foodstuffs and other products, to ensure that in case of any difficulty we could still survive for some time. 

Now, in October 1990, the curfew was in place, and in our neighbourhood there were gardeners and a number of persons who were stuck in homes which were not their homes and did not have any food.  So people came to our home through the hedges and through the fence to share a meal -- a hot meal with us.  And so these people came from various neighbourhoods, from various places, to share in our home what we had.  It may not have been much that we offered.  But for the duration of the curfew, that is, the four days, we were able to provide that kind of assistance to them. 

Then later on, when I contacted my colleagues or other traders, we became aware that since we had remained and other Europeans had left, people had began to talk much more freely about politics, about social affairs, and about family issues.  And then just like that, a whole range of barriers began to collapse and we were able to interact with a number of families and to understand their thinking about what was happening across the country. 

That experience for us was really a major opening of doors into the lives of these people and -- whereas we realised that we had an affection and a relationship with the Rwandan people, we had such a relationship with the Rwandan people themselves.  Although it might not have been the same elsewhere, we were able to share their sorrows and their joys.  We had a lot more intimate contact with them. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  From 1979 to 1990, during that period, were you aware of the problem of the refugees and their return?  Did you follow that particular issue?  And did the Rwandan government have good relations with its neighbours, namely, Tanzania and Uganda, who were hosting many of these refugees?  

Now, what was the thinking in the Rwandan government at the time?  And what concrete projects were implemented at the time with a view to solving those problems? 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry, I don't know that this witness was a member of the Rwandan government, so I don't see that he is in a position to answer that question.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I am very sorry, Learned Colleague.  I am simply asking him to tell me in his capacity as someone who lived in the country and who was aware and informed of the difficulties that obtained at the time and was aware of the discussions that must have taken place at that time in relation to this issue.  I am not asking him to give me the government's position.  I am simply telling him to tell the Court as a witness of the events what he is aware of in terms of the measures that were taken to deal with the refugee problem.  I think he is a witness to those events, and he is in a position to talk about them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but your question was what was the government's thinking on the subject.  And as far as this witness is concerned, he has not established a foundation which will allow him to discuss government's thinking.  Now, you have rephrased the question somewhat to ask him to detail the measures that he observed that had been taken, which is something he could testify to.  So if you could rephrase the question in a manner that he could respond, it would be -- we could move on. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I will do so.  Maybe my brain is getting stale, but I do not believe that I asked him to tell us what he was thinking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  You asked him to say what was the government's thinking, and I don't think he has established a foundation which would have enabled him to assert that.  But he could certainly discuss the measures that he observed that were taking place. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you have heard.  Now, can you tell us about the measures.  
A.	Yes.  Personally, for me, the refugee problem -- well, we personally were familiar with this refugee problem when I worked with the FAO in the area of agriculture.  At that time we knew that the refugees of 1959 were settled in a number of neighbouring countries and that the issue was quite a problem, agriculture being one of them, in terms of land tenure, and these issues were often discussed at various project levels.  That is why the breeding centre or the fertilisation activities were undertaken in order to deal somehow with this problem of refugees by encouraging fertilisation of the soil in order to increase output. 

Now, when the Ugandan conflict broke out, the problem became more serious.  That was around 1982, when some pastors were driven out of Uganda.  They were driven out of Uganda.  Yes, I hope I said that correctly, that they were driven out of Uganda and they sought refuge in neighbouring areas in Rwanda.  So we settled these pastors in their -- and their cattle in those areas.  And I had a Belgian friend who was a veterinarian whom we visited from time to time.  So we were able to see what land was available for those refugees and noted clearly that the land was not proper for extensive stock breeding.  

So those people who had been driven out were used to extensive stock breeding.  But the entire agricultural programme in place was more geared towards an intensification of stock breeding through a number of mechanisms which would enable the use of fodder and such fertilisers.  And so what happened was that there was a discrepancy between the practice in place and the lifestyle of those who had come into a country that was already overpopulated in terms of land occupancy.  That is how we were able to closely monitor the development of those issues up until the time when the refugees gradually returned to Uganda, not without some problems. 

And, again, the refugee problem arose once more.  And since we were more or less familiar with that problem, whenever any discussions arose on the issue of refugees, we were attentive to them.  And that is how we were able to know about the discussions between various governments. 

When I said attentive, it was something that may have been happening at a distant location, but we were interested in it.  And so we knew that there was discussion around issues of either returning to Rwanda or obtaining nationality in the neighbouring countries, be it Uganda or Tanzania.  And so, Counsel, what I can say is that we actually were attentive to those discussions and we followed the discussions. 
Q.	In July 1990, there was an agreement with the HCR, the OAU, Uganda and Rwanda, for the progressive or gradual return of the refugees.  Is that the case? 
A.	We were aware that some negotiations or discussions had begun at the OCAM village, a hotel which had been built in Kacyiru, close to the ministry of public works where I had worked.  We were aware that those discussions were ongoing, and this was at the time when I was actively involved in the group that sought to find solutions to local construction issues. 

Now, the issue of re-establishing the refugees in the various countries was being discussed, and at that time the idea of accommodation or homes was on the agenda.  We were interested in the re-establishment of refugees because we were ready to put forward our ideas about construction or building homes for the refugees upon their return.  So we felt that for the purposes of re-establishing the refugees, it would be necessary to use prefabricated houses or homes that would have been prefabricated abroad. 

For us that was a horrible idea.  Why would you prefabricate a home abroad, transport it to Rwanda, and then set it up in Rwanda; whereas, the country itself had the capacity to build those homes itself, and in so doing provide employment opportunities for its own manpower?  So we had an interest in that file and we made our own inputs. 

Now, as to what the exact conclusions of the meeting of July were, let me tell you that I do not remember them very, very clearly, but I know that we had talked about them.  All I can remember is that there was an intention to have a delegation of refugees have contact in Rwanda.  And I had colleagues who were working in the area of rural development, particularly in Kibungo préfecture.  They had been contacted to identify areas where it would be possible to resettle the refugees. 
Q.	After that extensive discourse that you have just made, can we say that the Rwandan government would have favourably been inclined to receive the refugees upon return after the war of 1990? 
A.	Well, the President has said that I may not express the opinion of government, but let me simply say that from our own observations, in what we did in Kibungo in the rural development project, what we did with the home building project, and all those initiatives, what one can say is that it would not be possible to say that government did not have the intention to receive or resettle those refugees.  That is on the one hand. 

On the other hand, and in relation to the Rwandan people proper, there seemed to have been some consensus, and the Rwandan people were saying, "These are our brothers."  They have very strong ties and relations with their brothers, and they felt that their brothers were entitled to be settled on the Rwandan territory. 

Now, quite often it is the foreigners who used their statistics to point out that the country was overpopulated and to say that it may be difficult to feed an extra 200,000 or 300,000 persons coming in.  So I think that the obstacles seem to arise more from the foreign observers than from the country itself. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, I should try to clarify something.  

	What I intended to convey from my intervention was that you could not express the opinion of somebody else without explaining how you came to know it, and you had not provided a foundation to explain how you could know what was the thinking of the government.  That's all I was trying to convey. 
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Mr. President.  I am sorry for probably having misspoken.  

Now, what we saw, what we observed was as a result of government's disposition in terms of allowing our agricultural projects to go on and in terms of government's provision of information that made us aware of a building project in which we were directly involved.  So if I did not express myself very clearly, Mr. President, all my apologies attended. 

Now, what we saw was that government took those measures in order to study the possibility of resettling Rwandans in their country -- I am sorry -- rather, to resettle Rwandan refugees -- resettle the refugees in the country. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Is that an acceptable answer, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, certainly.  You can move on now. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, could you explain to the Court what your reaction was on 1 October 1990 when the explanation was provided that the attack by the RPF was because of a refusal to receive or resettle the refugees?  Was that explanation in line with your own experience, or did it dovetail with your own experience at the time? 
A.	The reasons that were provided for invading the country in 1990 were such that we felt that the arguments put forth did not in any manner whatsoever tally with reality.  That was the source of great frustration for us. 

The arguments that were put forth were published and had great media coverage, but the other side of the story was not told in a similar manner.  I do remember that upon the lifting of the curfew, when I went around Kigali and the shops were again open, people talked to me spontaneously, and they told me that, "The refugees in Tanzania, Uganda or Zaire, they are all Rwandans and they should be able to return home.  This is their home.  This is their country.  The only thing is they should not come back with weapons." 

Now, there were other arguments put forth to justify the war, and we believed that those arguments were also erroneous. 
Q.	Which arguments are you referring to, sir? 
A.	The justification for the war included a major focus on ethnic discrimination within the country.  I believe that this so-called ethnic discrimination needs to be clearly understood or looked into. 

The other argument was democracy in the country.  And if I did not know Rwanda as well as I did, one may simply have said, yes, given that there was only a one-party system in place.  But one must also be aware that for several years there was an ongoing process.  

I do remember that in 1987, when there was a sense of blockage in the political process, the president began to broach the issues of political overtures and talked about matters of political collaboration and a revision of the constitution.  So it was not only after the invasion that people began to think or that the state began to think about matters of democracy in Rwanda. 

I even recall that there was a committee in place -- 
Q.	I am sorry, Mr. Witness.  I am sorry.  I think your answer is clear enough to the question and in relation to the various arguments which were put forth and which to your mind were not appropriate.  

Now, let me address that era of political change by putting some specific questions to you.  Now, can you tell me that -- from the time of your arrival, what the regime in place was in Rwanda from the time you arrived in the country till 1990 or thereabouts.  What was the political regime in place in Rwanda at that time?  
A.	I arrived in Rwanda at the end of 1979.  And in January 1980, shortly after I arrived, there was an event, purportedly an aborted coup d'état.  So that brought to the fore of my mind quite quickly the political problems of the country at the time. 

Clearly, the political system in place may not have been entirely referred to as being democratic -- and I would agree with that opinion -- but we must look at the other shades of possible interpretations.  It is true that there was a strong leadership at the head of the country, but at the top of the hill, there was a structure in place that allowed for great measure of openness.  

At the communal level, for example, they had communal elections.  There were elections at cellule level.  And so when we look at the single-party phenomenon only, yes, that first opinion may be valid, but it is also true that there were other interesting activities that took place at the local level. 

You see, various ministries used the same channels to do their extension work either through commune delegates or cellule delegates who were elected persons and were either Tutsi or Hutu.  Any of them could have been elected to that position because they were elected at the local level by the local inhabitants.  And if the inhabitants did not agree with the person who was elected to a certain position, or did not want him or her in that position, they could initiate the process to vote that person in or out of office again. 

So what I believe is that at the grass-roots level, there was some kind of democracy that western democracies can only dream of; a very beautiful experience whereby grass-roots decisions are debated upon over and over again before a group of people can approach a bourgmestre to submit their projects to him. 

Now, if we look at the other side of the issue, we can also see how, in the area of agriculture, for example, the central administration relied on the structures at the cellule level to continue to do its social and agricultural extension work.  In the medical area, there were projects in the area of nutrition and childcare, and the cellule structures worked properly and, to my mind, were basic democratic structures that were well developed in the country. 

Now, on the other thing -- on the other issues, I do agree that there was no political argument.  I agree with those who hold that school of thought.

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Following those comments that you have made, can you now tell the Court how this regime or this system was eroded.  Were there any other discrepancies -- well, was there any measure of favouritism, that is, one region being favoured to the disadvantage of another? 
A.	It is -- it is true that I observed a certain lethargy in terms of national management because of the centralised type of governance or government.  That is true.  I cannot challenge any opinion which holds that part of the visible power -- and I insist on the word "visible" -- part of the visible power was in the hands of people from a specific region or from two specific regions, that is, the north-west of the country.  That was something that could be observed and was visible.  

Now, for us what was also visible was the realisation or achievements that were undertaken at the national level.  Take the case of infrastructure by the ministry of public works.  The country was opened up through a number of infrastructure projects by the ministry of public works which built roads towards the borders of other countries, given that the country was landlocked and, therefore, needed to open up towards ports and also serve as a transit route to Burundi and Zaire.  

So as you may want to know, the first highways or roads that were built in the country were towards neighbouring countries, such as Uganda.  One of -- Byumba -- Rusumu, which opens the way to Tanzania, and Byumba, the way to Uganda.  All of those roads were tarmacked and for a good reason.  Particularly, the road to -- towards Tanzania was opened because of the tensions in Uganda.  Then there was a second road towards Uganda around Kagitumba, and then there is a road to Butare towards Bujumbura for Burundi.  And then there was the road through the Nyungwe Forest towards Cyangugu and later the road to Gisenyi -- Gitarama, Gisenyi and Kibuye.  That is in the public works area.  

Then you come to agriculture, an area in which I was very much interested.  Now, we noticed that the agricultural projects were focusing on areas with endemic food shortages.  And these areas were located within the central area of the country.  I believe that there was some measure of frustration, frustration by the various regions which felt somewhat abandoned.  

But, again, we need to interpret this with caution to the extent that the various projects and the implementation of those projects were undertaken mindful of the needs and problems of those areas.  Now, whether there was any favouritism or not -- it is not for me to -- to say here.  I cannot -- I cannot venture into that area because I will simply be opening a door which is already wide open.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Can you -- can you tell me whether after 1990 -- after the speech which you referred to, can you tell me whether different political parties emerged on the political scene.  
A.	Well, there are others who are better placed to write the history of Rwanda.  But I think that in 1987 the president delivered a speech pointing to some political openness.  And we welcomed the speech because we were aware of some of the needs, and at the same time, there were a number of government reshuffles and -- and there was a -- a desire to open up the political process and to entertain other schools of thought.  

It is at that time that a group was actually set up to -- to examine possible changes, including a revision of the constitution.  So these initiatives were already in place before the invasion from Uganda.  And I think that in July 1991 the new constitution was adopted.  

Now, when I consider my own country, Belgium, the amount of time it takes for a constitution to be amended, then one can appreciate how quickly things were done in Rwanda in a view to amend that constitution.  So these are some of the things that lead me to believe that, with the onset of those discussions and negotiations, there was a more tolerant attitude towards political parties and towards political activities, culminating in the adoption of the new constitution. 
Q.	I am not trying to cross-check your knowledge.  But can you tell us which parties were active on the political scene after that opening up of the political processes.  
A.	Well, I am -- I'm very happy that you are not asking me to provide an exhaustive list of all the political parties since there were so many of them.  But the most significant parties were the MRND, which rebirthed following the constitution.  Then we have the MDR.  Well, please don't ask me to give you the meanings of all those acronyms.  

And the -- the major parties were MDR, PSD, and PL.  Those were the major parties on the political scene at the time.  And a number of other smaller political parties were created later on, including, for example, the socialist party and surprisingly, a religious party -- religious parties, for example, some denominated as Christian parties, while others were known as Islamic parties.  

Now, what one wants to point out -- what one may want to point out is that the constitution provided for various mechanisms, and there were provisions in the constitution to the effect that no political party could bear a name relating to a region, to an ethnicity, or to a religious inclination.  But in -- in spite of that, Islamic parties were recognised; Christian parties surprisingly were -- were also recognised.  And maybe this was as a result of the activities of international human rights organisations which were monitoring very closely all government activities at the time. 
Q.	You referred to the activities of human rights organisations.  What was the impact of those activities during the time of profound political change? 
A.	Well, I think that there are two major impacts.  On the one hand, they contributed to fostering a number of actions -- or promoting a number of actions and changes.  But they also caused some measure of stagnation.  And I'll explain what I mean.  

The country Rwanda had become an observation point, so to speak, of various organisations, both at the national and international levels.  At the national level human rights organisations were created with direct links to a number of political parties.  So these associations tended to defend the interest of specific political parties and played the politics of those particular parties.  

The outcome or the result was that whenever the government made a decision -- and I'm referring to the 1990 government and the transitional governments -- these decisions, whenever they were taken, were scrutinised and analysed in depth by these various groups.  And given that the country was experiencing a crisis, some decisions that could have been taken clearly during those crisis times were not taken because government was stifled by the overwhelming criticisms or analysis from national and international human rights organisations.  So government did not have the elbow room to take crisis-type decisions at those times of crisis because of the activities of these various groups. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, would this be a good time for the break, the morning break?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much more time do you have in your examination?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Pardon?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
About how much time more time do you think you have to -- before you complete your examination?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Maybe one more hour, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We take the morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1027H to 1059H) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. De Beule, we are going to continue.  We left off on your views on activities of human rights organisations at the time.  I don't know if you also mentioned the impact of the way the international press handled this issue on the Rwandan society.  If you have done that, then we can move on.  But I have a feeling we haven't dealt with that yet.  
A.	When we examined this with a bit of detachment, we realised that up to 1990 Rwanda -- in the international press and also among donors, Rwanda was considered as a model country in development.  From 1st October 1990 suddenly in -- things changed in the press.  Overnight there was nothing -- there was no more anything that was positive.  Very harsh words are used.  And this obviously shocked some of the Europeans who were in Rwanda who did not agree at all with this characterisation.  And that obviously also shocked the Rwandan population.  

It is important to note that in the international press it was the Belgian press that was extensively followed on radio, short wave, newspapers, and in that case norm -- naturally and normally the French -- newspapers from the French speaking area of -- newspapers in French language, two of them easily found in Rwanda because they have an international edition.  One was the La Libre Belgique with Marie-France Cros as the African editor and then Le Soir with Madam Braeckman as the African editor.  

Articles published in those newspapers may have been characterised as hatred and considered as an insult to the local population.  And even in Belgium the Belgian government had decided to send soldiers initially to support the friendly country.  In the Belgian parliament a discussion started with some of the politicians and made statements that I prefer not to repeat -- to repeat here.  

Now, these reports were followed closely in Rwanda -- from Rwanda.  Belgian newspapers, which were available in the country, were read and reread.  And the -- we realised -- we probably did not realise that in Europe, but those articles on the country were often copied and circulated.  And since we had very few documents, we went for them.  At -- newspapers and articles are read and commented upon in the entire community, people who would read newspapers in groups, European newspapers as well as articles copied from those newspapers and other newspapers.  

And we realised that suddenly Rwanda had become an international hot topic.  And these newspapers report of ethnic discrimination.  This obviously contributed to rekindle the ethnis -- ethnicists' views.  And this from a country that was considered to be a friendly country, and suddenly the masks come down and they see that they cannot rely on what they considered as favourable.  

This is not the first time that I'm saying this.  But I stand by this, and I stated the same thing in the Belgian courts, that the Belgian press in the -- those early days contributed extensively to foster ethnic hatred in Rwanda and that they share -- they have a share -- an important share of the responsibility. 
Q.	Mr. De Beule, are you, therefore, saying that your daily experience at the time was totally contrary to what the press was saying in terms of ethnicity?  People in Rwanda were surprised about the accusations and, therefore, that generated that frustration and then subsequently anger? 
A.	Well, obviously that created some frustration.  I have told you a while ago that from 1990 we had 
	no (sic) longer access and we discussed easily.  And there as well -- this was a subject which previously was a taboo -- discussion became more open.  And that was also the attitude of the press and some Belgian politicians.  So we discussed and observed a deep sense of frustration.  And this generated some -- some weariness towards the international community.  

Belgium had a very close relationship to Rwanda.  Under military co-operation they had refused to supply weapons to Rwanda, weapons that normally were intended for Rwanda as part of military 
co-operation which had been paid for earlier on.  And in the Rwandan community, there was a feeling that in these difficult times Belgium was conducting itself -- was not conducting itself as a friend.  But in all these things, we need to qualify things.  

Where -- I said there was some weariness towards the Belgium press and some politicians.  They wanted to make believe in Europe that in Rwanda there was an anti-Belgian attitude.  And I think that runs counter to the reality.  

It is too easily assumed that a country like Rwanda could not make distinctions.  For example, my family and myself, during those four years of war, never experienced any animosity towards us.  I say that Rwandan society was much more informed about the prevailing situation in the country than it's commonly thought to be the case.  And it was in a position to make a distinction between some Belgians and Belgians.  

Similarly, it appears to me that this population -- population could make the distinction between the invaders and some groups within the communi -- Rwandan community.  Much too often a vision of Africa which dates from the colonial days is conveyed to Europe, and that is done to the detriment of the entire population. 
Q.	Did you observe that in spite of this erroneous presentation to the outside and this frustration, this sense of frustration that you have described, there was not -- or if there were, you'll tell us -- there was no confusion to the point that there were frontal attacks between the Hutu community and the Tutsi community? 
A.	Well, beginning of the war, October, brought back the ethnic issue to the fore.  Neighbours, who prior to that never bothered to know the ethnicity of their neighbour or somebody who had a shop next to them -- suddenly everyone became suspicious.  I think this attitude of suspicion was the root cause of a spontaneous reaction, spontaneous to the measures -- spontaneous measures which were taken in October, following the attack that came from Rwanda.  They went to look for collaborators and supporters within the country following that attack.  

And then there was -- there was an attack which was not properly thought out, and there were about 4,000 people who were locked up in the Nyamirambo stadium.  This de -- this situation was deplorable.  But it did not target exclusively the Tutsi ethnic group.  They were in search of weapons.  

I know Hutu friends who were arrested.  I even know of friends from the Hindu community who -- Indian community who were arrested because they had hunting rifles.  I'm not explaining, but I know that it was not a measure that was adopted.  It was denounced by human rights associations.  And it was proper that they reacted against that.  

But the media coverage that was given blew up the situation.  It was compared to events in other countries, such -- such as Chile and Pinochet.  They even made reference -- those who know the history of France before the war, the Vélodrome in Paris.  It was confirmed -- it was compared to that.  

So it is just to -- well, those who were imprisoned were freed -- were released.  And to my knowledge, there were no deaths.  But in my sense it was an act that was not properly thought out and, therefore, regrettable -- the fact that the country was not at all prepared for that 1990 attack.  
Q.	Are you done? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I think I've somehow forgotten your question. 
Q.	I understand.  From time to time, look in my direction.  I think -- I know that when you are engaged in such an intense thinking process things are a bit difficult.  

Now, I want us to focus on the issue of insecurity from October 1990.  Please tell the Chamber how this atmosphere of insecurity and fear progressively took over Kigali, particularly those events that highlighted those two feelings of insecurity and fear, particularly the RPF activities.  
A.	There are so many issues that need to be reviewed under this chapter.  Rwanda was not at all prepared for a war.  He had a small army, 4,000 troops, the army, the gendarmerie with old weapons when you compare them to Burundi.  We used to go there from time to time.  Burundi, with a population the size of Rwanda, had an army of 24,000 troops with more elaborated (sic) equipment than Rwanda.  Rwanda was not at all prepared for this war.  

The initial reaction was mobilisation.  Mobilisation, I must say that it was a very difficult process.  I realise that it was very difficult when you see young men claiming to go to the war front.  We were a little older, and we knew the result of those -- of that enthusiasm.  

But Rwanda carried out some recruitment.  But its army was not prepared for the training of the young recruits.  In the first confrontation with the opposing forces, we realised that there were a lot of desertion.  

It was at the same time that multiparty system came to the country, multiparty system which came at a difficult time in the history of the country but found a positive environment to develop.  We realised that some political parties -- some political parties even carried out some civic activities.  And there were other activities where there were young persons who maintained their weapons, did not go back to their native communities.  And that brought about some kind of banditism or crime -- high crime rate in the country never seen before that led to insecurity.  

Now, the activities of some political parties increased.  There were demonstrations.  I no longer recall in which year this was.  But there was a confrontation in Bugesera, a deplorable confrontation where the parties fought vigorously.  

And in all that we observed that the government was not in a position to take the necessary measures.  There were very few repressive activities.  And I think it simply could not because it was so observed on the one hand by all these groups of human rights associations and on the other hand the new political parties so that the -- any action taken by the government is scrutinised and criticised.  

And in a war situation, you have an administrative set-up that was not capable of acting and not at all capable of dealing with the challenge.  We observed on so many occasions that ceasefires that were agreed on with the RPF were breached.  I cannot recall all of them.  But on each occasion it was at a critical stage that the RPF would breach the ceasefire, attack once again, make victims, chase off people from their lands, and that resulted in what was referred to as internally displaced persons who would go and live in camps.  The first wave came from Mutara and Byumba regions, and subsequently more and more persons took -- were chased off.  

During the same period there was a bad harvest, such that there was food -- food shortage, particularly in the central region of the country -- the central part of the country which had more membership in some political parties.  

Secondly, Rwanda was not an aquarium where activities were limited to activities only within the country.  But there were -- there was also activities with institutions such as the World Bank with its infamous structural adjustment programme.  This required the government to devalue its currency.  I believe this must have been in November 1990 when we felt the effects of the first devaluation.  If I recall correctly, there was -- this was by 66 per cent devaluation.  

The population was affected.  Farmers were victims.  And don't forget that in Rwanda the system was extensively one of subsistence, subsistence agriculture.  What is marketed in the country normally is intended for exports.  And things like medicine, clothes, are not produced in Rwanda.  

So this valuation was felt by the population.  As part of those -- that programme, a structural adjustment programme, there was increase in school fees, medical fees, and that led to an unfavourable climate and discontent among the people and -- which worked in favour of opposition parties.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. Issa, please hand the bunch of pictures that I distributed to the witness.  

I believe everybody in this courtroom has a set of those pictures.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	While Mr. Issa is at it, please tell me what was the target of this merciless war that the RPF was conducting.  What was the main target?  
A.	Mr. President, as I said a while earlier, in the RPF attacks from the north, naturally, it fell heavily on the rural population.  So the first targets -- the first target was the rural population, be it in the 1st October attack and then subsequently early January in 1991 in Ruhengeri; then the run over of Byumba, Mutara.  We saw, as I said, populations that fled and knew precisely why they were fleeing the enemy, because the enemy showed extreme carelessness. 
Q.	Don't go so fast.  

Did you observe in February 1994 at the outskirts of Kigali that the refugees had settled there on their own?  Are you able to confirm that?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Indeed and even before then, starting from the Byumba attack, there were camps for displaced persons that were set up among others in the Tumba region.  I had colleagues at the school who were natives of that commune and also colleagues of my wife.  

We collected cooking utensils, clothes and together with a colleague would use my car to go all the way to the Tumba camp to distribute this in trying to alleviate the suffering of these people.  And that was my first contact with the war-displaced persons. 
Q.	The photographs that I have just distributed, were they taken by you yourself, Mr. De Beule, and are you able to explain to the Chamber on what occasion and in what context? 
A.	Yes.  I am the one who took the photographs myself.  We had a multidisciplinary group of work.  And we were working on a video on low cost building with local materials.  It is within that context that I went with a photographer to Rutongo commune to visit a site where there were some Rwandan craftsmen who were engaged in something which was somewhat revolutionary for Rwandans in that they were drying up timber.  And our purpose was to film that exercise for the record. 
Q.	Mr. De Beule, please let us be systematic in our approach.  The photographs before you are numbered from 1, 2, and so on and so forth.  Now, I do not know whether your original pictures were in colour.  We have black-and-white photocopies here because of the resources of the Tribunal and the resources of the Defence, which have not made it possible for the pictures to be printed out in colour.  But for now, if you were to look at the photograph, what does the white patch against the black background reflect or represent? 
A.	If you take photograph number 1, this is Rutongo commune at Nyacyonga.  At the bottom of the valley, we can see the road from Kigali to Bujumbura -- rather, Kigali to Byumba.  On the slope of the valley, you can see a refugee camp on various flanks of the hill, but this is the smallest group of refugees.  The bigger -- or the biggest group is located at the point from which I took those photographs.  So those spots are shelter areas which were somehow referred to as armoured shelters in which people sought refuge during the attacks. 

Now, if we move on quickly to the --
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	 -- second photograph, we can then see clearly the armoured shelters on the slopes of the hills.  But at the bottom of the valley, we can see the Kigali buildings.  The Nyacyonga camp had some 120,000 displaced persons.  So this was only one of several camps around the country for a total of about 1,200,000 displaced persons.  And the Nyacyonga camp was the biggest camp and the closest to Kigali.  
Q.	Now, if you look at photograph number 3 and 4, you see these makeshift accommodations.  Can you describe the area roofed in the white plastic paper.  What type of material is used for that building?  And if you went to photograph number 6, this would help.  
A.	Yes.  On photograph number 6 you can see that the luckiest of the displaced persons were lucky enough to collect some tarpaulins from the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  Now, all the other refugees had to struggle on their own to find timber and any other material that they could use.  So for that reason they would go into the woods and fetch timber, as you can see on photograph number 7.  So people went around and picked up whatever material they could find to use for their buildings.  

And you can see the same on photograph number 8 as well.  If we go to picture number 8 -- these were all photographs taken at the same time and from the same location.  Now, the hills which I referred to were initially forest areas, and as you can see, at some point all the forests were cut -- the trees were felled in order to make room for the building and also to serve as firewood.  

But -- but there is a small point which is yet significant, namely, that it is at that time while I was at the camp that I learnt that one of the survivor mechanisms that the Red Cross offers to the refugees was a blanket and a tarpaulin and a pot -- an aluminum pot, and a machete.  These are all ER -- items provided by the HCR in order to facilitate life for the refugees.  

Now, the point I'm trying to make is in relation to this machete.  And I -- I -- I tried to find out from the Red Cross.  I knew the doctor who was in charge of the Red Cross in Rwanda.  I asked to find out about the machetes.  And as you all know, the Red Cross does not agree to testify about these matters.  

And so all I can give -- mention to the Court is on the strength of my -- my own personal testimony.  If you look at the hills and you see how the trees have all been felled, you can also notice that these pictures were taken in 1994 and to show that the camp at that time was still relatively well organised.  

Furthermore, after the coup d'état or the death of President Ndadaye in Burundi, some 300,000 persons settled in Bugesera.  So 300,000 Burundians would settle in such makeshift camps in the -- Bugesera.  This is information that was provided to me by a friend, a medical doctor in Kigali-rural, who was in charge of the health situation in the various camps in November 1993. 
(Pages 16 to 25 by Tanya West)


























1140H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
So there were cases of dysentery in the refugee camp for Burundians, and he told me that some 1,000 people were dying per week, and so there was fear that the epidemic may -- may spread to other camps and certain measures were taken to curb such an eventuality.  Now, if you look at the conditions under which people lived, piled up one upon the other as the case was, then it was also in order to -- to fear for the worst.  

Now, as far as I am concerned, what was the worst possible thing in all this story?  Well, a million -- or, more than a million people were deprived of their land, and that led not only to a significant drop of agricultural production within the country, but also deprived those persons of their pride, the pride of owning a piece of land which would enable them to earn their livelihood.  

So, all these people whom you see there were dispossessed of everything, including hope, the hope to continue to live.  So one can understand that later on -- 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I would, at this juncture, wish to produce these photographs into evidence, of the Nyacyonga refugee camp.  I would like to produce all the photographs from number 1 to number 8, and these should be marked D. NG116, except we proceed otherwise.  

But, Mr. President, Mr. De Beule has spoken to these various pictures collectively, and therefore I would rather produce them as one single bundle bearing one number for all eight photographs.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree.  They are admitted in evidence.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG116 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. De Beule, on the 6th of April 1994 where were you?  
A.	On 6th April 1994 I was on an excursion with the working group on building materials, as we were trying to develop the first buildings for Rwanda.  And we were visiting various exhibitions and businesses involved in producing these materials.  And one of the sites was in Bugarama in the south of the country.  So it was Easter holiday, and I took advantage of that to travel with my family and my children, and we felt that this would give us the time to spend a few days in Kibuye.  So on the 6th of April 1994 we were in Kibuye.  

We had an appointment with some friends, including the consul of France -- of Spain, rather, who, like myself, was a member of the group monitoring Scouts in school, but who arrived somewhat late because of the swearing in of the government, which was supposed to have taken place on the 7th or the 8th, and which he (sic) was supposed to attend.  

So, on the 6th of April, I was with my family in Kibuye.  
Q.	The consul who was a member of your group, did he also attend other meetings -- other important meetings at the time, particularly those meetings relating to the implementation of the Arusha Accords?  And did you discuss any such matters with him?  
A.	Yes, indeed, the consul was one the members of the constituted corps, and he would be invited generally to all such important government meetings.  And she belonged to any of these organised bodies.  And in early 1994 we talked about these issues, we talked about the hope that all harboured about the setting up of the government, and which was delayed for several reasons over and over.  Yes, indeed, we discussed these matters.  
Q.	Which party was responsible for blocking the implementation of the Arusha Accords?  
A.	Several things happened.  There were splits within opposition parties, some factions being pro-RPF while others defended the national interests and therefore were in favour of the option for national integrity.  

Now, the obstacles arose in respect to the participation of some members of parliament, and the RPF was -- in fact, there was a need for the parties to designate their candidates.  And this would have happened before the splits occurred.  And if you take the CDR, for example, in April, or end of March 1994, the impression was given that all the problems had been solved, but there was still a problem in the political parties, and the swearing in didn't take place.  All of that compounded by the fact that the president's plane was shot down.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I know that you are now fully versed and talking about history which you are familiar with.  Now, can you just provide the Court with the names of the parties which had two factions?  Could you please -- if you do recall, could you please provide that information, as well as the name of the Spanish consul.  
A.	Yes, I can.  Let me start by answering the most -- the more difficult question, that is, the name of the Spanish consul.  The lady's name -- or, the lady was the wife of Herman, Machala (phonetic), a name of Basque origins which I am not able to pronounce.  But she was Mr. Herman's wife.  
Q.	Well, you have not spelled out the names since this morning, but would you now kindly spell out Herman Machala, please? 
A.	Counsel, I thought that I was not going to be tortured to that extent.  Ordinarily she was referred to as Madeleine.  That was probably the French translation of her Basque name.  Is that enough?  Is that a good enough answer, Counsel?  
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  Can you spell Herman, then?  
A.	H-E-R-M-A-N.  
Q.	Now, what about the parties.  
A.	The parties who were experiencing such splits were the MDR, in which there were some significant problems, they were experiencing some major problems.  The prime minister-designate, Twagiramungu -- and at the Kabasongo (sic) congress -- the Kabasongo congress evicted one of -- the president, and so there were two factions within that party and had different positions in relation to the national assembly.  

Now, something similar happened with Mr. Landouald's faction, on the one hand, and Mr. Mugenzi's faction, I believe, with the RPF, which was opposed to the participation of Mr. Mugenzi.  

Now, if you look at the PSD, there were also divergent opinions, to the extent that the chairman of the party, Mr. Gatabazi, was assassinated in Kigali.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. De Beule.  

On the 6th of April you were in Kigali -- in Kibuye, rather.  At what time did you find out that the presidential plane had been brought down?  
A.	We received the information in the morning of the 7th of April, from persons who had listened to the radio and who had come to wake us up to inform us that the presidential plane had been brought down, the president was dead, the president of Burundi was dead, the chief of general staff was dead.  And that is the information we received that morning.  
Q.	What was the reaction of your group? 
A.	As you rightly put it, we were at this guesthouse in Kibuye, a number of us, several Belgians.  And so we wanted to understand what was going on.  One of us, a major of the Belgian army working with the Belgian military co-operation services -- he was not a blue beret, his name was Major Van Hess -- he had a Motorola. 
Q.	Would you please spell Van Hess?  
A.	Van Hess is easy to spell:  V-A-N, H-E-S-S. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	So I was saying that Major Van Hess tried to contact his base in Kigali.  But because of the mountainous nature of the area and the distance between Kibuye and Kigali, he was not able to contact those -- his people in Bigogwe, where the paracommando training centre was located as well.  

So he, however, was in the lobby of the hotel, and my -- my wife was present when he was finally able to make contact from Bigogwe, where he found out that the day before -- or, rather, the day before, in the night of the 6th to the 7th, the -- a military vehicle, a Belgian military vehicle was involved in some incident at which a Belgian soldier was killed and a UNAMIR soldier was also hurt.  According to the information from Bigogwe there was an ambush between Kanombe airport and Remera hill, at which time those persons were killed or injured, as I have just mentioned.  
Q.	What was your reaction to that information?  Or, what was the reaction of the group to that information?  What was Major Van Hess's reaction?  
A.	At that time we sought to have more formal contacts with the embassy.  The chancellor of the Belgian embassy was also with us on leave, and she tried to contact the Belgian embassy.  The Telex officer of the Belgian embassy, who was with us, also attempted to reach the embassy.  We were advised to remain on the spot and not to travel to Kigali.  We complied.  

We were somewhat concerned and worried because we were aware of what had happened after the political killings of Mr. Gatabazi and Mr. Bucyana -- Bucyana, who was the chairman of the CDR party:  We knew that there had been some riots following those incidents, and so we were aware that the members of the population were going to react somehow.  And that is why we decided to remain on the spot until things became clearer.  
Q.	Did all of you, that is, your entire group, remain in Kibuye, or did you split up, or what happened on that 7th of April?  
A.	Well, on the 7th of April, things were not very clear.  We had not received any instructions.  So the group stayed together.  Very, very quickly, it happened that a foreigner -- or, foreigners were asked to leave Kigali and to travel along lake -- along the lake to Bujumbura.  Those of us who left Kigali had wanted to return to Kigali because we didn't have anything on us.  We had left all our property in Kigali.  We thought that when things would calm down -- calm down, we will then return to Kigali.  
Q.	At what time, then, did you leave that place, and with which member of the group, and where did you go?  
A.	In the evening of the Friday, which was the 8th -- the evening of the 8th, the camp commander came to reassure us somehow at the hotel.  And at the same time there was the manager who told us that he's been instructed to close down -- to close the guesthouse.  So we decided to move in convoy to Kigali on Saturday morning, and that is what we did on the 9th, we set off for Kigali and we took -- we took off together.  

We were six or seven families involved.  There was a Belgian working for Coopération suisse who joined us.  And we took off Saturday morning for Kigali.  
Q.	Were you able to reach Kigali, or did you have to turn round and go elsewhere?  
A.	Together we continued on our way.  We stopped at Saint Paul.  We knew a woman who managed the place.  But the Belgian woman did not want to leave; she remained there.  We then continued along our way, and when we got to the top of the hill, the soldier took contact with -- contacted -- made a contact and we were asked to go on.  But when we got to Gitarama, the embassy told us not to -- to remain in Gitarama and not to continue to Kigali.  But they intended to send us a military escort to take us to Kigali.  
It was then at the outskirts of Gitarama that, for the first time, we came across a military roadblock.  But everything happened -- everything was smooth, we were allowed to pass through.  And Saturday the 9th, the evening, we went to Saint Paul in Kabgayi.  
Q.	At the military roadblock you presented your Belgian documents and there was no problem?  
A.	At the military roadblock we did -- they did not ask us any question.  They were very proper with us.  They let us through.  We did not have to show any documents and we just continued along our way.  We stopped probably for one minute, not more than that.  But they were very proper with us. 
Q.	Finally did you manage to arrive in Kigali?  And if not, where did you go, and on which date?  
A.	We went to Kabgayi, Saint Paul -- Saint Paul's centre, which was a lodge run by Canadian sisters.  We got there on Saturday the 9th.  And the international community that was there, there was a Belgian medical doctor, there was a -- there was a hospital there, and a Belgian co-operation had asked him to leave the place.  The sisters were also requested to quit the place.  And on Saturday -- on that Saturday, all Europeans had left on their way to Bujumbura.  Our intention was not to go to Bujumbura, but to go back to our houses in Kigali.  So we remained there.  

The Canadian sisters gave us the keys of the centre, and I went with Dr. Nyst, who was a member of our group.  We went to get provisions in the neighbourhood.  We visited Murambi where I had friends who lived -- I had friends who lived there, but they had left.  But there was a market that was open and we bought foodstuffs, vegetables, fruits.  But there were small military roadblocks, but none of them created a problem.  I remember one of them where the soldiers were heavily armed, but there was no problem.  We greeted them and there was no problem at all.  

So we remained in Kabgayi until Tuesday -- Tuesday, 12th of April.  And we learnt from the embassy that we should not expect military escort.  And we decided -- the group decided to move on to Bujumbura.  So, together, we inspected all the vehicles to make sure that there was no problem along the road, and we moved in an escort towards -- we moved in -- we moved together in a convoy to Gitarama -- to Bujumbura.  We met policemen along the way, and they knew us because we had gone there to buy provisions, so they let us through.  

There was a big roadblock at the outskirts of Butare.  There we spent a bit of time, but they were very proper with us.  Those who had documents presented their documents, and those who did not have documents had no problem.  So we managed to continue and got to the border with Burundi on Tuesday, 12th, the afternoon of that day.  
Q.	During that trip, did you have accurate information on the situation in Kigali, on the resumption of the war, the reason for which you were not allowed to go back to Kigali?  
A.	Well, naturally we didn't get much information.  We tried to get -- or, to glean a little more information.  We listened to the radio, but we didn't get much to enable us to determine what was happening.  We understood that the situation was serious.  At the time that the wife (sic) of the Spanish consul told us that he was leaving the country, the husband did not leave, he stayed with the priest in the Runda commune, and that is when we got to know that the situation was serious.  He was somebody who was very well known in Rwanda, and he urged us also to leave.  
Q.	Were you able, during that period, to follow decisions that were taken to form an interim government?  You left Gitarama on the 12th of April.  Did you see the arrival of the government?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  On the 10th I went again to Murambi, because I had a German friend there, but he had left.  On the 11th we heard that a government had been formed and that they were on their way to Murambi, that they were going to establish in Murambi.  On the 12th, when we were getting ready to leave, there was the wife of one of the interim ministers who was taken ill, and they were looking for a hospital and came to the Saint Paul centre where we were.  So we spoke to her -- we spoke to her, my wife had some medicine for the baby.  And we heard that in Kigali there was a rumour going around that it is the Belgians who shot down the president's plane.  
Q.	You went to Bujumbura.  When did you leave Bujumbura for Belgium?  
A.	We stayed a day with friends in Bujumbura.  That was the -- that was the 12th.  Tuesday the 12th we remained in Bujumbura.  We left on Wednesday 13th, and got to Brussels Thursday, 14th of April.  
Q.	Witness, now, I'm going to ask you a question about the accused person that I am defending.  I would like to know if you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	I know Mr. Ngirumpatse by name.  I don't think we ever met, and I think this -- today is the first time.  I never met him; I knew him by name.  I told you that in our Scouting group there was a daughter of Mr. Ngirumpatse who was a member of the Girl Guides, who was a leader of the children.  That's why his name is familiar to me, and -- but I never met him personally.  
Q.	Did your wife have among her pupils one or several children of Ngirumpatse?  
A.	Yes, the girl that I was referring to as being a member of the Girl Guides was in my wife's school.  Subsequently I got to know that another daughter of Mr. Ngirumpatse, Francine, married one of my former students of Kicukiro.  And they have a beautiful baby called Stella.  
Q.	Thank you for this spot of bright news in this rather gloomy affair.  

So you have a group of Scouts coming from all over.  Did your wife observe any discriminatory tendencies of Delphine -- or, let me put it this way:  If Ngirumpatse's children in -- around you had any discriminating tendencies?  
A.	Certainly not.  This was not the case.  It was clear in our group we had children from everywhere.  They played together, be it at the ethnic -- ethnic, racial, or religious levels, they were all welcome, and there was no -- we did not make any observation -- any negative observation in that respect.  None.  
Q.	You probably do not know him personally because you never met him, but since you were living in Kigali -- in Rwanda, Kigali, did you know what his function was within the MRND?  
A.	The fact that one of Mr. Ngirumpatse's daughters was in my wife's class, we knew that Mr. Ngirumpatse was minister of justice.  And within the MRND, we knew that he was elected at a very difficult time and had the courage to accept to be chairman of that party.  Yes, we were aware of that.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection about that period -- let me rephrase the question.  To the best of your recollection, would you say that the MRND, during the multiparty dispensation, had ethnic discrimination -- tendencies of ethnic discriminations against the Tutsi?  
A.	Well, Counsel, first of all, let me refer to an event which occurred a few years earlier.  As I've already explained, my wife had worked in Burundi and had very close contacts in Burundi.  

In 1998 (sic), in the region where my wife worked, there were -- the army moved into the Bujumbura region and there were at least 4,000 people who died, most of them Hutus.  We, at the time, feared that there will be -- there will be reactions from Rwanda.  But we were surprised about the wisdom with which the government dealt with this issue.  To my knowledge there were no aggressive reactions, there were no accusations against the Burundian government, there were no accusations against the people of Burundi.  

We were also surprised by the Belgium -- Belgium -- Belgian reaction.  At the time minister -- at the time the then-minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Eyskens, minimised this incident by saying that it was just minor, that the army just committed some excesses.  But we were surprised.  We were surprised, and we also found out that on the Rwandan side their reaction was very wise and deliberate.  And we understood that in Rwanda they did not want to bring back the ethnic problems.  And that was completely in contradiction with the activities that carried -- that were carried out in Bujumbura.  In Bujumbura, in -- this was in contradiction to what happened earlier when Bujumbura had criticised Rwanda.  

Now, regarding the politicians, that there was a call to rise against the Tutsi, I said earlier on that in Rwanda people were able to make a distinction between an invader -- invader who were Tutsis in majority, and the Tutsis.  There's a difference, and I wanted to point out that that difference was clear.  It was not easy, and naturally the population had more difficulty making that distinction.  But the authorities, I understood that the authorities did everything possible to bridge the gap.  
Q.	Mr. De Beule, did you have the opportunity to go back to Kigali following this forced departure?  
A.	Yes, I went back to Rwanda early September 1994, and I remained in -- I stayed in Rwanda for about a month.  I had the opportunity to go across the country from west to the east.  Yes, I went back.  
Q.	What did you observe?  Were you able to get back your house?  
A.	My house was the least of my worries.  More -- but I particularly wanted to contact my friends, my colleagues, and not the -- regarding the belongings that we had left, I went back to the house which was then occupied by a young lawyer who was a member of an association -- a human rights association and had gathered in his house members of his extended family, about 14 of them.  He recognised me immediately because my photo -- my picture was in that house.  So he recognised me immediately.  There was no friction.  I understand the situation under which they were living.  So he allowed me to take with me my belongings which could still be taken away.  And there was no animosity at all.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. De Beule.  I've come to the end of my examination-in-chief.  And thank you for answering my questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
No, and thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. De Beule, you have to be ready now to be cross-examined, as the Prosecutor will have an opportunity to put some questions to you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Good afternoon to the Court.  Good afternoon, everybody.  

I just realised that I'm not completely robed.  That is my mistake.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sendze, in this courtroom we do see you.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Mr. President, I think it's almost lunchtime, and I would make an application that we have an early lunch, five minutes early, so that when we come back I will finish with the witness.  I don't plan to be long.  So if the Court pleases, we can take an early lunch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sendze, you made a comment which we may like to -- to elevate.  You would be able to complete this afternoon?  
MR. SENDZE: 
Definitely.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We can take the luncheon adjournment now.  

Sorry, Mr. Witness, I omitted so say something with which I'm sure you must be familiar.  That during this or any adjournment while you are a witness, you should not discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  
(Court recessed at 1223H) 
(Pages 26 to 33 by Kirstin McLean)

(Court resumed at 1402H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody. 
MR. SENDZE:
Good afternoon to the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sendze, I can see you're better now that you're fully outfitted. 
MR. SENDZE:
Yes.  I took steps to make sure that I didn't appear like I did before. 

May it please the Court to know that I have no questions for this witness in cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Sendze. 
MR. SENDZE:  
We are just going to wonder whether the Prosecution will be credited for the -- for the time not used.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Now, is that why Mr. Webster was laughing, because he wants to add your time to his time for cross-examination?  

Mr. Webster, if you're going to use that type of mathematical calculation, we then start adding up what you owe and deduct it.

Mr. Witness, that concludes your testimony for the Tribunal.  And we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting us with our work.  But you're now excused. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, it is a good thing for my colleague to be well dressed up and to tell you he has no further questions.  This is very professional.  I appreciate that a great deal.  

Furthermore, as usual I would like to request authorisation for Mr. De Beule to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse after the proceedings, since he has come to the end of his testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The request is granted and the registrar will make appropriate arrangements.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, can I ask for another favour?  I would like to visit the prison where the detainees are held.  Would you kindly authorise me to go right up to the prison. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The -- the prison is another management -- 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
I believe I -- I think that what the president is going to tell you is that it's for the registrar to decide to give people access to the prison.  And that the WVSS, the witness and victims' service section will -- will assist you in making a request.  

Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you very much, indeed. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, this witness is also -- the oncoming witness has also signed a waiver.  Is this a witness who has signed a waiver of his protection rights?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President, that is the case. 

And to complete my answer, Mr. President -- 
(Witness entered courtroom)
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 

We have received an affidavit, according to which you wish to waive the protection that has been ordered in your favour. 

That's correct; isn't it?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct, Your Honour. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
We've been informed that you have previously testified in another trial as a protected witness and that the protective order is still in force in that case.  We can't see from the affidavit that has been submitted to us whether your waiver covers only this trial or whether you also consent to the protection attached to your testimony in the previous trial is covered by your waiver. 

Will you please indicate your position. 
THE WITNESS:
I testified -- 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Don't tell us which case you testified in.  Just indicate you have testified in one trial as a protected witness and in other trials without any protection.  What -- what I want you to address is the trial where you were a protected witness.  The waiver you had given us now, does that cover only the trial -- this trial, the trial against Ngirumpatse and Karemera, or does it also cover your testimony in the trial where you were protected?  
THE WITNESS:
For the Ngirumpatse trial I would like to testify unprotected. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Yes.  I understand that.  But does that mean that you still want your testimony and -- and the information that might reveal your identity in the previous trial to be under seal?  
THE WITNESS:
Under the present circumstances I admit -- or, rather, I would say that the protective measures be lifted. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Also with respect to the previous trial where you testified as a protected witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is what I meant. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Very well.  We take it that you apply for the rescission of your protective order.  However, it's not for this Chamber to decide.  According to our Rules of Procedure and Evidence, it's for the first Chamber who ordered the protective measures for you to decide to lift those protective measures.  And since that Chamber is still -- since that Chamber is still seized with the first case, we will process this request and send it to that Chamber, and hopefully we will get a response before you conclude your testimony in this case.  But until we have a decision from the other Chamber, you will have the status as a protected witness also in this trial. 

Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Your Honour. 
JUDGE JOENSEN:
Very well.  Thank you. 

Mr. Witness, before you start your testimony, you will have to give -- take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will administer that -- the oath.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness. 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	A few recommendations, preliminary recommendations.  Both you and I speak French, it would therefore be necessary for you to pause awhile before answering my questions so that translation into English could be completed.  There is always some lapse of time necessary.  

You would also have to speak slowly so that the courtroom reporters should be able to take notes or record your evidence. 

I hope we understand one another.  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I understand you. 
Q.	Very well.  I think the registry staff has just given you a document, identified personal information sheet.  Can you please verify whether the information on that sheet is correct, whether there are changes that are necessary, and if they are necessary you make the changes.  Then you date and sign the document, please. 
A.	All the information on the sheet is correct. 
Q.	Have you dated and signed the document? 
A.	Yes, I've done so. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, can please collect the document.  It is numbered D. NJ117 (sic). 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
D. NG, not J.  D. NG117. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG117 admitted)
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, still as a preliminary remark, can you please tell the Court your educational background, and if possible the military training you received. 
A.	I graduated from the École supérieure militaire, ESM, in Kigali.  And I am a graduate of staff college -- of the defence war college of Belgium, generally referred to as École de guerre, the war college in Belgium. 
Q.	Very well.  That is, however, too brief.  Can you be -- give more details.  What I mean by educational background, I would like to know whether -- when you did your humanities, in what year, where.  And then you can talk about your military training, in what year.  You told us where you did your military training, but please would like to have a little bit more information.  
A.	I went to secondary school from 1968 to 1975.  And I completed what is called
	humanités pédagogiques at the Byumba teachers' training college.  

Then I went to the military academy in Kigali, ESM.  I graduated from that school as a second lieutenant in 1978. 

Thereafter, I served in several military units while continuing to undergo military training, particularly in Belgium. 

That is how it happened that in 1992 -- or, rather, 1982 I was awarded a certificate of transmissions -- or of signals officer of the signals at the electronic centre of Belgium. 

After that I underwent training.  I -- in --in the infantry unit in Arlon, Belgium. 

In 1985 I started -- or, rather, I joined the -- I joined the war school.  I went to war school and I graduated from that school in 1988 as I was awarded a certificate of breveté d'état-major.  Thereafter, I've returned to Rwanda.  These are the details of my training. 
Q.	Continuing along those lines, can you tell the Court the various positions you occupied and the various times you occupied those positions, please. 
A.	When I graduated from ESM as a young second lieutenant, I was posted as an instructor to the Bugesera training school.  There, right up to 1980, I carried out my duties.  In 1980 I was posted to the ESM, the military academy, as an instructor and a teacher. 

In 1982, I was posted to the paracommando battalion in Kanombe, first as a company commander and then as an officer in charge of operations and training.  It is in that capacity that I went to war school in Belgium.  

On my return, in 1988, I was appointed commander of the military police of the Kami camp in Kigali.  I carried out my duties in that position right up to December 1992. 

From 1992 to 1993, I was the officer in charge of operations at the operational sector of Byumba right up to the month of August 1993. 

In 1993, that is in the month of August I was appointed commander of the first battalion of Muvumba which was then based in the operational sector of Ruhengeri. 

And it is there that I was overtaken by the resumption of hostilities on the 6th of April 1994.  I continued being in charge of that battalion right up to July 1994. 

In a nutshell, that is my career profile. 
Q.	Did the said battalion remain in Ruhengeri from the 6th of April right up to the end of the war -- or, rather, right up to the moment when you left Rwanda? 
A.	After the 6th of April, I remained in Ruhengeri under the orders -- or, rather, for a few days and on the 10th of April, to be more precise, I was ordered to move to Kigali in order to go and reinforce that operational sector -- the operational sector in Kigali town.  So therefore I did not remain in Ruhengeri during the period of the hostilities. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Were you in Rwanda on the 1st of October 1990? 
A.	Yes.  I was indeed in Rwanda on the 1st of October 1990. 
Q.	Can you explain to this Court what happened and what your role was -- your role at that time. 
A.	On 1st October 1990 -- or, rather, this date will remain or be remembered by all Rwandans as a day when the country was attacked by armed people who came from neighbouring Uganda.  

I was a soldier, and in addition to that a unit commander.  I therefore played my role in accordance with the directives and orders from my superiors.  If you want more details I could give them. 
Q.	Yes, I'm interested in the details.  Did you go to the war front?  What exactly did you do?  
A.	When the war broke out, all units were ordered to be in a state of alert and to wait for orders where there were no orders yet given.  It should be said that my unit was a special unit, in other words, it was a military police unit.  It is a unit in the army, but which carries out police duties vis-à-vis other soldiers so that in particular ensure -- it can ensure discipline -- discipline amongst the various units and vis-à-vis individual soldiers.  

In the event of war the military police can be asked to fight, but it keeps -- or continues carrying out its police duties, and this is what happened.  My unit was split into two.  There were some troops that had to go and support the other troops fighting the enemy in Mutara and other troops remained in Kigali and were at the disposal of the high command and to ensure law and order.  

It was therefore around the 2nd that I set up a detachment that had to go to Mutara in order to reinforce the units that were there engaged in war. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court the reasons the attackers put forward. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
On the 1st of October, Rwanda was invaded from Kagitumba in the far north of Rwanda.  Rwanda was invaded by the regular troops of the Ugandan army.  Their chief, in particular the commander -- commanders at all levels were officers of the Ugandan army. 

But the media, when reporting on that attack, was talking about claims -- claims made by the assailants which the assailants put forward.  In particular it could be heard that the attackers came to install or introduce democracy in Rwanda.  Their spokesperson said that they were going to put in place a state under the rule of law that they were going to bring an end to the dictatorial regime.  And, in particular, that they were returning by force because they had, for a long time, been kept outside of the country as refugees without having the possibility of returning to their country of origin, or their country of their ancestors.  That was the pretext, or that reason they put forward for the attack.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Can you tell the Court whether those claims that were made in respect of launching the war were founded, and also tell the Court what efforts the Rwandan government made at that time, the efforts of the Rwandan government to facilitate the return of the refugees. 
A.	To my mind, the claims of the attackers, that is, part of the Ugandan army that was attacking Rwanda, were baseless, particularly in respect of democracy.  It is true that there was a one-party system in place in Rwanda at the time.  But that was not unique if one were to look at all African countries, because most of them had a similar type of regime in place. 

Furthermore, the president of the republic had just expressed a desire to open up the political arena and consultations were ongoing to determine the manner in which to open up the political game. 

As for the refugees, the claim seems to be even more baseless because when they took up arms and were recruited into the army of another country, in that breath they lost their status as refugees. 

Even others who were Rwandans claimed to be refugees desiring to return to their country.  But we must -- we must recall that there was very high level consultation between the governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and the HCR, as well as the OAU, Organisation for African Unity, with a view to determining the modalities for the unconditional return of all refugees.  

I therefore believe that these matters no longer were valid as at the 1st of October 1990 when the attack was launched. 
Q.	What was the reaction within the army to that situation?  And if you are aware, what was the reaction of the population at large? 
A.	The reaction was one of total surprise.  On the side of the soldiers, we were not prepared for war -- for a modern or classical war, because our army was focusing on maintaining order and involvement in community or communal work and so was not prepared for engaging in classical and modern warfare -- or, rather, conventional warfare. 

Furthermore, the motto was peace, unity and development and good neighbourliness at the international level. 

Rwanda intended to have good relations with all countries of the world, and particularly neighbouring countries.  This was the clear position of the government.  And to wake up one morning and to find that the country was under attack without any ultimatum, without any precursors, without any signs, without any warnings, then the only reaction could have been one of total surprise.  And that is what I also observed, be it with the army or with the population at large. 
Q.	When you say, Mr. Witness, that the aggressor or the attacker came from Uganda, did that army also include Ugandan soldiers? 
A.	Clearly, those who included -- or those who attacked the country included Ugandan soldiers.  But even in the very strict sense of the word they were all Ugandans, either because they had been naturalised or because they were bearing Ugandan national identity cards, irrespective of their origins. 

So all the prisoners of war who were captured at that time were in possession of Ugandan national identity cards, so it is clear to my mind that they were all Ugandans. 
Q.	The Rwandan army opposite, what was the -- the strength of that army to respond to that sudden attack? 
A.	The Rwandan army was a small army made up of land units in the various ten préfectures, some at the company or battalion levels, and a few reserve and intervention units in Kigali.  

On the whole -- on the whole they -- there was a total of about 5,000 -- 5,000 soldiers, and to which we need to add the gendarmes, a police/military force which did not have more than 2,000 troops.  And if we were to add about a thousand reserve soldiers, then we can say in total that Rwanda had only about 8,000 troops to defend itself with. 
Q.	How then, Mr. Witness, do you explain the ability of that small army to resist and actually cause damage -- serious damage to the attacking forces?  Can you explain to the Court how this result was achieved. 
A.	Let me start by -- by the end, so that we may understand the issue better.  On the 
	30th of October 1990, the combatants of the Ugandan army who had attacked Rwanda with trumpets and what have you, and were acclaimed by the international press as being able to capture the country within two or three days, they were chased out of the country -- out of Rwanda on the 
	30th of October 1990 and they retreated to their sanctuary in Uganda. 
How did that happen?  After those first moments of surprise, and the fumbling of the initial days, the Rwandan units reconstituted and re-organised themselves, so much so that around the
10th of October the units in the Mutara began to recapture some of the territory that had been taken over by the RPF, particularly the Gabiro camp.

1445H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
Around the 20th, the Nyagatare centre, which had already been occupied by the enemy, was freed and liberated.  

Then, around the 23rd or 24th, our units had progressed from two directions and linked up 
at a place -- causing serious damage and loss to the enemy, including the loss of 
senior military officials, who were the high command of the RPF, who died in an ambush laid by our units and that was the beginning of disarray within their ranks and they, therefore, returned to Uganda.  

And on the 30th of October, we marched to the Kagitumba border post and hoisted our flag believing that the war was over within those 30 days.  That is how this operation was undertaken in a flash.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Q.	Mr. Witness, during this -- these proceedings, the Prosecutor referred to an event of the 
4th and 5th of October 1990, referring to it as having been staged.  Now, you, who were present, can you tell us what happened on the 4th and 5th of October, as a matter of fact?  How do you -- what is your reaction to the Prosecutor's characterisation of the event as having been stage-managed?  
What is your opinion, given that you were involved in the fighting proper? 
A.	In the night of the 4th to the 5th of October 1990, there was sustained gunfire throughout Kigali and in all its neighbourhoods.  The firing came from all directions.  

Where was the firing from?  What was the source of that firing, one may ask.  

First of all, on the 4th, in the day, information was circulating to the effect that the capital would be attacked by the fifth column of the RPF, and I have already told you that part of my unit was already moving towards the front.  I was ordered to promptly return to my camp and to organise the defence of my camp given that the -- there was a likelihood of the enemy attacking the capital city.  

So I asked the G3 of the general staff whether there was such a probability.  And he told me that they had received information from a reliable source, namely, the embassy of the United States, which had provided the said information to the ministry of defence, and it was the chief of cabinet himself who received that piece of intelligence.  

And, given its importance, the general staff was accordingly notified and the orders were issued to the various units accordingly for them to organise themselves.  It is in this manner that all the units in Kigali returned to their positions in the evening.  And at around 9 p.m. to midnight, the firing started, and it lasted till dawn.  And as the sun rose, people became aware of what was going on, and then the firing ceased or stopped.  

My explanation to this incident is the following: 

Our soldiers were not used to fighting and combat situations and conditions.  They were not familiar with combat or fighting situations, and they panicked at some point.  And at the slightest provocation, they shot and emptied all their firing power.  So that was one reason.  

The other reason would be that the political and military leaders -- our political and military leaders fell into the trap that was part of the RPF policy and propaganda in relation to the army.  I, therefore, want to say that it was not a staged event but, rather, a plot or a trap set by the sponsors of the RPF to demonstrate that, contrary to what the Rwandan government was saying in respect to an attack from abroad -- to -- to point, therefore -- point out, therefore, that those people had supporters from within.  

The next day the question was to put as to who may have shot first -- who may have fired first and who may have provoked the Rwandan armed forces.  Those who may have been in collaboration with the RPF or who were suspected of belonging to the fifth column were arrested.  And it is that incident, which is referred to as the ibyitso, in Kinyarwanda, where some 500 persons were gathered at the stadium.  

Now, the claim by the RPF that they were coming to deliver the country from a dictatorial government was thus justified because it was claimed that, by arresting those people, the government was not upholding values of democracy and human rights.  So this clearly was a trap into which we stumbled.  
It was not stage-managed.  I was there.  I researched the issue, and I do not come to the conclusion that it was stage-managed but, rather, to the conclusion that it was a trap into which the authorities easily walked.  
Q.	You mentioned that the government reacted by arresting some persons who were suspected to be supporters of the RPF.  Were those people released after the issue was clarified and the mistake was understood? 
A.	Yes.  I cannot be specific as to the date, but I believe that a few weeks after -- in fact, from the 6th, a commission was set up to sort through the people, and some were being released even as early as then.  And a few weeks thereafter, they were all released, that is, after they had all been gathered up on the 5th of October 1990.  
Q.	I -- I hope I am not mistaken when I put it to you that your unit was in charge of discipline within the army; is that the case? 
A.	You are right.  
Q.	What did you establish in relation to the discipline -- or to discipline within the army following the attacks of 1 October 1990, an army which had never been to war? 
A.	With the onset of the war, the situation naturally changed.  Things changed for everybody and theories that had been acquired or -- or learnt in military school now had to be applied.  At some point those theories were properly applied and implemented because, as I told you, after the surprise of the first days of the war, the army regrouped and proceeded with -- and in an orderly manner, to the point of kicking the enemy out of the country.  

But the war continued.  And there was ongoing or continuing tension as people continued to be on permanent alert or -- and life was no longer following its normal flow.  Things began to change, including discipline.  There was an issue of increasing the number of troops -- recruitments here and there hastily conducted -- in order to deal with an urgent and ever-changing situation.  All of those transformations had a negative impact on discipline.  That was my observation.  
Q.	Could you describe to the Court the strategy adopted by the RPF after it was defeated.  Now, from 1990 to 1994 would there be a lull in the country, or will the war be sustained throughout that period against Rwanda? 
A.	It is only on hindsight -- hindsight and after studying the military history of the war that we now understand the various phases of the war.  We -- you -- you know what is referred to as 
conventional warfare.  It is warfare in which specific units are pitted against each other and where there are specific and clearly defined objectives using conventional approaches.  You have a support unit, you have a combat unit, and you have a target which you seek -- you seek to capture, and you know exactly where the enemy is positioned.  If you defend yourself properly, you would defend your position, and that is the way conventional warfare is conducted.  

Now, when they attacked on the 1st of October, they were relying on the surprise element and their greater numbers, as well as their experience because you may want to know that they had just conquered Uganda, which was bigger -- which is bigger than Rwanda, that is, in 19 -- that is just 
a few -- four years before they -- they attacked Rwanda.  That was in 1986.  

And so they felt that using a -- conventional warfare with the surprise effect they would be able to 
run over Rwanda.  But after the defeat, they changed strategies and moved away from 
conventional warfare to guerrilla warfare.  Guerrilla warfare uses other strategies in order to reach the same objective, namely, victory.  

So they attacked in small numbers.  They do not focus on one target; they strike and run.  They caused disorder across the country without capturing or occupying any specific position.  And you proceed by harassing the adversary or the -- an -- and your enemy.  This is the strategy that was adopted by the RPF after the 30th of October.  
From 30 October 1990 to the 4th of April 1994, the RPF no longer engaged in conventional warfare.  They opted for guerrilla warfare and harassment.  

That is my analysis of the war operations as they were conducted by the RPF.  
Q.	You have just described to the Court the guerrilla warfare tactics used by the RPF.  Now, my question is, were there any attempts -- any discussions to seek peace during that period?  And could you refer to any specific dates, any highlights in that exercise during that period.  
A.	The first series of serious discussions between the RPF and the government of Rwanda took place in 1991, culminating in the N'sele accords in the former Zaire near Kinshasa.  These were signed under the auspices of Marshal Mobutu.  

According to those accords, the two parties agreed to observe a ceasefire and to put in place a 
neutral group of observers to monitor the said ceasefire and then to proceed with political negotiations thereafter.  That was the situation in 1991.  I think it must have been in March or April 1991.  

The N'sele accords were never implemented because the RPF simply accepted that neutral military observers should be put in place, including the RPF.  That is all it acceded to or it -- it respected.  
But the other clauses of the agreement were not respected; the RPF breached them consistently.  

Then in 1992 -- 1992 -- yes, 1992, following the installation or the inauguration of a 
multiparty government, some parties of that government supporting the RPF, a government 
that -- was set up in April 1992, following that, the RPF attacked again in June 1992 and insisted on negotiations being undertaken immediately as a precondition for a ceasefire, and that is how the Arusha Accords negotiations began culminating in what you know to be the Arusha Accords.  

Therefore, from October 1990 up until June or July 1992, the Rwandan government continued 
to reach out and to encourage all efforts to stop the war.  
Q.	In your testimony just given, you talked about the -- a government -- a multiparty government that was formed.  What did you notice once the prime minister, Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, came to power? 
A.	It should be said that that government was put in place under very special conditions.  There was the former single party, that is, the MRND, which was no longer a single party on the political scene, and there were other opposition political parties that had just come into being and which wanted power to be shared.  In other words, it wanted to enter the government, to participate in the management of the country during that period of war.  

The paradox is that these same parties were in contact -- in fact, in connivance with the -- they acted in connivance with the enemy who was attacking the country.  Having noticed that, as far as I'm concerned -- as far as some soldiers were concerned, we were sort of confused; we were confused because the armed forces -- the -- the -- the army's at the disposal of the government.  The army is a tool for the government that enables the government to put in place or implement its policies -- foreign policy.  

Now, if the government asks you to go to war but it tells you that the war you are going to is not a war, you are confused.  This is what happened after the -- that government was formed.  

If you would give me a little bit of time, I'm going to tell you of the episode of the meeting in Brussels around the end of May 1992.  

Three parties in government met.  They met with the RPF in Belgium, Brussels.  For three days of -- or, during three days -- or after three days of discussions, they issued a communiqué saying that, "We, MDR, PSD and the RPF, we are saying that our common enemy is the government of Kigali.  We have to fight it so that democracy should be introduced in the country."  

The communiqué was signed and was aired on the radio and television.  The delegates who came from Rwanda returned, but those people who returned, one of them provided a prime minister, some provided ministers.  But yet they said that the enemy was the government in which they were participating.  One doesn't have to be a political scientist to understand that such a situation is unheard of in -- in politics.  

Now, coming back to your question, with the putting in place of the multiparty government, there was confusion in the minds of people, confusion resulting from the fact that someone -- or a member of a given government would say that he's fighting the same government -- would say that he is sending his soldiers to fight their friend who is no longer their enemy.  

So this is what I observed.  These are the vicissitudes linked to that situation arising from 
a multiparty government.  
Q.	Do you want to -- or do you mean to tell the Court that the RPF was preaching war with supporters or with its members in government and that the government of Rwanda itself was preaching war?  Or, rather, the government was preaching peace -- this is to summarise what you have expressed 
at length -- and that this was the cause of the stalemate?  
A.	It should be said that when negotiations started and continued, on every occasion it was seen that the RPF always kept on the table the war option.  Once a ceasefire was signed, it was breached -- even before it entered into force.  There were even occasions when the RPF would attack while still present on the negotiation table here in Arusha.  
When the RPF launched its all-out attack on the 8th of February 1993, it was a total surprise because negotiations were ongoing and everyone, including the media, was saying that everything is going on very well; that there was confidence.  But we were surprised.  

So it is this paradox of two persons who are talking to one another, who are negotiating, but one has a hidden agenda and another one is of good faith.  And that person is always surprised.  This was something that was always present throughout the peace process -- or the war process depending on which side you are.  
Q.	Can you remind the Court of the date when the Arusha Peace Accords were signed.  And can you also describe to the Court the specific concrete activities that the government forces' command took in order to implement those accords, that is, the Arusha Accords.  
A.	The Arusha Accords were signed on the 3rd of August 1993.  It should be said that, for the negotiations to have continued right up to that date, there was an important protocol that still had to be negotiated -- that is, the protocol relating to the integration or the merging of the two armies.  That protocol took time to be negotiated.  It -- it -- it was just concluded.  It was the last protocol concluding the Arusha Accords.  

Now, from that moment on, all the parties were supposed to implement what they had to do in order to give meaning to the accords.  The government, for its part, had to -- had to open up so as to form a broad-based transitional government.  A transition assembly also had to be put in place.  

Regarding the army, an integrated command of the army had to be put in place.  Units -- commanders of the various units had to comprise 50 per cent government forces and 50 per cent RPF forces.  So each party started implementing what they had to implement.  

As regards the Rwandan armed forces, that was the only entity that went far enough in implementing the Arusha Accords.  Without delay, the Rwandan armed forces designated the ten or so officers who had to be part of the high command of the new army.  They made the list official or public.  

When the RPF was given the names of those ten FAR officers and when the RPF were asked to give the names of their own ten officers who were part of the high command, the RPF said, "No, we are not giving any names."  

Well, that was the first hiccup.  We did not understand anything.  But the RPF -- the names of the 
RPF -- or, rather, the FAR officers were published and announced over the radio.  

It was said that the accords provided rules that would rule -- or provided the harmonisation of rules.  As you know, the -- we were -- we -- the -- the FAR rules were kind of French rules and the RPF rules were Anglo-Saxon rules, so all these rules governing the two armies had to be harmonised.  It was, therefore, necessary to create ad hoc committees.  For our part, in the armed forces, we designated officers who would be part of the harmonisation exercise.  When we asked the RPF to do the same, they did not comply.  It was only when it was said that, "Our committees are ready" -- and whether we could start, they said "Yes." 

So our officers went to Mulindi to start the joint meetings with the RPF.  This shows you the good faith, the willingness -- and, I would even say, the naivety of the government forces because they implemented all that they had to implement, another sign of goodwill.  

It was said that in the buffer zones -- the buffer zones between our positions and the RPF positions, in principle, in that buffer area, no army had to be there.  It was said that, "We'll put in that place a committee comprising officers of the government forces, the RPF forces and civilians to monitor that zone."  That committee was put in place.  I know something about it because I was a member of that very committee in my sector, which was in Byumba.  

The RPF played the game.  It brought their officers.  We worked together.  We were moving about together everywhere.  

Another sign to show that the government forces did everything to apply what they had to do, we were told that we had to designate 20 officers to participate in the seminar called, "Confidence building seminar".  I do not know what that is in French.  We had to participate in that seminar with RPF officers.  

We designated our own officers.  They went, and the Americans started teaching us how to live -- how to coexist with the RPF.  We participated in that seminar.  I was one of the officers in one of those seminars.  We did everything to meet our obligations, and we did so right up to the 6th of April.  We did that bearing -- thinking that the war had come to an end.  

So in a few words, this is what I can tell you regarding what I noticed -- or the efforts that I noticed, efforts made by the government forces as far as they were concerned -- the -- offered -- the efforts they made to implement the Arusha Accords.  
Q.	Witness, are you in a position to explain to the Court the lack of transparency regarding the 
RPF conduct whilst the government forces were applying what they had to do?  And they did so 
openly, the RPF was resisting.  And, as a matter of fact, it was only the government side that was seeking peace whilst the RPF was engaged in war -- engaged in war since they attacked in February 1994.  Can you explain, you, as a member of that committee, can you describe to the Court how you -- you experienced -- how you went through this stalemate. 
A.	I am convinced that this RPF attitude was due to its hidden agenda.  The RPF was convinced that the peace process, which would lead to democratising the country, that that peace process would not be in its interests.  Sooner or later -- well, they could participate in a transitional government lasting about 
two or three years, but sooner or later, if there were democratic elections -- if there were democratic elections, they would not be able to take over power in Rwanda.  And its main objective was 
to take over power, power in its entirety, and to do so they could only achieve their goal through the use of arms.  

So what I was able to notice is that, at the time that we set ourselves to showing the goodwill, our goodwill in applying the Arusha Accords, the RPF refined or honed its strategy to take over power.  
Commissions, seminars, and so on -- he (sic) took advantage of all this furore to gather intelligence.  And we, on our part, we were very naive.  We were observing what -- what was going on.  

When they came to us, it was to gather intelligence so as to prepare its final objective.  And we were saying that we should not upset them; that the war had ended and that we're -- we're engaged in a peace process.  
(Pages 43 to 50 by Jean Baigent)





















1515H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
	And on the 6th of April when the president's plane was shot down -- immediately after the 6th of April, on the 7th, the RPF attacked on all fronts in less than a few hours.  Any army officer would tell you to put a unit in place in a state of alert, even a unit which was supposed to be there in time of peace; in other words, the weapons are in stores, ammunitions have not been distributed, some of the officers follow.  

	To engage a unit in war, you need notice of at least 12 hours, but in their case they were already on their way to war.  I therefore conclude that they were already in a state of alert before the 6th of April.  This is a technical inference -- a technical deduction.  All staff colleges would tell you that you need a minimum time to put an army unit in a state of alert and to ask the unit to move.  

	If, therefore, the RPF were able to proceed to war as early as the 7th, it means that they were in a 
	state of alert before that date.

	Furthermore -- well, in theory, they were in a state of peace, since the peace agreement had been signed in August 1993.  In fact, it would even be more difficult under those circumstances to 
	mobilise people who had spent six months in a state of war.  

	So this is what I can say regarding this attitude -- the RPF attitude.  What I can is that certainly the RPF only sought military victory, not any other solution. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I would like us to deal with a matter that I've -- I would have already dealt with, and that is the definition of the enemy.  Can you tell the Court the circumstances under which the high command of the government forces put in place the committee that dealt with the definition of the enemy? 
A.	When the war broke out, in other words, in 1992, during a meeting of unit commanders and commanders of operational sectors, a meeting chaired by the chief of staff -- I'm sorry.  That was 
	1991 -- 1991. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
On that occasion, following a question asked by an officer who asked that up to now, contrary to 
other command authorities -- or command committees -- that there is no document defining the enemy that the country is fighting.  And that it was necessary to have such a committee or defined enemy so that everyone should be clear and should not be confused as to who the enemy is.  

So a committee was set up.  And that committee handed in its report in 1992, I believe, but the report was made not public.  There was only a letter from the chief of staff which gave excerpts of the report to unit commanders or commanders of sectors.  And the excerpts simply said that the committee has come to the end of its work and also talked about the conclusions.  

This document, which was classified as confidential, fell into the hands of the media and was made public.  We were surprised to see it disseminated or circulating, even though it was a confidential document, a classified document.  It is that document that talked about the definition of the enemy.  I do not know whether that is the document you want to refer to. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Yes.  That is the document I'm referring to.  But I would like you to tell the Court whether in the 
	military strategy -- in military strategy it is abnormal to define an enemy in time of war and sometimes even during peace.  
A.	It is perfectly normal, and even appropriate, to define the enemy, the enemy that you are confronting, because the enemy may change, depending on the circumstances.  The enemy may change over time and space.  The enemy's not static.  

It is for that reason that when you develop a strategy, that strategy is based on hypotheses, working assumptions.  And each working hypothesis or assumption must indicate who the enemy is, who the friend is, who the resource is and the strategy -- or, rather, the manoeuvres to be carried out.  

That situation could change the following day, depending on the circumstances, depending on the alliances.  Therefore, in any command unit, you're not going to have that document in its hand, but each headquarters has that document.  The document is prepared for each circumstance when the situation changes.  

I can illustrate this.  When I was a student in the war college that was in Belgium -- this is the NATO system.  And that was at a time when we had two blocs, the Warsaw pact and NATO; that is, the 
Soviet Union existed with its satellite countries who were members of the Warsaw Pact and you had NATO and its allies, including the United States.  

Now, when we went to drills we would say, "Where is the enemy coming from?  The enemy is coming from the east.  The enemy is red.  The enemy is Russian."  So this is what was said in every 
military exercise.  So we're told that the enemy is the red army -- the red army supported by 
satellite countries or allies. 
MR. SENDZE:
Witness, please slow down.  Speak slowly. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm sorry.  

We did not stop there.  We did not stop there.  We were even told -- we even asked questions such as: "Where can the enemy recruit supporters?"  And we would say, "Well, from members of the communist parties in our respective countries who were also under surveillance."  Because in the event of a conflict it was believed that on the basis of political affinities, they could give intelligence through the main army or you guide the enemy or even help the enemy.  And this is always defined now.

The war curtain fell.  There's no longer the Cold War.  But do you think that in the headquarters you do not have a strategy for the enemy?  Now, you know that some countries define the enemy at present as terrorism.  Terrorism has replaced the red army.  

Now, in the present circumstances you will say:  Who is the terrorist?  Because the principal enemy now is the terrorist and the terrorist could be somebody who comes from this part of the country who -- who is a member of this religion, and so on and so forth.  All of this is developed, depending on the circumstances and the moments.  

So to summarise what I was saying, Counsel -- in fact, this is not an exercise that was peculiar to the Rwandan army.  It was not peculiar -- it was not the Rwandan army that defined the enemy.  It is necessary always to define the enemy.  That enemy changes depending on the situation and the strategy that you want to adopt. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.

In the FAR army, did you consider the Tutsi -- the Tutsis as a whole or did you consider that the enemy was a soldier, a member of the RPF who was fighting? 
A.	Today, as before, the situation is very clear.  The FAR, that is, the government forces, were always of the opinion that the enemy -- the thought was the RPF army, that was called RPA, the 
	Rwandan Patriotic Army, that was the enemy.  The government forces never considered the Tutsi as their enemy.  Never.

But, as I told you, the RPF recruited mainly Tutsis.  The Government forces, therefore, were entitled to understanding this aspect.  If all observers agree that the RPF recruited mainly the Tutsis, the government forces, that is the FAR forces, also noticed that.  But that is not an indication that the government forces considered the Tutsi as the enemy.  

Of course, the Tutsi who joined the RPF army and who attacked, whether it was Tutsi or a Hutu, was considered as an enemy.  But, first of all, that person had to join the RPF army that we were fighting.

Therefore, we should not make any confusion here.  The government forces never made that confusion and they always considered the enemy to be clearly identified.  And that enemy was a soldier, the army that they were fighting. 
Q.	A last definition -- and I think after that it'll be time for us to adjourn -- what does the term "Inkotanyi" mean, as far as you're concerned?  And what did it mean?  And what does it still mean? 
A.	When the RPF attacked on the 1st of October 1990, they made reference to the RPF Inkotanyi.  They always added that suffix:  Inkotanyi.  

I must say that I did not know them much before, but I sought a lot of information.  And, subsequently, I became aware that Inkotanyi referred to a militia that existed in the 19th century, a royal militia, a militia that fought in the king's expeditions, the expeditions that the king sent to neighbouring counties or areas.  And that the Inkotanyi meant courageous, fearless fighters.  

Inkotanyi, therefore, is the name that the RPF army gave itself.  And even today that name remains their favourite nickname.  But from the point of view of entomology, that name derives its origin from the royal militia that existed in the 19th century. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I think, at least for once, I can clearly see that the time is 3:30 p.m.  It is in my interest to see clearly because I do take any -- I do not want to take even one minute more than it is necessary.  And I'd request you to order an adjournment. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we take our adjournment now.  

As -- as you're aware, the -- we have a long weekend and we don't resume our sitting until Monday.  So, Mr. Witness, I must advise you that during this, or any other adjournment, while you are a witness, that you do not discuss your testimony or the case with anybody. 
THE WITNESS:
I understand that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We take the adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1533H)
