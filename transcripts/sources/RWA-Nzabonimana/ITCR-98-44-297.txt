P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness said "good morning".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you open the proceedings, please.  
MS. KOUO: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 2nd of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.    

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, madam registrar. 

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I trust you're in good shape to continue this morning?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes sir, good morning, indeed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began.  And Mr. Sow will continue his examination.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody. 
WITNESS ALG,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I should like -- before putting questions to the witness, I should like to ask you to admit in evidence the speech we saw yesterday by Mr. Édouard Karemera in all three versions, French, English and Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was there an objection, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, I'd -- I'd like to make an observation, though.  My -- my request is that actually we admit -- this is something I'd communicated to the parties by an email.  There are three tabs in the Prosecution bundle that all concern this event that took place on the 16th of January 1994.  And my request, for the clarity of the record, is that we simply admit in full tab 152, tab 153 and tab 154.  Tab 154 includes the portion that Mr. Sow referred to yesterday, which is the speech of Édouard Karemera.  Tab 152 includes the speech from Ngirumpatse.  Tab 153 is a radio broadcast that contains other comments on the same event.  And all of these speeches -- all three tabs will be reviewed by our experts when they come.  And I think that, for the clarity of the record, we'd all be better off if we simply admit all three tabs in full.  

I can't imagine that the Defence --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask you:  Isn't Ngirumpatse's speech already admitted in evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It was admitted as P. 14, but I can't confirm that because the CMS has not scanned that exhibit into TRIM and that's where we compare our bundle to the items that are actually admitted, and my recollection is that it was only his speech that was admitted, not the entire tape.  

Before starting the trial, there was an informal meeting between the parties and we had agreed that as far as the radio transcripts are concerned, it would be preferable to admit the entire transcript -- the entire transcript of the entire tape because then we could see the speeches in context.  That's what I recall being the result of a meeting we had with the parties.  I can't remember when it was, but it was before the beginning of the trial.  And to simplify matters, my suggestion is that we simply create three new exhibits, with each containing the full contents of the Radio Rwanda or RTLM broadcast that was then transcribed.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you wish to be heard?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I don't accept that; I object to that request because the -- the radio broadcasts contain other material other than things that occurred at that meeting on the 16th of January.  For example, within those tabs are speeches by the prime minister, concerning events regarding the swearing-in of the transitional institutions, and other comments by the journalists which are not relevant to the trial.  So I think what should be admitted are the speeches of those people who were the subject of testimony by this witness.  

So, I object to the whole (unintelligible) admission of the Prosecution's tabs.  If they want to isolate the speeches of other people, besides Mr. Karemera and Mr. Ngirumpatse, who spoke, they should do that in their re-examination and -- and have the witness give some relevant testimony about it.  But simply to admit the whole day's tape of all the chatter that is going on on the radio is not acceptable to us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow, really you're the person who is controlling the admission of this exhibit.  What is it that you'd  like to have admitted?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I asked to enter Karemera's speech that we referred to yesterday.  That's enough for me.  I didn't ask for anything else.  I think that the Prosecution will be at liberty to enter anything they want when they come to questioning.  Thank you.  
MS. KOUO: 
That speech will be D. K8, Your Honour, D. K8.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. K8 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I'm pleased to announce that I shall have finished my cross within the hour.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	So, Witness, we still have a few minutes together.  I should like you to concentrate on the questions I put to you, and, as far as possible, please answer me concisely.  Whilst recalling that you are a protected witness, I think that we have been able to work together without revealing your identity and in advance I thank you. 

Now, Witness, before adjourning yesterday, you spoke of the ten commandments, the business about the ten commandments as published by the paper Kangura, and you said that they had never been in any way troubled.  Would you confirm that the editorial team of that paper was never given any problems because of that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness answers:  "At least I never heard anything like that."
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	What was the name of the person in charge of Kangura? 
A.	His name was Ngeze, Hassan. 
Q.	So you say you never heard about anything like that, so why did you insist in saying that the authorities did nothing? 
A.	Well, it's obvious.  The authorities did nothing to condemn that person.  On the contrary, they supported him.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, with your permission, I should like to ask Mr. Issa to help me to show two documents.  One which was disclosed to us by the Prosecutor, which is a document emanating from Amnesty International, K0504960, as well as another document in Kinyarwanda, from Imvaho, I-M-V-A-H-O.  I-M-V -- Imvaho -- I-M-V-A-H-O, issue number 867 -- 867, dated 5 November 1990.  I want to show this to the witness, the Kinyarwanda version, the original Kinyarwanda.  So that's Imvaho, I-M-V-A-H-O, issue number 867, dated 05/11/1990. 

Mr. President, I should like to ask my assistant, Ms. Fatou NDour, to help me in reading certain extracts whilst identifying precisely which extract she's reading so that all parties might follow.  And I shall ask Mr. Leopold Nsengiyumva to help me in reading the small extract in Kinyarwanda.  

Ms. Fatou NDour --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, sorry, the Kinyarwanda booth is saying that they have no copies.  They need a copy of the document in the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, you have taken care of that request?  
MR. SOW: 
Well, Mr. President, we've given some documents to Mr. Issa and I think he's taking care of that. 
MS. NDOUR:  
So it's page number 4, the second paragraph, beginning by "Two".  "Two prominent journalists, 
Vincent Rwabukwisi and Hassan Ngeze, were arrested on 3 and 6 July 1990, respectively, in Kigali and held --

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slow down a bit.  Sorry.
MS. NDOUR:
Sorry.  "...and held at Kigali central prison." 

	Fourth paragraph:  "In an editorial in Kangura newspaper, Hassan Ngeze reportedly alleged that the minority Tutsi controlled most of Rwanda's economy.  It's apparently because of this opinion that Hassan Ngeze was detained." 
JUDGE SHORT: 
I think you will have to go much slower.  
MS. NDOUR:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. --
JUDGE KAM: 
Counsel Sow, I think that the booth is still asking for the document. 
MR. SOW:
I did make enough copies.  I thought everything had been handed over.  I have another copy available here. 
MS. NDOUR:
"In an editorial in Kangura newspaper, Hassan Ngeze reportedly alleged that the minority Tutsi controlled most of Rwanda's economy.  It's apparently because of this opinion that Hassan Ngeze was detained.  It has also been reported that the authorities accused Hassan Ngeze of allowing the publication in Kangura newspaper of readers' letters relating to tension between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  

"Amnesty International is concerned that the two journalists were brought to trial solely because they exercised their rights to freedom of expression and association while acting in pursuit of their profession.  Amnesty International fears that, as in previous trials by the state security court, these prisoners of conscience may be sentenced to long prison terms." 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Ms. NDour.  

I should like to ask now -- like to ask now Léopold Nsengiyumva to read the relevant paragraphs in Kinyarwanda, whilst specifying what they are.  
MR. NSENGIYUMVA: 
I'm now going to read ten lines from the first column, and then I shall read a second paragraph from the third column, beginning with the title, of course.  "Rwabukwisi, Ngeze are convicted." 

"On the 14th and 16th of July, the Tribunal, entrusted with trying people threatening state security, charged Vincent Rwabukwisi and Hassan Ngeze, who were both accused of having published in their newspapers ethnic material which could induce confusion amongst the population." 

Third column:  "Article 166 was an accusation against Hassan Ngeze because he published in his newspaper, Kangura, material that might lead to ethnic division." 
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. Léopold Nsengiyumva.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness -- Witness, can you -- are you following?  
A.	I hear you, Counsel.  
Q.	After this reading of two publications, do you persist in saying that the authorities did not sanction the person responsible for publishing Kangura? 
A.	Counsel, I will stick to what I said, especially at the time -- what I said is valid for the time at which they were published.  I think that those articles were published in 1990.  Now I see a date here of the 14th and 15th of July, but there's no mention of the year.  It is only subsequently that one sees that it might have been in 1990, but in the extract read there was no mention of the year.  They merely mention the 14th and 16th of July. 

I think that the problem that concerns us for the moment is the ten commandments, the Hutu ten -- ten Hutu commandments.  So it all depends on the timing, and I can say more about what -- about what pushed the people to do what they did. 
Q.	I have heard you, but I remind you that I put the following question to you:  Did not the authorities ever sanction the editor?  And in answer to that question you said you were not aware of that.  And I added that since you weren't aware, informed, why do you persist in saying that he wasn't sanctioned?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I should like to enter the document from Amnesty International, disclosed to us by the Prosecutor, as an exhibit, as well as the extract in Kinyarwanda from that publication. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I agree that it's necessary to answer the question put to me, but when I'm presented an extract which is only what counsel wishes to show but not extracts that might say something else, I must comment, which is why I said that you have to look at which point in time, certainly.  I know that Rwabukwisi and Ngeze worked together; they had a newspaper.  At that time the authorities said that it was a newspaper working for the Inkotanyi.  Subsequently, maybe Ngeze and Rwabukwisi couldn't get on any more; Hassan Ngeze created his own newspaper and no longer worked with Rwabukwisi.  When the two were tried, they were still working together, and they were said to be accomplices of the RPF; that is why they were prosecuted.  

Subsequently, Hassan Ngeze changed his position and began to support the ideas of the existing regime.  He was a turncoat, especially in the period of multiparty politics.  He no longer said the same thing.  He began to defend the interests of the Hutu, and he created that newspaper to awaken the majority of the population, and that is when the ten commandments were issue -- published.  He was cooperating with the authorities. 

When the CDR was created, he joined that party.  His newspaper was merely spouting the propaganda of the CDR.  And I tell you that in what was read out, there was no reference to the ten commandments.  

In February 1993, I recall Ngeze published an article in which he said, "We're a bit all over the place" and called upon the Hutu to work together and join the association named Turihose - "we're a bit everywhere."  At that time, the authorities never condemned Ngeze.  They knew very well that Ngeze was a member of the CDR, and his newspaper was merely producing the propaganda of that party, and the MRND people you see here decided on an alliance between the MRND and the CDR, and articles continued to be published. 

So you see that Ngeze was tried when he had not yet started to cooperate with the authorities, and as of the time he began to espouse the ideology of the established authorities, the power that was, he was no longer given any trouble. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you need to stop pleading.  I believe that I have put a number of questions to you that you need to respond to.  
MR. SOW: 
Now, Mr. President, I requested for the document -- the Amnesty International document, bearing the reference K0504960, as well as the excerpt from the newspaper in Kinyarwanda that was read, to be admitted into evidence, with your leave. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I believe the witness would like to say something to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to admit the documents into evidence. 
Madam registrar, what are the numbers?  
MS. KOUO: 
D. K9 for the document from Amnesty International and D. K10 for the excerpt.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. K9 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. K10 admitted) 
MR. SOW: 
I thank you, Mr. President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness is still trying to speak to you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I would like to thank Mr. President. 

Now, Mr. President, what I said to you with reference to the question that was put to me is pure reality.  Now, it is the Defence counsel who has a client to defend.  He wants to rid him of any guilt, and I have come here to testify against him, so every time he presents documents to me, they are documents that serve his purpose and every time he wants to avoid the excerpts for passages of those documents that might incriminate his client.  That's what I wanted say to you, Mr. President.  I would like for that to be taken down in the record.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you must not underestimate the Court.  We are listening to your testimony.  Counsel is entitled to challenge your testimony and to try to contradict you with material that he has at his disposal.  It is our duty to assess the testimony as a whole and come to conclusions based on it.  So you can be sure that we'll be looking at the totality of the testimony when we come to make our decision.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I also think it would be helpful for you to advise this witness that he's not here to charge the Accused as some kind of a prosecutor, but that he's here simply to tell the truth and to answer the questions put to him; and, therefore, it's not necessary for him to make the Prosecution's case by introducing other exhibits or other passages of the exhibits, that there are professionals on the other side of the courtroom here to do that job.  I think he's confused as to his role, and it would be helpful if you could educate him, because when I start to cross-examine him, it would lengthen the proceedings if he has this misapprehension.  Thank you.

MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, clearly I don't share Mr. Robinson's view, and I'm quite sure that the Court, in its own discretion, will know how to instruct the witness appropriately.  So I'm not going to comment on the substance of what he said, but the witness should take his instructions from the Court and not from counsel on either side.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Robinson, if portions or extracts of the publication are put to a witness in order to contradict the witness's testimony and the witness feels that there are other portions in that publication which supports his testimony, isn't he entitled to draw attention to counsel to those other portions?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, absolutely, Your Honour.  However, for example, in this particular extract, there's nothing about Mr. Karemera in -- in that extract.  So if there was some other portions of that article that he wanted to draw to counsel's attention, that would be perfectly proper, but what he did was try to make the case against Mr. Karemera by referring to material that has nothing to do with the -- the extract.  

And this is actually something, I think, that's very common to Rwandan culture, at least as I have been trying to understand it over the last four years, is that people who come from Rwanda think that they're here to charge the accused.  They don't realise that they're just here to answer questions, and so they feel it's their duty to bring into play information which will help them charge the accused.  I don't think that that's something that's done with any malice, but I think that's part of the culture, that when people come to a court, they think they're charging the accused, but it prolongs the proceedings here when they do that. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe that the witness has taken an oath to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, but from the moment when the witness says that they have come here to -- in order to accuse somebody, then I must say that I should cast some doubt on the credibility of that witness.  And Counsel Robinson is in the right.  I believe that we need to educate the witness, because he does not realise that when one takes an oath to tell the truth, whatever the circumstances of that truth, that truth needs to be told.  And now I understand more why every time he seems to be pleading himself with a view to incriminating the Accused.  

He is here to testify on facts, and we need to know which elements the Prosecution have in order to outline them to Your Honours.  So I also believe that it is a problem of principle that needs to be dealt with, and this is valid for all witnesses, whether they be Prosecution or Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the problem is that one cannot insist on -- that the witness simply answers questions if the questions are put to the witness in an argumentative fashion.  Now, the witness has just heard the speech in which the arguments about his attitude, about his approach to the truth, have been put forward.  Should he respond or shouldn't he?  Now, I see him already trying to raise his hands to try to enter into discussion which has been introduced, and I don't think that I should stop him from doing it, because if matters are put to him in an argumentative manner, then how else could he respond but in similar way?  

So whereas it is true that the witness is not here as an accuser, he's here simply to give evidence, it is up to the Court to make an assessment of the evidence.  On the other hand, if counsel argues with the witness, I think the witness is entitled to try to rebut the propositions being put to him, if he feels that way.  Because at the bottom line, what we really are trying to do is get the testimony from this witness that we can assess in due course, and we look at the totality of the picture, his behaviour, his demeanour in the witness box; all these are part of the whole package that assists us in assessing his testimony.  But we are trying to understand him and what he has to say and to evaluate the reliability and credibility of his testimony.  

So you may continue now and put your questions to him. 

Mr. Witness, it's not necessary to respond to that last remark.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we shall continue with the examination. 

Witness, you said -- during the examination-in-chief and during the cross-examination on the subject of the demonstration of the 23rd of October 1993, you said that the intervention of Frodouald Karamira gave rise to a problem in association with the Hutu Power movement.  Can you confirm that, please?  
A.	I can indeed confirm that.  
Q.	What difference do you make between the MDR Power and the Hutu Power movement?  
A.	As regards the Hutu Power movement, Karamira mentioned this movement in public.  It is a movement that laid a claim for power for the Hutus, and they said that power should remain within the hands of the Hutus, in particular. 
Q.	When the MDR party speaks of MDR Power, are they not comparing it with the other MDR minority for which the Kinyarwanda Amajyoji, A-M-A-J-Y-O-J-I -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel did not finish his question.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, you have just spelt it perfectly.  
MR. SOW:
Unfortunately, there was a problem when -- the Kinyarwandans said Karemera instead of Karamira, and there is often a confusion between the two, so please let the record reflect Karamira.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Now, Witness, have you ever heard Édouard Karemera, one the co-Accused in this case, refer to the Hutu Power ideology?  
A.	No, he never uttered those words openly.  He never said "Hutu Power" openly.  

I wanted to say something else, but I think I'll stop there. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, is it not true to say that on the 26th -- or, rather, the -- Friday, the 27th of October, that you had had to go on rounds with Major Bivamvagara, B-I-V-A-M-V-A-J-A-R-A (sic), in the context of civil defence with a view to distributing arms?  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
One moment, please, Counsel.  The English translation came through as the 27th of October with no year. 
MR. SOW: 
The year 2006.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He did not mention it previously.  
MR. SOW:
That was the draft of the 27th of October 2006, page 10, paragraph 8 and 9.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, would you like me to repeat the question to you?  Now, you said that you accompanied Major Bivamvagara in accomplishing civil defence missions with a view to distributing arms.  Can you confirm that fact to us? 
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  You are saying that I accompanied that person, but then you said that we were distributing arms.  I accompanied him; I admit to that fact.  And even when he was distributing arms, I was present because I was in his company.  I gave you the locations where he took young people to -- where he trained young people. 
Q.	Witness, I reassure you by saying that I did but quote your statement of the 27th of October.  

Witness, how many weapons did you distribute?  
A.	I would like to say, Counsel, that you are asking me how many arms we distributed, but I told you that I was merely accompanying Major Bivamvagara, who was distributing arms himself.  I never used the plural term to say that "we distributed".  I said "he distributed" those arms, and I said I was accompanying him.  
MS. FRANKSON-WALLACE: 
Mr. President, I'm not sure what the French translation says, but the English translation was, certainly in terms of the question, "You did mention accompanying Major Bivamvagara on occasion or occasions when he distributed weapons."  That was the question that was to him, to whom were the weapons distributed, and then the answer followed.  For clarification, it's at page 9 of the English transcripts, lines 1 to 10, including the question and answer.  
MR. SOW: 
I think I shall rephrase my question in order to move forward.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Now, Witness, as you have said, I request -- I respect what you say.  You say that you accompanied him.  How many weapons did you see distributed by Major Bivamvagara? 
A.	Well, before responding to that question, I would like to add a further fact that you have not mentioned.  It was***************************************************************************************, and I don't know whether that detail was taken down or not.  But that is not the important thing for me.  I would now like to answer your question. 

I said that he was distributing weapons, and he would distribute them two by two in every location where the reservists had been sent to and where young people had been trained.  And I also added that there were two other weapons that he distributed in Kimisagara, K-I-M-I-S-A-G-A-R-A, and he distributed said weapons at the roadblock where members of the population had stopped and were requesting weapons there, and he distributed two weapons at that location. 

Then we carried on our round of inspection, and I also said that the members of the population ****************************************, in fact.  And when they saw us, they thought that ********* ***************distributing the weapons.  I also said that when we got to Nyamirambo, the members of the population requested two weapons that we also handed over to them.  There were other weapons that we handed over to the conseiller de secteur of Nyakabanda.  I shall spell that N-Y-A-K-A-B-A-N-D-A.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apologies for the speed.  
THE WITNESS:
It was the préfet who asked us to hand over the weapons to that conseiller.  ************************* *******************************************************************************************************************************  I think that is what I stated and what I am now confirming.  

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you.  But, specifically, if you went with the major, was it upon the major's request or upon an instruction given by the préfet? 
A.	It was on*****************. 
Q.	Witness, occasionally when the préfet was not there, did you stand in for him? 
A.	No, I did not stand in for him.  
Q.	Witness, a number of people have accused you of not only distributing weapons but also saying that you were with the Interahamwe.  Can you tell us why those people accused you?  Did you have problems with them? 
A.	The -- those people who leveled accusations of that nature against me, I do not know who they are.  It might have depended upon the way in which they interpreted events, but as far as I'm concerned, I never drove Interahamwe anywhere, and I never distributed weapons to the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Witness, you are being accused on the other side and you have come here to accuse 
	Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Would it not be right for us to ask ourselves the question whether you are trying, in accusing Mr. Édouard Karemera, to let yourself off in your own trial? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was asked to come and testify before this Tribunal in this case, as you said a few moments ago, but when I was called upon, I came in order to tell the truth.  I have a case pending, I'm aware of that, but what brought me here was the intention of telling the truth and the whole truth, without thinking about my pending trial. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe that, as I said, I have just -- the commitment I entered into with you yesterday, I have now finish my cross-examination.  I would like to thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow. 

Now, Mr. Witness, you still have to be examined by counsel for Nzirorera, so I now ask Mr. Robinson to commence his cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG -- go ahead.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I am happy to note that Mr. Karemera's counsel has just finished his cross-examination.  I'm happy to see that counsel for Nzirorera will now commence his cross-examination.  And with your leave, I would like to ask for a five-minute break before 
Counsel Robinson begins his cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are not normally supposed to grant requests of this nature, but I should ask you, is there a particular reason that you need to have a break?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, this is merely for psychological reasons, if I may say.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, I don't ask the obvious question:  Whose psychology, yours or Mr. Robinson's?  

Mr. Witness, you see, we -- we -- as a Trial Chamber, we have a very serious problem in that we want the case to finish, and we are trying to drive the case forward as quickly as possible, without compromising the fairness of the proceedings or the fairness to anybody.  Now, earlier this week we took some time off because you said you weren't feeling well, and that was a good reason for us to give you some time.  But normally in a trial, the mere fact that one cross-examiner has changed to another, that's not a good reason for granting an adjournment.  We're going to have our mid-morning recess in about half an hour, and I would prefer to wait until then for us to have our break. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, mwaramutse.  Amakuru ki?
A.	Good morning, and I'm very well, thank you.  
Q.	Can you tell us which post Mr. Nzirorera held at the time the Interahamwe was formed at the end of 1991? 
A.	When the Interahamwe were formed, Nzirorera was one of the members of the national committee of the MRND party.  
Q.	Witness ALG, I'm going to suggest that you're completely wrong about that, that, in fact, Mr. Nzirorera had been a member of the central committee of the MRND as a unique party, that those positions were dissolved in May of 1991, that a transitional period ensued in which some members were appointed to the MRND during the period of transition, and Mr. Nzirorera was not among those, and that Mr. Nzirorera was not elected to the national committee until April 1992; and, therefore, during the period of May 1991 to April 1992, he held no post within the national committee of the MRND.  Now, do you have reason to dispute that? 
A.	Counsel, I might have been wrong, because I was used to seeing him within the central committee at the time of the single party, and I considered him to be one of the senior leaders of the MRND party.  I might have been wrong. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, thank you, and then Mr. Nzirorera can no more be charged with any responsibility for the formation of the Interahamwe than you could be, who was a member of the MRND.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry, I object to that. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Robinson, that's for the Court to decide.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You would agree, would you not, that if he was not a member of the national committee, Mr. Nzirorera would have had no responsibility for the formation of the Interahamwe at the end of 1991, correct? 
A.	Maybe he was not a member of the national committee.  Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't, I'm not sure.  But it should be said that Mr. Nzirorera had considerable interest within -- power or influence within the party.  And as you have just said, he was one of the members of the central committee and had been so since April 1991.  And during that period, the Interahamwe had not yet been set up throughout the entirety of the country.  Even if he did not set up the Interahamwe, or train the Interahamwe, he actually encouraged the expansion of that organisation.  
Q.	And from April of 1992 to July of 1993, the only post that Mr. Nzirorera had in the MRND was to be a member of the national committee, correct?  
A.	Yes, he was one of the members of the national committee -- MRND national committee. 
Q.	And that made him one of more than 55 people who served on that national committee, correct? 
A.	Well, I'm not familiar with that figure of 55.  
Q.	It's true, is it not, that the national committee was comprised of four members elected from each préfecture for a total of 44, plus the president of the MRND from each préfecture, adding another 11, making 55, correct? 
A.	No.  I think that is an incorrect calculation.  The préfectoral president or chairman of the MRND were appointed, if I remember, by -- well, at least at Kigali urban préfecture, it was one of the members of the party steering committee.  For example, in Kigali, Mathieu was president -- chairman of MRND, but in the Kigali urban préfecture, he was also a member of the party's steering committee.  He'd been appointed by four people.  I was one of those who appointed him -- sorry, who elected him.  We elected him to be a member of the MRND steering committee.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We're talking now about steering committees.  I'm sorry, has this got anything to do with the executive committee?  It's not clear.  I'm sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I think it would be useful for you to refer to the statute of the MRND and if you could be shown Exhibit D. NG2, and I'll direct your attention to article 53.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of interest, Mr. Robinson, what was the tab number for that?  I don't have -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't believe that that was in the tabs. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't in the tabs?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I don't believe so.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Robinson, just before you proceed, just to get the record straight, the last comment by the interpreter from my record seems to have been attributed to the witness.  So I'd like to the record to be clear where the interpreter said, "We're talking now steering committees.  I'm sorry.  Has this got anything to do with executive committee?  It's not clear." 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, sir, that was my interjection.  I'm sorry.  
JUDGE SHORT: 
Could the record reflect this is the comment of the interpreter and not the witness?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Absolutely.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, turning to article 53, do you see that that article contains the composition of the national committee members? 
A.	Yes, I see the article, and I read its contents. 
Q.	And it indicates that among the members are the chairman of the movement, and that would be the president of the MRND, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And then the chairman of the movement in the préfecture, so that would be the 11 MRND presidents, one for each préfecture, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then it says, "Militants of the movement elected by the national congress for a renewable five-year term.  Their numbers shall be determined by the national congress upon the recommendation of the chairman of the movement."  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written. 
Q.	And you told us that that number was four, there were four people elected by the national congress from each préfecture, correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness assents. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And then there's the chairman of the movement's parliamentary group and the national secretary of the movement, who are also members of the national committee, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- 
THE WITNESS:
That is what is stipulated in this article.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, if would be useful if you repeated the question.  The chairman of what?  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	The chairman of the movement's parliamentary group and then the national secretary of the movement, they're also included in the membership of the national committee; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is what is written. 
Q.	And so is it not true that according to the statutes of the MRND, the national committee would comprise more than 55 people? 
A.	I don't know if I made a mistake.  I said 44, you said 55.  I don't know which of us is mistaken.  For example, take the example of Kigali urban préfecture.  There was the MRND chairman, the préfet of Kigali urban -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is asking the -- the witness to start again.  There is some degree of confusion.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the interpreters have requested that you start your answer again as they had difficulty following you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  So this is the answer -- my answer to the question:  I said, perhaps I'm mistaken.  I spoke of 44, counsel is speaking of 55, so I'm wondering whether it's correct, because from what I know, the chairman -- MRND chairman in Kigali préfecture was elected by the congress to be a member of the national committee, so he represented Kigali urban préfecture.  He was also party chairman, so he had two roles.  He was a member of number 2 and number 3.  So you could see a person would be present at two levels.  

What is -- the counsel is saying -- on the basis of what counsel is saying, the figure would be 55, but you mustn't forget that a person might be present at two levels.  What I can answer -- what I can add -- no, Counsel, maybe I'll stop there.  That is the clarification I wanted to make. 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Sherri Knox)
































1015H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you.  
A.	Thank you, too. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that the president of the MRND at the level of the préfecture also served on what was known as the MRND political bureau, which comprised the 11 presidents and the four members of the executive committee, correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. When one gets into this exercise, one can easily make mistakes.  The important thing is to know which part each person played. 
Q.	Exactly, and Mr. Nzirorera was not the president of the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture, and, so, during the period of April 1992 to July 1993 he would not have served on the MRND political bureau, correct? 
A.	But he was a member of the national committee.  Maybe he wasn't a member of the political bureau, but he was a member of the national committee. 
Q.	That's correct, and that would make him one of either 44 or 55 people holding that post, correct? 
A.	Yes, he was a member of the national committee. 
Q.	And that would have made him one of 44 or 55 people holding that post, correct? 
A.	Absolutely. 
Q.	Now, you also testified, incorrectly I might add, about the identity of the members of the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe.  And I'm going to ask that you be shown three exhibits from the Prosecution which correctly lists the identity of those members, and that's Exhibits P. 9, P. 10 and 
	P. 13.
MR. WEBSTER:
The last page of P. 13 would satisfy Mr. Robinson's concerns and we could avoid the issue of possibly violating the protective order.  It's not a big deal, but I think that would make things much simpler.
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think two other witnesses have identified Exhibit P. 9 as containing the key members of the national Interahamwe, so I think it would be better for the record if the witness takes a look at that.  

Mr. Issa, if you could put all three exhibits in front of the witness, please.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, document P. 9 has been identified in this trial as containing an accurate list of the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe and Exhibits P. 10 and P. 13, which are also before you, have been identified as letters signed by each member of the national committee of the Interahamwe, and they are the same.  And so having seen those documents, I would like to ask you whether or not -- do you see P. 9, do you see also the signatures on the two letters, P. 10 and P. 13?  
A.	Yes, I see the signatures. 
Q.	So can we agree that the testimony you gave on Monday, that among the officers of the Interahamwe provisional national committee were Aloys Ngirabatware, N-G-I-R-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E; Joseph Setiba, S-E-T-I-B-A; Claude Nshime -- I don't actually have the spelling of that, but perhaps the witness can provide that -- André Nzabanterura, Epimaqne Uwizeyimana, and Seraphin Twahirwa were not, in fact, members of the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	Counsel, I should like to know when this document was produced.  I see no date.  I cannot be sure whether the membership ever changed, because I see there's a figure 0075, but nothing else.  So, is it a list of the members at the outset, in the beginning or subsequently?  
Q.	Thank you for your question, Witness ALG.  That's a good question.  That list was prepared by the Prosecution, and it has been testified by two members of the national committee that those were the members at the outset and that the members never changed until they went into exile in July 1994.  So I think you can rely on that list.
MR. WEBSTER:
This is an inappropriate way to put this issue to the witness, to suggest that this is a list of the Prosecution and therefore that is going to vouch for its accuracy.  I think the appropriate question to ask is, looking at that list, if he wants to change around his answer, correct it, I mean, the witness asked a very reasonable question and the response coming from Mr. Robinson does a disservice to this particular point.  So, I'm objecting to the form of the question.
MR. ROBINSON:  
I wonder if Mr. Webster could indicate whether he has any dispute that this list contains true and correct names of the officers of the national Interahamwe committee from the time of its inception until the time they went into exile?  If that is disputed, then we can deal with these nuances.  So, if it's not disputed, it is simply a tactic that is of no force.
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not a question of tactics, it's a question of the proper way to elicit testimony from the witness.  That is my only concern.  This is a minor point, but I'm trying to send a signal that the way the question should be put to the witness should assess his understanding of the factual scenario and compare his ability.  It is not to indicate to the witness that there is a correct answer and that his answer is not in conformity with it.  So, I'm asking Mr. Robinson to be careful with the way he puts questions to the witness, so that we don't have a repetition of this way of asking questions.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, from the documents that are before you, can we agree that the six names that you mentioned do not appear as officers of the national -- or advisers of the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Counsel, the names of those people are not on this list.  But let me put a question to you, the date of this list, because I know that membership of a committee, any committee, can be changed.  I know that there were members of this committee -- in '92 and in '94 there was a change in the membership of the committee, which is why I should like to know on what date this list was produced.  There's no signature.  The name of the person who drafted this list is not mentioned. 
Q.	Well, again, Witness ALG, I told you that two members of the committee have testified here in this courtroom -- have seen that list, and have testified that the membership on that list did not change from the inception of the Interahamwe until they went into exile in 1994.  So that's the answer to your question.  Now, you seem to be saying that contrary to the testimony of these two Prosecution witnesses, who were themselves members of this committee, that you have information that the membership of the national committee did change.  Is that your testimony? 
A.	Counsel, I think I have provided sufficient explanation as to this document you've shown me.  I said, yes, it's true, the names are not here, but I put the question as to when this list was produced to know whether it is credible or not.  You said that two people came here, testified as to who was a member of the national committee, but each one -- everyone is responsible for what he himself has said.  So those people are only committing themselves. 
Q.	And so just to nail down what you are saying, is it true that you are saying that, based upon your information, that these persons, Ngirabatware, Setiba, Nshime, Nzabanterura, Uwizeyimana and Twahirwa, were members of the national committee of the Interahamwe at some point?  Is that your testimony under oath? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I should like to say I was saying one has to look at the documents.  One can forget.  I did each time say that I wasn't absolutely sure.  Maybe I made a mistake in the names.  Please forgive me.  I agree that I can't (sic) make mistakes, but that was the information given to me, just as you were informed you were given this document.  
Q.	Witness, we will accept that you made a mistake.  That's my job here, to assist in bringing out the truth.  So it is no problem, and I thank you for that.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time would you like to take your morning recess?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes this is a convenient time for the morning break, about 15 minutes.  
(Court was recessed from 1032H to 1104H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you can continue.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I would now like to turn your attention to the meetings or meeting that you told us about in which the members of the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville were introduced to Mr. Kajuga and Turatsinze, which you placed in the beginning of February 1992.  And, first of all, can you tell us was this meeting held at the building of Veneste Rubangura, that`s R-U-B-A-N-G-U-R-A? 
A.	You are right, Counsel.  The meeting was held in Veneste Rubangura's office. R-U-B-A-N-G-U-R-A. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And was the meeting -- were the meetings of the préfectoral committee held on Wednesday evenings at that time? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, after 3:30 p.m. most times. 
Q.	Now, at this meeting in February of 1992 did Mr. Ngirumpatse make any statements calling for the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	No, he didn't say such a thing at that time. 
Q.	And, indeed, at that time there were Tutsi who were members of the préfectoral committee of Kigali and Tutsis who were members of the Interahamwe, correct? 
A.	Yes, there were some who were members of the Kigali préfectoral committee and others were members of the national -- of the Interahamwe's provisional national committee.
JUDGE SHORT:
When you asked whether at this meeting in February of 1992, whether there -- is it Nzirorera --
MR. ROBINSON:
Ngirumpatse.
JUDGE SHORT:
-- Ngirumpatse made statements concerning the extermination of Tutsis, now, the witness said that -- was it just one meeting that was held each month?  There were several meetings a month, right?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Correct.
JUDGE SHORT:
So when you say at "this meeting," which of the meetings are you referring to?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, I was referring to the meeting at which Mr. Kajuga and Turatsinze had been introduced to the préfectoral committee on one occasion the witness stated occurred at the beginning of February 1992.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because you didn't qualify your statement in that manner.
MR. ROBINSON:
I can do that.  Thank you very much.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, directing your attention, Witness ALG, to the meeting in which Kajuga and Turatsinze were present in early February 1992, did Mr. Ngirumpatse make any statements at that meeting calling for the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	No, he didn't say any such thing on that occasion.  It was a meeting of the préfectoral committee, Kigali urban préfecture in Rwanda, when we spoke of meetings.  We had to differentiate between rallies and meetings.  Meetings -- rallies involved everyone, but that was a meeting of the Kigali urban préfectoral committee.  And on that occasion Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not incite people to kill the Tutsi. 
Q.	Indeed, in February of 1992 it was impossible for any MRND leader to make such a public statement at an MRND meeting, correct? 
A.	Well, it depends, but what I can say is that on that occasion there was -- the question of exterminating the Tutsi did not arise. 
Q.	And it's also true, is it not, that on that occasion there was no discussion about acquiring axes for the Interahamwe.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm concerned about the form of this question, and my concern echos what Judge Short said a moment ago, that the assumption of the question is that there was a once a week meeting when we know that there were more than that.  This witness is talking about one specific meeting.  Can we rephrase the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, he is asking about a particular meeting.  He identified the meeting.
MR. WEBSTER:
My mistake, then.  I'm sorry.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, directing your attention to the meeting where Mr. Kajuga and Mr. Turatsinze were present at the préfectoral meeting in February 1, 92, was there any discussion about the Interahamwe acquiring axes?  
A.	No, that item was not on the agenda.  It was not discussed. 
Q.	And in February 1992, was it necessary for a person to undergo military training in order to join the Interahamwe?  
A.	No, at that time that was not the practice.  There was no military training for Interahamwe at that time. 
Q.	Are you acquainted with a man named Ahmed Mbonunkiza, A-H-M-E-D, M-B-O-N-U-N-K-I-Z-A? 
A.	I knew him, but in a general way. 
Q.	Was he in attendance at any meeting of the MRND préfectoral meetings for Kigali, that you know of? 
A.	I did not know him at that time. 
Q.	Do you know of any office Mr. Mbonunkiza ever held with the youth of the MRND, whether it be the Interahamwe or an entity known as the JMRND? 
A.	Counsel, I've just told you that at that time I did not know that person. 
Q.	Did you ever hear any information about a plot to kill Ahmed Mbonunkiza? 
A.	Again, I should like to tell you, Counsel, that I did not know that person at that time. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask that the answers and testimony of Witness ALG be considered as supplement to the motion filed on the 29th of May and still pending before the Trial Chamber concerning Mr. Mbonunkiza and request he be investigated for false testimony at this trial.
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, I'm not going to respond to that substantively, but I find it inappropriate to make that kind of motion in the middle of this witness's testimony.  If the Court could give an instruction to Defence, specifically Mr. Robinson, that we are here to take testimony of witnesses and not engage in oral motions, I think there was a practice -- directive describing the way motions should be handled.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you are entitled to make applications such as the one you made if you wish, but we don't think that doing it as part of your cross-examination is appropriate.  It may have an adverse impact upon the particular function you are doing now.  We disapprove of it.
MR. ROBINSON:
Would you prefer, then, I file a written submission attaching the transcript?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not necessarily.  We're not trying to be technical.  We are saying that it affects what you are doing in an adverse manner, so you can make it orally, but not when you are in the middle of your examination.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I want to turn now to the matter of Léon Mugesera and his speech in November of 1992.  You testified that you believed that at that time Mr. Mugesera worked at the national secretariat of the MRND, and you gave that testimony on the 26th of October in this courtroom at page 56, and I want to suggest to you that you are in error in that testimony, that, in fact, Mr. Mugesera had worked at the national secretariat during the single-party era of the MRND but had later gone on to be employed in the ministry of higher education.  And at the time of his speech, he was an employee of the ministry of family affairs headed by Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  Now, in light of what I have said, do you stand by your testimony that at the time he made this speech he was working for the MRND national secretariat? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It is possible to err.  I know that Mugesera worked at the national secretariat when it was part of the single-party system,*********************.  But, after the advent of multiparty politics, I know that Mugesera continued to work at the national secretariat.  But, as far as we are concerned,******************************.  So, I don't know whether I erred.  What I know is he was a member of the préfectoral committee in Gisenyi.  Of course I did not yet work with him.  ***************** *********************************************, but we would meet and talk.  So I don't know if he was still at the national secretariat or whether he also had changed jobs. 
Q.	And at the time of Mr. Mugesera's speech in November of 1992, we can agree, can we not, that Mr. Nzirorera was not a member of the MRND national executive committee, correct? 
A.	No, Counsel, he was a member of the national committee, that I know.  He was a member of the national committee. 
Q.	He was a member of the national committee, but was not a member of the national executive bureau composed of the President, secretary-general and the two vice presidents, correct? 
A.	You are right, Counsel.  At that time he was not yet a member of the national executive bureau. 
Q.	I'm going to read an excerpt from a letter that you wrote to this Tribunal on the 18th of May 2004.  We have it in handwriting from you and, if necessary, it can be shown to you.  Because in this letter, when you spoke in Paragraph 2A of the letter, as examples of messages and other acts and conducts inciting ethnic hatred and discord among the population, you spoke of the speech of Mugesera and you said that, following the speech, the préfectoral MRND committee, in which you were a member, held a meeting in Kigali to denounce and condemn the content of the speech and that you recommended to the executive bureau of the MRND, composed of Mathiu Ngirumpatse, president; Édouard Karemera; Ferdinand Kabegama and Joseph Nzirorera to make an official statement condemning this message and distancing the MRND from the speech of Mugesera, and this had never been done.  So can we agree that you were in error to claim that at the time of Mr. Mugesera's speech Mr. Nzirorera had any function as a member of the national executive bureau?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, can you remind us of the date?  
MR. ROBINSON:
The 18th of May 2004.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, unless I'm mistaken, when I was read back the context of the document on the 
30th of August 2005 -- when they read back to me my various statements for me to comment on, it was on the 30th of August, regarding the document that I signed on the 1st of September 2005.  In that document it is specified that I made a correction at that place.  I stated afresh who the members of the national committee were.  I made a corrigendum.  I spoke of Juvénal Habyarimana, the president; the first vice-president, Édouard Karemera; second vice-president, Ferdinand Kabagema; and Mathieu Ngirumpatse was the national secretary.  Check that document carefully, it was read back to me and I signed it.  The title of the document is "Witness Statement of 30th August," unless I made a mistake.
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Yes, I can check that, but we are in agreement that your statement of May 2004 was in error when you indicated Mr. Nzirorera was a member of the executive bureau at the time of Mugesera's speech, correct?  
A.	Yes, there was a mistake that I corrected subsequently in the document I just referred to. 
Q.	And I suggest to you, Witness ALG, that you have yet made another mistake because at that time, in the executive bureau of the MRND, the first vice-president was not Édouard Karemera but was Amandin Rugiara, A-M-A-N-D-I-N, R-U-G-I-A-R-A, is that not correct? 
A.	No, no, I do not think you're right, but in any case, Karemera was one of the vice presidents -- vice-chairmen of MRND.  I don't know whether he was first or second, but he had been appointed by the April congress in 1992.  I took part in the congress, and I know that he was a member of the national executive committee. 
Q.	Witness ALG, after the speech of Léon Mugesera, did you ever have a private meeting with Mr. Ngirumpatse in his office in which you expressed your concern over the speech of Mr. Mugesera? 
A.	I do not remember very well, but I know that subsequently I would meet Mathieu, but I don't know if we discussed that topic or not. 
Q.	So, do you have any recollection of attending a meeting with Jean Habyarimana, Gabriel Mbariyehe, M-B-A-R-I-Y-E-H-E, Andre Karekeke in the office of Mr. Ngirumpatse in which the group of you expressed your concern over Mr. Mugesera's speech?  
A.	I don't really remember that very well, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now I want to turn to the period of February 1993.  There was an attack, was there not, by the RPF on the 8th of February 1993? 
A.	I remember that in that same month of February 1993 people said such an attack had taken place in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	And that attack caused insecurity in Kigali as well, did it not?  
A.	No, it was not apparent.  The security situation was not as disturbed as all that in Kigali.  I know that after the attack there was a rally led by Mathiu Ngirumpatse, secretary-general of the MRND party at that time, and that rally was held after the attack. 
Q.	Isn't it true, Witness ALG, that on the 10th of February 1993 a curfew was imposed in Kigali as a result of the RPF attack in which they came close to the city limits of Kigali? 
A.	I do not remember that curfew being imposed.  I do not believe that a curfew was ever imposed in Kigali and even if there was one, I don't remember.  Whatever the case may be, I do not recall.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may the witness be shown document number one in my group of exhibits which was filed with the registry on Monday?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, what I have placed before you appears to be -- Witness ALG what was placed before you appears to be a three-page regulation issued by the préfet of Kigali on the 10th of February 1993.  Would you agree? 
A.	Yes, it is written that this document is drafted on the 10th of February 1993. 
Q.	And does it not also indicate on the first page that, considering the flagrant violation of the ceasefire by the RPF Inkotanyi on the 8th of February and considering the massive infiltration of elements of the RPF, which are difficult to identify, that the security committee for Kigali préfecture had met on the 
	8th and 9th of February 1993 and thereafter adopted certain measures which are specified in articles 1 through 7, including a curfew in the city of Kigali? 
A.	That is possible.  I had forgotten those facts. 
Q.	But given your position*****************************, this is clearly something you were aware of in 1993, was it not? 
A.	Yes, of course.  I admit that fact.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask this document be exhibited document D. NZ177.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no objection, but I'm curious as to what the evidentiary basis for admitting the document is.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I believe the witness indicated the curfew was imposed and the document does have the signature of the préfet of Kigali at this time, but if you would like me to give more foundation I can do that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the real objection has to be the number, 174 exhibits that we have to read.  Now, the witness has admitted, so what's the purpose for the document?  He's agreed the curfew was imposed.
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  Two things, number one, to show perhaps to other witnesses who will come concerning the infiltrations and the security situation that existed in the préfecture; and, secondly, because this is a document that is an official record of the préfecture that has some historical and probative value that should be part of the record.
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, the other reasons for which you want to tender the document are not relevant at the present moment.  Why don't you wait until the appropriate time, and then you could tender the document.  So far as the imposition of the curfew is concerned, the witness has agreed, so there is no need for the document at this stage.
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, as far as we're concerned, it is true that the witness has agreed to the imposition of the curfew, but the fact of the existence of this document, like other documents in evidence, is significant and we think the document should be admitted.  If you don't want to rely upon it during your deliberation, that's perfectly your right, but as part of the record we are trying to make a historical record of exactly what happened in Rwanda during this time, and we think we are entitled to rely on authentic documents as well as oral testimony.
JUDGE SHORT:
The President pointed out everything that we admit we have to read, and so if, on the record, the witness has admitted an allegation or a point you have put to him, then I don't see the point of entering the document.  If at a later stage it becomes necessary to enter this document for one reason or another, that is different.
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, for example, the witness said there was no insecurity in Kigali during this time, and I just read from this document that there was insecurity, and that was the reasons for the curfew.  It is stated in the document.  So I'm reading from a document, the document ought to be in evidence.  And I don't see the harm to anybody if the document is in evidence.  This is the way we've been proceeding in the trial throughout, to document what happened in Rwanda through official records, as well as oral testimony.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't quite agree that that's the way we have been proceeding because 20 minutes ago I suggested that we admit the full transcripts of the event that took place on the 16th of January, and it was opposed by the Defence.  So I think we need an even-handed approach responding directly to Mr. Robinson's submissions.  The witness modified his answer, so there is nothing that needs to be documented through this exhibit.  I'm not opposed to allowing official documents on the record, but I share the Court's concern.  If we are adopting the approach that all official documents should come in because they help us to reconstruct the history, then that approach has to be even-handed, and when I make a motion to admit the full transcripts of an event that is central to this case, I don't see why it should be objected to.  There should be a consistent approach.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen, please.  We are trying to cut out this type of argument.  We are running a trial now.  We are not a truth commission.  That's the point.  There is no thing to contradict this witness anymore because when shown the document he admitted that he had made an error, and he modified his answer.  And so the record -- that's the state of the record.  If at some future stage another witness needs this document, perhaps it may be necessary to admit the document, but at this point in time the information you are seeking has already been satisfactorily addressed.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we have been referring to a document.  It seems important that this document should be part of the court record.  Simply to refer to a document, have the witness then admit the document is correct, and state orally, why don't we take out Sindikubwabo's speech too, then, and speeches that the witnesses themselves described if you don't want to clutter the record?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem is Sindikubwabo's speech is a contention by the Defence that the language of the speech is not clear of supporting the meaning, that it was justified, so we need to read the speech.  There is a reason for entering these speeches.
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But in this case here, the witness has acknowledged that what is in the document is correct and he has modified his answer.  So there is no reason for entering it at this point, except for the point that you raised.  And I think that it is time for us the draw a distinction between the truth commission and a trial where we are trying to focus on the issues that are really important in issue.  This fact is no longer in issue where this witness is concerned.  It may be that another witness may need to be cross-examined on this particular fact.  And if that witness denies -- first comes the denial, then that would be a reason for putting the document on the record, because it will assist us in evaluating the reliability of the testimony, but this point has been overcome by the witness's acknowledgment of the accuracy of the document and the modification of his answer.  So there is no longer -- if there are other issues of dispute, you may explore them, but at the moment the dispute has been (unintelligible).
MR. ROBINSON:
I think it is a mistake not to admit documentary evidence when it is relevant in a trial.  When those of us researching the Nuremberg trials go looking through to see what was happening and what happened would look at that type of material, so I don't see why you would take away from the record.  You are not obligated to deal with it in your judgement, but when a document is referred to and produced, it ought to be part of the proceedings.  And for historical purposes, it is not necessarily a truth commission but it is not a very good way of dealing with a trial of historical significance to let documents be referred to then not be available as part of the record.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, for what you are doing, you can mark it for identification and come back to it in your cross.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask that it be marked Exhibit ID NZ31.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, in addition to the curfew that was imposed in Kigali after the RPF attack of February 1993, is it also not true that 13 political parties got together in March of 1993 and made a declaration in which, among other things, they called for the establishment of a civil defence? 
A.	I do not remember that, Counsel, but, with your leave, I would like to make a comment on the document that you have just handed to me.  Thank you.  Now, I do recognise this document, but if you refer to Article 5 of the document, for example, it was the period of the end of the curfew was not mentioned.  So, if we do not take care, we might fall into the trap when talking, for example, of article 5, where it says that, "All demonstrations in public areas and public meetings of a political nature are provisionally suspended," one could use this article as a pretext to say that no demonstrations or rallies were held and the date ending the end of the curfew was not specified.  I told you that there was not that much insecurity within Kigali town and that rallies were held nonetheless.  That is the comment that I wanted to make, in order for Article 5 not to be taken as a pretext for people to say that no political gathering or demonstrations occurred. 
Q.	Witness ALG, I think that is an example of something you shouldn't be doing as part of your role here.  If the Prosecutor thinks that role was important, they could bring that up, but it is not necessary for you to be perusing these documents and engaging in a debate on points.  That was not necessary, in my opinion, for you to do that and it will prolong your stay here in Arusha for you to continue to do that.  So, with all respect, I would ask you to refrain from making such points in the future.
MR. ROBINSON:
But I do think, Mr. President, in light of the additional references to this document, it should now be admitted because it we will not be understandable to the public to be referring to articles of the document without having the document read in an inaccessible manner.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Why not (unintelligible), if you are going to use his answer as a basis for admitting the document?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I asked him not to do that again but I haven't (unintelligible).
MR. WEBSTER:
I have an objection to the direction that Mr. Robinson is giving to the witness, because he can't have it both ways.  I mean, I hesitate to keep jumping up because I know the Court wants to hear testimony, not legal argument, but it is not appropriate for Mr. Robinson to give that instruction to this witness, particularly in light of how this issue has developed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, let's move on for now.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, going back to my question before your comment, I had asked you whether or not you were aware that, as a result of this insecurity that 13 political parties had come together on the 
	2nd of March 1993 and issued a declaration which, among other things, called for the establishment of civil defence? 
A.	I did not know that, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm going to ask that you be shown Exhibit D. NZ82.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel Robinson, may the interpreters please have access to that exhibit, please?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I've been asked by the interpreters to have access to the exhibit.  It was admitted at one point, copies were given to everyone.  That document was an exhibit in another session.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't have a copy.
MR. ROBINSON:
If they look in their collection of documents it would be available to them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I'm not being prerogative but you couldn't expect the interpreters to walk with a volume of exhibits that have already been admitted.  I'm certain they wouldn't have it.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, in the future I'll provide copies of previously entered exhibits.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, we are not necessarily trying to create additional paper.  That's not my point.  If people knew in advance what you were going to do they might be able to issue the documents themselves, I'm not trying to suggest that money and time and material should be wasted.  Sometimes notice is sufficient.
MR. ROBINSON:
Would you like me to give a list of which documents I intend to use during my examination?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can't make a directive of that nature.  One has to think about it a bit.  You can think about it, as well.  I'm not making a directive now.  I wouldn't like to be forced to make a directive just like that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, directing your attention to Exhibit D. NZ82, do you see that is a declaration of 13 political parties, all the political parties in Rwanda except for the RPF, of the 2nd of March 1993? 
(Pages 19 to 31 by R. Lear)






















1200H 
BY MR. ROBINSON (continued):
Q.	Witness ALG, have you now had a chance to see that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  I have just read through the document, and I would like to ask you if I might provide a comment on the subject of this document.  I thank you, Counsel.  

I can see that it is indeed a declaration, but I do not remember when this was broadcast over the radio.  But in the *******************field, we were never informed of such a declaration.  Moreover, I asked myself the question, why, as you can see, the signatories to the document did not specify the posts that they occupied within their parties.  I do not know whether they were simple members or whether they were people occupying posts of leaders.  

For example, if we look at number 1, Jean-Baptiste Ndarihoranye, who was the representative of the MRND party, we did not know that person as being a leader of the MRND party at national level.  But what I have just said does not mean that this document should not be considered as being valid.  That is the comment that I wanted to make on the subject of this document.  
Q.	Well, Witness ALG, since you have given us so much information about affairs of the MRND and the Interahamwe and you seem to be so well informed about the meetings and goings-on of the party, are you telling you us that this is the first time that you've heard that in 1993, in the month of March, 13 political parties had come together and issued a declaration.  Is this the first you're hearing of it?  
A.	Counsel, I told you that I did not remember that.  I don't know whether anything was broadcast about it over the radio.  But we ********************were never informed of the existence of any such declaration, nor were we ever invited to comment on any such declaration.  
Q.	Now, the declaration itself indicates that, considering the situation in the country as a result of the violation of the ceasefire by the RPF-Inkotanyi, the political parties made certain recommendations, and number 6 of those recommendations was to invite the government to engage and organise, for the population, a civil defence for the country.  And, as you can see, the document is signed by representatives of all of the political parties and even two priests.  And I ask you, Witness ALG, whether or not the idea of a civil defence programme to combat the attacks and infiltration by the RPF was, in fact, a legitimate idea.  
A.	I will reiterate the answer I gave you before.  I said that the declaration was never presented to us, we who were*************************.  So to put such a concern to me would be to invite me to make comments on a document that I have never had any knowledge of.  
Q.	Well, my question, to put it again to you, Witness ALG, was whether the idea of a civil defence in Rwanda, in light of the attack and infiltration by the RPF, was a legitimate idea.  
A.	Well, yes, perhaps it was a legitimate idea.  But, as I have explained, civil defence did not do what it was supposed to do.  Moreover, that declaration was never submitted to us so that we might examine it and see what -- it was necessary to do and how to proceed.  So it is a surprise for me.  I cannot make any comments on that declaration which has just been presented to me at this very moment.  
Q.	Now, it has been your testimony that in the month of March 1993 that you were informed by Préfet Renzaho that military training would be given to the Interahamwe; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And I wonder if you could tell us at which location this meeting took place at which you were informed of the military training.  
A.	I think I explained -- answered where we were.  The préfet invited a handful of people, *************** *******************************who were MRND members, of course.  He just didn't invite anyone.  And he told us the top authorities of the MRND and of the army had agreed that the national army should dispense training to some Interahamwe so that they might fight the RPF, support the army in fighting the RPF, should the RPF attack.  They should protect Kigali.  

And he told us that it should be kept a secret, that the opposition parties should not know of it before it took place.  So he told us it shouldn't be a surprise to us to see some people in the secteurs or in the communes going for that training.  That's what he told us.  And, indeed, that was in March, but I did not know where the idea came from.  Since you have presented this document to me, maybe it was subsequent to that declaration.  
Q.	Did this meeting take place in the préfet's office or in a conference room?  Where in the préfecture did this meeting take place?  
A.	We were in his office, a handful of people,*******************. 
Q.	And can you tell us the names of those people who were present, besides yourself and Préfet Renzaho?  
A.	I do not recall very well.  I don't remember everyone.  Please forgive me.  But I will try to remember.  I think that when I was invited there were*********************************************.  I think Gabriel -- Gabriel Mbyareyehe, spelled M-B-Y-A-R-E-Y-E-H-E.  I'm trying to refresh my memory because your question is a bit unexpected.  I think that Amri Karekezi, counselor for Biryogo secteur, was also present.  Karekezi is spelled K-A-R-A-K-E-Z-I.  Biryogo is spelled B-I-R-Y-O-G-O, B-I-R-Y-O-G-O.  I don't remember who***********************, but I know that at that time I was there with those two people.  And, subsequently, he invited other people, but only MRND people were invited.  
Q.	And can you tell us the names of other people who were in attendance at this meeting who were told that military training was beginning in March of 1993?  
A.	Counsel, I told you he invited small groups of people.  When I was invited, I was with the people whose names I just gave you.  But, subsequently, he invited other small groups.  I know that the bourgmestre of Kacyiru told me that he had been invited, and he was with conseiller (sic) from secteur in his commune.  The bourgmestre's name was Nyilikwaya, Claver.  Nyilikwaya is spelled N-Y-I-L-I-K-W-A-Y-A, and Kacyiru is spelled K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  Another group of counsellors was invited -- of conseillers was invited, but I don't remember the names of the people in that group. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, Pierre Claver Nyilikwaya, is deceased; is that correct?  
A.	I don't know, Counsel.  
Q.	And do you know whether or not Gabriel Mbyareyehe is still alive today?  
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	But it's your testimony that you were informed by the préfet in March of 1993 that the army would be training the Interahamwe; correct?  
A.	Yes, that's what he told us.  You say he said to me, but I wasn't the only one present.  I was with other people.  So we were all told that the army was preparing to dispense the training and the army had consulted with the top people in the MRND.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness please be shown Exhibit D. NG. 37, which is a prior statement he made on the****** *************?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could you give us the date of that statement, for the record?  I realise it's in evidence, but I don't have it recorded in that way.  
MR. ROBINSON:
The*****************.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, what has been placed in front of you includes a handwritten and a typewritten version of the statement you made as an annex to your confession of the******************; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And this is a lengthy document and I -- it was submitted to the court which would be judging you; correct?  
A.	That is possible, Counsel.  
Q.	And it was an important document for you, was it not?  
A.	At the time when I drafted it, Counsel.  
Q.	And it was, in fact, the first detailed statement you had given to the Rwandan authorities about your knowledge of the events of 1994, apart from answering the specific things that you were charged with; correct?  
A.	I don't remember very well, Counsel.  It wasn't my first document, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, as far as the documents that we have been provided with on -- from your dossier, it appears that from 1998 to 2000, you had appeared periodically to answer questions from the public prosecutor; and that then on the*******************, you had taken the initiative to make a confession for those things that you had done wrong; and that three days later on the**********************, you submitted this document, which appears, at least to me, to be the first document in which you accused others of various acts in Rwanda.  Would that be correct?  
A.	I won't say that everything you have said is correct, because it wasn't the first time that I was confessing to the acts I committed, because, as I told you, since the ****************1998 -- after the **************1998, before the public prosecutor, I did confess to the crimes I committed and begged for forgiveness because I had not been able to protect the people I was supposed to protect.  I've told you that here recently, and each time I would repeat it.

And on the************************, I drafted a letter in response to one Nsengiyumva, who worked at the public prosecutor's office -- the state prosecutor's office, who had asked me to draft a letter to explain to the state prosecutor what were my functions from April to July 1994 during the genocide.  In that letter, I said that I confessed to the crimes I committed and begged for forgiveness.  It was subsequent to that that I drafted the document you just shown to me, as well as all the other documents that you know of.  

After the present document, I drafted another document where I set forth those events I had forgotten, which is the practice in Rwanda.  Whenever you have information on what happened, you are always invited to share that information.  And if you draft a confession and subsequently realise that some things -- you'd omitted certain things, when it comes to imploring forgiveness each time something springs to mind -- every time you have a recollection, you can say what it is.  

In the document I'd forgotten to clarify certain events -- or, if I thought that I had to add something because if -- I felt mentioning certain things would not help me at that time doesn't mean I couldn't mention later.  I think it was on the****************************.  I'm explaining to you, Counsel, so do forgive if I'm lost in the details.  

But I think that before that period, as regards Renzaho and the other leaders, I don't think that I wanted to directly incriminate them.  I didn't want to say the truth as to what they had done.  But, subsequently, I realised that it was necessary to speak the whole truth and I began to speak of everything, which is why in**************, I drafted a confession in which I explained the role that Tharcisse Renzaho, préfet of Kigali-urban préfecture -- the role he played during the genocide; and I also spoke of the other people who had committed genocidal acts.  

I think now I've explained everything to you, Counsel.  When each time -- whenever I feel it is necessary, for example, at Gacaca hearings, I give information each time.  When I remember something that I've forgotten to mention, I mention it.  And when I'm invited to make a written statement, I do so.  I think I've answered your question, Counsel.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  That answer has taken us well beyond our lunchtime adjournment, so I'll continue when we'll resume.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our luncheon break now.  

And, Mr. Witness, I give you your usual reminder.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
	(Court recessed from 1233H to1408H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, good afternoon.  

Mr. Robinson, we understand that you wanted to address us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, at this time I would like to take the opportunity, without the witness being present, that I had attempted to take during his testimony concerning the pending motion to investigate Ahmed Mbonyunkiza.  And I simply want to ask you to consider, as supplementary material to the motion that's already pending before you, the testimony that you heard from this witness this morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'll give my standard response.  This is a motion that I'm acquainted with from Mr. Robinson.  He makes it almost for every witness, but our position is that inconsistencies in the witness's statements and his inconsistency from one witness to another does -- does not make out a case of perjury, and I would ask the Court to refrain from -- from granting his application.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we'll consider this when we're considering the motion. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And, Mr. President, may I enquire what is our schedule for tomorrow?  Since you're talking about deliberating on motions, I thought, perhaps, we could use the day tomorrow to deliberate on that and other motions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We did intend to -- we have been thinking about not sitting tomorrow for the purpose of dealing with two motions.  This was not the list that we had -- on our schedule, but motions we felt would have had an impact on the admission of evidence, which we thought were important to adjudicate on as quickly as possible.

Have we agreed?  We've agreed; right?  Well, we have agreed; right?

Yeah, I think I could say now, because we had not formally agreed before, but we will not be sitting tomorrow. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I do that this motion regarding Mr. Mbonyunkiza's testimony would have a deterrent effect on perjury from other witnesses, so I would ask you to put that on your list of priorities.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you bring in the witness now?  
	(Witness entered the courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon to you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your examination will continue now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I'm going to continue on the topic of the meeting that you claim to have attended in March of 1993 in the office of the préfet at which you claim that you were informed that military training of Interahamwe would be beginning.  And I would like to read to you from your statement of ***********************, and if -- do you still have that in front of you?  From the -- 
A.	I have the document before me, Counsel.  
Q.	So on the typewritten version on that document in French, this begins on page 3.  In the English, it's page 2, the second full paragraph, and it starts with the words "Still on the same subject.  I would like to mention that the Interahamwes had reportedly received military training in Gabiro prior to 6 April 1994 as a result of collaboration between the ministry of defence and MRND's national secretariat.  All this was done in absolute secrecy, and even I" -- and then it says what your position was -- "as a" -- and I'm going to leave that out so we don't reveal your identity -- "and even I learned about it only later."  And then you go on to say that "Kabando" (phonetic) -- one of the people who is trained and who is currently detained with you -- "says that he was trained so that he could fight with soldiers against the RPF, should the RPF resume hostilities."  And so would you agree with me, Witness ALG, that when you discussed the military training in the annex to your confession on the************ **************, you made no mention of your meeting with Préfet Renzaho and, in fact, you claim that you only learned about the military training later? 
A.	Counsel, it was the****************, not the 3rd of August.  That is what I said, and that is what is in the documents before me.  I believe I had explained that.  I told you -- actually, I had forgotten that the préfet had discussed about it to us, so subsequently I remembered that he had told us.  So when you realise that you had forgotten something and when you remember the thing, then you can mention it.  That is what I did, and I did that in the statement I told you about.
Q.	Now, what is the case, Witness ALG?  When you wrote your confession, did you forget about this meeting in which you learned about military training, or did you deliberately omit that since you did not want to incriminate Préfet Renzaho?  Which is true?  
A.	Counsel, at that time I no longer remember (sic) that meeting.  It was only after preparing this document and hand it -- handing it in that I remembered that point.  
Q.	Witness ALG, I put it to you that there never was such a meeting in Préfet Renzaho's office in March of 1993 about military training because military training of the Interahamwe did not begin until late 1993 or early 1994.  Would you like to comment on that?  
A.	Counsel, the military training took place in 1993.  I attended that meeting.  We were told about the military training.  Now, subsequently, I thought about what I heard during a rally which had taken place at Amahoro stadium either in February or in March.  That rally had been chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He mentioned this point without actually getting into the specifics.  He told us that we had to keep it a secret, but I know that that issue was discussed.  
Q.	Witness ALG, it was your understanding that the purpose of the military training was to fight with the soldiers against the RPF, should the RPF resume hostilities; correct?  
A.	That was part of the duties of the people who had to be trained, but you forgot something.  I also told you that the people to be trained also had to help the soldiers in protecting Kigali city if the RPF were to attack.  
Q.	And was it your understanding at that time that the purpose of training the Interahamwe was so that they could exterminate the Tutsis?  
A.	No, sir.  That was not the idea I heard about the training.  I understood it the way the information had been given me.  
Q.	Now, it's true, is it not, that throughout 1993 and early 1994, some people were sending their children to be trained by the RPF? 
A.	That is what was being said, but I did not know anything about that.  
Q.	And with the arrival of the RPF battalion at the CND in December of 1993, would you agree that the level of tension in the country and in Kigali was very high?  
A.	Yes.  That could be felt, especially because -- well, that battalion -- I was going to give you some explanation, but I believe I will stop now.  Now, if you want further details, then I can give you the details.  But I think it was felt that way.  Now, I believe I'd already explained this.  If you want me to repeat, then I will do so.  
Q.	Did you attend a security meeting on the 3rd of February 1994 at the préfecture of Kigali in which the defence minister, Bizimana, and General Ndindiliyimana spoke and discussed with the officials the security situation as it existed in Kigali and the requests that were being received for weapons by members of the population at that time?  
A.	I was not in Kigali-ville préfecture on the date that you just mentioned, so I didn't attend the meeting.  
Q.	The meeting was -- the meeting was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, or portions of it, on the 11th of February 1994, and I'm going to ask that you be shown exhibit -- the second exhibit in my list and see if you are familiar with the report of that meeting that was made on the radio.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So if the registry could show the witness the second document.  

Mr. President, this document is in Kinyarwanda, but at the very last page, we have had provided an unofficial English translation of the excerpt that I'm going to ask the witness about.  So if you're following and want to see the text, it would be on the very last page of that exhibit.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm just requesting a point of clarification, because on the cover letter, it mentions the date of the broadcast as the 11th of February 1994, but I recall Mr. Robinson said something about the 3rd of March a few moments ago.  Could Mr. Robinson clarify that for us, please?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you.  I actually said the 3rd of February, and the text of the broadcast indicates that the meeting had taken place on the 3rd of February, although the broadcast itself was made on the 11th of February.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, you have in front of you a Kinyarwanda transcript of a broadcast that took place on Radio Rwanda on the 11th of February.  And I'm going to ask you to turn to the page that has the number on the top, K0148765.  And at the bottom of the page, there is a statement by Bizimana, Augustin, and it continues on to the next page.  And you're welcome to read the entire text, but that's the part I'm going to ask you about.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going to read this excerpt.  And while the witness is reading along with me, we can all be familiar with it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, the minister speaks of -- says that "another question asked is the concerns of conseillers or prosecutors and other -- other Rwandans, too, to be provided with weapons".  And he says that "These days, due to the problem of fragile security, every Rwandan would like to have a weapon" and that he's getting 300 letters a day asking authorisation from the ministry of defence to have arms.  And he says that, "We tell them that we don't have weapons, and we can't afford arms to distribute to them, and that if every Rwandan was likely to own a gun in this country, it could not be ruled.  Security could not be maintained".  And then he says that "There are some people spreading lies that the ministry of defence is distributing arms in some regions and not in others".  And he says that "We think that the solution is that those in charge of security should work together so that we can protect the population, that the population itself should feel that where they were in the cellules should maintain their own security" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kindly slow down, Counsel, please. 
(Pages 32 to 40 by Priscilla Trillo)






























1430H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	And the minister said that if they know that such a person is a thug, they should denounce him and monitor him.  And if he commits a crime, they should arrest him, take him to the authorities so that he may face the law.  And he criticises the prosecutor.  He says they should arrest and try them, not simply release them, as we have noticed.  He notes that once you've taken someone to the prosecutor's office, it is surprising to discover that he has preceded you home, and that this is very discouraging for those working for the security of the population.  

And he went on to say that he believed the solution could be found on this side, that if we were to issue firearms to everybody, people would fight and no one would avoid a war.  And that people who are given firearms are in fact very few, and they consider the individual's behaviour on reports from communes and secteurs, and really make sure, if a security has been seriously affected.  

And then he says that, together with the conseiller, the other remedy is for the PVK to see how it can increase its police force, even supplementing them with demobilised soldiers who might be willing to join the gendarmerie.  

Did you hear about this address by the minister of defence in Kigali in February 1994?  
A.	Counsel, I am not aware of such a meeting, but the situation as you have just described it was similar to that which prevailed at the time.  There was a climate of tension, and that is the answer that I would like to give to your question.  
Q.	And for what period were you outside of Kigali during February of 1994?  
A.	When you talk about Kigali, I understand Kigali-rural.  When you're talking about the town of Kigali itself, you should say that you are talking of the préfecture of Kigali-ville town.  I thought you were talking about Kigali-rural.  Maybe this meeting was held in Kigali-rural préfecture, and the office of that préfecture was to be found in Kigali-ville préfecture.  So it could be that the meeting was held at Kigali-rural préfecture office.  
Q.	So -- 
A.	And were that meeting to have held at Kigali-ville préfecture office, it could be that people who were convened to said meeting were other than myself. 
Q.	Well, Witness ALG, the meeting was in the préfecture of Kigali-ville office, and I apologise if I created any confusion for you.  

But are you saying that you were not within Kigali-ville préfecture during February in 1994?  
A.	If we are referring to Kigali-ville préfecture, I was indeed there, but I do not believe that I was aware of such a meeting.  It could have been a meeting convening the préfet and the senior leaders of the country -- Bizimungu was minister of defence, as you can see.  And as far as I'm concerned, I do not recall having been aware of a meeting that the minister of defence might have presided at the office of Kigali-ville préfecture.  
Q.	Witness ALG, in the text the minister's talking about having met with the conseiller of Kigali-ville préfecture and the prosecutors.  And**********************, I'm finding it difficult to believe that, if you were in the préfecture at the time, you would not have attended or known about such a meeting.  Are you sure that you have no recollection of this meeting?  
A.	Counsel, in the excerpt to which we are referring, I did not see it mentioned anywhere that the conseiller and prosecutors were present.  It was merely said that the councilors and prosecutors had a problem.  Now, to say that they had a problem does not mean that they were convened to attend a meeting.  People were requesting weapons, and conseillers and prosecutors and members of the population were requesting weapons, but that does not mean to say that they were present or in attendance at that meeting.  
Q.	Witness, not to belabour this point too much, but if you could look at the page where the minister begins his speech, which ends with the number 65 at the top, and right above where the minister -- before the minister started talking, there is an introduction by the journalist, and if you read the two sentences, or the three sentences before the minister starts talking, does that not indicate to you that the meeting was at the Kigali-ville préfecture office, and involved the minister of defence, the -- General Ndindiliyimana, and the conseiller? 
A.	I have not found the passage, Counsel.  I can't find myself in the document.  Unless you were to grant me a few moments in order to locate that passage.  
Q.	Well, I think it's probably not worth that much time.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So, Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer the broadcast of the Radio Rwanda speech as Exhibit D. NZ177. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I still have a question about the evidentiary value, and this is simply going back to our previous discussion with the last exhibit that Mr. Robinson wanted to tender.  What is the evidentiary basis for admitting this broadcast now?  Particularly since there is a point in contrast between the witness in his answer and Mr. Robinson's representation that this is recounting a meeting.  The witness was directed to what Bizimana allegedly said, and he said he didn't understand from that portion that there was a meeting.  And we haven't resolved whether there was a meeting or not with reference to the preceding sentences, so where are we going with this?  What's the evidentiary value -- value?  Excuse me.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, what you have before you is a broadcast on Radio Rwanda of a meeting took place at the préfecture of Kigali relating to security in the country at that time.  So the evidentiary value is that this shows what the minister of defence was saying at the time concerning security, weapons, the need for self-defence or defence by members of the population.  That's the relevance of it.  I agree that the witness did not hear it, he hasn't adopted its contents, and that will be part of your consideration of its weight.  But nevertheless there's sufficient indicia of authenticity and the provenance of this speech such that it should be admitted.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The evidence will be admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ177 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, we're going to move ahead a small distance to the end of the month of March 1994, and I am going to ask that you be shown a document which is in tab 9 of the Prosecution's notebooks of exhibits.  

Witness ALG, what has been placed before you now is a letter in two languages, in French and in English.  So if you could direct yourself to the French.  It's a letter from the chief of staff of the Rwandan army, Déogratias Nsabimana, that's D-E-O-G-R-A-T-I-A-S N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  It's dated the 30th of March 1994 at Kigali.  It's addressed to the minister of defence, and it relates to the minutes of a meeting held on the 29th of March 1994 between the chief of staff, the préfet of Kigali-ville, and the ops commander for the city of Kigali.  And it indicates that the purpose of the meeting was to hone the civilian self-defence plan.  And then it goes on to detail the findings of this meeting, including number 10, that it was suggested that the bourgmestres instruct the population in traditional weapons handling, as there are insufficient firearms available.  

Now, my question to you is whether or not you were aware that before 6 April 1994, in fact on 29 March, there were already plans in place for civilian self-defence in Kigali.  
A.	Counsel, that is a question that you are putting to me with reference to that document, but I was not aware of the existence of this document.  The programme was not disclosed to us.  
Q.	Okay.  And I'm going to ask that you be shown the contents of tab 10 from the Prosecution's binder of exhibits, which was the document submitted by the préfet to the minister of defence the next day.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Meanwhile, Mr. President, although the witness has not identified this document, since it is in the Prosecution's tabs, I'm going to take the initiative of moving it into evidence as Exhibit D. NZ178, since assume the Prosecution would like to have it in evidence, and other witnesses will be talking about it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no objection.  In fact, you can move tab 10 into evidence as well.  We can take both of them at the same time.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 

Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, that brings in an ongoing discussion that you have been privy to about the (unintelligible) exhibits.  If there is no bona fide objection, or no objection at all, it would save a lot of time -- I understand that there's -- one has no obligation to consent to admission of exhibits in advance.  But if there's no objection, why not do it the quick way?  This is an example of what could happen.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand that, Mr. President, but I also think that the -- which documents can be admitted into evidence, it depends on the subject of the testimony of witnesses.  We're not prepared to consent to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I accept that one doesn't have to agree to everything.  But this is a classic case in point, where this agreement could have taken place yesterday or last week.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Understood.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's all.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I mean, not to belabour the point, Your Honour, but it brings another issue to the fore, which is to me it's inconsistent to demand one evidentiary standard when the documents -- when Mr. Robinson is in favour of the documents, and then to put up barriers in other instances.  It's just -- it's not a consistent approach, and I find that troublesome.  Because if we're trying to be disciplined about it, what about this document should lead it to come into evidence through this witness, since this witness already stated that he had no knowledge of the document beforehand?  

Now, I'm not objecting to bringing it into evidence, I would like it to be admitted, but I think that the Court should be mindful of doing things in a way that is consistent and principled.  And I don't see how we can justify this admission in the face of the arguments that Mr. Robinson has made previously.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, why make an unnecessary enquiry?  The admission was -- would have been based on the fact that you have agreed to it.  That was the basis.  There is no evidentiary basis for it laid by the -- the examining attorney.  And you suggested that from your side, you'd concede the admission of that document and the following document.  It is on the basis of that where I made my comment, that the agreement could have taken place earlier, and there could be a more (unintelligible) agreement where there is no objection to documents on either side, and it would save us a lot of time.  So I do hope that you both -- or, all counsel will reconsider the position on the arrangements for agreed admission of exhibits.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

With respect to the letter of the 30th of March 1994, I would ask that that be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ178, which is from tab 9, and with respect to the letter from 31st of March 1994, which is in tab 10, I would ask that it be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ179.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And Mr. President, I would also indicate that the Exhibit 178 has a French and an English, so it should be 178A for the French, 178B for the English, and the same for Exhibit 179.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Madam registrar, can you confirm?  

Yes, admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ178A and D. NZ178B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ179A and D. NZ179B admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I've now had placed before you a letter, both in French and in English, from the préfet of Kigali to the chief of staff of the army dated the 31st of March 1994.  And in it he submits a list of persons chosen in the cellules for the civil defence, and that list is, at least in the English version, some 17 pages long, containing the names of citizens in many cellules, if not all of the cellules of Kigali.  And I would ask if you were aware that such lists were being prepared and forwarded to the chief of staff of the army in the préfecture?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It is a list of reservists.  Those are not ordinary citizens.  So they are people who were in the army.  Of course they were considered to be ordinary citizens as well, but it is not truly the case.  As you noted, it is a confidential list, and it is the very first time that I am consulting this document.  It's very useful to me, but it -- I was not aware of the existence of this document, Counsel.  It's very interesting for me, and it's a very good thing for me to consult this list. 
Q.	But you're telling us that as of -- well, before the 6th of April 1994, you were not aware of plans for civil defence in Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	I will confirm again, but with reference to the programme I was not informed of it. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, I want to ask you about another event that occurred at the very end of March of 1994, and that is the killing of a man named Katumba, K-A-T-U-M-B-A.  Did you hear about that?  
A.	I know all about that story, I did not merely hear talk of it.  And I have even testified on the matter.  
Q.	And when you say you have testified on the matter, are you speaking of this trial or some other proceeding?  
A.	No, not in this trial, Counsel.  I wanted to say that I think I might have mentioned that somewhere in a document.  The Katumba incident is mentioned somewhere in my statements, subsequently two questions that were put to me on the subject of Katumba.  I believe I talked about that.  At an earlier stage you showed a document to me, this is a document containing my confession dated the******** ************, and I believe that I said somewhere that after the death of Katumba, the Tutsis of Bilyogo were persecuted.  
Q.	Yes, that's correct, Witness ALG, you did say that.  Just so I understand, though, have you testified at any trials concerning the events, either during or after the death of Katumba?  
A.	No, I did not testify in any other trial. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, Katumba was a notorious member of the CDR, correct?  
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And after the death of Katumba, there were -- there was violence which caused some members of the population to take refuge in Bilyogo centre, at the Charles Lwanga parish, correct?  
A.	Yes, there were even some who sought refuge at the Josephite brothers. 
Q.	And there was some violence in connection with the aftermath of his death, but that violence was kept under control by the gendarmerie and the United Nations civil police, correct?  
A.	That is correct.  Even the employees of the administration would go through that area on a regular basis, and I even told you that *******************************on that subject. 
Q.	Yes, we're going to get to that.  

Now, I want to read to you from what is number 3 in my package of exhibits.  It's not necessary that it be shown to the witness because it's in English.  And what this is is a weekly situation report from UNAMIR, and it's dated the 5th of April.  And in paragraph 1(C), it says as follows:  That "On the 30th of March at 2200 hours 1994, the leader of the CDR youth organisation, extreme Hutu, was killed during a gun fight at Kigali.  The next morning the CDR flags were hoisted half mast and there was a spontaneous demonstration by CDR supporters.  Gendarmerie and UN civil police held the situation under control.  Further escalation of the violence was expected" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Counsel, kindly slow down.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Sorry.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	"Further escalation of the violence was expected, but did not take place.  Fear amongst the Tutsi population is limited and few Tutsi take shelter in churches and other public places during the night.  The CDR flags are still hoisted half mast."  Is that an accurate summary of the situation after the death of Katumba?  
A.	Counsel, at that time UNAMIR was not aware of all events, because I did not hear in this report any mention of deaths, because there were Tutsi who died.  I even remember the name of one of those who died.  Tutsi went to seek refuge elsewhere.  There were not many of them, but some of them were compelled to leave their homes.  We tried all what we could --******************************************** *************************************************************************** -- to restore security in that area.  

	Amongst those who were killed, I remember Maurice Muganambuga, which I'm going to spell.  M-U-G-A-N-A-M-B-U-G-A, first name Maurice.  If my memory is not playing tricks with me, that person worked at the Rwanda savings fund.  That was the name of one of those who died following that event.  

	What I mean is that there were some information which UNAMIR did not access at that time.  Because at that time the CDR and the Interahamwe, even though they did not demonstrate as such, they however threatened Tutsis by moving into homes of Tutsi.  When the authorities were informed of the state of affairs, they tried to do all what we could to restore calm in that area.  But those who lived in those houses had already fled. 
Q.	But it was true, was it not, as UNAMIR has reported, that here, less than one week before the death of President Habyarimana, the authorities were successful in controlling the situation, and that the authorities had control, whether it be from the administration, the gendarmerie, they had sufficient control to contain incidents -- explosive incidents within Kigali, correct?  
A.	That's what happened on a regularly -- on a regular basis.  The incident at issue here is one of such examples.  But despite everything, calm was restored afterwards.  But there were casualties.  There were also cases of people who left their homes to seek shelter elsewhere.  
Q.	Now, in this weekly situation report, on page 6, it's also reported that:  "On the 29th of March, at Kicukiro, one person tried to get in the house of the president of the MRND.  He was arrested by a gendarme who fired one round, the man had not ID card with him, and the gendarmerie are still investigating."  

Did you hear about that incident at the home of Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 29th of March 1994?  
A.	People knew of that information, but it was not discussed for a long time following Katumba's death.  It is true that in Kicukiro that incident was discussed, but in Nyarugenge commune, what was breaking news and headline news was Katumba's death.  But indeed the incident you are referring to here took place.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would move the admission of the weekly situation report dated the 5th of April 1994, which is number 3 in my bundle, as Exhibit D. NZ180.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
I would still query the evidentiary value of putting this in evidence.  It doesn't hurt the Prosecution case, but I would like to understand why we are fulling the record with documents that do not go to advancing the Defence case or undermining the credibility of this witness, unless Mr. Robinson has an explanation of how this is furthering his defence case?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I can provide that explanation.  The relevance of what is contained in this document is that it describes events showing that even before -- as of before the death of the president, very close to that date, that the authorities had control over civil disturbances and were able to maintain control, which is part of our defence, that the events after 6th of April, because of the beloved nature of President Habyarimana, and the belief that the RPF have shot down his plane, caused people to act in ways which the authorities could not control.  That's one point.  

Secondly, it documents the attack on Mr. Ngirumpatse's home, which justifies some of the security measures that were taken by the MRND during this period, including distribution of weapons to people.  So these are relevant points, and they're well-documented by a reliable source.  

So the Chamber in Bagosora has held that documents which reflect the views of the United Nations officials in Rwanda in 1994 are relevant to the charges against the Accused, and can be admitted without even an authenticating witness.  So I'm offering them as self-authenticating, but I've linked the relevance to the Defence examination of this particular witness.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I understand Mr. Robinson's point, it doesn't address my point.  The witness has already given all the information that he seeks to rely on.  We have that in the transcripts of this witness's time.  If Mr. -- if independently of this witness Mr. Robinson wants to move this into evidence during his Defence case, that's another -- another matter.  But it's not appropriate to admit the document now through this witness.  If he wants to make the arguments based on the -- if he wants to make the points that he just articulated, he should be able to make those points based on the testimony of this witness and rely upon the credibility of this witness to make those points.  These documents can come in during the Defence case, but that's the only basis for admitting them.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, without belabouring the point, we're entitled to admit documents at any time during either the Prosecution case or the Defence case when they're relevant to the subject that's being discussed.  We can't -- we don't have any limitation on only admitting documents during the Defence case.  So I don't think that's a legitimate objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, we're not going to rule yet.  But please proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I'm going to be introducing a number of these, and we're going to have a problem of confusion unless they're given some number.  So perhaps at this time I can ask that this be marked as ID. NZ32, and then hopefully we can convert it into an exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, I'm going to also read from the fourth document in my package of exhibits, which is a daily situation report, or SITREP, from UNAMIR dated the 5th of April 1994.  And directing the attention of those with this document to paragraph 3(C)(4), which is on the -- page 3 -- excuse me, on page 2.  It indicates that:  "On the 4th of April at 9:45 p.m., two grenades were thrown by some unknown persons near the office of the MRND Kimihurura, number 208.  Seven persons were injured, out of which four were taken to Kanombe hospital, and three to Kigali centre hospital."  And that:  "Following this incident, supporters of the MRND erected two roadblocks in the area, and they were subsequently dismantled.  And the gendarmerie is investigating."  

And so I'd ask you, Witness ALG, whether you were familiar with this event which was directed against the MRND on the 4th of April 1994?  
A.	It was discussed, but not at great length.  
Q.	And this incident took place within*************************, correct?  
A.	No, sir.  The incident took place in Kicukiro commune. 
Q.	You're correct, I apologise.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ33, pending ruling on its admissibility.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We mark it for identification.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, continue, please.  

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, we -- it brings us to the 6th of April 1994, and it's true, is it not, that you attended and participated in a meeting in Bilyogo secteur, along with representatives of the ministry of interior and UNAMIR, correct?  
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And the purpose of that meeting was to try to convince the population and those who had taken shelter to reconcile and to allow the people who had taken shelter to return to their homes, correct?  
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And you yourself were strongly urging the people to be allowed to return to their homes, correct?  
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And so we can agree, then, can't we, that as of the 6th of April 1994, you had no idea that there was any plan in place for extermination of the Tutsis? 
A.	That's right, Counsel, I was not aware of such a programme.  
Q.	And I believe you stated in one of your statements that you were taken by surprise when the massacres started; is that correct?  
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Okay.  
A.	Correct, Counsel.  But at some point in time I said there were pointers to the fact that Tutsi were being persecuted, even though it was not in a widespread manner, as it became the case after the 6th of April. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask you a lot of questions about the events after the 6th of April, but before I do, I want to establish some general -- excuse me.  Before I do, I want to establish some general understanding of your situation and what you did and what you didn't do.  

So, first, let me ask you whether or not, in your capacity as a********************************************* **************** -- and I will say no more about that post -- did you ever order that anyone be killed? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	And in that same capacity, did you ever receive an order to kill someone?  
A.	Never. 
Q.	You have also told us that you held a post within the MRND as of the 6th of April, at the level of the *************.  And I'll ask you if, in that capacity, you ever ordered anyone to kill another human being?  
A.	No, Counsel, it was not from the 6th of April, it was before the 6th of April.  Now, coming back to your question, I never gave such an order.  
Q.	And in that same capacity, at the *************level of MRND, did you ever receive an order to kill anyone?  
A.	Never. 
Q.	Did you ever attend any preparatory meetings during which massacres were planned? 
A.	No, sir.  
Q.	After the 6th of April, did you have the means to stop the killing?  
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	What would have happened to you if you walked up to a roadblock and told the people to stop the killing? 
A.	I had explained that.  If I had ventured to do such a thing, perhaps I would have been killed.  I know of people who were killed for having done just that.  
Q.	Now, on the 7th of April 1994, you were in your home, correct?  
A.	Correct.  

	Counsel, regarding the question you just put to me, there is something I would like to add to the answer I had given you, of course, if you allow me to do so.  Thank you.  You asked me whether I could go and speak to those manning roadblocks and asking them to stop killings, and whether those people could respect me.  What I would like to tell you is that I tried on one occasion, but I was almost killed.  A firearm was pointed at me.  And if I survived, it is perhaps thanks to the will of God, because there is one person I tried to rescue who -- someone I was taking from Gitega.  And when they attempted to kill me, I left that place with the person whom I was trying to rescue.  

	So I wanted to add this piece of information to explain to you further that you should not always think that nothing was done to stop the killings.  When I arrived on the 13th, I tried to convince people to dismantle certain roadblocks which had been set up, but my efforts were in vain.  We did everything, but we failed.  That is the addition I can make to the answer I had given you, Counsel.  

	Now, let us deal with the question you just put to me.  Let me start by thanking you, above all, for giving me the opportunity to provide you with this point of detail.  Concerning the question you just asked, kindly repeat the question, because I didn't quite understand it, and I wouldn't want to give a wrong answer.  
Q.	My question was simply whether you had stayed at home during the 7th of April.  
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And from your home, could you hear the sounds of war in Kigali? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I heard gunshots. 
Q.	And were there even times when you hid within your home because the war was so close to where you were?  
A.	Yes, I hid under my bed. 
Q.	Looking at the document number 5 in my series of exhibits, a report from Kofi Annan to the secretary-general of the United Nations on the 7th of April 1994, in paragraph 6, Kofi Annan says that:  "The special representative of the secretary-general," which was Mr. Booh-Booh, "and the field commander," which is General Dallaire, "inform that there is no authority in control at this moment in Kigali."  That's on the 7th of April.  Was that the situation as you understood it?  
A.	What I told you was that on that date I was hiding, so I could not know what was happening outside.  I just heard gunshots.  
Q.	And I take it that you did not feel that the authorities had sufficient control such that you could venture from your home, even if you had some policemen with you; is that correct?  
A.	Counsel, if I did not leave my home, it was because of the communiqué which I had told you about -- the communiqué prepared by army officials, which had been broadcast over the radio calling on members of the population to stay indoors.  So I felt I was concerned by such a communiqué, because even state employees were asked to stay home, not to go to work.  
Q.	Yes, we're going to speak of that communiqué in a moment.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, this time with respect to my document 5, the cable of the 7th April 1994, I ask that this be marked as ID. NZ34, this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So marked.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take the afternoon break at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we can take the mid-afternoon recess now.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, thank you.  Before my learned friend begins his cross-examination again, I would like to request that the Trial Chamber excuse the absence of my colleague, Ms. Hounkpatin, and I guarantee I will assist Mr. Ngirumpatse in her absence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Registrar, I gather there is an announcement you wish to make. 
MS. KOUO: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  The registry wishes to put on record that some document submitted by Defence, co-counsel for Ngirumpatse, Maitre Weyl, were admitted in evidence as Exhibits 22 through 33, and there was also Exhibit 35.  That was on the 30th of October 2006.  Thank you.

MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I have had -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have decided to continue the practice of marking them for identification at this stage.
 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, I have had two documents placed before you and hopefully you have had a chance to look at them during the break.  They are Exhibits D. NZ18 and D. NZ19.  And if we can turn first to D. NZ18, was that a communiqué that was read over the radio on the 7th of April from the ministry of defence? 
A.	I have two communiqués that would seem to have been drafted by the same source.  This communiqué was on the subject of the death of the president of the republic, and I did learn of it. 
Q.	So the communiqué with the exhibit number D. NZ18, which also has on the top K0080683, it is both French and English in the admitted exhibit, but you have the French before you, that one is the one that was -- urged the population to remain indoors pending further instructions.  Do you see that at the very bottom? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And it is true, is it not also, reading two paragraphs above that, that the minister of defence called upon the Rwandan people, "Not to lose courage as a result of the death of the president, and to avoid any acts that may jeopardise public safety"?  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written in this document, and that is the message that was broadcast on the radio. 
Q.	And turning to the next document that you have in front of you, which is D. NZ19, and it bear K0233372, this is a communiqué which was, apparently, broadcast at approximately 5:20 p.m. on the 7th of April from the ministry of defence, again issued by Colonel Bagosora.  And do you see under the number 1 that the participants to the meeting of the armed forces on the 7th of April have requested that, "Members of the army surpass themselves and show restraint and discipline in order to comfort the people and to restore order to the country."  Do you see that under number 1? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written, Counsel. 
Q.	And then under number 4 it indicates that:  "The senior officials of the army invite the population to stay calm and to refuse any appeal that could stir up hatred and any kind of violence."  And it goes on to say that, "The people, in particular the youth, must refrain from acts of vandalism or else be liable to severe punishment."  Do you see that? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Unless I am the only one -- 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Counsel, I have seen that passage. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt.  What I have as D. NZ18 is actually -- what I see stamped on the exhibit I have on my screen, which is coming directly from TRIM, is that D. NZ19 is the first document that we discussed, and D. NZ18 is what we are discussing now.  Can I ask Mr. Robinson to double-check that so that we are accurate in how we refer -- we refer to these documents on the record?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. President, I don't have the official stamped copy.  I have my own copies that were admitted, and I marked them when they were admitted.  So, I may be mistaken or, perhaps, they were reversed when they were admitted, but to my -- according to my records, D. NZ18 was the communiqué with K0080 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam registrar -- Mr. Issa, could you assist us, please?  
MR. WEBSTER:
D. NZ18 has the numbered paragraphs, and D. NZ19 has no numbers to the paragraphs; so that should be a way of visually distinguishing the two.  So they are actually reversed in the way we were discussing them through Mr. Robinson's earlier questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, could you confirm the position for our record, please. 
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, there is a problem, Defence -- the one which is indicating as 18 in our file is 19.  And the one which is indicated as 19 is 18 in our exhibit file.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So Mr. Webster's intervention was accurate. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think that is enough to note for the record without my having to go back and ask the same questions again.  So the record is now clear. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, it is true, is it not, Witness ALG, that not only did the army call for people to stay indoors, but they called for people to refrain from acts of violence, correct?  
A.	Counsel, the communiqué I was aware of was D. NZ19A.  I heard that communiqué when I was at home.  Regarding the second communiqué, I did not hear it because the place I lived at was very close to*********************************.  There was sustained fighting.  And at that time I was not able to listen to my radio which would have made it possible for me to hear the communiqué.  
      
Let me underscore that the communiqués were broadcast, but the messages conveyed were not translated into reality, at least, concerning members of the population and the army.  So the instructions which were given were not followed.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness ALG.  Witness ALG, on the morning of the 7th of April did you receive a telephone call from any of your -- any conseiller of secteurs? 
A.	I can't quite remember, Counsel. 
Q.	And did you have any telephone communication with the préfet on the 7th of April? 
A.	No, I never spoke with him.  Perhaps, Counsel, what I can tell you in connection with telephone calls is that from 7 p.m. the lines in the area where I was were disrupted, so the telephones were not working in that area.  It was very difficult to place any phone calls. 
Q.	And was that from 7 p.m. on the 7th of April? 
A.	I did not say exactly 7 p.m.  I said throughout the evening from the 7th of April the phone lines were down. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	Thank you too, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, turning to the 8th of April, document number 6 on my package of exhibits is a situation report by UNAMIR from 12 o'clock until 3 p.m. on the 8th of April.  And it is noted in paragraph 6 that fighting was taking place between the RGF and RPF soldiers at different places in Kigali city, like the CND area, Amahoro stadium area, Kimihurura area, that is K-I-M-I-H-U-R-U-R-A, and Hôtel Méridién area.  Was that true as far as you experienced on the 8th of April? 
A.	I was not an eyewitness to that, but we heard sustained gunfire from that direction.  I did not leave my house to go and ascertain for myself, but we could hear gunshots in that area. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that that situation report be marked as ID. NZ35. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So marked. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, also UNAMIR has reported in a supplementary report from Mr. Booh-Booh to New York on the 8th of April 1994, which is number 7 in my package, at paragraph 3 that:  "UNAMIR attempted to maintain contact with as many agencies as possible, but telephone lines, our only communication with most of them, went down early in the morning of 8th April and have not been restored."  Was it also your experience that you were unable to use the telephone on the 8th of April? 
A.	Counsel, I believe I answered that question earlier on.  I experienced that situation from the 7th of April. 
Q.	And did that continue until the time you left your home, you had no phone service? 
A.	Yes, the situation continued. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And Mr. President, I will be marking the UNAMIR cable dated the 8th of April as ID. NZ36.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, we already have admitted into evidence as D. NZ29 the text of a speech by President Sindikubwabo on the 8th of April when he addressed the nation on the radio.  And during that speech President Sindikubwabo announced that the new government had been given three tasks:  "First to quickly restore security for Rwandans and their properties; second, to negotiate with the RPF for the installation of the broad-based transitional government within three months; and third, to find a solution to the hunger faced by those displaced by the war."  And he asked the Rwanda people "to stay calm and refrain from killing others."  Did you hear that address to the nation on the 8th of April? 
A.	Counsel, are you referring to the 8th of April?  Because as far as I know, if my memory is not playing tricks with me, the government was sworn in on the 9th of April, I believe it was on the 9th of April.  And the ceremony took place at Hôtel Diplomates.  That speech you are referring to was made after that swearing-in ceremony.  
Q.	Leaving aside whether it was made on the 8th or the 9th, did you hear that speech? 
A.	So it was after the swearing-in ceremony that I heard that speech.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, the interpreters did not get what you said. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I heard it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And so, when you testified on the 27th of October of this year at this trial at page 11 of the draft transcript that, "No figure of authority ever said that the killings should stop" that was not accurate, correct? 
A.	Counsel, you realise that those speeches were made after the government had been formed.  But subsequently, other speeches were made which seemed to contradict what had been said before. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I'm suggesting that what you said before is contradicted by what you have said today because you said on Friday that, "No figure of authority ever said that the killings must stop."  And today you are acknowledging that President Sindikubwabo, on either the 8th or the 9th, whatever it may be, asked the Rwandan people to stay calm and refrain from killing others.  So will you acknowledge that you were in error when you testified that no figure of authority ever said that the killings should stop? 
A.	That speech, or the speeches reportedly made that day, perhaps, I forgot them because of that speech which was made and which contradicted the previous speeches.  So you certainly understand that what was said in those speeches was translated into reality.  This is true, even more so because the authorities who made the various speeches did not ensure the implementation thereof.  
      
Perhaps I would acknowledge that I did not mention that there were certain speeches which advocated calm.  But subsequently there were other speeches made which were rather an encouragement for massacres to be committed.  And after the second category of speeches, we did not hear any other speeches made to contradict the inflammatory speeches which had been made before. 
Q.	Witness ALG, we have in evidence as Exhibits D. NZ72 and D. NZ73 a message broadcast on      Radio Rwanda on the 8th or 9th of April 1994 by Préfet Renzaho.  And Préfet Renzaho said that, "The préfet of Kigali préfecture urges the population of Kigali to respect the orders, instructions of the ministry of defence; and informs the population that it is forbidden to aggress" -- that is aggress, "other members of the population."  And asks them moreover, "To be cautious in these difficult times and to cooperate with the security forces and make their job easier.  And the population is urged to keep an eye out for security, so they should not be infiltrated."

Did you hear that message broadcast on the radio on the 8th or 9th of April?  
A.	No, Counsel, I didn't hear that call. 
Q.	Now, you were aware, were you not, that on the 9th of April the interim government was set up in Kigali, correct? 
A.	I know that members of that government were sworn in on that date. 
Q.	And were you aware that Prime Minister Kambanda in a message broadcast on the radio, which is Exhibit D. NZ24, on behalf of the interim government asked the minister of defence to do everything in his power to stop the massacres immediately, and urged the political parties to stop their members from taking part in massacres, and further urged the prosecutors to punish those responsible for the massacres.  Were you aware of that massage by Prime Minister Kambanda after he was sworn in? 
A.	No, sir, I didn't hear that message. 
Q.	Did you hear the communiqué issued by the five political parties, including the MRND, which was broadcast on the 10th of April, and which is in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ21, in which the political parties called for the restoration of security, regardless of a person's ethnic origin, party membership, or region, and they urged the authorities to put an end to the massacres and to punish those who broke the law? 
A.	I didn't hear that communiqué. 
Q.	And did you hear the speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 10th of April in which he addressed the Rwandan people and told them that no one had the right to tamper with the life of his or her neighbour, and that the government had given orders that anyone caught committing such acts would be published exemplary, that everyone was urged to keep the peace, that unauthorised roadblocks were to be dismantled immediately, and in which he publicly condemned those who have encroached the rights of others.  And that is in evidence as D. NZ23.  Did you hear that speech?
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	Did you hear the speech on -- broadcast on the 10th of April by Préfet Renzaho in which he said, "Once more the préfet denounces criminals of all categories, killers, bandits and other persons who threaten one another's safety and urges that anyone trying to infiltrate in the various districts, neighbourhoods, should be denounced."  And he also asked the authority to take control of the roadblocks.  Did you hear that announcement by the préfet on the 10th of April? 
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	You do know, however, that on the 9th and the 10th of April the killings were going on in Kigali, correct? 
A.	At that time I was home.  And at that time I did not yet know -- or I should say I didn't really know, but I was subsequently informed of that.  Well, if those communiqués were broadcast I wouldn't have known because my radio set was not switched on; you see, I was hiding. 
Q.	Now, on the 9th of April 1994, in a cable from Kofi Annan to -- the secretary general, he reported that "The special representative of the secretary general, Mr. Booh-Booh, maintained contact with the interim government.  And the president had been on the radio but that the interim government does not appear to have any authority having been disavowed by the RPF."  Were you aware that the RPF refused to negotiation with the interim government after it was established on the 9th of April 1994? 
A.	I didn't know it then, I got to know of it later. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And Mr. President, I would ask that the cable from Kofi Annan be marked for identification as ID. NZ37. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So marked.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, on the 10th of April 1994 a situation report, special one by UNAMIR, which is number 9 in my packet, reported that there were families in danger in Kimihurura, including families from Belguim -- of Belgians, that the RPF had reached the outskirts of Kigali and that the RPF had begun killing civilians suspected of being Interahamwe in Amahoro stadium, were you aware of any of those facts? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry to interrupt.  Although I understand that the Trial Chamber is proceeding to deal with these documents by marking them for identification, but I still take issue with the way Mr. Robinson is proceeding, because his questions come after he reads a substantial portion of these documents into evidence.  And that just does not seem appropriate to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, when he reads the document they are not read into evidence.  They become evidence if the witness adopts the answer.  So he's reading them onto the record, but they are not part of the evidential basis of the trial unless they are adopted by the witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If the Trial Chamber thinks this is anappropriate way to proceed, then I won't object constantly, but it seems to me that we take a lot of time reading things that the witness has already stated that he is not aware of.  So, I don't want to interrupt and slow things down, but  somehow this really doesn't seem appropriate to me.  But I will be guided by Your Honours' judgement on the matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we will permit it.  It is cross-examination.  And the point I am making is that we are not a jury.  And it doesn't become evidence unless the witness acknowledges it. 

Yes, Mr. Webster -- Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness ALG, referring again to the report of UNAMIR on the 10th of April where they reported that there was a family from Belgium in danger in Kimihurura, that the RPF had reached the outskirts of Kigali, that the RPF was killing civilians suspected of being Interahamwe in Amahoro stadium; did you come to learn of those events on the 10th of April? 
A.	I was not aware of that, Counsel. 
Q.	Was there fighting in Kimihurura on the 10th of April? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, and I have already said that,***************************. 
Q.	And there was fighting, the fighting was between the RPF and the Rwanda government, correct? 
A.	Yes, there was fighting, that is correct. 
Q.	And you later learned, did you not, that the RPF had killed civilians in Amahoro stadium, correct? 
A.	At that moment in time I did not know of it.  Counsel, I told you that at that time I had no communication with the outside world.  At that time, in view of the fact that there was fighting, I was obliged to hide myself under my bed in the company of my family.  And I didn't even have a radio, so I could not follow what was happening in the outside world. 
Q.	But you have testified here to many events that occurred during the 7th to the 12th of April that you claim to have been informed of at a later time.  And I'm asking you, were you informed at sometime that the RPF had killed civilians in Amahoro stadium? 
A.	I didn't follow up on that information closely.  What I do remember is that at some moment in time the préfet referred to that subject, but he did not mention the name of the area, specifically.  He said -- and it was, in fact, from his own words that I heard that information, and he even drew up reports on the subject saying that every time the RPF came into a specific area, it would kill civilians.  So you must understand that I learnt that fact at a later stage when I came back to Kigali-ville préfecture office.  
      
Now, that is what I can say with reference to the question you just put to me.  I do not know how he was informed of that, i.e., with reference to what was going on in the RPF controlled areas. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness ALG.  Now, sticking with the period of the 10th or 11th of April, I understand that you were still at your home.  So, it is true, is it not, that you did not attend a meeting at the préfecture office in which weapons were distributed to conseillers at the ministry of defence after that meeting? 
A.	I heard speak of that meeting but I did not take part in said meeting.
 
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be shown D. NZ76, please?  
 
Mr. President, while that is being retrieved, I would ask that my document number 9, which is the UNAMIR report of the 10th of April that I referred to, the special situation report, be marked for identification as ID. NZ38. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So marked. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness ALG, what has been placed before you is a list compiled by another witness, a conseiller in Kigali who listed the people who were present at a meeting which he said occurred on the                10th of April 1994 in which weapons were distributed at the ministry of defence after this meeting.  Do you see your name on this list?  
A.	I can, indeed, see my name, Counsel, but I would like to say that what is written here is not correct because I did not take part in that meeting. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness ALG. 
A.	And I thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, you have also told us about another meeting on the 10th or the 11th of April which you did not attend but which you claim to have heard about, and that is a meeting at the Diplomat hotel; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I heard people talk about that meeting. 
Q.	Now, we have had two members of the Interahamwe national committee testify in this trial about that meeting; both of whom were present.  And they testified that at that meeting they were ordered to go around to the roadblocks in Kigali and to order the Interahamwes to stop the killings; and they did that.  Did you have information that persons from the Interahamwe national committee had been ordered by the Accused at the Diplomat hotel to go around to roadblocks and order the Interahamwe to stop the killings? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, I'm a bit confused by the question, because when the witness was being examined in direct,    Mr. Robinson made a big distinction between two meetings that were taking place on the 10th of April.  And now I think we have conflated them again, because this witness admitted to hearing about, what I would call the second meeting, not the first.  And with Mr. Robinson's question, I believe, was with respect to the first meeting.  So can I please ask him to distinguish between the two so that the record is clear. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, it is our position that there was only one meeting at the Diplomat hotel on the     10th of April, that that meeting is as portrayed in paragraph 38 of the indictment, a meeting at which the members of the Interahamwe committee were asked to go and stop the killings.  And that is the meeting that I'm now asking this witness about. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness, did you hear of such a meeting that the Interahamwe committee members, and I will specify them, Bernard Maniragaba, Ephrem Nkezabera, Joseph Serugendo, Dieudonné Niyitegeka and Jean Pierre Sebanetsi met with Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera, allegedly Mr. Karemera, at the Diplomat hotel, and were instructed to go around and tell the Interahamwe to stop killing.  Did you ever hear of such a meeting? 
A.	I heard people talk about that meeting, but those who informed me of it did not describe it to me in such a fashion.  This is the very first time that I have heard that the members of the Interahamwe commission -- or committee were told to stop the massacres.  This is the first time that I have heard speak of that in this Trial Chamber, and notably the content of the message during the meeting. 
Q.	And were you not aware at all that, in fact, members of the Interahamwe national committee on the 10th, 11th and 12th April had, in the company of military escorts gone around to the various secteurs in Kigali and, in fact, told people to stop the killings; have you never heard of that before?
A.	Counsel, I heard that piece of information here.  Yesterday, I was told of it and you have just repeated that fact.  It is the first time that it has come to my attention.  In fact, that is not how it happened because the massacres never stopped. 
Q.	You're correct about that, despite the best efforts of Mr. Nzirorera and those members of the Interahamwe committee who had the courage to go to roadblocks and ask people to stop the killing, that those killings did not stop.  But let's talk about the meeting that you seem to think occurred at the Diplomat hotel, because you have told us that you received some information about a meeting from the former bourgmestre, Pierre Nyilikwaya; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, and a number of other people that I mentioned. 
Q.	Yes, and we are going to take them one by one.  So, perhaps, you could tell me when you were informed by Bourgmestre Nyilikwaya of this meeting? 
A.	He informed me of it in the month of April.  I do not recall the date.  That was in the year 1994. 
Q.	And where were you when he informed you of that? 
A.	I was with him at Kigali-ville préfecture office. 
Q.	And was anyone else present when he informed you of that? 
A.	Nobody else because*************************************************. 
Q.	And according to him, had he attended that meeting? 
A.	In fact, he did give me that piece of information, but he didn't specify.  Moreover, I did not ask him to specify or clarify, but to my mind it was something that he knew well, but I did not ask him whether he was in attendance at the meeting or not. 
Q.	Was he an Interahamwe? 
A.	No, he was not. 
Q.	Now, you also told us that you -- well, first of all, can you tell me to the best of your recollection what he told you about that meeting? 
A.	Counsel, what he said to me was similar to what was said to me by other people.  And I have already said that.  If you want me to repeat what I said, then I shall do so.  He said that the leaders of the MRND party, that is Mathieu Ngirumpatse and the other senior leaders of the MRND party, held a meeting for the Interahamwe at the date that you quoted.  He told them that they should help the army with a view to fighting the RPF, and that they were also to provide protection for the town by manning roadblocks, and that they were to organise night guards in order to -- night guards in order to avoid infiltration on the part of the Inkotanyi.  They were also asked to obey soldiers. In view of the fact that those leaders could not always be in the company of the Interahamwe in order to give them instructions or orders.  That is what he told me.

And even if the information from other people was not necessarily packaged in the same manner, it was similar in content.  It was the same message.  
Q.	Now, you have also testified that you spoke about this meeting at the Diplomat hotel with the conseiller from Biliyogo secteur; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  As we also talked about it with Nyilikwaya. 
Q.	And the conseiller of Bilyogo secteur is Amri Karekezi,  correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel, Amri Karekezi. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, could you get the witness to spell some of these names that are being mentioned for the first time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Your Honour.  Karekezi is K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I.    And I believe the bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune had already been spelled for the court reporter, the name has come up before. 
THE WITNESS:
Kacyiru. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Kacyiru, sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, can you tell us when you received the information from Amri Karekezi concerning the information that occurred at the Diplomat hotel? 
A.	I think that that information was given to me during that same period.  I do not remember whether that was in the month of April, May, or June, but it was around that time. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda boothdid not understand what the witness just said. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you please repeat the answer.  The interpreter did not understand you. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I was saying that if we had a conversation of that nature, there was a reason for it. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us who else was present when you had this conversation with Amri Karekezi about the meeting at the Diplomat hotel? 
A.	In fact, it was not a meeting, it was a conversation.  I do not remember who was present; really, I can't remember at all.  And the same applies for the conversation that I had with the bourgmestre of Kacyiru, it wasn't a meeting where we had a discussion about a number of matters, but it was on such an occasion that he told me of that; we were at Kigali-ville préfecture office, as well, on that occasion. 
Q.	And did Mr. Karekezi tell you that he had been present at this meeting at the Diplomat hotel? 
A.	No, he said that he had also heard people speak about it, but that he had not been in attendance at that meeting. 
Q.	And did he tell you what his source of information was; who it was that told him? 
A.	He told me that it was an Interahamwe; and he mentioned a family member, but I don't quite remember what relationship there was between him and that person.  I don't even know the name of the Interahamwe who was related to the conseiller.  But it was, indeed, that person who informed the conseiller of that meeting. 
Q.	Now, did you also discuss the meeting -- well, first of all, with respect to your conversation with        Amri Karekezi, can you tell us what he told you about that meeting? 
A.	He repeated the same message as Nyilikwaya.  But we focused our conversation on the subject of roadblocks.  And I asked him whether it was, indeed, the conseiller who had allowed the roadblocks.  In fact, I had asked the conseiller how the roadblocks had been set up.  And he said that the soldiers were the ones who had set them up.  And at the same time, he talks to me of the meeting where Renzaho and some soldiers were in attendance.  And we said that those roadblocks should be reinforced and that inspection rounds should be organised.  
      
I remember that he said to me that the Interahamwe were assisted by the soldiers, and that they had set up those roadblocks on the 17th.  And what is more, that information, or piece of information was confirmed to me by other conseillers. 
Q.	And we heard the date of the 17th from the translation, is that what you said? 
A.	No, it was the 7th.  Well, it was at that date that the conseiller said that the roadblocks had been set up in their secteur.  And it was the Interahamwe and the army that set them up.  Now, with reference to that meeting held on the 10th or the 11th, I was told of the directives that were given by the MRND leaders, and the Interahamwe members that had been called to attend the meeting.  And I was told that the MRND leaders had asked the Interahamwe to reinforce the roadblocks and also to set up further roadblocks with a view to stopping infiltration by Inkotanyi.  But I must say that it is not all of the conseiller that told me that, I think of Amri Karekezi and Gabriel Nbyariyehe.  Nbyariyehe is spelt N-B-Y-A-R-I-Y-E-H-E.  Sorry or the speed.  And Karekezi and Mbyariyehe were the ones who gave me the same information on the subject.  I am convinced that when they told me that they were, in fact, together.  I am beginning to remember that now.  They were together in the Kigali préfecture office.  And I remember that on one occasion, those two people uttered those words in the Kigali-ville préfecture office.

1700H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness ALG.  Now, you have also -- 
A.	Yes, thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	You've also told us that you received information about this meeting from Joseph Setiba; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel.  
Q.	And when was it that Joseph Setiba told you about that meeting that had occurred on the 10th or the 11th of April? 
A.	He gave me that information when we were at the Kigali main prison.  
Q.	Approximately what year? 
A.	I can't remember the exact year, but it must have been around 2000, 2001 or 2002, anywhere between those three years.  I am unable to remember the exact year.  
Q.	And can you tell us what Mr. Setiba told you about the meeting?  First of all, did he claim that he had personally attended this meeting? 
A.	Yes, but I'm sorry, Setiba mentioned two meetings to me.  The rest talked about one meeting to me, but Setiba mentioned two meetings.  He said he did not attend the first meeting, but one of the Interahamwe working with him had attended that meeting.  Then he told me of another meeting which had been chaired by Colonel Bagosora, and he said he attended that meeting.  I'm referring to Théoneste Bagosora.  He also told me Dallaire attended that meeting and that Callixte, too, attended that meeting.  So he mentioned two meetings, whereas the others mentioned only one meeting.  
Q.	And directing our attention to the first meeting that Mr. Setiba mentioned, the one that he did not attend, did he tell you the name of the Interahamwe who had attended and from whom he had received the information? 
A.	Yes, on that occasion he gave me the name of the Interahamwe who told him, but I've forgotten it.  
Q.	And what did he tell you about that first meeting? 
A.	He explained it to me the same way as the other people I had talked to you about earlier on.  
Q.	Now, with respect to the second meeting, he told you that that also had occurred at the 
Hôtel Diplomates? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And he had personally attended that meeting in the presence of Colonel Bagosora, General Dallaire, and the minister of youth, Callixte Nzabonimana; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, he also mentioned the name of Gaspard Gahigi, who was the editor-in-chief of RTLM radio.  But he told me he saw Nzirorera, Édouard and Mathieu within the vicinity of the Hôtel Diplomates. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Callixte Nzabonimana is spelled N-Z-A-B-O-N-I-M-A-N-A, and Gahigi is spelled G-A-H-I-G-I.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did Mr. Setiba tell you anything about the distribution of weapons occurring at either of those meetings? 
A.	He told me that at the end of that meeting chaired by Bagosora, and after Dallaire's departure, Bagosora ordered for weapons to be brought in, and the weapons were distributed.  Let me add that he told me that the weapons were not given only to Interahamwe but also to the other youth of other political parties, in fact, the Power factions of those political parties.  He said they were issued with weapons at the end of that meeting which Dallaire had attended, and he said the weapons were distributed after Dallaire had left.  A military truckload of weapons were brought and distributed in the presence of Callixte Nzabonimana, Gaspard Gahigi, and they were at Hôtel Diplomates when the weapons were distributed.  
Q.	And was anyone present when Joseph Setiba spoke to you about this in prison? 
A.	I went to see him, asking the information.  There were -- there was no one else.  We were just two of us.  
Q.	Now, you have also told us that you received information about the meeting at the Diplomat hotel from Bernard Maniragaba -- that's spelled M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A -- is that correct? 
A.	Yep, he gave me that information, but I am not too sure whether he mentioned those two meetings to me, because he was in a rush.  He wanted to go and meet Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera in Murambi.  He told me of the meeting he had attended, which meeting had been chaired by Mathieu Ngirumpatse at Hôtel Diplomates.
Q.	And approximately when did you have this conversation with Bernard Maniragaba? 
A.	Around early May.  Yes, it was in May 1994, I think.  Of course, that's an approximation, because it is very difficult to recall dates.  In any case, I think it was around that time, but it must have been after Nzirorera had come to the Kigali-ville préfecture office, so you realise that it must have been in the month of May, because he gave me that information after Joseph Nzirorera had come.  
Q.	Was anyone present when you received this information from Bernard Maniragaba? 
A.	No, but bear with me, Counsel.  I was able to notice that there was some other person moving about very close to the place where I and Bernard were.  I don't know if that person overheard our conversation, because, you know, the senior Interahamwe leaders were accompanied by people charged with providing their security, so he was accompanied by another Interahamwe or other Interahamwes.  I do not know whether they overheard our conversation.  
Q.	And you were sufficiently friendly with Bernard Maniragaba in the month of May 1994, that he would confide the circumstances of this meeting to you; is that correct? 
A.	I had known Bernard a long time.  We were in the same secondary school; I had known him ever since secondary school.  ********************************.  We were not in the same class, but I simply saw him, but we did not have any particular relations.  
Q.	Did Bernard Maniragaba kill or order the killing of Tutsis in Kigali in April or May 1994? 
A.	Bernard Maniragaba was an influential Interahamwe in Kigali city.  Everybody knew him.  Even the Interahamwe feared him.  The Interahamwe said that he scoured all places where roadblocks were located to give instructions to Interahamwe.  I did not see him kill anyone, but he was one of those who scoured the various roadblocks, giving instructions to Interahamwe, especially whenever he returned from Murambi.  

It was said that he always loved holding meetings with Pecos Ngerageze, spelt N-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-E.  That gentleman was the president of the Interahamwe in Gitega secteur.  Gitega is spelt G-I-T-E-G-A.  I'm sorry, Bernard Maniragaba also lived at Gitega secteur.  Many influential Interahamwe attended those meetings.  The Interahamwe of Gitega mentioned that point to me.  Even Setiba gave me that information.  It was not just once that I had a discussion with Setiba.  We often met and discussed, so he told me that he attended that meeting and a report had been prepared to be forwarded to the officials in Murambi. 
Q.	Now, you have told us that you also received information about the meeting on the 10th or 11th of April at the Diplomat hotel from a gentleman by the name of Jean Népomuscène and I think it's Biziyaremye; is that correct? 
A.	That's right.  Biziyaremye also told me that he attended that meeting chaired by Bagosora.  Actually, whenever I discussed with those people, I did not pay attention to whether they mentioned one or two meetings; however, whenever anyone gave me information regarding those meetings, I realised that their accounts were consistent.  Biziyaremye is spelt B-I-Z-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  Biziyaremye was an very influential Interahamwe who lived at Rugenge secteur, spelled R-U-G-E-N-G-E.  Biziyaremye was an Interahamwe, but a former soldier.  That's what he said.  
Q.	And when was it that he told you about the meeting on the 10th or 11th of April? 
A.	He told me they had received orders from party officials to go and set up roadblocks, and after the meeting chaired by Bagosora, weapons were handed to them.  In fact, the account he gave me was similar to what Setiba had told me.  He said they were issued with weapons after General Dallaire's departure.  He also said that it was necessary to move the orphans who were at the 
Gisimba orphanage.  Gisimba is spelt G-I-S-I-M-B-A.  That orphanage was in Nyakabanda secteur, spelt N-Y-A-K-A-B-A-N-D-A, in Nyarugenge commune.  

Dallaire had made the request for them to evacuate the children who were at that orphanage, because UNAMIR intended to evacuate them to a safe place.  So, I was told that that was the purpose of that meeting chaired by Colonel Bagosora.  When General Roméo Dallaire made that request, the request was turned down because he was told that UNAMIR had never tried to evacuate the children in Nyacyonga, spelt N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A.  That was a camp for war-displaced persons who had left Byumba préfecture.  

So Dallaire was told that UNAMIR had never tried to evacuate the children at Nyacyonga.  Why would UNAMIR try to evacuate those who were at the Gisimba orphanage?  I don't know what Dallaire said, but from what I was told, that was the response he received and that his proposal was turned down, a proposal to evacuate the children at Gisimba orphanage.  That was the information I got regarding the meetings.  Furthermore, young Interahamwe who did not want the evacuation of the children of that orphanage, said that those children should not be evacuated.
So Bagosora said that those young people did not see the basis for the evacuation.  Counsel, that is the information I was given.  When Dallaire realised that his proposal had been turned down, he left the meeting place and after he left, Bagosora ordered that weapons be brought from staff headquarters or from the ministry of defence, but it was simply said that the weapons were brought in by army officials and that they were distributed.  That is the information I received regarding those meetings.  
Q.	Witness, I know it's a little late, maybe we are getting tired.  But my question was actually when you had met with Jean Népomuscène Biziyaremye in which he had told you about the meeting of the 10th and the 11th of April.  When was it that you got that information from him? 
A.	Counsel, I thank you.  When he gave me that information, we were at the Kigali main prison.  
Q.	And approximately what year? 
A.	It must have been during the same period as the one during when Setiba gave me the same information.  It must have been around 2001, 2002, 2003, but the first person to give me the information was Setiba, followed by Biziyaremye.  But we often met and discussed other issues with regard to the Interahamwe and the situation at the time.  They told me what the Interahamwe were doing because they had a wealth of information.  
Q.	Now, Witness ALG, you've also testified that you received information about the meeting on the 10th or the 11th of April at the Diplomat hotel from Odette Nyirabagenzi, is that true? 
A.	True, sir.  
Q.	And can you tell us when you discussed the meeting with Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
A.	She too gave me information about the meeting and I believe it was in April, somewhere around the 10th or the 20th of April, and we were at the Kigali-ville préfecture office; it was around those dates.  We were in the Kigali-ville préfecture office.  
Q.	Nyirabagenzi is number 123 on the Prosecutor's spelling list.  

Was anyone else present when she gave you this information? 
A.	It was in April -- towards the month of May, it was during a meeting which had been convened by the préfet.  At the end of the meeting, we took some time to chat, so she informed me of that meeting.  I can't remember also whether she mentioned one or two meetings to me, but she mentioned Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Bagosora's names, telling me that those two people attended the same meeting.  
All what I'm doing is to tell you about what I know, so that you can perhaps analyse it, and then you will know whether it was one meeting or two meetings.  But all those people I have mentioned told me of those meetings.  
Q.	Was there anyone else present during your conversation about these meetings with 
Odette Nyirabagenzi? 
A.	No, no one else, but very close to where we were was a policeman escorting her.  I remember that there was a police officer close by.  I don't know the policeman's name; I did not know whether he overheard what we were saying.  
Q.	Did Odette Nyirabagenzi tell you that she herself had attended the meeting on the 10th or the 
11th of April at the Diplomat hotel? 
A.	I can't remember whether she told me she had attended the meeting or not.  
Q.	And did you receive any information about the meetings on the 10th or the 11th of April at the Diplomat hotel from any other person that we have not mentioned this afternoon? 
A.	Counsel, I believe those people whose names I've mentioned are the only ones who would talk about those meetings to me.  Yes, I think there's no one else.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may this be a good time to adjourn? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I was wondering whether I could make a request.  I think we are all happy to take a break tomorrow but there are a couple of things that we could resolve during the time when the Chamber is not here.  There are a number of translations that we wanted to place on the record.  There's also the transcripts from Tony Lucassen that were admitted pursuant to the Trial Chamber's decision of the 15th of November 2005.  And what I would like to suggest is that perhaps the Defence and members of the Prosecution team can convene here with someone from the registry and go through that material systematically so it can be numbered.  And then the Trial Chamber can admit it within a few minutes when we reconvene on Monday.  But this would require the assistance of the registry and perhaps of the interpreters, if Mr. Sow and Mr. Weyl think that the interpretation is necessary.  

There also are a number of exhibits that were apparently were mis-scanned into TRIM, so the titles of the exhibit don't match the content and these are things that need to be reviewed systematically with someone from the registry.  And if we all did it in one session, I think it would facilitate matters.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
Any response from the Defence to the proposal?  
MR. ROBINSON:
It's fine with me, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the others? 
MR. SOW:
It's fine with me, Mr. President.
MR. WEYL:
It's fine with me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And, Mr. Weyl and Mr. Sow, in particular, is it necessary for the interpreters to be present or would a session such as this nature be facilitated just with the assistance of the registry? 
MR. WEYL:
We would like the interpreters to be present, Mr. President.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, you can guess what my answer will be.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Madam Registrar, I'd ask you to make the appropriate arrangements.  

Would somebody suggest the time? 
MR. WEBSTER:
What about 10 o'clock?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that agreeable to everybody? 

I take it that the time is fixed at 10 o'clock, and Madam Registrar, I ask that you make the appropriate arrangements.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you are going to have an opportunity for a long weekend break because there are some matters requiring our attention tomorrow, which makes it necessary for us not to sit tomorrow.  So your testimony will resume on Monday morning.  I remind you as I have done on so many occasions before that during this or any other adjournment, you are not to discuss your testimony or the case with anybody.  

We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1732H)
