P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, 8 November 2005 for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr Registrar.  The appearances are the same.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can you hear me? 
THE WITNESS:
   Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you hear me, Madam Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
   Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  Your evidence is going to continue this morning.  You remain on the same oath that you took yesterday to tell the truth.  Do you understand that? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
WITNESS 920
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, good morning.
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	I am going to continue with the cross-examination.  And you'll recall that we're in open session, and you therefore shouldn't give any details that are likely to reveal your identity.  Yesterday, when I questioned you in closed session, you had earlier ascertained on a piece of paper details concerning your particulars and you confirmed that the information was correct.  And you said on that piece of paper that you are a member of a political party; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I do confirm it. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you became a member of that party?
A.	Yes, I joined that party in 2003. 
Q.	Prior to that date, had you been a member of any political party?
A.	No, I belonged to no party before then. 
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, I'm going to take us back to the statement that you gave in 2003.  I do not know if you have that statement before you, but it was handed over to you yesterday, I think.
MS FALL: 
Can the witness's statement of 23 July be handed over to her? 
MR. HOOPER:
The witness hasn't been shown this statement -- certainly not yesterday and, indeed, I don't have a hard copy of it other than one in English.  Can you give me one moment?

I don't have one, so if my friend can show me what she's got, I'd be grateful.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, this statement that was disclosed to us by the Defence as being a statement by this witness, I have made some annotations thereon, but I can show it to the Defence counsel.  Registry, can you please be of assistance to us?  Well, I have a copy that doesn't have any annotations thereon.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, thank you very much.  I have that document and, indeed, served it on the Prosecution, but it's dated the 27th or 25th, is it, of July 2005, and is effectively counsel's note.  It is not a statement.  It's never been signed by her; it's never been seen by her.  It was compiled by Svetlana Pouplard, who provided it to me.  When I got it from her, I forwarded it to the Prosecution.  So the position is this, that this witness was met -- met by me and Svetlana Pouplard and an interpreter in July when we were in Rwanda.  As far as I can remember, I met her at the Mille Collines Hotel, and I asked questions that were interpreted, and Svetlana Pouplard made a note.  This witness has never seen or signed that note, and it was then forwarded to me.  I took the view that it was a record of what she'd said and should be served on the Prosecution, and that is what has been done.

But I've got no problem with my friend referring to that, with all the obvious reservations that the nature of that document imposes.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Counsel Hooper, for all that information.  

But, as he said, this will not stop me from referring to that document.  I wish to ask the witness under what circumstances -- and I would like her to tell us this herself -- I would like her to tell us the circumstances under which she made this statement to Counsel Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Before we go any further, I just realised that it may be in those circumstances that the Judges themselves don't have a copy of that statement, though it was formally served.  If you don't have a statement, Mr. President, or your co-Judges, it wouldn't take very long for us, I hope, to provide one.  It would take the time it would take to get a laptop to a printer upstairs and to print some off.  I should think that would take five minutes.  

It was served -- incidentally, with considerable assistance of Mr. Hometowu of Court Management Services -- in electronic format.  So the document's been served in electronic format, as indeed have all the statements relating to Defence witnesses.

So as, indeed, you were possessed of witness statements for the Prosecution, we had hoped that the Court Management Service has provided you, the Judges, with the electronic copies relating to the witnesses nominated by the Defence.  If that hasn't happened, then I'd, frankly, hope that it does, immediately .
MR. PRESIDENT:
It has been served, and we are in fact getting access at the moment.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Now, if we're going to have a witness refer to a document, it's always perhaps helpful if you have it.  But I appreciate that the Court would not want to lose time in respect to that.  So, will you excuse me while I go and print that out?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I said it has been served.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I hadn't appreciated we were in the present tense.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have it.  One of us is currently accessing it at the moment.
MR. HOOPER:
Right; thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the other two have it.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, you may continue.
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Before proceeding, I would like to make it clear that we may refer to the Niyitegeka judgment to say that, as Counsel Hooper emphasised, questions were put to the witness and answers have been provided.  Of course, we understand that this statement should have been signed by the witness.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So I'm going to ask a question -- put the question to the witness under what circumstances the interview was conducted.

Did the witness hear my question?
A.	Yes, I heard your question, Madam Prosecutor.  I am going to tell you the circumstances under which I met Mr. Hooper.  When he came, he was looking for the person responsible for the centre in which I live, but then ************************************************************************** and those are the circumstances under which I met him.
Q.	What was the language of the interview?
A.	I made my statement in Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	Was there an interpreter?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us his name?
A.	I do not know his name.  I don't know the name of the interpreter, but the interpreter was speaking in Kinyarwanda, and both of us should understand one another. 
Q.	Do you recall the exact date on which the statement was given?
A.	No, I can't recall. 
Q.	What about the year, the approximate year?
A.	When he came to where we used to live, or where we lived, I don't quite recall the year.  All I remember is the year in which I met him at Hôtel des Mille Collines, and I know that I met him in 2005 then. 
Q.	Now, the statement that you gave when you met him in 2005, was it prior to or after this statement had been taken?
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I thought I just made it clear:  the date of the document you have is written at the top of your document, and I believe it's the 27th of July 2005, but I don't have your document with the date on it in front of me.  But it's written on the top of your document.  It's certainly July 2005.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would rather have the witness provide the answers.  I have a problem with dates, because in the document that I am availed of, I have the date of 23 July 2005.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, in that case, that would be the date of the document.  But you must bear in mind that while of course you've just asked this witness the date of the meeting, you can't ask her the date of the document, because it's not her document; it's in fact the document of Svetlana Pouplard.  But I've given you the circumstances of how it came to be drawn up, and I'm satisfied that it reflects my understanding of the conversation between me and this witness.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't know if the witness can answer the specific question I put to her.  To the extent that she said that she answered Counsel Hooper's question and remembers she met him in 2005, I would like her to tell us if this statement was given before or during the meeting that she had with Mr. Hooper in 2005.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the question is (inaudible).
MR. HOOPER:
Very well, but somewhat confusing, because the statement's contemporaneous with the meeting, and this witness has never seen the statement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was a suggestion from her answer that there was more than one meeting.
MR. HOOPER:
Right, okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought that counsel was endeavouring to clarify that.
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed, Mr. President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Thank you.  Madam Witness, can you please answer my question?
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor, I can provide you with an answer.  I told you that I remember having met him in July 2005, but I did not quite remember the date.  I know that I met him; he put questions to me concerning my place of residence.  I gave him my statement and went home.  I could never remember the date on which I met him.  Furthermore, I never saw my statement to be able to recall the date on which I met him. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I will take up that statement again when we will be talking about events.  Now, I am going to hand over to you a picture -- a photograph that was shown to you yesterday and I'll be more pointed as to the information that you gave us.  It will be more useful if you could put some information on that photograph that will be handed over to you.

The document is Exhibit P. 2 of the Prosecutor, page 14, picture no. 1, K0276234.
MS. FALL:  
I would like to reassure the witness that this document is confidential, and that all information that will be written on it will not be disclosed.

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, if you were handed a pen, can you put a cross indicating where your house is?  Can you put a cross on your house?
A.	I am done, Madam Prosecutor.
MS. FALL:
I am not through yet, Mr. --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not a problem.  We're just clarifying our access to the documents, which we have.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, we're going to proceed.  Now, on that document, can you put a circle on the house that belonged to Muhire, if you can locate it?

Then, to finish with that photograph, can you indicate the place at which you were standing -- the place at which you were -- when you noticed such an event, for instance, the arrival of the ambulance?  

And, to conclude, can you, if possible, write down the letter "A" on the spot at which the ambulance was parked.  Have you finished doing that, Madam Witness?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.
MS FALL:
Mr. Registry Clerk, can you, please?  
BY MS. FALL:
Thank you, Madam Witness.

Mr. President, for the record, I would wish that it be indicated that on the document the witness showed her house with a cross, which is located between two grey documents (sic).  While she showed where she was, she also indicated, using a circle, Muhire's house, and she also showed, not far from Muhire's house, the place at which the lorry was parked, and I would like that this document be entered as P. 72 and placed under seal in light of the information -- the privileged information that it contains.
MR. PRESIDENT:
A word came over the English translation.  The witness said that there was a "lorry" that was parked there?  
MS. FALL:
No, it was an ambulance.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, the Prosecutor used a word camion, which is translated as "lorry", Mr. President.  Thank you.  

BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P. 72 admitted, under seal.
	(Exhibit No.  P. 72 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, you may continue.
MS. FALL:
I'm obliged, Mr. President.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm now going to put questions to you in respect of the Gacaca court sessions, and I would like to ask you what was the purpose of the court?
A.	Those courts have the objective of seeking out the truth in respect of the events that occurred.
Q.	Can you be clearer?  When you are talking about the "truth", what does it represent?
A.	Let's reckon that there is a person who killed another, and since this happened in broad daylight, and let's say people denounced -- well, people denounced those who committed the acts during Gacaca court sessions and all information are entered into a register.  Furthermore, persons who are likely to be unjustly accused are known, and when they are found out they are exculpated and they are also heard during the Gacaca sessions.
Q.	Can you talk to us about how the Gacaca courts are organised?
A.	Insofar as the organisation of the Gacaca courts are concerned, people who used to live together in 1994 -- well, I'm talking about 10 households who come together and discuss the events that took place in their neighbourhood in 2004.  They also talk about persons who came after 1994.  They take down the names of the people who lived in the 10 households and, also, take down the names of those who lived outside those 10 households in the register.  So they enter all the information on what took place in the register, and I'm talking about information concerning the neighbourhood.  And after having gathered all that information, the said information is forwarded to the district or cellule office.
Q.	So, if I understand you well, your involvement in the proceedings is at a level of your neighbourhood?
A.	After the collection of information in our cellule, there is another phase --
Q.	Witness, I'm asking you -- and I would like you to answer precisely -- I want to know whether your participation in this process is limited to your neighbourhood.
A.	No.  I am also involved or concerned by the events that occurred in other neighbourhoods, especially as these events took place or occurred on a wider scale in a manner *********************************************.  
Q.	Do you also take part in meetings in other neighbourhoods; that is, for Gacaca?
A.	No, I do not take part in these meetings.  You go to the meetings if you are summoned to provide one explanation or another.
Q.	Witness, when did the collection of data that you referred to yesterday start?
A.	July, August and September, so after this collection of information in 2005, this is the confirmation stage -- October 2005, so the confirmation phase for this information.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that this procedure was started in order to get at the truth, especially to determine the criminals who had committed these murders.  In your statement you also said that there were no crimes committed in the centre.  So what was the purpose of starting a Gacaca process in your neighbourhood?
A.	I did not say that no crimes were committed in our neighbourhood.  Yesterday, I told you that two young people were beaten in our neighbourhood.  I told you that houses were destroyed.  I did not say that there were no crimes committed in our neighbourhood.  Crimes were committed.  But what I did say was that no one was killed in the neighbourhood.
Q.	What is your definition of a crime?
A.	A crime, in my view, is, for example, the persecution of people.
Q.	And is that all?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So we agree that crimes were committed in your neighbourhood?
A.	Yes, crimes were committed.  Houses were destroyed and people beat these two young people that I told you about.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I shall move on now to what happened before the accident of                   President Habyarimana's plane, and I'm going to follow the examination-in-chief conducted by Mr. Hooper.  

You said that before this event relationships -- or relations between Hutu and Tutsis in the community were very good and that there was no problem.  So how can you explain how the relationship was at the time between Hutus and Tutsis?
A.	I lived in the centre.  People shared everything -- people shared food and drink.  We did not have any problems in our community.
Q.	When you say that people were sharing, do you mean that they visited each other, they ate together, and that they practically lived together?
A.	For example, if someone bought a drink, then he would share it with someone else.  That's what I mean.
Q.	During that time, how was the political situation; was it stable?
A.	I thought the situation was stable, because there was no problem between political parties in our neighbourhood.
Q.	So there was no reason for soldiers to be stationed nearby, was there?
A.	There were soldiers, because in Byumba there was fighting.  We could hear gunshots and, actually, the gunfire became audible after the president's plane went down.
Q.	So we're referring to the period before the plane went down.  So when you do say that the situation was stable, it's not exactly true, because there was latent conflict.
A.	From 1990 there were military positions around there up to 1994.
Q.	And can you tell us what conflict started from 1990 inside Rwanda?
A.	It was in 1990 that the war started in Mutara and Ruhengeri regions.  From 1990 refugees took up abode in our region, because it was safe.  These refugees stayed in our region up till 1994.
Q.	Before we return to the matter of refugees, I would like to ask you:  who were the adversaries in this conflict?
A.	It was the Inkotanyi, who had come from outside the country.  Inkotanyi troops were fighting the government army.  But it was a conflict between the two armies.  Civilians were not involved, because the civilians left combat zones to move to areas where there was no conflict.
Q.	Who represented the Inkotanyi?
A.	How would I know?  I do not know who represented the Inkotanyi. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter did not hear the first part of Counsel's question.  Counsel, be so kind as to repeat. 
THE WITNESS:
I saw the Inkotanyi soldiers in 1994.  I had not seen them before that.  I only heard about them on the radio.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So who was in the Inkotanyi army in 1994?
A.	I just saw soldiers; I did not know their names.
Q.	Can you tell us what ethnic group this army was drawn from?
A.	I really couldn't tell you, but it was said that they were Tutsis who had left the country in 1959 and who wanted to come back home to their country.
Q.	And who made up the government army?
A.	The government army was composed of Rwandans, Tutsis, and Hutus.
Q.	So you say that on one side there were Tutsis and, on the other side, Tutsis and Hutus.  History does not actually reflect what you're saying.  You say that since 1990 there was a latent conflict and you say that the situation was stable.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, but it's improper for my friend to suggest that history reflects a different picture, when in fact, as a statement, that's quite inaccurate.  The FAR army was composed of both Hutu and Tutsi, and this witness has not said something that contradicts the available information; indeed, the position of the Prosecution in respect of other cases, notably the military case, that the FAR was not a military army, it was, or attempted to be, an homogenous army of Hutus and Tutsis, albeit that the Tutsis were, of course, in a relatively small number, given their proportions within the country.

So my friend is, I feel, amiss to contradict the witness's statement by a comment in that way.
MS. FALL:
Counsel, I suggested nothing, I'm sorry.  I only repeated what the witness herself said, because she said, on one side, there was an Inkotanyi Tutsi army and, on the other hand, there was the army of Hutus and Tutsis.  That is what I repeated.  I did not add anything.  I only referred to -- I only questioned the stability that she referred to and I wanted to ask whether, since 1990, there was this problem of Inkotanyi who had left in 1959 and who wanted to return and this led to the conflict.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, Madam Witness, from the point of view of stability, you'll agree with me that from 1990 the situation was not stable, wouldn't you?
A.	I'll admit it, but in our region there was no problem, even if there were refugees.  No one had been attacked until the soldiers arrived.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  You also acknowledge today that refugees had come to take up abode in your region, do you?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We shall move on to the event of the accident involving the president's aircraft.  You said that this is when relations deteriorated and you referred to a date; that is, the 9th of April 1994.  We all know that the plane was shot down on the 6th of April 1994.  What happened immediately after the aircraft went down?  I am, of course, referring to the 7th and the 8th, because you have started your story from the 9th.
A.	On the 7th and the 8th there was a radio announcement that people should stay in their homes, so we stayed in our homes.  But we could hear gunfire a little further off.  I'm referring to the 7th there.  And, on the 8th, we began to hear gunfire coming from the neighbouring commune of Rutare.  There was a lot of shooting.

On the 9th, that is when the fighting came closer to our area, and a certain person, Nyarwaya, who was a brigadier.  
Q.	So you're telling us about shooting and then you tell us about gunfire.  Is there a difference between the shooting that you heard on the 7th and the gunfire you heard on the 8th?
A.	On the 7th there was shooting that came from afar, but we could hear the sound of the gunfire approaching from the east, and it was on the 9th that we realised that the situation had changed.
Q.	Let's stay with the shooting, Madam Witness, the shooting that you heard on the 7th from afar.  I suppose you heard them while you were at home.  So you could hear them from afar.  So could you tell us in what direction or from what direction the sound of the shooting was coming?
A.	It seemed to us to be coming from the city of Kigali.  We could also hear shooting that seemed to come from Byumba on the other side.
Q.	And the shooting that you heard coming from Kigali, do you think that this was the sound of rifles, or it involved some other firearm?
A.	The noise was louder than normal gunfire.  Perhaps it might have been rifles.  I couldn't tell you.
Q.	So why did you say that there was a difference between gunfire and shooting?
A.	The difference is that the shooting that we heard on the 7th were further off than the one that we heard on the 8th.
Q.	Witness, we shall get to the 9th, since you're so keen to get there.  So what happened on that date?
A.	On the 9th we stayed in our neighbourhood.  We did not go far, and it is at 4 o'clock that Nyarwaya shot or fired into the air and said, "This is what one does when one is seeking war."  And when he did that, when he fired into the air, I saw him with my own eyes.
Q.	Madam Witness, where were you at that time?
A.	I was at the centre, and he was near to the brick house that you can see on the photograph.  You can see the house on the photograph.
Q.	So you no longer complied with instruction to the effect that you should stay in your home?
A.	******************************************, and I was in the street at the centre.
Q.	You have not answered my question.  I just asked you whether you no longer complied with the instruction to stay at your home.
A.	It was not said that we should stay inside the houses.  What was forbidden was moving, for example, from one hill to another, and people still came to drink at the centre, but these were the people who lived in the neighbourhood.  They didn't come from afar.
Q.	So why did you say a few moments ago that you stayed at your home on the 7th and the 8th, as per the instructions that were given?
A.	I stayed at my home, but not inside the house.  I could go outside and go out into the street, but I still stayed at the centre.
Q.	So you stayed at your home, but outside it; is that right?
A.	Yes, I could move about the centre in the street without going further.
Q.	When Brigadier Nyarwaya arrived, was he alone?
A.	He was alone.
Q.	How do you explain his firing into the air?
A.	He came, and he said, "This is what people who are looking for war do," and he fired into the air.  It was as if he was starting the war in that region.
Q.	And who would the war be against?
A.	He didn't explain; he just fired into the air.  And we went back into our houses, and from that moment we began to hide.  We sometimes spent the night in sorghum fields and, in the end, we left the centre and we went away.
Q.	Madam Witness, we shall return to this incident.  You said that Brigadier Nyarwaya came alone; he shot -- fired into the air; he did not wound anyone, and you became afraid from that point and you went into hiding.  So is it this single gunshot, which wounded no one, that frightened you so much?
A.	Yes, that is what frightened us.  We did not know what was going on.  All the Hutus and Tutsis became afraid, and they went into hiding.
Q.	You tell us that the Hutus and the Tutsis all became afraid and went into hiding.  But you say that afterwards houses were destroyed and that these houses that were destroyed were the houses of Tutsis.  So how can you say that relations were good and that there were no problems, if the only houses that were destroyed were Tutsis' houses?
A.	The day they came to destroy houses, it was the Interhamwe who came.  It was the first time that we were seeing Interhamwe; we had only heard about them.  These Interhamwe were led by one     Ephrem Nyirigera, and when he arrived he said, "I want all Hutus to find weapons."  Some took clubs, others machetes.  And he said to them, "I'm going to show you how you should destroy Tutsi houses."  And he said that all the Tutsi houses should be destroyed.  And they broke down the doors and they began to loot the property that was in the homes of these Tutsis.
Q.	I observe today that you refer to "clubs" whereas in your statement, in your testimony yesterday, you did not make any reference to "clubs".
A.	It is true I did not mention this yesterday -- I forgot.  But now I remember; I know where these clubs were gathered.  Actually, it was just bits of wood that had been gathered in a place somewhere.  They took these bits of wood and used them, and it is the wood that they used to hit these young people.
Q.	I am pleased to observe that Defence witnesses can also forget things.  Madam Witness, we shall now return to this incident of the two Tutsis who were beaten up.  Can you recall, for our benefit, the circumstances of this beating?
A.	They were made to lie down; they were beaten up.  I don't know how they were caught, but in the data collection for Gacaca sessions it was said that one Vianney Nkurunziza called them and said someone wanted to speak to them, so they went.  So when they got there, they began to beat them.
Q.	So this is a new addition that you're -- this is something new that you are adding to your testimony.  Yesterday you said that you were present and that it was when they were returning from prayers, they being Pentecostals, that they were called and beaten.  And you said that you were present during that event.
A.	I said that they were called.  I did not say who called them, because you didn't ask me that question.  I was not really that close to them.  I've showed you where my house was and I showed you where they were beaten up.  If you wish, I could still indicate on the photograph, for your benefit.
Q.	Everything you said yesterday was taken down.  We can verify this.  You never made any reference to people calling them.  You said that they were intercepted when they were returning from prayers; that they had done absolutely nothing; and that they were beaten up.  
A.	I did not see the person who called them.  I told you that I learnt of this during Gacaca sessions when information on what occurred was collected.  Yesterday I told you what I saw with my own eyes.
Q.	Yesterday you told us that you were an eyewitness to these events and that the people who beat them came at around midday and went away between 3 and 4 p.m.  This is what you said, and the transcript on page 22, line 3, indicates this, starting from line 3.
A.	That is true, but, as far as the hours are concerned, it's been a long time, so the hours may not be precise.  They may be -- there may be some lapse between the time that things happened and the hours that I gave, so I already gave approximate hours.
Q.	I would like to know, however, if indeed this took place at about 12 midday and that the event ended at about 3 to 4 p.m.
A.	Yes, the event occurred at about those hours, and it was towards the evening that they were taken to the hospital.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, for that clarification.  When the event occurred, were you alone?
A.	No, there were other persons with me.  In particular, I was with one of my neighbours when we were witness to the scene.  One of the soldiers stopped people from coming close to where the young people were being beaten up and the people were threatened.
Q.	Apart from your neighbour, were there other persons?
A.	I was with that neighbour, but there were other persons close to those other houses.  But, generally speaking, people were rather afraid and they didn't come very close to where the event was taking place.
Q.	About how many people were there?
A.	Are you talking about the spot on which they were being beaten up?  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can Counsel repeat the last question, because we didn't hear it.  The microphone was not yet switched to the English booth. 
THE WITNESS:
I was in front of my house with my neighbour and I could not see everyone who was witnessing the scene, but during the Gacaca sessions most people stated that they had witnessed the scene.  I would say there were about 10 people living in that centre who stated that they saw what happened on that day.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Would you be in a position to give us the names of those persons?
A.	I can give you the names of those who were living at the centre, but what I can confirm to you is that I -- since I witnessed the scene -- is -- well, I can talk to you about my neighbour, my husband and myself, who were three for -- three of us in our own group who were witnessing the scene.  I can also give you the names of the other persons who lived at the centre, who probably witnessed the scene.
Q.	Are you saying that you can give the name?  
THE INTERPRETER:
(No interpretation)

MS. FALL:
I crave your indulgence, Mr. Interpreter, and I'll try to make an effort.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that you were with your neighbour, you were with your husband, and then you've told us that you can give us the names of people who were living at the centre.  Besides those people who used to live at that centre, were there other people who were present but who did not live at that centre?
A.	I could not see everyone.  I was merely in front of the spot on which the scene was unfolding, but I can talk to you about the trader whose name was Ndoli, who was close to those young persons at the time they were being beaten up.  And he was standing near Muhire's house, the house I pointed out to you on the photograph.
Q.	So, Madam Witness, you're telling us that for a period of over four hours, if I go by the time periods you gave us, you were present and you were observing the events that were taking place.  
A.	No.  Well, it could happen that we returned to our home, but this doesn't mean that they stopped beating them up, and when you came back, you saw that they continued to beat them up, and sometimes they'd take a break.  
Q.	So, if I understand you, you are saying that for the entire period that events took place, you were not an eyewitness?
A.	Yes, I didn't stay there for the entire period of four hours looking on at what was happening.
Q.	You also testified, Madam Witness, that following the beating, those two persons were in rather a terrible state and that they had to be taken to Kayanga.  Can you tell us who took them to Kayanga?
A.	It were the inhabitants of the centre who took them to Kayanga.  It is the conseiller who instructed people to take the people to the hospital, and that's what they did.
Q.	Who is the conseiller who issued the order?
A.	His name was Laurent Ntamuhanga.
Q.	Would you be in a position to spell out the name to us, please?
A.	Yes, I could do that.  N-T-A-M-U-H-A-N-G-A, Ntamuhanga.
Q.	In your evidence yesterday, why didn't you refer to the conseiller?
A.	I believe I -- sent those people away, take them to the hospital.  No one asked me the name of the person who had given orders to the inhabitants of the place to take them to the hospital, but I believe that I gave evidence to the effect that those two people were taken to the dispensary by members of the population.
Q.	But you are giving such details that I believe you could have talked about that conseiller, as you did in your statement of 23rd of July 2005.
A.	I believe this information will be found in my statement of 23 July.  I think I mentioned it.
Q.	That is exactly what I've just told you, Madam Witness.
A.	Yes, I'm telling you that I cannot remember all the details.  I forgot that detail yesterday.
Q.	You tell us that those persons were taken to the Kayanga centre.  For how long did they stay in that institution?
A.	They were conveyed there on Tuesday evening.  They stayed there on Wednesday and on Thursday, and on Friday that is when we got information, since we were no longer in our house -- in any case, information got to us to the effect that they had been killed.
Q.	Madam Witness, yesterday you told us that it was on Monday evening that they were taken away; that they stayed there on Wednesday, Thursday.  Today you are telling us that it was on Tuesday that they were taken to the dispensary.  What exactly was the date?
A.	Well, I will crave your indulgence here.  I believe I made a mistake.  They were taken to the hospital on Monday -- Monday evening.
Q.	Thank you.  But you tend to make mistakes a bit too often.  How did you learn that they stayed there for so long at the hospital?
A.	It's people who came from Kayanga who gave us information.  They found us where we had taken refuge.
Q.	Would you be in a position to give us the identity of those who informed you or who gave you the information?
A.	One of those persons was called Béatrice Mukagakwisi, but she is dead today.  The other person who was with her was Éline Mukantabana.  They were sisters.
Q.	And where is the other sister today?
A.	The other sister lives at Gasabo.
Q.	Madam Witness, at what time did you learn that the Kayanga centre had been attacked?
A.	I got wind of this from those people who gave us information.  When those people found us where we had taken refuge, I cannot tell you the exact date, because in that period we could not retain dates.  All I can tell you is that this happened in the month of April.
Q.	Madam Witness, you did tell us that the events occurred on the 11th -- that is, on Monday, the 11th -- and you stated that they were transported on the same day in the evening to Kayanga and that they stayed there right up to Thursday, the 14th, and that it was on Friday, the 15th, that they were attacked and killed.  Is it logical to think like that?
A.	We were informed that those people were killed on Friday.  I don't know if the attack took place on that same Friday.  Well, we wanted to get information on what had become of those people, and we were told that they had been killed on Friday morning.  I did not know if it was on that day that the Kayanga attack took place.  We were told that those young people had been killed and that their patient minders, as well as their sisters who had brought them food, were also killed on that Friday.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I would like to tell you that we are in lock step insofar as the persons who were killed at the centre were concerned -- are concerned.  I'm talking about the young persons and their sisters, because we have the same information.  Now, insofar as the dates are concerned, you told us that it was on Monday, the 11th, that you had realised, or that you had witnessed the beating of those people.  You told us that on Thursday and Friday, even if they had been killed, you don't know exactly the date on which the centre was attacked; it so happens that the attack took place on Friday, the 15th.
A.	It is after the date of the 15th that we learned that those people had been killed, but when we were given the information, we were told that those people had been killed on Friday, the 15th.  I wasn't an eyewitness to what took place at the Kayanga dispensary.  We were only informed about what happened there by other people.
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  We therefore agree on that date of the 15th.  Madam Witness, do you know how many attacks took place at the Kayanga centre?  I'm referring to the massacres that took place at the centre; how many of them occurred?
A.	Well, I think you'll have to excuse me there.  I wasn't at the Kayanga dispensary and I'm not in a position to tell you the circumstances under which the attacks were carried out at the Kayanga dispensary, unless you probably ask those who were at Kayanga dispensary at the time.
Q.	At the Gacaca proceedings, did you hear, or didn't you hear, of the massacres that took place at Kayanga centre?
A.	At the Gacaca court sessions and, insofar as the Kayanga massacres are concerned, well, if we take into account the information that we received, I was able to note that one person pleaded guilty of having killed people at Kayanga, and it is only one person from Gasabo who acknowledged that he killed -- who confessed to having killed people at Kayanga.
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know that corpses of victims of the Kayanga centre were exhumed in April last year?
A.	Yes, it is last year that those corpses were exhumed.
Q.	Are you also aware that it was established that there were 100 victims at that centre?
A.	No, I didn't get wind of the number of persons who were exhumed.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, one must necessarily distinguish between victims killed at the Kayanga health centre from actual bodies exhumed in Kayanga, where there were, of course, other killings over a period of days, indeed by both sides.  So one cannot draw from the fact of an exhumation that those exhumed were killed in particular circumstances, certainly without further evidence.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we can bring evidence showing that a census was carried out concerning specifically the victims at Kayanga.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, we're going to proceed.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, if such evidence was to be adduced, you've had ample opportunity to adduce it as part of your case.  I, for my part, have never seen or had disclosed to me any such information.  So, if you have such a document, I would ask that it be disclosed to me, please.
MS. FALL:
We'll do that, Counsel.  I will go back quickly to the problem of refugees.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Yesterday, you told us that there was no refugee in your commune, which is inconsistent with what you just told us a while ago when you were talking about the events beginning from 1990.  You confirmed to us that, indeed, there were, or there had been refugees who had come to your region.  So I do not think that, if you confirm this, we need to emphasise the point any further.
A.	When I stated that I did not see refugees fleeing near the centre where we heard gunshots, I did not know that you were referring to refugees that had been there for four years in our area.  Yesterday, I thought you were talking to me about refugees that were fleeing when they heard the gunshots at the centre.
Q.	Madam Witness, I thought my question was very clear, and you answered pointedly that there were no refugees, but I'm pleased to note that your position has changed and that you are accepting the fact that there were refugees who had been living there for virtually four years in your area.  

We're going to move on to another line of questioning now and take up the events that took place on the 12th with the arrival of the ambulance.

Mr. President, I do not know if I can carry on, because we usually take our break at 10:30, unless I'm mistaken, and since I'm going to broach a line of questioning that will take quite some time, since it's a new topic, I don't know if we can take the break now and begin the line of questioning when we resume deliberations.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can take the recess now.  

Madam, we take a short recess in the mornings and we'll take a break now.  We'll resume in about 15 or 20 minutes' time.
	(Court recessed at 1027H)
	(Pages 1 to 17 by Maureen Dunn)








(Court resumed at 1056H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we can now resume.  Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, we shall now come to the events that occurred on the 12th with the arrival of the ambulance of the commune in which were three men that you have called -- whose names you have given; that is Ephrem Nyirigera, Michel Nyarwaya and Nzaramba.  So you said that you knew Michel Nyarwaya.  Was it the first time you saw him in the commune on the day you saw him?  
A.	Yes.  No, no, no; I had seen him before.  
Q.	Can you say under what circumstances you used to see him?
A.	I used to see him when he came to the centre for a drink.  I could also see him go past in the street.  He lived in the neighbouring secteur of Rutanga. 
Q.	Was it on those occasions alone, the occasions you have described to us, that you saw him? 
A.	I also used to see him in the market square.  He was a policeman.  He moved about often in the area. 
Q.	Apart from these circumstances, did you see him often? 
A.	Those were the only places where I used to see him.  
Q.	Was Michel Nyarwaya the person who fired into the air on the 9th of April? 
A.	Yes, it's the same person. 
Q.	So you also saw him on that occasion and not only on the occasions that you have referred to? 
A.	Yes, I saw him when he fired into the air.  I used to see him.  I also saw him when he came on board the ambulance. 
Q.	Witness, do you know where Michel Nyarwaya is at present? 
A.	No, I don't know where he is. 
Q.	Did you obtain any information about him as part of the Gacaca procedures? 
A.	Yes, his name was mentioned during the Gacaca procedures. 
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which his name was mentioned? 
A.	It was said that he had fired into the air and it was also said that he threatened members of the public.  In Gacaca procedures, there is a category of person who is considered as one of the perpetrators of the events, and he is in that category. 
Q.	How did you get to know the person named Nzaramba in a way that you were able to recognise him? 
A.	I knew Nzaramba because he was a driver for the commune. 
Q.	And you told us that he's dead.  Do you know how he died? 
A.	I do not know how he died, but after the war I met his wife, and it is she who told me that her husband had died.  I did not ask her how he had died. 
Q.	And Ephrem Nyirigera, how did you get to know him? 
A.	He lived near the commune office and he was a native of Kayanga secteur, ********************. 
Q.	You say that **************************************************************************.  Did you know him well?  What was your relationship with him? 
A.	I had not seen him for a long time because he lived in Gishaka secteur and I lived in ************ secteur.  We had all left our native secteurs, but I had known him for a long time. 
Q.	Do you know where he is now? 
A.	No, I don't. 
Q.	Now, about the ambulance, can you tell us how many times you saw the ambulance? 
A.	You're referring to that day?  
Q.	I am asking you how many times you saw the ambulance and the dates on which you saw this ambulance.  
A.	The ambulance came to the centre only once. 
Q.	What date was that? 
A.	It was the 12th; it was a Tuesday. 
Q.	You described this ambulance as being similar to a communal transport taxi.  Were there any signs to indicate that this was, in fact, an ambulance? 
A.	The ambulance had a siren on top and it was generally used to carry sick people. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry to interrupt.  My recollection, certainly of the English translation yesterday, was that there was no mention of a taxi, but the vehicle was described as being -- I've forgotten the exact words -- a public utility vehicle.  I don't think there was a word "taxi" involved in it.  And perhaps my friend could just establish what that was.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, it may be an issue of translation, so maybe you can just ask again, to clarify it.  I also noticed the same thing.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, I asked you -- I told you that yesterday you said that you saw the ambulance, and you said that this was described as a communal transport -- common transport vehicle.  I don't know how this was described in French.  But I asked you why you thought that it was an ambulance.  
A.	We knew that it was an ambulance because it used to carry sick people.  I already knew the ambulance, but I do not know the number of the ambulance. 
Q.	Now, you said before that it had a siren, and now you said that it used to carry sick people.  
A.	Yes, it did carry sick people, and it was blue. 
Q.	On the first day when you saw the ambulance, where was it parked? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, again -
 
THE WITNESS:
I have showed you the place where the ambulance was parked on the photograph.  
MR. HOOPER:
The witness has said she only saw the ambulance once, so it's a little confusing to put it to her, with respect, in those circumstances, "Where was it when you first saw it?"  She's only claimed to have seen it once.  I say "only seen it once" in the context of these events. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I saw it only once in Ndatemwa, but I usually saw the ambulance elsewhere because it was used at the dispensary.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I shall repeat my question, and I shall ask Mr. Hooper to be more attentive.  On the 12th, when you saw the ambulance, where was it parked? 
A.	I indicated the place to you on the photograph. 
Q.	Was the place that you indicated close to Muhire's house? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Were the people in the vehicle able to talk with Muhire? 
A.	I saw those people when they came down -- out of the ambulance.  I did not, however, observe whether or not they spoke to Muhire, but I did see them get out of the ambulance. 
Q.	You have told us where you were.  Can you tell us how long the ambulance stayed at that place? 
A.	The ambulance stayed for about five minutes. 
Q.	And during these five minutes, what did these people do? 
A.	These people came out of the ambulance and stayed standing for those five minutes.  I do not really know whether they spoke to Muhire, but they were near Muhire's house.  However, I was not able to find out whether they did speak to him.  
Q.	So during those five minutes when these people -- these three people stayed standing up, what did they do? 
A.	Ephrem was behind the ambulance.  I couldn't see Muhire very clearly.  Perhaps he was covered by the vehicle.  I have showed you where I was.  I saw the vehicle stop, and we wondered what was going on.  We wanted to know what this vehicle had come to do there.  After a few minutes the vehicle left again.  We did not know what had really happened. 
Q.	So, contrary to what you said yesterday, you said that you could see what was going on very clearly.  There is a contradiction with what you say today, because you couldn't say whether Muhire was there; you couldn't see him very clearly.  So you are not able to tell us exactly what happened, are you? 
A.	I did not see Muhire near the vehicle.  I do not know whether he was on the other side of the vehicle.  What I can tell you is that I did not see Muhire. 
Q.	So what you observed is that these people came in the ambulance, got out of it, stayed there some five minutes and went away again.  You do not know what was going on.  Whereas, in your statement, you said that they had spoken with some people for some moments and then they went away again.  
A.	I saw no one.  I only recognised Ephrem, but I did not see any of the people near the ambulance. 
Q.	This is totally different from what you said.  

Now we shall move on to the 13th.  What happened on the 13th?  You saw a vehicle.  This time, it was not an ambulance; it was, you say, a Daihatsu.  Can you describe this vehicle to us?  
A.	This vehicle was also blue and it came from the direction of Rutanga.  On board this vehicle there were these refugees who had come from 1990.  They came from Rutanga camp. 
Q.	How do you know that they were coming from Rutanga camp? 
A.	We heard the sound of the vehicle's engine.  I was with my baby whom I was carrying on my back.  I saw people get out of the vehicle.  They were armed with machetes.  I left the place in a hurry.  I didn't look too closely.  

That morning there was a man who came at about 9 o'clock, and he told me to hide, and I asked him why and he said that they were going to kill me.  So when I heard this vehicle, I immediately thought of that other vehicle that had come the day before and I was -- I became afraid.  I fled and I went past near these people.  No one stopped me.  I saw them take up these pieces of wood and these machetes.  In particular, I saw Ephrem, who was wearing a machete at his belt, and I went to hide.  The place where I was hiding was not far from the centre, and I could hear how the doors of houses were being broken down. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have not answered my question and you have told a completely different story from the one that you told yesterday.  At no point did you refer to the person who asked you to hide.  
A.	I did not talk about this person. 
Q.	So I said that at no point did you talk about this person.  You have not answered my question.  I would like you to answer it.  You told us that these refugees came from Rutanga camp.  
MR. HOOPER:
My friend is making quite an emphatic assertion here that the witness is now telling a quote "completely different story", unquote.  At some point prior to this immediate testimony, my recollection is that this witness, either in-chief or perhaps yesterday, in questions -- or answers in reply to my friend, certainly prior to this aspect of her evidence, she said that she'd received a warning.  She didn't go into details, but she mentioned that she'd received a warning -- a warning that morning.  So I just point that out.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, the transcripts are there and they reflect everything that was said.  I am sure that they will be closely examined.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So I repeat that what you say is completely different from what you said yesterday.  I shall return to that.  I shall put my question to you once again, and I am still waiting for an answer.  You said that refugees were coming from Rutanga camp.  I am going to ask -- I am asking you how you knew that these refugees in this vehicle were coming from Rutanga camp.  
A.	These people had been living in the region for four years.  We knew them.  And I went right past them.  
Q.	When you went right past them, how long did that take you?  Did you just walk past, or did you stop for a bit? 
A.	I did not stop. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many refugees were in this vehicle? 
A.	I really couldn't give you an exact figure, but I can tell you approximately how many people there were.  I didn't stop to count them.  There were about 15 people. 
Q.	So, 15 people, you say.  You go past quickly.  You don't stop, but you are able to recognise these 15 people as refugees coming from Rutanga camp? 
A.	Yes.  Besides, the people who were at the centre and those who had helped them to destroy houses talked about this during the Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you emphasized that you were an eyewitness, but I get the feeling that you refer a lot to what was said during Gacaca sessions.  

I shall move on to another question.  Apart from these refugees, were there other people in the vehicle?  
A.	There were also communal policemen. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many communal policemen there were? 
A.	I saw three, but since they were not wearing their uniforms, I can only tell you that I saw three, and I recognised one of them.  I went past very quickly, but I can give you one -- the names of one of these policemen. 
Q.	So, walking quickly, you recognised 15 refugees, three communal policemen, including one whom you know.  Madam Witness, can you tell us how many people this vehicle could carry? 
A.	I do not know the capacity of that vehicle, but it's fairly large.  
Q.	Can you describe it to us? 
A.	It was a Daihatsu.  It was a pickup, with space in the back. 
Q.	Can you tell us where this vehicle was parked? 
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  I can describe the place where the vehicle was parked to you, but it can not be seen on the photograph that you showed to me. 
Q.	Witness, you told us yesterday in your testimony that you noticed that the person known as Ephrem had machetes at his belt.  This is on page 24, line 35 of the transcript, "He had machetes at his belt."  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In your statement of 23rd July, you say that this person called Ephrem had a bag, a small bag, containing grenades.  So what is the truth?  Did he have a bag with grenades, or did he have machetes? 
A.	He had machetes and a bag containing grenades. 
Q.	So, he had both of them? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But in your statement of the 23rd, you only referred to the grenades, and in yesterday's testimony, you only referred to machetes.  
A.	When I made my statement on the 23rd, I forgot some details.  Some of these details I remembered afterwards because I hadn't had the time to think about it.  This was an event that happened a long time ago.  It is entirely possible that after my testimony here today, I will remember things that I have not mentioned here. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that afterwards these people went to destroy the homes of Tutsis.  Can you tell us to whom these houses belonged?  More precisely, did you know the owners of the houses? 
A.	Yes, I knew the owners of the houses. 
Q.	Are you able to give us their names? 
A.	Two houses were destroyed.  They belonged to Nsengimana:  one was his home and the other was his shop.  His sister, whose name was Théophile Nyirakimonyo also had her house destroyed.  Gatera's house was also destroyed.  This house belonged both to Gatera and another person called Rwiyamira.  Those are the houses that were destroyed in the centre of Ndatemwa. 
Q.	Can you tell us with what these houses were destroyed, or how they were destroyed? 
A.	Ephrem came and told them to destroy the houses belonging to Tutsis, in order to be able to loot food supplies from there.  That's the first thing he said when he got to the centre at the time I was getting by.  
Q.	Beside those houses that were mentioned, were there other houses that were destroyed? 
A.	Those were the only houses that were destroyed at the centre, but a bit further away, other houses were also destroyed.  One of such houses belonged to Ntawugayumugabo -- Ntawugayumugabo, and the other house belonged to his elder brother.  Those were houses that had not yet been occupied, but all those persons are dead.  
Q.	Madam Witness, how do you explain the inconsistency that I notice in the statement that you gave on the 23rd of July, when you tell us that, in the course of the destruction of the houses, no grenade was used, and in the statement you gave yesterday, you said a grenade was used to destroy, particularly Rucikoma's house? 
A.	No.  Yesterday I did not say that grenades were used to destroy houses.  I told you that Ephrem brought out a grenade which he used to threaten people, telling them that he was going to kill them if they did not destroy the houses belonging to Tutsis to look for food.  He did not use the grenade.  
Q.	I'm sorry, Madam Witness, in your testimony you do say that when he got to Rucikoma's house -- probably my pronunciation is bad -- they threw a grenade, and since there was a military position there, the soldiers reacted and the attackers fled.  
A.	That happened at a different location, a bit farther away.  I hadn't talked about that yet.  That happened in a different secteur, indeed.  That didn't happen at Kamusengo.  I haven't talked about that yet.  They also destroyed Makaka's house at a different locality.  I haven't talked about those events here.  That is when they threw the grenade.  We heard the grenade explode.  We were not present.  We did not know exactly what happened.  We heard so much noise from explosions, and we heard a gunshot fired by a soldier.  I could see the attackers when they were fleeing, after the gunshot. 
Q.	You have just stated that you were not present; you didn't know what happened.  How, therefore, did you get to know that those were the houses that had been destroyed?  Who gave you the information? 
A.	But that happened in my locality, and it has been a long while.  How is it that I wouldn't know the identity of the persons whose houses had been destroyed?  
Q.	Madam Witness, I am not talking about the identity of the owners of the houses.  You said the events took place in your locality, not far from where you were living.  You were present, witnessing the events.  Finally, you don't know what happened.  You merely saw the attackers as they fled.  You said there was a military position and the soldier fired a shot, and then all those attackers took flight.  You said you were a witness to all those events, and finally you accepted you were not there and that you didn't know what happened.  
A.	I'm going to explain things to you.  I was able to see what was happening at the Ndatemwa centre.  As to Ntawugayumugabo's house, I could witness the scene from a distance.  I was in the courtyard of the house where I had taken refuge.  I cannot tell you exactly who destroyed the house.  That happened a little farther away.  I have talked to you about Rucikoma's house yesterday.  I did not witness the scene personally.  I was not present at the spot, but we did hear the gunshots, and when we asked what had happened, this was explained to us. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you say that you were in the courtyard of the house.  You said you witnessed the scene from afar.  How could you, from the courtyard of a house, see what was happening outside, unless there was no fence surrounding the house? 
A.	That is possible.  I could see from afar the scene.  This probably is not possible for you, but if you went to the location today, you would see that from where I was standing I could witness the scene.  
Q.	Well, I would have liked to see such a miracle indeed.  Now, you are talking about a military position.  Where was that military position? 
A.	No, the position was not very near our house.  It was near the Gasabo primary school.  
Q.	Madam Witness, why didn't you provide all this detailed information in your testimony yesterday? 
A.	No, yesterday I was answering questions that were put to me.  I gave my answers on the basis of the questions that were put to me.  
Q.	I believe at some times you gave such details, even without questions being put to you, since you are talking about soldiers who had to react and that is how the attackers fled and that that location was not far from where you were standing, whereas right now you have just said the opposite, that it wasn't on the same location that the events occurred.  
A.	Well, we were not -- the position wasn't near our place, but the soldiers who were stationed at that position moved about.  The soldier who made the gunshots was moving about and he is the one who shot in the air.  He was alone.  This was a soldier that we knew very well -- his name was 
	Nahayu (phonetic) -- since the position had been on that location for a long time. 
Q.	So this was a military position where there was only one soldier? 
A.	There were many of them, but it used to happen that a soldier or two soldiers could move about amongst the population in order to ensure the security of the population.  All of them did not move about at the same time. 
Q.	Madam Witness, for a person who was afraid and who had to hide, I am afraid that you did move about quite a bit yourself.  
A.	I didn't move about a lot.  I left my house; I left the centre in order to go and take refuge at a location I mentioned to you, and since I knew that the people intended to kill others, I saw the group that came to the centre in order to loot.  They had not yet started killing.  So everyone who felt targeted sought a sure place where they could go into hiding.  But this did not stop me from seeing a number of things. 
Q.	Madam Witness, since you are talking to us about where you went into hiding -- indeed, in a closed session yesterday you gave the name of the person in whose house you took refuge -- and, ultimately, where does that person live? 
A.	The person lives a bit above the centre.  I think that between the centre and the person's house, there is only one other house.  I believe there is a distance of about 300 metres separating that person's house and the centre. 
Q.	In your testimony or your statement, you mentioned the 300 metres between that person's house and André Muhire's.  
A.	No.  That's the distance between my house and Muhire's house, and the distance was about ***********.  As for the distance between where I was hiding at the centre, I think I talked to you about 300 metres. 
Q.	Even there, I would like us to refer to the transcript because the assessment of distance you are giving is different from what you said yesterday.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, we can take up time.  She said exactly the same thing yesterday:  300 metres from where she was hiding to Muhire's house, she said, and she lived, she estimated, ********** from Muhire's house.  I think they are two quite separate and distinct measurements that she gave evidence on, but if you want to pursue it, please.  
MS. FALL:
I probably will have to dig further into the issue because she did talk about 300 metres yesterday vis-à-vis the centre, and yesterday she was referring to Muhire's house.  There's another contradiction.  In that respect, I am not going to talk about a distance again.  There's another contradiction concerning the distance between her house and Muhire's and the distance between the distance she gave yesterday and the distance she is giving today.  I think we really need to look into that and ascertain matters. 
MR. HOOPER:
Let's do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got a copy of the transcript?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you got a copy of the official transcript?  Because you may note it coincides with what you said, but I don't have the official transcript as yet and I didn't want to rely on my note at this stage.  But I think my note coincides with what Mr. Hooper has said, but I don't have the official transcript as yet.  
MR. HOOPER:
I have the, I think, official draft transcript, where she says this in the English: "It was my neighbour."  

"Roughly speaking, how far from your home was that address where you stayed?"  "It was my neighbour.  In fact, I think that between the centre and his house, I mean the place where the people had stopped, I think it's about 300 yards -- 300 metres from where that person lives and the place where the vehicle stopped."  

There maybe a further reference.  I don't know if there's any other reference.  That's the only reference to that I can find, and that's at the bottom of page 26, at line 31 onwards, 31 to 35.  And it's a small point.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am also looking for -- 

Yes, Mr. President, indeed, I think I'm the one who's mistaken.  This is what I saw in the French version.  She did indeed talk about where the vehicle was parked.  So I withdraw what I said concerning the distances.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that you had taken refuge at that person's house, and indeed his house was at some 300 metres from the centre and from where the vehicle was parked.  Do you know that person well? 
A.	Are you referring to the person who hid me?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	Yes, I knew that person very well.  He was a family friend. 
Q.	While you were at that person's house, were you alone there?
A.	I was with his wife.  My husband later joined me there.
Q.	And where were your children? 
A.	I was carrying the youngest child on my back.  As for the two others, they were living at ********** with their grandmother.  I told you that I hail from **************, I think.  
Q.	You tell us that you know that person well, which is justified by the fact that you went and took refuge at his home.  And what was the person's behaviour or attitude at the centre? 
A.	That person never went to the centre because he was ill.  Even if he hadn't been ill, I trusted him.  I believe that he wouldn't have taken part in the massacres. 
Q.	Would you be surprised to know that that person has been on the list since 1996?  I'm talking about the list of persons who are known to be criminals.  
A.	That would come as a surprise to me. 
Q.	And yet that is what happens, because this person is listed as one of the most well-known criminals in Rwanda.  
A.	No, that person's name is not on the list of those who perpetrated genocide.  Up until date we know all the persons who distinguished themselves during the genocide, and we don't know about the name of that person up until today. 
Q.	It is possible for us to disclose a document on which that person's name figures as being one of the genocide perpetrators.  
A.	I would really like to see that document, Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. FALL:
If the Court will give me a minute.  

Mr. President, with your leave, I'm going to hand over a document.  
MR. HOOPER:
What is the origin of this document?  What group of documents is it drawn from?  When and who has drawn this document?  And I notice that it relates to the préfecture of Kibungo and to a commune of Kayonza.  What is the relationship between that commune and the one that concerns us?  To what extent are the Prosecution, in proffering this evidence, sure that Édouard Turatsinze, that appears at No. 28 of this document, is the same man that we're talking about?  Do the Prosecution have further evidence to connect Édouard Turatsinze, the name that's been mentioned by the witness, with this man?  And what's he doing in Ndatemwa?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we drew that document from Zaire, after having collected the necessary information.  We reserve ourselves the right to proffer further evidence showing that Édouard Turatsinze is the same person in question, and we'll do this subsequently.  We would also like to reserve the right to introduce this document as a Prosecution exhibit, after having brought the necessary information.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, again, I ask:  What is the source of this document?  If it is drawn from a -- if it's a partial selection from any further document, where is the further document?  Who compiled this document, in what circumstances?  I think before it even begins to float about the Court, it be lent some gravity, some relevance.  At the moment all we have is a name.  We need to see the entire document.  And we have a name that's headed, I'm afraid, with a completely different place, quite the opposite side of Rwanda.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I did indeed say that we will reserve the right to introduce this document after having brought further information.  And if you will grant me leave, we can proceed with the cross-examination.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you confirm where the person who gave you refuge is living today? 
A.	The person who hid me died.  I know very well the circumstances surrounding his death, because since that person hid me, we fled together on the 14th of April.  It was a Thursday, and we were together up until when he died.  I never saw his remains, but I am aware of the circumstances of his death.  But I remained with his wife and children and they're still my neighbours and they're still our friends.  

As to what concerns that man, he was very ill at the time of the events, and you can also enquire from his neighbours.  He was bedridden.  
Q.	So you are saying, Madam Witness, that you fled together? 
A.	Yes, we fled together in the company of his wife and his children. 
Q.	So, he was very ill, so how was he able to leave? 
A.	He was very ill.  We did not actually carry him on a stretcher, but we used to help him to walk.  He walked slowly until we got to the place where we sought refuge.  Even if you ask the neighbours, they will tell you that he had scars on his head.  He had his head marked with scars because he was very ill.  These scars on his head, these tribal marks, were made on his head around the 12th.  
Q.	So you went with this person who gave you abode, and his wife.  Who else did you go with? 
A.	The children, his elder brother, who was married, and so his elder brother's wife was also there.  And the children of the elder brother were there as well, so were two of his sisters.  There was also a younger brother and another child who was 28 years of age.  He, too, died during that period.  
Q.	Witness, you said that when you were fleeing, everybody went on his own, but we realised today that it was a whole group that fled together.  
A.	I told you that every person left his home as an individual, but afterward, we met up together.  When we heard the gunfire, everybody left their home.  Those who were ill -- those who were ill walked slowly, but those who could run, ran towards Lake Muhazi.  What is true is that we met afterwards at the lake.  
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like to know what the truth is.  Did you leave individually?  Did you go in a group with the person who gave you refuge, his wife, other people, his family, his children?  Did you meet up later on in lac Muhazi?  What is the truth now? 
A.	The entire group met up in Lake Muhazi.  We spent the night together in the home of the person who had hidden me.  We met in Lake Muhazi.  When we got there, the Inkotanyi told us that they would evacuate us to another place.  That is how we went on living in the same refugee camp; that is, the entire group. 
Q.	So you did not go together and you did not observe that he was walking slowly and that he took some time to get to the place where you sought refuge? 
A.	From his home we did not help him when we left his home, but after we left the house, there was a group of five people who were walking together.  When we got to Lake Muhazi, we wanted to stay as a group.  We began to look for our children.  People were looking for their spouses.  My husband, for example, did not leave with me.  He went to find out what had become of our house and he joined me afterwards. 
Q.	Your story is fairly complicated, but let's move on.  How long did you stay in the place where you found refuge in Lake Muhazi? 
A.	We spent two days there; two nights we spent there.  Yes, that's right, two nights and two days. 
Q.	And afterwards, where did you go? 
A.	Afterwards, the soldiers found us at the lake and told us to follow them.  We crossed the lake.  We went beyond the lake to Rutare commune because they told us that they would be better able to provide security for us there.  
Q.	Could you tell us which soldiers took care of you? 
A.	Inkotanyi soldiers. 
Q.	Can you tell us the date on which these soldiers began to take care of you? 
A.	At that time we were not at peace.  We saw the days go by.  We did not count dates. 
Q.	You have been precise with other dates, Madam Witness.  
A.	The dates I remember are the dates on which I was still at home.  Even though the situation was not a very easy one, I was at least in my home.  Later on, I was in the bush.  I saw the days go by.  And then we would be told that we had to move.  So you really couldn't know the dates; you couldn't even know what day it was, whether it was Monday or Tuesday.  
Q.	Madam Witness, was that the only place where you saw the Inkotanyi? 
A.	Even in the morning on the 14th, before we left the house, I saw the Inkotanyi, but they did not speak to us.  They just went past.  When they went a little further, soldiers of the government army began to shoot at the Inkotanyi, but at that time the Inkotanyi didn't talk to anyone and they didn't attack anyone. 
Q.	You said they attacked no one and you say that later on it is these Inkotanyi who protected you.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you saw them on the 14th of April it did not occur to you to place yourself under their protection, did it? 
A.	But we didn't know them.  Some people said that they were government army troops.  Others said that they were Inkotanyi because they had different uniforms and they were carrying baggage, as if they had come from afar.  They were walking in a line and they spoke to no one. 
Q.	And it is at this exact time that you fled; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you add that it is the 14th of April? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall return to a particular event.  Do you know whether on that date the massacre at Kayanga centre had already taken place? 
A.	I was not aware of it at the time.  We had not yet received the news. 
Q.	So, now, let's follow the course of your narrative.  So you went toward Rutare and the Inkotanyi took charge of you.  When did you return to your secteur? 
A.	I returned on the 23rd of July 1994. 
Q.	And when you returned to your secteur, what did you observe? 
A.	Homes had been destroyed and there was no one in the secteur. 
Q.	When you say, Madam Witness, that there was no one, does this mean that the secteur was completely deserted? 
A.	From the time when we left, the 14th, there was no one in the secteur.  Only soldiers stayed there.  And, in fact, these soldiers were very few.  I saw that it was deserted when we returned.  Actually, after the 14th of -- after the 14th I only returned to Gasabo on the 23rd of July, as I have told you. 
Q.	When you returned to your secteur, did you hear about killings that had taken place in that area? 
A.	In Ndatemwa?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I did not hear about these Ndatemwa massacres when I returned.  It is only in July of this year that I heard that there were massacres in Ndatemwa. 
Q.	You have answered my question very clearly.  You told me -- I asked you whether you had heard about massacres that occurred in Ndatemwa when you returned.  

Madam Witness, can you tell us how many victims there were at that place?  
A.	In Ndatemwa?  No one was killed in Ndatemwa.  We exhumed no remains in that centre when we returned.  But in all other areas, the bodies of victims were exhumed and they were reburied with greater dignity.  But in Ndatemwa there were no victims' remains. 
Q.	Madam Witness, was there a census conducted in your commune of the victims of the 1994 genocide? 
A.	Yes, there was a census.  I'm telling you about the Gacaca and you don't seem to understand this.  Even in Gacaca sessions, we conducted a census.  We have a list of the victims of the genocide by cellule, and concerning our cellule, there's no one on the list.  There is also a list of people who lived in the cellule who were killed elsewhere, and on that list we have the names of these four people:  the two people who were beaten first in Ndatemwa and later killed in Kayanga, along with two other people.  So on the list we have only a total of four names of people living in the cellule who were killed.  
Q.	Would you be surprised to hear that the remains of people were found in your secteur, Ndatemwa? 
A.	I wouldn't be surprised because when we draw up these lists, we draw up lists of people who survived the genocide, a list of people who, for example, met their deaths in Ndatemwa in the period preceding the 14th.  Because after the 14th, we all left, both the assailants and potential victims.  Everybody left. 
Q.	The fact that you respond that it doesn't surprise you -- 
A.	I say that it did not surprise me because after the -- between the 14th and the date on which we returned, I don't know whether people were killed and I do not know who killed them.  There is a banana plantation near the centre of Ndatemwa and we found there, and exhumed, the remains of people.  And it seemed to us that these people were men and we observed that their arms had been bound.  We thought that before they had been killed or before they were killed, their hands had been tied.  I cannot tell you more about that because I wasn't present when this happened. 
Q.	Madam Witness, we agree that you acknowledge that bodies were exhumed.  As to the problem with dates, I think I will ascribe that to the time that has gone by.  I shall not ask you to be as exact as we might be about when those massacres actually took place.  

We shall move on to another matter, and we are referring here to André Rwamakuba.  Witness, you said yesterday that you did not know the person known as André Rwamakuba.  I would like you to tell me exactly when you began to hear about him.  
A.	It was before 1990, and even after that.  I used to hear about him as -- within the framework of political activities, but I had never seen him. 
Q.	So you say before and after 1990 you heard about him, when political activity was being discussed.  What were the circumstances?  Could you give us further detail?  
A.	I used to hear, for example, people saying -- people used to talk about the MDR. When the MDR was talked about, people, the public, would like to know who was in that party and, for example, people would say that André Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR. That is how I heard about him.  
Q.	Perhaps there is some nuance here, but you said yesterday that you had heard about him during political party rallies.  You said that you'd heard about him, but you'd never actually seen him.  It was during political rallies.  You mentioned his membership in the MDR later, but you said that you heard about him during political rallies.  That is what you said.  
A.	Parties organised rallies.  I was not a member of any party.  I didn't take part in any rally.  That is why I never saw him. 
Q.	But you did say that you heard about him when there were political rallies, didn't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us the dates on which these rallies took place? 
A.	I really cannot remember these dates.  It was of no great interest to me.  I have never been a member of a political party.  I have not taken part in a rally.  I cannot even give you the month or the year when these rallies occurred. 
Q.	Since you did not take part in rallies and since you were not interested in political matters, how did you then find out that Rwamakuba had taken part in political rallies? 
A.	For example, people who were at the centre could talk about that and have discussions about it.  And they would say something like, "If we are members of this party now, other people will know who are members of these parties."  It was just talk amongst people.  And people would say, for example, "André Rwamakuba of Nduba, he's a member of the MDR party."  
Q.	So at that time people already knew André Rwamakuba as a member of the MDR? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So this name was not an entirely new one within your secteur; it was known? 
A.	It was not the first time that we were hearing this name.  
Q.	Can you tell us what the MDR party stands for? 
A.	At that time I was not interested in political parties. 
Q.	But you did know that the parties existed? 
A.	Yes.  I could see members of the MDR who were wearing red and black uniforms, especially including berets. 
Q.	Did you know any other political parties that were active in Rwanda? 
A.	There was the MRND.  I used to hear about that as well.  I also heard about the PSD on the radio.  At the time there was also the PL. 
Q.	For someone who is not keen on politics, you did know a few political parties, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, I used to see members of these parties. 
Q.	Did you know some of the members of these parties? 
A.	Amongst my neighbours, do you mean?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I knew one member of the MDR.  He was called Habimana, Joas.  Most of my neighbours weren't really keen on political parties. 
Q.	Do you know where this Joas Habimana is now? 
A.	Let's see.  He lives in our region, but I don't know where he works. 
Q.	Was he involved in the genocide? 
A.	No.  If he had been involved, he would be in prison now.  All those who took part in the genocide are in prison. 
Q.	Can you be certain?  Can you say with certainty that all those involved in the genocide are currently in prison? 
A.	Those who are not in prison are not in Rwanda; they have gone to other countries to live. 
Q.	So Gacaca sessions try to handle the matter of criminals.  Is it possible that after the Gacaca collection of information, people who had not yet been to prison so far might have to go there?
A.	Yes, there are people who will be imprisoned subsequently after Gacaca proceedings, and we are almost at the end of the data-collection process.  If someone from another cellule committed these crimes in Ndatemwa, I would not be aware of it because I do not know this person. 
Q.	Madam Witness, all of this shows that all the criminals are not in prison.  
MS. FALL:
I shall stop here, Mr. President, and continue tomorrow, and I hope that it will not take up much time tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was just about to ask for an estimate of the remainder of your cross-examination.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, perhaps three-quarters of an hour, at the very most, possibly less.  I think I will have finished by the first hour of tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
It appears to us that there was, this morning, what has every appearance to have been an inept and inappropriate smear of this witness by the introduction of the name Édouard Turatsinze, together with the assorted comments that were made in respect of that person.  You, Mr. President, and I will well know what in fact the airwaves of Radio Rwanda are probably going to carry this evening, and probably the newspaper Hirondelle, publish.  I'm very concerned because, as I say, from our viewpoint, it has all the appearance of an inept and inappropriate smear, and I would, I hope, be able to insist that over this adjournment until tomorrow we are furnished with the Prosecution's basis for making this allegation.  I'm most concerned that this witness does not leave this witness box without the Defence being afforded the opportunity to address fully this allegation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  Your remarks are noted.  

Madam Witness, we are going to take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning, and as I have told you yesterday you are not to discuss the case or your evidence with anybody during this or any other adjournments while you are giving your testimony.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President, and I shall comply with your instructions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just indicate that if I'm seen going into the rooms where the witness is -- protected witnesses that are brought here are -- you will know, of course, that it's in no way to talk or approach in any way this witness, to whom again I give my thanks for her patient attendance, but in order to explain to the other two witnesses who I brought here today in a surfeit of confidence what their position is, and I hope put their minds at rest to some extent and ease their nervousness.  So I hope that's quite plain. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1234H)
