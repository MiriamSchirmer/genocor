MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Emile Francis Short; and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 6th of March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are more or less the same, but I notice that I see Mr. Weyl there this morning.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I will just want to express my greetings to the Trial Chamber.  I have returned to Arusha, so I say good morning to the Trial Chamber and, of course, to all who are here in this courtroom this morning.  I salute the Prosecutor and my Defence colleagues, as well as the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, welcome back.  We are glad to have you back.  Apart from that, can I say the appearances are the same?  

Yes.  Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I gather there was a problem with the video for the witness.  Did we -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think there was a problem, but it didn't seem to get done until this morning.  So I'm not sure exactly why.  But we did finally show the witness the two videos that the Prosecution had -- one video and one audio that the Prosecution had requested be played to him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  So that's been completed now? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And everything is ready to -- you're ready to continue? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning, and Mr. Robinson will continue his cross-examination.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, first of all, I just wanted to say perhaps we could charge this last hour and a half to the Prosecution, since it wasn't my request that this be shown to him.  I just want to make that small statement if things get to the point where you think I'm taking too long.  

Secondly, I want to let you know I cut my outline by 15 pages over the weekend, so I have 25 pages to go.  So I -- I still think that will take me the whole week, but at least I'm -- I will do my best to expedite it.  So we'll see. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, well, I must say that we have not yet formed the opinion that anybody has been wasting time in their examination.  So there's no judgemental (sic) commenced up to now, but we are expecting all counsel to -- to be proactive in the issue of time management.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
WITNESS UB, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness UB, you have now had a chance, first, to view the video recording of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech at Nyamirambo -- Nyamirambo stadium on the 7th of November 1993; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  I've been able to see the video. 
Q.	And having seen that video, is there anything you would like to add to what you have said about this speech previously? 
A.	Having watched this video, I'll say that this is not proof -- this is not serious proof to the effect that Ngirumpatse's speech is true.  First, this speech was prepared by Ngirumpatse himself.  In addition, a videotape is not reliable evidence that could lead to the conclusion that it is a clear or honest representation of what Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse did say.  It is possible that the technicians are well aware of this, that a tape can be altered.  I saw the picture clearly, the images clearly, and they do depict Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mathieu.  But I cannot give any probative value to this tape.  I know that it is he who gave that tape to the Prosecution because he was well aware of what he was preparing.  

So I have nothing to add to the statements that I made before now.  But I know that the MRND was a very powerful party, and it was in power.  I was able to see on the tape the Interahamwe, and I heard what he said about the Interahamwe.  What I can add, therefore, is that I cannot accept that this tape be tendered and entered into evidence and be considered as such, as serious proof. 

Mr. Chairman -- Mr. President, that is what I wanted to say about the video that I was shown this morning.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness UB.  And now I would like to ask you, with respect to the audiotape that you heard of the speech on January 16th, 1994, as broadcast over Radio Rwanda, also of a rally that took place at Nyamirambo stadium, is there any comment you'd like to make about that audiotape now that you've listened to it? 
A.	Now, regarding this tape of the speech that was broadcast on Radio Rwanda, I can tell you that a journalist can alter the facts to suit him if he wishes.  So I cannot accept this cassette as accurate.  I cannot say that it is irrefutable proof.  If you want to tender this tape into evidence, then it is your prerogative.  That is your evidence.  But it does not mean that I agree with this piece of evidence that you wish to tender.  I cannot accept it. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And I'll just point out, for your information, that both of those audio and videocassettes were tendered by the Prosecution as its own exhibits in this case.  But, having said that, we will now move on to where we left off.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to that last comment, Your Honour, because even though it is tendered by the Prosecution, I made it quite clear when we raised this issue on Friday that the Prosecution is not vouching for the accuracy of the recordings.  

Number one, the video was obviously edited.  I doubt that Mr. Robinson could contradict me on that.  The images were edited.  I can't say for the sound, but it's clear that it was an edited product that was placed on the market by the MRND in 1993.  That's how we came into contact with it.  

As for the audiotape, the -- the introduction to Mr. Ngirumpatse states that he was -- Ngirumpatse was the master of ceremonies, that he had made comments earlier on during the day, that he had introduced the rally.  And what we have recorded was simply the speech somewhere towards the middle or the end of the rally.  So there are comments that Mr. Ngirumpatse made that are not reflected on the tape.  So while these are Prosecution exhibits, we take them as we find them.  There is no statement from the Prosecution that these are accurate recordings of everything that was said on those two events.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I don't think there's any more that needs to be said about that.  The Prosecution wants to explain the limits of its own evidence, and they're free to do that.  So I would like to move on with my questioning.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, when we finished on Friday, we were speaking about your own interview on 
	Radio Rwanda, which had been transcribed as Exhibit D. NZ71.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would like that exhibit to be placed in front of the witness so I can resume my questioning about that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB, just to reorient ourselves, this is an interview of you that was done on Radio Rwanda on the *************1994.  And let's both remember to not mention your name or the secteur when we're discussing this exhibit, which is under seal.  

Now, the first part, which I asked you about on Friday, you had said that you couldn't -- you didn't know who had threatened the people who had fled from your secteur.  And I want to now direct your attention to the second question that was asked of you by the journalist, which begins on the second page of this transcript.  And is it true that the journalist, during this interview, said that the people who had fled were saying that the conseiller knew who the people were threatening -- who the people were who were threatening them?  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	And then you go on to reply that it's untrue to say that the conseiller knows them and that they don't reveal anything about who was attacking them.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I had said. 
Q.	And you told the journalist that investigations were still continuing and that you couldn't tell them who was responsible but you hoped that the investigation result would be made public and that the criminals would be known, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what, indeed, happened.  We conducted investigations to determine who these people were who were threatening other people.  
Q.	And, in fact, at the end of this interview, the journalist asked you who was responsible for the investigation, and you told them that it was those of the Nyamirambo brigade, correct? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And that referred to the gendarmes, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  So now that -- this was on the ************1994, and now, turning to*************, the 
	6th of April 1994, is it correct that there was a meeting in your secteur with UNAMIR and others to try to persuade the Tutsi to return home after they had fled? 
A.	Yes, you're right.  A meeting did take place on the 6th of April 1994.  We wished to convince the public, and especially the Interahamwe and people who had fled, to return.  

There was a representative of the préfet.  There was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune, who was present at the meeting, as well the préfectoral administration and the brigade -- or, the brigade were aware of the situation.  That is why all these people came to the meeting. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, if he -- could I have the exhibit removed from before the witness?
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, you told us that you attended speeches of the MRND in which they called for extermination of the Tutsis; that the Interahamwe had prepared lists, even in your secteur, of Tutsis to be exterminated; and you knew that the Interahamwe had been trained and had received weapons.  So can you tell us, then, why on the 6th of April 1994 you were encouraging Tutsis to return from the places where they had taken refuge and came (sic) back to their homes in your secteur? 
A.	It is because we had just reached an understanding with the Interahamwe leaders because we told them that the Tutsis were not safe because of the activities of MRND members.  It means that the commune and préfecture administrations had had discussions with the leaders of the party to talk about the safety of Tutsis in general.  
Q.	And so as of the 6th of April 1994, you were sufficiently comfortable that there would be no extermination of Tutsis that you urged them to return to their homes, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I had confidence, since the gendarmerie and the administration were prepared to intervene.  I thought they would protect the safety of the Tutsi because security forces, including the gendarmerie and préfectoral administrations, had agreed that they would take some action.  So I had received assurances from -- to this effect from the préfectoral authorities and security forces that they would help.  
Q.	And as of the 6th of April 1994, did you know of any plan to shoot down the plane of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, I have never heard of any such plan. 
Q.	As of the 6th of April 1994, had you participated in any plan to exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	I was never involved in the plan to exterminate the Tutsis.  On the 6th of April, when we left the meeting, each one of us went home.  So I never was a part of such a plan.  
Q.	Did you ever agree or conspire with anyone to kill Tutsis? 
A.	I never conspired with anyone to kill Tutsis.  If I'd had such a plan, I would not have waited for the 
	6th of April.  I did not know such a plan was in the offing as of the 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	And were you ever part of a joint criminal enterprise which had the destruction of the Tutsi as its object? 
A.	I was never a part of any joint criminal enterprise.  I noticed the Tutsis were targets before 1994.  In 1992, in 1993, I noticed the Tutsis were targets, and I reported the matter to my direct superiors.  
Q.	Did you ever order anyone to kill Tutsi? 
A.	I never ordered anyone to kill Tutsis. 
Q.	In your capacity as conseiller of a secteur in Kigali, did the bourgmestre of your commune ever order you to kill Tutsi? 
A.	The bourgmestre in ************commune, and nobody else as well, ever gave me the order to kill Tutsis.  He never did give me an order to kill Tutsis. 
Q.	And the préfet of Kigali never gave you an order to kill Tutsi, correct? 
A.	He did not give me any order to kill Tutsis.  All I am saying is that the préfet of Kigali never wanted to protect the Tutsis who were being killed.  He never gave me the order, but I say he never wanted to protect the people who were being killed, that is, the Tutsis. 
Q.	Did anyone in the minister -- ministry of interior ever order you to kill Tutsi? 
A.	No.  I think you're going too far.  Given my position, the minister of home affairs could not have spoken directly to the préfet.  When a conseiller had a problem, he would address the bourgmestre, who would address the préfet, who would, in turn, address the minister of home affairs.  

I was at a very low level, and the minister could not even have known me.  There were more than 1,500 conseiller, that is to say, the préfet never -- the minister of home affairs never did anything about the situation in the country, whereas he was aware of the killings.  He never condemned them.  
Q.	Can we agree, then, at least as your own personal experience is concerned, that the killing of Tutsi was not something that was ordered through the chain of command in the government? 
A.	In any event, the lower authorities never prepared the Interahamwe.  It is not the grassroots level that prepared the Interahamwe.  It is the top leadership that prepared the Interahamwe to kill.  If the Interahamwe had been prepared by the grassroots authorities, then they would have had some authority over the Interahamwe and controlled their acts.  
Q.	But it's true, is it not, that the killing of Tutsi was not ordered through the chain of command in the government.  From the minister of interior to the préfet, to the bourgmestre, to the conseiller, to the responsable, and to the heads of the ten households, no such order to kill Tutsi ever came through that chain of command, correct? 
A.	The minister of home affairs is responsible for security of the country, as well as the minister of defence.  When the préfet has to do something, it is a decision taken by the minister.  If the bourgmestre is to take an action, the decision for that action is taken by the minister.  If the killings were perpetrated in broad daylight, and if the minister of home affairs was aware of this, that means he is answerable.  If the préfet perhaps ordered killings, or if the bourgmestre ordered killings and the minister was aware, because the killings were committed in broad daylight, that means that the minister is equally answerable.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB, I'm afraid you're not answering my question directly.  There's a difference between responsibility for something that is ordered by someone else and ordering something yourself.  And I'm trying to make that distinction here.  So I'm asking you again, that, at least as far as your own personal experience is concerned, it's true, is it not, that the killing of Tutsi was not something that was ordered through the chain of command in the government? 
A.	You should not say that it did not happen that way.  In any event, the government never condemned the acts that were being perpetrated within the country.  The government never did anything to show that it did not support the killings unfolding in the country.  You are giving your opinion, and I am also giving you my opinion.  
Q.	Okay.  I think that's about as far as I can take that, given the time. 

Now, in your capacity as a member of the communal committee of the MRND, did the chairman of the MRND in your commune ever order you to kill Tutsi?  
A.	All I know is that the Interahamwe were trained to obey their superiors' orders, from national level to the lower levels, whether it was the president -- at any rate, the killings were perpetrated, and the president of the Interahamwe never told the Interahamwe to stop the killings, which means that it is the top leadership who ensured that the killings did not stop.  They were the ones making it impossible for anyone willing to stop the killings to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just one minute, please.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may continue, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I am going to suggest to you that this question can be answered by either "yes" or "no."  So I'm going to ask it again.  See if you can do that.  

In your capacity as a member of the communal committee of the MRND, did the chairman of the MRND in your commune ever order you to kill Tutsis? 
A.	You're asking me to answer "yes" or "no."  Well, he gave me no order for myself, personally, but he did give orders for Interahamwes.  
(Pages 1 to 8 by Ann Burum)




































1045H 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	In your capacity as a member of the préfectoral committee of the MRND, did the chairman of the MRND in your préfecture ever order you to kill Tutsis?  
A.	I told you the préfectoral committee of the MRND was not on the same wavelength as the Interahamwes because it never supported the acts of the Interahamwes.  I believe I told you this in previous questions. 
Q.	So the answer, then, is no, the chairman of the MRND in your préfecture never ordered you to kill the Tutsi, correct? 
A.	I cannot give a yes or no answer when you ask me a question to try and trap me.  It is as if you wanted to incriminate me on killings of the Tutsis.  I told you that Tutsis were killed by the Interahamwe from the MRND party.  Now you are asking me if I was given an order, as if you considered me a killer.  I will therefore not answer you in the way you want me to.  I know only that the MRND, as well as the Interahamwe or the Interahamwe who were killing came from the MRND.  

Now, as a member of the MRND I noted that the Tutsis were being killed by the Interahamwe, so that Mathieu cannot escape being blamed.  Orders were given to the Interahamwe to kill, but I was not an Interahamwe.  
Q.	And therefore you were never ordered by the chairman of your préfecture to kill Tutsi, correct? 
A.	I told you I never killed a Tutsi.  Don't say I was given some order.  You should say that the Interahamwe were given orders to kill Tutsis, and I will tell you that this is irrefutable evidence because they did it. 
Q.	Did any member of the executive committee of the MRND at the national level ever order you to kill Tutsi? 
A.	You're still putting your question in the same way by saying that one of these members may have given me an order to kill Tutsis.  You should, rather, ask if he gave an order to someone else.  He gave an order to the Interahamwe.  That is the correct formulation.  I think you understand well that I did not kill Tutsis, unless you want me to say I killed a Tutsi following an order issued by the president.  I was a leader in charge of a secteur.  The Interahamwe killed Tutsis in my secteur, yet the Interahamwe came from the MRND party, of which I was a member. 
Q.	So is it fair to say that you yourself never killed Tutsi and you were never ordered to kill Tutsi by anyone in the MRND? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  I told you that the Interahamwe from the MRND party -- first, let's agree on one thing.  The Interahamwe killed people.  Besides, I would say that if such an order had been issued to me, I would not have agreed to execute that order, whereas some members of the Interahamwe were killing Tutsis.  And that is the reason I am here, to tell you about the events.  I noticed the Interahamwes were killing Tutsis. 
Q.	Now, as a conseiller, did you consider yourself under the control of Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera such that they could order you to do something in your duties as a conseiller? 
A.	Within the MRND party Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera were top leaders, senior leaders in the party.  I was a conseiller, and it was my duty to obey the bourgmestre and préfet's instructions.  If I had been given an order and if I had not complied, that does not mean that someone else could not have killed them, or the Interahamwe he controlled, well, they killed Tutsis in the country, and that is what I have been explaining to you. 
Q.	But did the three leaders of the MRND who are on trial here ever order you to do anything in your capacity as a conseiller? 
A.	I am not on trial as a conseiller here.  I am speaking in my capacity as a member of the MRND, not as a conseiller.  Mathieu was not a responsable de secteur nor of a commune.  It is the minister of the -- of home affairs who was in charge of those administrative entities.  I told you that the minister was supposed to take measures to put a stop to the killings.  Interahamwe were busy killing.  Others -- people were busy killing.  This was a situation that was within the realm of the minister of home affairs.  On the other hand, there were killings perpetrated by Interahamwe.  And I am saying that as a responsable de secteur that the Interahamwes killed Tutsis and that I reported this to the authorities.  

As for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, he was president of the party, the party spokesperson at national level.  He was in a position to condemn or put a stop to what his own youths were doing, the youth that he had established.  He did not do so.  If he did not do so, it is because he supported their actions.  And we have seen in this court that the MRND was controlling the Interahamwe at national level.  Such control extended to the lowest levels of the party, cellule and secteur level. 
Q.	Witness UB, you're continuing to make speeches after every question that I ask you that have nothing to do with my question but simply giving yourself another opportunity to restate your position about the Interahamwe.  I'm not asking you about the Interahamwe, and you -- I suggest to you that you're unnecessarily prolonging these proceedings.  So I would like to ask you a question and have you concentrate on my question.  We all know your position.  The Judges will decide if you're being truthful or not.  You don't have to repeat it with every answer.  I'm simply speaking now of your position as a conseiller, and my question to you, which I suggest can simply be answered in yes or no, is whether or not any of the three people on trial here ever ordered you to do anything, yes or no?  
A.	You are asking me to give a yes or no answer.  It is because you assume I am guilty of something, and therefore, if I'm guilty, I cannot answer yes or no.  You should ask me if one or other person gave an order to kill.  Then I will answer.  Why are you asking me if one of these people gave me an order?  I was not an Interahamwe.  I was not under their direct control.  The time will come for me to tell you who gave me orders on what I had to do. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I'm going to ask for your intervention at this point, because I've been asking this witness questions now all morning, and he has yet to give me a direct answer.  So I asked him, "Did the three people who are on trial ever order you to do anything?"  And I would ask that you direct the witness to answer that question directly.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The difficulty for Mr. Robinson, as with any advocate who asks questions of a witness, is that it is, 
Your Honours may think, not for the advocate, and possibly the Tribunal, to determine how the witness should answer and what the witness should say.  The witness is trying to give his answer in the way that he thinks it can be answered as a question, and what he seems to perceive is that the way the question is asked, it cannot be answered yes or no because the directness of whether he has been given an order does not meet with the reality.  And therefore, I would respectfully invite the Court to say that whilst the Court takes note of the way that the witness is unable to answer the question directly, it is not appropriate to direct him to give a yes or no answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we do not intend to direct you at this stage how to answer a question, but we are hearing the questions, we are hearing the answers, and we are going to have to make an assessment of the reliability of the testimony that you give in due course.  

Last week I had suggested to you that you should listen and focus on the question that was being asked to you and try to answer it as concise as possible.  I draw your attention to that again.  You've heard the particular question which was asked.  Your answers have been very lengthy and not necessarily respond to the particular question which was asked.  And I just ask you to focus on the question and try to answer it as concisely as you can. 

Mr. Robinson, we think in due course that the way the witness responds may be a matter for comment.  We notice the question, we are noticing his answers, and we will have to make an assessment at the end of the day on his reliability, but I have invited him now to -- to consider the exact question you ask and to try to answer it, and we'll see what he does. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I appreciate that very much, Mr. President.  I just wanted to point out that in addition to wanting you to have some evaluation of his reliability, I also want to have substantive evidence in the record which can also support our case.  So sometimes I need a direct answer for that reason, besides the issue of his credibility.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, I am going to ask you again, did the three people -- any of the three people on trial here today ever order you to do anything? 
A.	No one -- or, rather, none of the three ever gave me an order. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I'm going to read you a small paragraph and ask you to give us your comment on it based on your own experience.  Is it true that from January 1994 through July 1994 Édouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and Joseph Nzirorera exercised effective control over the préfets, bourgmestres, and conseillers who were members of the MRND? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm going to object to that question.  It seems to me that Mr. Robinson is reading directly from the indictment.  I would ask him to clarify for the record what he's reading, and if it is from the indictment, I would object.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, it is indeed from the indictment, at paragraph 18.  And I point out to you that we are here to see if the allegations of the indictment have proven or not.  So I think it's perfectly proper for me to put something to the witness directly out of the indictment. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
When we use the word "effective control," that is a matter that the Court should address.  It's a legal concept.  It comes right out of our jurisprudence.  It's not appropriate to ask a witness if -- if the three exercise -- the three Accused exercised effective control.  There are other ways of getting at the factual allegations, and I would invite Mr. Robinson to put other questions to the witness and not to rely on a passage from the indictment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Although it may sound contradictory, I found that you are both right in the sense that I did think that you are entitled to put the allegations in the indictment to the witness.  But the other thing, that the phrase "effective control" is not -- is a legal concept, and that what you should do is to get the factual elements of it and put those to the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President, I'll do that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, from January of 1994 through July of 1994, you engaged in a number of activities on a daily basis.  During that period, did any of the three Accused control any of those activities that you engaged in? 
A.	I don't understand your question.  Please try and explain because we have -- you had the administration on the one hand and then you had the administration of the political parties on the other hand.  There was the central administration and the functioning of political parties.  I really do not see what it is that you are driving at with your question. 
Q.	Well, during this period in 1994, you were undertaking different activities, some of which were dictated by your responsibilities to others.  For example, as a conseiller of the secteur, you had responsibility to the bourgmestre and the préfet to do certain things that were either required of you or you were directed to do.  And I'm asking you whether during that same period in 1994, you also were doing things under the control of any of the three Accused.  So were you in 1994 taking any actions that were controlled by any of the three Accused? 
A.	I am still in some doubt as to what activities you are referring to, but I can say that as a conseiller I performed a great many duties, and I was not, in carrying out my duties, under the control of any one of these three people. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, we're going to move on to the events of the 6th, evening of the 6th of April.  When you learned of the assassination of President Habyarimana, who did you think was responsible? 
A.	I did not think.  I actually heard that the president's aircraft had been shot down by the Inkotanyi.  I heard this on the radio.  I'm clarifying this.  It was said that the Inkotanyi had shot down this aircraft.  This aircraft was returning to Kigali from Tanzania. 
Q.	Now, on the morning of the 7th of April you told us that you telephoned Préfet Renzaho and Bourgmestre Bizimana.  Which of those did you telephone first? 
A.	I began by calling Bourgmestre Bizimana. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately what time you called him? 
A.	I don't remember the exact time, but it was in the morning before 9 a.m.  We were still at home.  That is when I called him.  It was in the morning, as I said, but I can't remember the exact time. 
Q.	Did you call him at his office or at his home? 
A.	I called him at his home. 
Q.	And can you tell us to the best of your recollection what was said during that conversation? 
A.	We talked about the situation, and I told him that there was no safety in the secteur and that gunshots could be heard.  He answered that he himself could not get out of his home, and he said that I should talk to the préfet about it.  So, in short, we talked about what was going on in our area. 
Q.	And after finishing your conversation with the bourgmestre, did you call the préfet immediately? 
A.	When he advised me to contact the préfet about this, I immediately called the préfet and we talked on the telephone.  
Q.	And where did you reach the préfet, at his home or at his office? 
A.	I called him on the telephone at home.  
Q.	And where was he living at the time, what section of Kigali? 
A.	He lived in the city of Kigali. 
Q.	And which area? 
A.	He lived in Nyarugenge. 
Q.	And is that where you reached him, in Nyarugenge? 
A.	Yes.  We had his telephone number in the office.  We had his office telephone number and his home telephone number.  So I reached him through his home telephone number. 
Q.	And can you tell us to the best of your recollection what was said during that conversation? 
A.	I called him and told him about the security situation in the secteur where I was.  My secteur shared a boundary with other secteurs, so I told him about the security in that area. 
Q.	And what did he say? 
A.	He told me that I should wait, and he promised to tell me what the soldiers had decided.  We all had to wait for the soldiers' decision regarding what was going on at the time. 
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that Préfet Renzaho was living at the time in Kanombe, he had no telephone access at his home on the morning of the 7th of April, and that you never had this conversation that you've just related with the préfet.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is what you say, Counsel.  I have told you what I did.  You say that he did not have a telephone, so I don't know what I can possibly add to that.  I had a telephone conversation with him at that time, and I did what he asked me to do.  
Q.	Now, later on the 7th of April, after you have been out of your home, did you have another conversation over the telephone with the préfet? 
A.	After going round the secteur and having observed what had occurred there, I talked with him, installed a telephone in the office and an employee who was supposed to take all calls to that number, so that is when I got him on the telephone once more. 
Q.	Approximately what time of day on the 7th was that? 
A.	I don't remember the exact hour, but it was still in the morning. 
Q.	Before calling the préfet, had you tried to call the bourgmestre again? 
A.	The bourgmestre had already told me that he had no power, so it was not necessary for me to call him any more.  So from that time, we raised all these issues with the préfet instead.  It is he who was responsible for security.  He had the security forces at his disposal. 
Q.	And directing your attention to the second conversation that you had with Préfet Renzaho on the 7th of April, can you tell us what you said and what he said, to the best of your recollection? 
A.	I told him that people had been killed in my secteur and that I had actually seen bodies in one of the cellules of my secteur.  He replied that the people who had been killed were to be buried in graveyards. 
Q.	And was there any further discussion about how those bodies would get to the graveyards? 
A.	We told him that we did not have the wherewithal to do so.  The graveyards were some 5 kilometres away, and we couldn't carry the bodies there, so he said that he would send vehicles for this purpose.  In my secteur he sent a vehicle to carry these bodies. 
Q.	And is there anything else that was discussed between you and the préfet on the second telephone call of the 7th of April that you can recall? 
A.	I cannot remember.  I cannot remember everything that was said at that time, but I think I have said the main things that were discussed.  I wanted to tell him what was going on in my secteur.  We may well have talked about other things that do not come to mind immediately, but I said that we called him each time we had any news for him or each time we needed to talk to him. 
Q.	And do I understand you correctly that it's your testimony that you reached him on the second conversation at the préfecture office? 
A.	Yes, he had already reached the préfecture office when we talked for the second time on the telephone. 
Q.	And Witness, my last question to you on this subject is that I put it to you that on the 7th of April 
	Préfet Renzaho was engaged in a meeting of the crisis committee of the military from approximately 10:00 in the morning till about 3:00 in the afternoon and that you could not have and did not have this conversation with him that you've testified about.  Can you give us on your comments on that, if you wish? 
A.	I do not know how you know this.  I am telling you that I spoke with him.  If you think that he wasn't present at that place, well, that's up to you.  I have told you what we told each other on the telephone.  You seem to know where he was.  In any case, the headquarters -- the army headquarters was not far from the préfectoral office.  In any case, I'm sure of what we said on the telephone, and I've told you about it. 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I at this stage make an inquiry?  I'm very grateful to my learned friend for putting aspects of his case.  Your Honour will recall that from time to time that's been an invitation I have made.  I'm intrigued by -- and I wonder if the witness might take his headphones off. 

I'm intrigued by what my learned friend is putting about the whereabouts of Renzaho.  From a lawyer's point of view as to whether or not what is being put is the instruction of my learned friend's client, Mr. Nzirorera, based on what Nzirorera knows, which would suggest that Nzirorera knew the whereabouts of Renzaho that day, which may not be to Mr. Robinson's advantage, or whether what my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is putting is something that he has learned from the Renzaho Defence.  Because as Your Honours know, Renzaho is a detainee and he faces trial at the Tribunal.  So that, in effect, my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, is trying to assist another Defence team.  

And the reason why I ask the question is because my learned friend acts on instructions, and I anticipate the instructions must come from his client, Mr. Nzirorera.  And if that's right, then one might be forgiven for assuming that Nzirorera, through the question being put that Renzaho was at a crisis meeting, is saying through Mr. Robinson that Nzirorera knows where Renzaho was.  But alive to the fact that there is a lot of cross-fertilisation between Defence teams in this jurisdiction, it may be of assistance for the Tribunal to know which it is.  Is it what Nzirorera knows or is it what Mr. Robinson has learned from other Defence teams?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I've got a very simple answer to that, Mr. President, that it's absolutely none of his business.  And where I get my information and the source of it is -- especially with respect to instructions and discussions with my client is absolutely no business of Mr. Morley's, and I'm not going to answer that question.  

But I will invite the Trial Chamber, if you would like to take a break at this time, if you planned on taking one.  It seems like we're a little past the halfway point of the morning session.  If you would like me to continue, I can go ahead with my next question.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm impressed by my learned friend's gusto in his response, but it may be that this is an issue which is of interest to the Tribunal.  When my learned friend puts something, and that is welcome, in principle it ought to be on instruction from his client.  And the Tribunal may then thereafter proceed on the basis that what's being put is something which is in the knowledge of Mr. Nzirorera.  If it is not in the knowledge of Mr. Nzirorera, in other words, it's being put because of conversation with other Defence teams, it may be of importance for the Tribunal to know that.  

Ordinarily, one would never put on behalf of a defendant something which comes from an outside source.  If there is an outside source taking part in what is being put, Your Honour may feel, as a matter for the Tribunal, that the distinction needs to be known; otherwise, one may proceed on a misunderstanding of what is in Mr. Nzirorera's knowledge. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson -- if you may excuse me, Mr. Sow.  We had thought that -- Mr. Robinson, I was -- wanted to respond to an inquiry you had made.  We had thought of toughing it out without a mid-morning break, but since you have raised the question, we think we'll take a short break at 11:45.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I notice that two of your colleagues had wanted to say something.  Mr. Weyl was on his feet first and then Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Weyl was up before you, Mr. Sow, so we'll hear him before you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I'd like to thank you.  I'd like to ask Mr. Morley this:  Could he please henceforth give the list of questions the Defence would be authorised to put, first?  

Second, what Mr. Morley has just said in respect of Mr. Morley's organisation of his line of questioning leads me to highlight all of the main aspects of what I think is an unfair trial.  Mr. Morley is wondering about how questions can be put if such questions involve other Accused parties and other persons.  He doesn't seem to have this difficulty on his own side, and what we have observed for some time now is that because this is a joint trial, the Prosecutor has access to all case files, and all Prosecution teams communicate with each other, which means that the Prosecution has some considerable advantage over the Defence, all the Defence teams, in terms that make the trials that we are having here basically unfair.  I think Mr. Morley was right to raise this difficulty that the Defence is facing.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow.
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I'd like to handle a housekeeping matter.  Mr. Karemera, Édouard, must go out for his kinesitherapy session this morning, and I'd like to seek the leave of the Trial Chamber to ensure that Mr. Karemera goes to this session.  

Now, in regard to the point at issue, I think that Mr. Morley has no business getting involved in the confidential nature of the relationship between Mr. Nzirorera and his counsel.  And his counsel, 
Peter Robinson, must put the questions that he feels necessary to put.  It is up to Mr. Morley to bring contrary proof.  I think it is inappropriate.  I find his statement inappropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Mr. Sow, permission is granted. 

Now, I'm familiar with the -- at least some of the principles that Mr. Morley was referring to in the remarks that he made, although I do think that he went a bit far, went too far when suggesting that it would be open to the Court to impute personal knowledge through the Accused, if Mr. Robinson had been acting on instructions in the way he conducted his cross-examination. 

Now, we feel that the -- that there is an obligation on counsel in cross-examination to be acting on instructions from his client, but that does not necessarily impute personal knowledge from the Accused on the instructing party.  At the end of the day, if the witness denies what is being put, counsel will be obligated to adduce evidence to support the matters put to counsel -- sorry, the matters put to the witness.  And the Court will have to address any failure to do so if that eventually does materialise as the trial proceeds.  We don't think we should ask Mr. Robinson to disclose the source of his information at this stage.  But we do act on the expectation that when he puts something to the witness, he is acting on the instructions of his client.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, maybe I could get some clarification from you since I'm not so familiar with this "putting" business.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you've been doing it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I've been doing it because I was under the impression that you wanted me to do it, and that if I failed to do it, somehow there would be an inference drawn that I hadn't given a witness an opportunity to confront the witness that I bring in my defence case. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
That's simple.  That's what your obligation is.  You see, we assume that when you put something to the witness, it reflects what your case is basically, but it doesn't necessarily impute personal knowledge of the Accused. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Exactly.  And it's my understanding that matters in which I become aware of through our investigation, if I know something that directly contradicts a witness from our own investigation, that I'm obligated to put that to the witness so he has a fair opportunity to respond before I bring some other defence witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the long run, failure to put your case to the witness is a factor which -- which we take into account when we are assessing reliability of his testimony.  If you bring evidence to contradict what he says and you never gave him a chance to address that issue, then we take that into account when deciding what -- what weight to give his testimony.  So it's advisable to do it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Right.  And I mean, that's what I'm trying to do, but on the other hand, I'm also doing it in instances in which my own -- our own investigation has revealed that the witness is -- there is evidence contrary which I have the expectation of adducing during my case but independent of my client.  I'm thinking that I should continue to do that, but I'm not sure. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What I'm saying is that as far as the Bench is concerned, whereas we expect you to be acting on instructions, we don't necessarily impute personal knowledge to the client. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand that but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we expect you to continue to put your case -- or to put matters which are likely to contradict the witness's testimony on which you intend to introduce evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And that's regardless of whether those matters are something my client has knowledge of or something we've learned by investigating the case on his behalf.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Precisely.  You'll get instructions in different ways, and all that we are saying is that we thought Mr. Morley had gone too far when he suggested that personal knowledge should be imputed to the client if you were instructed to pursue a line of examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand, then.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Honestly, Mr. President, I can't remember if Witness UB answered the question that I put to him or not.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your last exchange, if you don't mind, if I can read it:  "And Witness, my last question to you on this subject is that I put it to you that on the 7th of April Préfet Renzaho was engaged in a meeting of the crisis committee of the military from approximately 10:00 in the morning till about 3:00 in the afternoon, and that you could not have -- you could not have and did not have this conversation with him that you have testified about.  Can you give us your comments about that, if you wish?"  

And the witness said:  "I do not know how you know this.  I am telling you that I spoke with him.  If you think that he wasn't present at that place, that's up to you.  I have told you what we told each other on the telephone.  You seem to know where he was.  In any case, the headquarters -- the army headquarters was not far from the préfectoral office.  In any case, I'm sure of what was said on the telephone, and I've told you about it."  

Now that was the last exchange of -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I think I can move on to something else now.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, according to you, the collection of bodies began as of the 7th of April under the instructions of préfectoral officials, correct? 
A.	Yes, indeed, it is the préfet who gave that order. 
Q.	And that collection of bodies continued throughout the period that you were in Kigali, correct? 
A.	Yes, the removal of the bodies continued until the end of April and even up to May.  
Q.	Now, did there come a time on the 7th of April when you learned that Georges Rutaganda was distributing weapons to the Interahamwe? 
A.	Since I lived along the main road, Georges Rutaganda passed by that road and distributed weapons -- as he distributed weapons to the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And did you see that with your own eyes? 
A.	After noticing that people in that neighbourhood had weapons, I went to the main road.  I told you there are three neighbouring secteurs.  I saw him in a Hilux vehicle, driving. 
Q.	And did you speak with him on that day? 
A.	We greeted each other.  He was an important person.  He told me he was visiting his men, his boys, in our area. 
Q.	Did he make any statements about distributing weapons? 
A.	He distributed weapons to the Interahamwe.  I cannot report what he said, but I believe he had a plan that he and his Interahamwe had agreed on a number of things.  The fact is he was distributing weapons to them. 
Q.	Did he confirm that to you by anything that he said during your conversation? 
A.	No.  He said nothing to me about that.  He could see we were removing the bodies.  He did not say anything about that matter because he could see that I was aware that I could see what the Interahamwe were doing. 
Q.	And where was it that you had this conversation with Mr. Rutaganda? 
A.	We were along the road.  I told you I live along a busy road.  We could stand on the road, discuss with passersby before they went on their way. 
Q.	And last question on this point:  Were you in your own secteur at that time? 
A.	Yes, I was in my secteur.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we'll keep the break very short.  We'll try to resume in exactly ten minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1146H to 1205H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, is there any change in our recess time for the lunch break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  We still lunch at 12:30. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'd like to get back on schedule.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, you've just told us that you -- on the 7th of April you met Georges Rutaganda in your secteur and you did not discuss the distribution of weapons.  I'm now going to direct your attention to an interview report done by the Office of the Prosecutor after your interview of the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th of April 2004.  And I'm referring on that report to page 3 to item number 3.  And I'm going to read it to you.  It says that, "According to the witness, some of the guns utilised by MRND Interahamwe as from 7 April 1994 to perpetrate the massacres had been distributed in the morning of that same day by Georges Rutaganda, a member of the Interahamwe national committee, to Interahamwe secteur leaders who distributed them to their men.  Thus, on 7 April Interahamwe leaders, Gatonza and 
	Suedi Ndayitabi, had informed him that it was Rutaganda who gave them arms."  Then it goes on to say, "Rutaganda himself had confirmed it when they met on that same day near CHK." 

So, Witness UB, according to what the Prosecutor reported you said in April of 2004, you told him that, in fact, Rutaganda did confirm to you that he was distributing arms on 7 April, and you told him that you had met Rutaganda not in your secteur, as you've just testified, but near the CHK, the central hospital of the Kigali.  Can you tell us which is correct, did you speak to Rutaganda about the weapons on the 7th, and where did you meet him when you'd spoke with him?  
A.	You asked me if we spoke about the weapons distributed, and my answer was that he confirmed that he had distributed weapons.  So we did not meet at the Kigali hospital centre.  There's a difference between the centre hospitalier de Kigali and the surrounding areas.  You say I met him and that we talked.  He confirmed he had distributed the weapons.  We did not meet at the centre hospitalier de Kigali.  We met in the area close to**********, actually. 
Q.	And so the statement that is attributed to you by the Prosecution in April of 2004 is not correct? 
A.	The content of the statement is accurate.  I did say I met Rutaganda who confirmed he was the one who had distributed the weapons and that he was visiting his young men.  That road leads to the CHK, not far from the place where we were, the place where we were is close to the CHK.  He confirmed he had just distributed the weapons, but I did not ask him why he was distributing the weapons, because I could clearly see the purpose of the weapons he was distributing.  
Q.	So then the testimony that you gave a little earlier today that you did not discuss the distribution of weapons with Mr. Rutaganda, that was an error? 
A.	I said we did not talk about the weapons that -- what they were going to be used for, the purpose intended for the weapons.  I did not ask him why he was distributing the weapons, because I knew the use of the weapons he was distributing. 
Q.	And the CHK, that's in Nyakabanda secteur, correct? 
A.	No.  The centre hospitalier de Kigali is Nyarugenge secteur which borders the Biryogo secteur. 
Q.	And the hospital itself is up on the plateau of Kigali, correct? 
A.	What plateau are you referring to?  When we speak of the plateau, we call the area around the presidency in the town centre the plateau, but the CHK is not far from Kigali camp. 
Q.	It's across the road from Camp Kigali in the flat portion of Kigali that sits upon the top where not only Camp Kigali sits but the office the ministry of defence and other government offices, correct? 
A.	I don't know which ministry of defence you're referring to when you say the ministry is close to the CHK.  That is not how I remember it. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, in the centre of Kigali on the -- what I understand to be the plateau is I understand that there are three or four streets that run parallel to each other on the top of this plateau.  On one street, I believe it may be the Avenue of the Revolution, there's a number of buildings and offices, and it's a business district.  And those streets lead from the area, for example, of the Mille Collines hotel down to Camp Kigali.  And among the buildings on those streets is the central hospital of Kigali near the end of the plateau closest to Camp Kigali.  Is that correct? 
A.	It is not a matter of making a presentation on the map of Kigali.  You are trying to confuse me, trying to trap me.  I told you the CHK is straddling three secteurs, the Nyarugenge secteur, as well as other secteurs.  The Mille Collines hotel had nothing to do with CHK.  I don't know who informed you.  I believe they lied to you.  At any rate, if someone gave you such information, it is incorrect.  I am telling you where we were.  If I were to give you the information, it is because I know where Camp Kigali is located, where the Mille Collines hotel is located in relation to Camp Kigali.  If I tell you we met not far from the CHK, it is at the border between Biryogo secteur and the Nyarugenge secteur, which is not far from the CHK. 
Q.	Witness UB, you said that roadblocks went up all over Kigali on the morning of the 7 April; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  The roadblocks were scattered all over the city of Kigali. 
Q.	And did you receive any orders as a conseiller to establish any roadblocks in your secteur? 
A.	The roadblocks were set up by the Interahamwe, which means that the Interahamwe leaders had issued such instructions.  We noticed that some roadblocks manned -- were manned by soldiers, whereas others were manned by Interahamwe.  I had no power over the Interahamwe.  All I could do was inform my superiors.  So I did not receive any order to the effect that I should set up roadblocks. 
Q.	And did you see any members of the national committee of the Interahamwe at any roadblocks on the 7th of April? 
A.	One Bernard Maniragaba, I found him at the roadblock at Gitega at the border between Biryogo and Gitega secteur.  This was an important Interahamwe nation wide, and the roadblock was located between the Nyakabanda and Biryogo secteur.  He was also an active Interahamwe at préfectoral level.  He was a well-known Interahamwe. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Maniragaba is spelled M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And he was from Gitega secteur, correct? 
A.	He lived in Gitega secteur, but there's a difference between his place of origin and place of residence. 
Q.	And you say you saw Georges Rutaganda in ***************on the morning of the 7th of April.  And where was he residing? 
A.	Georges Rutaganda lived in Cyahafi secteur in Nyarugenge commune. 
Q.	And, Witness UB, to finish on this topic, I put to you that Georges Rutaganda was not in ***********on the 7th of April, that he was not in Cyahafi secteur on the 7th of April, and that you never saw him or had a conversation with him on that day.  Would you like to comment on that? 
A.	That is your position, positions that he gave you himself.  One has to defend oneself as best -- as best -- I told you I met him several times later on the same day, and it was somebody -- this was someone I knew well, so there was no way I could be mistaken as to his identity. 
Q.	And you told us that the Interahamwe had set up roadblocks on the morning of the 7th and that they had orders to do so.  Did you hear Mr. Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, or Karemera ever give an order that roadblocks be established in Kigali or anywhere else in Rwanda? 
A.	I never heard Nzirorera give such an order.  I never heard Mathieu do so.  But I saw 
	Georges Rutaganda, who was national vice-president of the Interahamwe, visiting the various roadblocks.  Rutaganda reported to Mathieu.  Maniragaba was reporting to Nzirorera.  Nzirorera would report to Mathieu.  These people were under that office's control.  I, therefore, assume they were acting on the orders of that same office. 
Q.	And apart from your assumption, did anyone ever tell you that Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, or Karemera had given an order to establish roadblocks in Kigali on the 7th? 
A.	As soon as I saw Georges Rutaganda, national vice-president of the Interahamwe, doing that with his subordinates or the persons accompanying him, I did not doubt for one moment that these things were reported to the party leadership.  I could not ask him as to the origin of the orders.  He was more powerful than I was.  I am not saying it is Mathieu or Nzirorera who gave such a specific order, but they were aware of it.  And then I met them on other occasions, although not on the day in question.  
Q.	And I think the last question on the 7th of April, did you go to your secteur office at any time on that day? 
A.	The secteur office was near my house.  I got there in the morning, and I would go there whenever necessary.  So I went to the secteur office that day.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the 8th of April, did you have any contact with Préfet Renzaho or Bourgmestre Bizimana on that day? 
A.	At the time we spoke by telephone because everyone was concerned for his own security.  On the 8th I spoke to the préfet like the other people who called him, and we spoke about security.  Bizimana also was in touch with me, but he told me he had no authority over what was being done, so I spoke to the préfet on the 8th. 
Q.	Did you also speak to the bourgmestre on the 8th? 
A.	I reported to him, but he told me that power was concentrated in the hands of the préfet, that in those circumstances he had no power.  
Q.	And when you spoke with the préfet, Renzaho, on the 8th of April, can you tell us approximately what time of day that was? 
A.	In the morning.  I don't remember the exact time, but it was before midday. 
Q.	And can you tell us to the best of your recollection what was said between you and Préfet Renzaho on the 8th of April? 
A.	Our conversation dealt with security in general.  I mentioned my own situation as far as security was concerned.  The topic under discussion was security, and I discussed the situation -- security situation in the area I was responsible for.  
Q.	And did you tell Préfet Renzaho that there were killings in your area? 
A.	Indeed.  I told him about that.  I told you we regularly drew up reports on events in the various secteurs.  These could be in written form or not written.  
Q.	And what did Préfet Renzaho tell you after you told him about the killings in your secteur on the 8th of April? 
A.	He gave me no answer.  I know that at the time he sent the policemen to protect my house.  Other than that, he gave no specific answer.  This was a matter to be dealt with by the préfectoral security committee.  I did not receive any answer to that question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I've come to a place where we could break if you would like.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  We take the luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1230H) 
(Pages 9 to 24 by Sherri Knox)





























(Court resumed at 1409H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Robinson, you may continue now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, before we begin, I just want to make a brief request that the Prosecution be ordered to disclose to the Defence the list of witnesses for the next witness session -- the next trial session, in the order that they intend to call them, no later than one week from today.  So I wanted to make that request now so they have time to do that, if you grant my request.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Robinson, we are in the process of -- we have written both parties -- all parties -- trying to get information as to what scheduling orders we should make.  So I, in fact, would hope that we have got this addressed administratively before making a formal order.  But it will be addressed shortly.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I appreciate that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to allay the Court's concern and Mr. Robinson's, we have no objection to providing that information.  We do it as a regular course of business.  All you have to do is make the request and we'll comply.  I don't think it's appropriate to order us to list the order of appearances.  We've addressed this before, but in terms of providing the information, we've given -- we've responded to all of the communications from the Trial Chamber coordinator, so it's not going to be a problem in terms of working together to get the scheduling down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness UB.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I see that Judge Kam doesn't have his headphones on, so I will just wait until he's ready.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are ready now, Mr. Robinson.  Thank you for waiting. 
MR. ROBINSON:
You're welcome.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, you've testified about conversations you've had with Préfet Renzaho on the 7th and 8th of April, and is it your testimony that Préfet Renzaho never attempted to stop the killings? 
A.	Yes, my testimony is that nothing was done to stop the killing. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown what is Exhibit No. 18 in my group of exhibits?  Actually, No. 17 and 18.  So we can start with 17 would be better.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what's been placed before you is a transcript from a Radio Rwanda broadcast, and it's cassette number 903, and I'm going to ask you to read a few lines from this broadcast, beginning on the bottom of page -- of the first page after the cover sheet, and then going to the first four lines of the second page, where it stops with "classical music".  And the date on the face of this exhibit is the 7th of April 1994, but I believe the evidence will show that this was on the 8th of April that this statement was made.  But in any event, do you see, two lines from the bottom, where it starts with the words about the prefect?  
A.	You mean page 1 or page number 4?  
Q.	Page number 4, at the very bottom -- 
A.	Fine. 
Q.	The last two lines.  At the very bottom, the last two lines.  
A.	Okay, I see it.  
Q.	Can you read those two lines out loud, as well as the first four lines on the next page?  
A.	It says the following:  "The prefect of Kigali préfecture urges the population of Kigali to respect the orders, instructions, of the ministry of defence, and informs the population that it is forbidden to aggress other members of the population, and asks them, moreover, to be cautious in these difficult times and to cooperate with the security forces and make their job easier, and the population is urged to keep an eye out for security so that they should not be infiltrated."  Signed, Tharcisse Renzaho, prefect of Kigali urban préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this transcript as Exhibit D. NZ72.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ72 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness could be shown number 18 in my packet of exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, directing your attention to the document that's been placed in front of you, if you can turn to the second page, and in the middle of the page, under number 13.2, if you could read those six lines before the "classical music".  
A.	It reads as follows -- I think you want me to start with the line which says -- "classical music" or before "classical music"?
Q.	Before "classical music," the line underneath 13.2.  
A.	I see it.  It says as follows:  "The prefect of Kigali préfecture hereby urges the inhabitants of Kigali town to respect the instructions issued by the ministry of defence and informs the population that it is forbidden to aggress or to attack other members of the population, and urges them to be prudent and cautious in these difficult times, and asks them to cooperate with the security forces in order to facilitate their task, and asks them to keep an eye open to security -- to be very careful about security in their area so as not to be infiltrated."  Signed by Tharcisse Renzaho, prefect of Kigali urban préfecture. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this seems to be an actual -- another broadcast of the same message, but I'll offer it as Exhibit D. NZ73, because I believe it was repeated on the next day.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ73 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, if I could just have a moment to look at my original exhibits.  

Okay, thank you, Mr. President.  I think somehow there's another broadcast that I'm missing, but I'll sort that out over the evening and come back to that, if necessary.  

Now, if the witness can now be shown the document in tab 162.  This is a -- also a Radio Rwanda broadcast on the 10th of April.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to ask you to direct your attention to the Kinyarwandan version of this broadcast, and in particular, to the pages that have in the top right-hand corner, K0144398.  And on that page, at the very bottom, underneath the "classical music", can you please read the first three lines -- or the last three lines of that page?  
A.	I see it.  
Q.	Can you read it out loud, please?  
A.	I don't think it's very legible.  The writing is very small.  The print is very small.  "They can go to market, go for medical treatment and other things.  We ask the population not to go to the market in Remero or the market in Kacyiru because of the military operations there."  
Q.	Okay, Witness UB, I'm going to ask you to read a few more paragraphs, but I have a copy that has bigger print on it, so I'm going to ask the registrar to take my copy and put it in front of you so it's easier.  

The page that has the number 399 on the top, which is right in front of you now, can you read the paragraph that has the 2 at the top?  
A.	"The préfet -- "  "The prefect asks people in charge of security to make things easier for the population when the people want to go out to obtain food, supplies, or to obtain medical treatment." 
Q.	And can you read number 3?  
A.	"The roadblocks erected by the people in various districts are forbidden in daytime.  They may only be erected at night, and the security committees in the various neighbourhoods must supervise the activities at those roadblocks."  
Q.	And then could you read number 4?  
A.	"All categories of civil servants must return to their place of work, except for those working in Kacyiru.  The latter should wait until there are no -- until the military operations are over, and they should remain cautious and try to contact or meet their hierarchical superiors so as to determine how to pursue certain activities, so as to find solutions to various problems that arise.  Among those who must return to work is ONATRACOM, Electrogaz, the pharmacies, hospitals and dispensaries, the public hygiene sanitation department -- public sanitation department, must ensure that its staff returns to work as soon as possible."  
Q.	And then paragraph number 5.  
A.	"Once more, the prefect denounces criminals of all categories, killers, bandits, and other persons who threaten one another's safety, and urges that anyone trying to infiltrate should be -- in the various districts, neighbourhoods, should be denounced."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this broadcast as Exhibit D. NZ74.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ74 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
And may the registrar retrieve my copy from this witness so I don't lose track?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, I'm now going to turn to your activities on the 10th of April 1994.  Can you tell us what you did that morning? 
A.	You gave me a chance to read the document.  You should also give me a chance to comment on the exhibit you tendered.  Before we deal with the events of the 10th of April, you should allow me to comment on what we have just read.  If by any chance it is not important, we can move on, but this is my request to the Chamber. 
Q.	Yes, as far as I'm concerned, you can give us your comments on what you've just read.  Go ahead and do that.  
A.	Regarding the release I have just read, these are releases issued by the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  In my opinion, they should not be used as evidence that the préfet intervened in some way with regards to security.  First of all, these releases are not dated.  They could have been drawn up at any point in time.  Secondly, when you make a speech on Radio Rwanda, that does not mean that the population is in a position to restore security.  I agree with the content of the communiqué, but it would perhaps be more interesting to question the préfet about this.  The message was to restore security in the city of Kigali.  The préfet had jail cells where he could have placed criminals.  In short, even though you have tendered this as an exhibit, I tell you that this document was useless as far as restoring security in the city of Kigali was concerned.  

Now you can go on with your questions.  This is the comment I wished to make. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, turning to the 10th of April of 1994, can you tell us what your activities were that morning?  
A.	On the 10th of April I took part in security-related activities.  This involved reporting to my superiors on security matters, security in the area under my care.  
Q.	And to which superiors did you report on the 10th of April? 
A.	As usual, I addressed the bourgmestre, the préfet, and the gendarmerie.  Normally, these were the officials we would report to on events in the cellule and secteur. 
Q.	And on the 10th of April did you report to them by telephone or in person?  
A.	On the 10th of April, a meeting of the security committee was held at the préfecture office.  All participating conseillers reported on the security situation in their respective secteurs, although some written reports were submitted to my hierarchical superiors.  Even though the meetings took place, nevertheless, there were written reports to our superiors. 
Q.	So I'd like to ask you some questions about this security council meeting on the 10th of April.  First of all, was that the first time that you had physically been to the office of the préfecture since 6th April?  
A.	We would communicate by telephone, and we only went to the préfectoral office on the 10th when convened -- when the meeting was convened by the préfet of Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Now, we have seen from the statutes of the préfecture of Kigali-ville that the conseillers were not ordinarily members of the security council.  Is it your testimony that the security council meeting included the conseillers on the 10th of April?  
A.	There was an ordinary security committee, but the préfet felt there was a need to call conseillers and representatives of parties.  He convened the meeting of an expanded security committee.  He felt there was a need to call them to the meeting.  This measure was taken by the préfet so as to ensure that the message was spread to the population, so we were invited to the meeting under those circumstances. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately what time the meeting began?  
A.	The meeting began in the morning, in the morning.  I'd say about 9 a.m.  I did not look at my watch to confirm that, but I think it was about 9 a.m. 
Q.	And about what time did the meeting end?  
A.	I think the meeting went on until 2 p.m., between 2:00 and 3:00.  I clearly recall that the meeting was still on at midday.  
Q.	And where in the building was this meeting held? 
A.	The meeting was held in the préfecture -- the office of Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	But in what room?  
A.	In the conference room.  There was a conference room for that purpose. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness please be shown number 1 in my group of exhibits?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what we've placed before you is a sketch of the préfecture building, at least as we understand it was laid out.  Do you recognise that?  
A.	I'm not very good at drawing.  When a sketch is done, I'm not very good at looking at it.  But I do have it in front of me.  I do have the sketch, the plan. 
Q.	Do you think you would be able to mark on this document the room where the security council meeting was held on the 10th of April? 
A.	I told you, there was a meeting room in the préfecture office, where the meeting was held.  So just as shown in the drawing, I see the meeting room.  Indeed, that is the room where the meetings were held.  That room was on the lower floor, and that is the room where meetings were normally held. 
Q.	And is that the room that has the words "salle de reunion" written inside? 
A.	Yes, I see that is indeed the meeting room, and as I said, I can see another addition where "recensement" is indicated.  I don't know whether you were told anything about census-taking in the préfecture, but I do see a place marked "meeting room" and that is where the préfecture meeting room was located. 
Q.	And did all of the security council meetings that were held after 6 April which you attended, were they all held in that room? 
A.	Security meetings were held in that room, except perhaps for other important meetings that were chaired elsewhere by the préfet.  But the meetings that we attended were held in that room. 
Q.	And did that also include the meeting at the end of April, where Mr. Nzirorera was present?  
A.	No.  That is not where those meetings were held.  I was referring to meetings attended by Mr. Nzirorera. 
Q.	So just to be clear, the security council meetings that you testified about that took place on the 10th and the 14th and the 16th of April were all held in the portion of the building where it says "salle de reunion," correct?  
A.	The meeting of the 10th was held in that meeting room.  The second meeting -- since we thought that that place was not safe enough, subsequent meetings were held elsewhere.  But the first was held in that meeting room, the one indicated or marked on the sketch. 
Q.	And can you tell us where the meeting of the 14th of April took place?  
A.	The meeting of the 14th took place in another room.  You go through the corridor.  I'm not sure if you can see it, there, where the telephone was located.  There was a waiting room, and when members of the population sought to meet officials, they were to wait in that place.  Subsequent meetings took place in a concrete room.  
Q.	If the registrar could be asked to give you a pencil or a pen, I'll going to ask you to make some markings on this diagram.  

Now, don't write anything yet.  When -- for the meeting of the 10th, can you put the number "10" in the place where that meeting was held?  
A.	The meeting was held in the préfecture meeting room. 
Q.	So, write the number "10" in that meeting room on the drawing, and then same for 14, the meeting of the 14th, write the number "14" where that meeting was held.  And for 16th, can you write the number "16" where that meeting was held?  And for Mr. Nzirorera's meeting, if you could write the number "30" where that meeting was held.  

Have you done that?  
A.	Yes, I'm done. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer that sketch as Exhibit D. NZ75.  I would ask the registrar to make copies of that for all of us, since it's been marked on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ75 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And now if the registrar could give the witness a blank piece of paper and also a pen, I'm going to ask the witness to write down some names of people who attended that meeting.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, don't start writing yet.  Just first of all, can you tell me approximately how many people attended the meeting of the 10th of April?  
MR. WEBSTER:
While the witness is doing that, could we put the last exhibit on the overhead so we can all see where the witness made his notations?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That's a good suggestion.  

Mr. Issa.  
THE WITNESS:
I have not numbered or given the list of participants -- rather, I did not count the members who participated at the meeting and I cannot tell you how many there were.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Well, on that piece of paper, can you first, at the top, write the words "10 April"?  And first I'll ask you who chaired the meeting.  
A.	The meeting was chaired by the préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	So could you write down on your list his name?  Was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune present at this meeting?  
A.	Yes, he was present at the meeting of the 10th. 
Q.	And that's Jean Bizimana? 
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	Could you write his name, please?  

Was the -- thank you.  Was the bourgmestre of Kacyiru commune present?  
A.	Yes, he was present at the meeting. 
Q.	Can you write down his name, please and that name Pierre Clavier Nyilinkwaya, N-Y-I-L-I-N-K-W-A-Y-A? 
A.	Yes, he was at the meeting. 
Q.	And was the bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune there?
A.	No, he was not present at the meeting. 
Q.	In the préfecture of Kigali-ville, were there some people who held the posts of presidents of commissions? 
A.	I do not exactly recall, but whenever the préfet was to be in attendance at the meeting, the sous-préfet was supposed to be there.  Maybe that is what you mean by presidents of commissions.  They had to assist him in his duties. 
Q.	Yes, that's exactly what I mean.  Was one of those people Jean-Baptiste Butera, B-U-T-E-R-A? 
A.	Yes, he was responsible for administration -- 
Q.	And was he at this meeting of 10 April? 
A.	-- and political affairs.  

	Yes, he attended the meeting. 
Q.	Could you write down his name, please?  

Was an individual by the name of Fabien Bunane, B-U-N-A-N-E, present at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, he was there. 
Q.	Can you put his name down on the list as well?  
Q.	Was a person by the name Aloys Simpunga present at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, he was present at the meeting. 
Q.	And can you put his name down on your list, please?  

Was a person by the name of Faustin Munyakazi present at this meeting? 
A.	I do not remember such a person in the préfecture of ville Kigali.  I don't remember that person as being employed in the préfecture of the city of Kigali. 
Q.	I'm informed that he was the -- in charge of the commission on infrastructure and equipment, and perhaps you would know as a sous-préfet.  Does that refresh your recollection?  
A.	I just remember there were sous-préfets, but I don't remember such a name so that I cannot tell you if that person attended the meeting.  I cannot recall his face. 
Q.	Okay.  Now we'll move on to the conseillers of the secteurs of Kigali.  Can you tell me if Conseiller Gabriel Mbyariyehe was present at this meeting? 
A.	The préfecture of Kigali-ville had 19 conseillers de secteur, and 15 of them were present at the meeting.  I believe he was also there.
Q.	Okay, so can you put his name down on the list please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	And for the court reporters, the spelling is M-B-Y-A-R-I-Y-E-H-E. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Was the conseiller Euphrasie Kamatamu present at this meeting?  
A.	Yes, she attended the meeting. 
Q.	Can you put her name down as well, please?  

Did the conseiller Odete Nyirabagenzi attend this meeting?  
A.	Yes, she attended. 
Q.	Thank you.  And if you could write her name down as well.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm informed that the French translation came out "Nyiramasuhuko," and I'm going to spell the name that I actually gave, which was Nyirabagenzi.  It's N-Y-I-R-A-B-A-G-E-N-Z-I.  And if I neglected to spell Kamatamu, it's K-A-M-A-T-A-M-U.

A.	Yes, Conseiller Michel Haragirimana participated in the meeting. 
Q.	And if you could write his name down.  

Did the Conseiller Stanislas Mbonimana from Gitega secteur attend this meeting?  
A.	No.  He did not attend the first meeting.  He sent a representative, one of his cellule responsables. 
Q.	Do you recall who that was? 
A.	His name was Bizimana, Majaliwa. 
Q.	And if you could write that down, please on your list. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	And in the meantime, I'll spell Michel Haragirimana, which is H-A-R-A-G-I-R-I-M-A-N-A.  
	Stanislas Mbonimana is M-B-O-N-I-M-A-N-A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness UB, can you spell the name that you've just written down, "Bizimana"?  And you gave another name; can you spell that for us?

Did the Conseiller François Gahigi from Gatsata secteur attend this meeting? 
A.	I don't quite recall if he participated in the meeting of the 10th. 
Q.	Okay.  And what about the conseiller from Gisozi secteur? 
A.	No, he did not attend the said meeting. 
Q.	Was he killed by the RPF?  
A.	No.  I have not sufficient information on this issue.  I cannot tell you if he was killed by the RPF or the Interahamwe. 
Q.	And what about the conseiller of Kacyiru secteur, did he attend the meeting?  
A.	Yes, he was present at the meeting. 
Q.	And what was his name? 
A.	I think you should help me; give me his name.  I see you have his name on the list.  I don't remember his name any more. 
Q.	Actually, I don't have his name, so maybe you can just write "conseiller of Kacyiru".  

Was the conseiller of Kagogo secteur, Jean-Baptiste Rutasingwa, present?  
A.	No, he did not take part in the first meeting, but in the ensuing one. 
Q.	Okay.  What about the conseiller of Remera secteur?  Did he participate in the meeting of the 10th of April?

A.	Biziyaremye is B-I-Z I-Y -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Oops -- please, it came a bit quickly from the Kinyarwandan booth.  Could they please repeat it? 

Biziyaremye, B-I-Z I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  Biziyaremye, B-I-Z-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you.  And what about the conseiller of Kagarama secteur?  Was he present?  
A.	No, he did not attend. 
Q.	What about the councillor of Kimisange secteur, K-I-M-I-S-A-N-G-E? 
A.	Yes, he did attend. 
Q.	Could you write down his name and then spell it for us when you've completed that?

A.	Yes, he did attend. 
Q.	If you could write his name.  I understand it's spelled M-I-N-A-N-I.  

Now, we've covered the conseillers.  I'm now going to ask you about the other members of the security council. 

First of all, with respect to the military, can you tell us the names of those persons representing the military at this meeting of 10 April 1994?  
A.	I don't remember exactly the names of the soldiers, the military people who attended, because it wasn't the same person who attended each time.  So I can't tell you who attended on the meeting of the 10th of April.  If I remember the name of the conseillers, it is because they were my colleagues, but I cannot give you the name of the military who attended.  
Q.	Now, when you were first interviewed about this back on the 28th of November, 1997, you told the Prosecutor that General Marcel Gatsinzi was present at this meeting.  Do you recall whether or not he was present? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	Can you write his name down on that paper, please?  And that's spelled G-A-T-S-I-N-Z-I.  

Now, you also in that statement said that a Commander Rutayisire was also present at that meeting on the 10th of April.  Do you recall now whether he was there?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you write his name down?  

Do you recall whether General Gratien Kabiligi was present at this meeting?  
A.	I don't think -- I -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I think we'd better get the witness to repeat that answer, because it wasn't clear whether he did or did not attend, as he wasn't sure in any case.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, the interpreters did not get your answer to that question.  So, was General Kabiligi present at the meeting of the 10th of April? 
A.	No, he did not attend the meeting of the 10th of April.  I remember well now, he did not attend. 
Q.	And Colonel Bagosora, did he attend the meeting of the 10th of April?  
A.	No, I did not say that Colonel Bagosora attended.  I said that the -- the soldiers, high-ranking officers were present, but I did not specify that Bagosora was present, had attended that meeting. 
Q.	Yes, you're quite correct about that, but I'm giving you a few names.  You can just tell me yes or no.  You haven't mentioned them in the past one way or the other.  And the next one is Colonel Ephrem Setako. 
A.	I don't even know Setako, so I can't tell you whether he was present or not. 
Q.	I'm told that the military commander for Kigali was Colonel Felicien Muberuka, M-U-B-E-R-U-K-A.  Was he present at this meeting? 
A.	No, I did not see him. 
Q.	Are there any other representatives of the military who you can recall as having been present at this meeting? 
A.	No, I do not remember the names of the people representing the army at that meeting, so I cannot give you the names of people representing the army at that meeting. 
Q.	Turning now to the gendarmerie, do you recall the names of any gendarmerie officials who attended that meeting?  
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers, I'm alive to the time, we're not far off the break, and Your Honours will be aware that we've been going through a list of names since five to three.  Now, it's the delicate question.  I would invite my learned friend to explain to Your Honours what the purpose of going through this long list of names is with regard to his case and the cross-examination of this witness.  To what end is this, the examination of the witness with regard to assessing his credibility, or is this some sort of investigation taking place in order for my learned friend to make further enquiries elsewhere?  

If it's an investigation, one would have thought that many of the people whose names have been offered by Mr. Robinson himself are people who would have been talked to by the Defence in any event, so that Mr. Robinson is not acquiring information he doesn't already have.  I'm a little uneasy and puzzled about what the purpose, as an exercise in cross-examination, this is, and I would also wonder -- it may be I don't need to worry about it -- to what extent are we going to be going through all the names again when we deal with the meeting of the 14th of April and the meeting of the 16th of April and the meeting at the end of April?  I don't know.  I don't know what's in my learned friend's hands -- or what's in his mind.  But I invite an enquiry from the Bench as to what end this line of enquiry advance the cross-examination of this witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like me to answer that question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could take his headphones off, please.  

Mr. President.  Mr. President, my purpose is this:  These are meetings that are very much contested, and the object of having this witness say exactly who was present is to establish his testimony with certainty, under oath, before this Court, so that later we can -- we can refute that testimony as to either the contents or the existence of the meeting by the very people he said were in attendance.  So it's necessary for us to have a complete list of all those people who attended, and you'll probably be seeing many of those people as witnesses for the Defence.  And that's the purpose.  

Now, with respect to the subsequent meetings, my intention is to create one list for the 10th of April and for subsequent meetings, to ask him to either add or subtract from that list so that we don't have to go through this exercise again.
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend is thorough, as always, but he can call any number of witnesses to say that this witness's recollection of events on the 10th of April is wrong.  Insofar as he has identified individuals who he proposes to call as Defence witnesses, he can simply put to the witness that certain individuals were there.  It's then on record that they were there, according to the witness.  And we will hear from them, one anticipates, a long time from now, during the Defence case.  But the methodology being used by my learned friend to go through each and every individual in order to be able to set up an opportunity to call some individuals to contest either the existence of the meeting or, alternatively, the contents of it, I respectfully submit, is unnecessarily time consuming.  

He need only put to the witness, "I suggest the people A, B, C, D, E, F and G were present at that meeting."  The witness, I anticipate, will give an answer in response to that, and then we can move on.  We don't need to spend 30 minutes drawing up a list of names.  And I do shudder at the thought that we are going to be going through a names process for the other witnesses.  Even though my learned friend is inviting the adding to and the subtraction from the list, I can see that it's going to take time again.  I respectfully suggest that this could have been dealt with quite quickly, in a manner different to the present manner.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think the matter could have been dealt with more quickly absent such an objection and the lengthy submission, but in any event, I'm open to suggestions to improve what I'm doing.  But it seems to me that it's very important to establish who was present at this meeting.  

I haven't spoken with every person who is on his list, so there's some that we will continue to contact, and so, again, I think I'm doing the best I can under the circumstances.  But if someone has any practical suggestions as to how to get this information in a quicker way, I'm open to doing it that way.  

So, would you like to take a break now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.  

We take the mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1530H)
(Pages 25 to 38 by Karen Holm)




(Court resumed at 1602H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, is the list completed yet or -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's not completed yet, but we're -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how much farther do you think there is to go?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think there's maybe less than ten names to go.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I did have an idea, Mr. President, of speeding things up.  I was thinking that perhaps we could give the witness some homework to do by asking him to make a piece of paper for the 14th and the 16th in which there's basically two columns, plus and minus, and he can take the list from today and he can write the people who were added on the plus and the people who were not there on the minus, and he can bring that with him tomorrow, and then maybe it will go a little more quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  But you will ask him if he can do that -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- later.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It would also be helpful at this stage if we could know which meetings of the four Mr. Robinson claims did not take place, because when we had this discussion before the break, I believe there was a suggestion that some meetings did not take place at all and others that he was disputing the content.  So in terms of putting his case to the witness and clarifying matters for the record, that also would be helpful.  And here we have the 10th, the 14th, the 16th, and the 30th.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll do that in the course of my examination, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, if we could continue now with the people who were present at the meeting of the 10th of April -- and we're speaking of the gendarmerie -- can you recall the names of anyone representing the gendarmerie who were present at that meeting?  
A.	Rutayisire was present.  It's possible -- I don't know if he was representing the gendarmerie.  The préfet -- the prefect knew who were the members of the security committee proper, but we didn't know whether the gendarmerie was represented by one person or another.  That was not part of our tasks or duties.  The representative of the army doesn't need to be present in person.  He can delegate someone else.  

As to the gendarmerie, the person I saw there was Rutayisire, who was in the company of other gendarme of lower rank.  The person in charge of Muhima and Nyamirambo could accompany their high-ranking officers, such as the conseiller could be accompanied by responsable from the cellule in his secteur.  
Q.	Do you recall the names of any of the gendarmerie who attended that meeting, besides Commander Rutayisire?  
A.	I am not in a position to tell you whether one person or another -- whether such and such was present or not.  When such meetings were held, whoever had to attend would attend.  What I'm saying is that the meeting did take place on that date, on the date in question.  The prefect might introduce one person or another by saying, "We acknowledge the presence of so-and-so," but wouldn't go as far as to say, "but he's accompanied by this person or that or another."  
Q.	I'm informed that the commander of the gendarmerie for Kigali was Lieutenant Colonel Laurent Munyakazi, M-U-N-Y-A-K-A-Z-I.  Was he present at this meeting?  
A.	I know that he was in command of the gendarmerie in Kigali, but I did not see him at the meeting.  I told you that the security committee provided for in law was one where such people should attend.  But when a prefect called a meeting, he summoned other people to take part in the meeting -- to attend the meeting, and I tell you I did not see Laurent Munyakazi at that meeting.  
Q.	Another member of the security council was the president of the tribunal of Kigali for the first instance, Jean Hategekimana.  Was he at this meeting on the 10th of April?  
A.	There were various authorities in Kigali town.  The names of the people I gave are not people who were supposed to attend the meeting as required by law.  It's true that they were -- some were -- that he was obliged to come, as many others should have attended, but I cannot tell you that he was present.  When you know someone very well, you cannot say that they were present.  He should have attended.  In any case, he should have.  

And, similarly, the prosecutor -- the office of the prosecutor can send a assistant prosecutor and say that they were represented.  I know that the committee did include other people, and the prefect discussed the sort of problems that are normally discussed in the security committee.  The bourgmestres were naturally present at the meeting.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness B (sic), try to concentrate on my questions, and answer them directly if you can.  We'll save some time that way.  
Was the prosecutor of Kigali present, François Xavier Nsanzuwera?  That's N-S-A-N-Z-U-W-E-R-A.    
A.	He was not there.  
Q.	I'm told that the person responsible for the immigration service in the préfecture was named Tharcisse Rubwejanga, R-U-B-W-E-J-A-N-G-A.  Was he present on the meeting of the 10th? 
A.	He was there.  
Q.	Okay.  Could you add his name to our list, please.  

Was there a representative of the intelligence service for préfecture of Kigali present at the meeting on the 10th of April?  
A.	Yes.  That person was present.  
Q.	Can you write down his name, and then spell it for us after you've completed it?  
A.	The name is Bigega.  
Q.	Is that B-I-G-E-G-A?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And was the director of the Kigali prison at the meeting of the 10th of April?  
A.	I do not remember this person and can, therefore, not tell you if they were there or not.  That person should have been present, but I am not able to tell you for sure if the person was present at the meeting.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that the political parties were represented at this meeting on the 10th of April 1994.  Can you tell us the names of those persons who represented the MRND?  
A.	The MRND was represented by François Karera.  That person was present and representing the MRND party.  
Q.	If you could write his name down, please.  

Did the MRND have any other representatives at that meeting?  
A.	He was accompanied by Interahamwes, including one Maniragaba and Suedi Ndayitabi.  
Q.	Could you please write those two names down on the list?  Ndayitabi, I believe, is spelled N-D-A-Y-I-T-A-B-I, and Maniragaba we have spelled earlier in the session.  

Was Jean Habyarimana present at this meeting?  
A.	Habyarimana did not come to the first meeting.  
Q.	Can you tell us, who represented the MDR?  
A.	I do not remember the name of the MDR representative on that occasion.  
Q.	When you were interviewed about this meeting on the 29th of April of 2004 -- and this is in the first paragraph -- you said that the MDR was represented by Froduald Karamira.  Can you recall if he was present?  
A.	I think I made that statement, but I don't remember very well.  The fact is that the parties in government were represented.  They had first been convened for the meeting and sent representatives thereafter.  I'm not in a position to tell you the names of the representatives of the 15 parties.  This happened a long time ago.  I am not in a position to give you the names of the various party representatives.  Karemera lived in the city of Kigali and ought to have been present at the meeting.  What I mean is that I do not remember the MDR representative for the Kigali-ville préfecture.  Various officials were usually accompanied by other members of their parties.  
Q.	In that same statement, you indicated that the representative of the CDR party who attended that meeting was Stanislas Sambizi.  Do you recall whether or not he was present?  
A.	Yes, he was present.  
Q.	If you could write -- 
A.	There's no way I could forget to mention him.  He lived in***************, and I clearly recall he was present at the meeting.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  If you could write his name down, please, that's S-A-M-B-I-Z-I.  

Was there anyone else representing the CDR at that meeting, that you can recall?  
A.	I was able to identify that one, but he was accompanied by other CDR members, various party representatives in the surrounding areas.  He was accompanied by persons I could not identify.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, with respect to the PDI party, do you remember the person who represented the PDI party at that meeting?  
A.	The party's representative was Babuzinturo, Djuma.  
Q.	Can you please write that name down.  And it's spelled, the first name, D-J-U-M-A, and then B-A-B-U-Z-I-N-T-U-R-O.  

Do you recall who represented the PDC party?  
A.	No, I do not remember.  
Q.	In your interview of the 29th of April of 2004, you gave the name "Sibomana."  Do you recall such a person being present?  
A.	Yes.  That person was present, I remember.  He represented the PDC party.  
Q.	If you could write his name down, please.  

And do you recall the names of any other leaders of political parties, such as PSD or PL, who attended that meeting?  
A.	I said the préfet called party representatives to the meeting, and, therefore, the préfet is best placed to know how many people were at the meeting.  If he invited representatives of the parties to the meeting, those parties should have been represented, but I certainly did not try to find out who the various party representatives were.  I knew that this was a meeting convened by the local authorities.  
Q.	And was there anybody else who attended this meeting whose name you can recall that we have not yet mentioned?  
A.	I do not remember everybody who came to the meeting.  I told you a long time has passed since the meeting was held 12 years ago.  I did not think such questions would be put to me and, therefore, did not prepare for them by recalling names of other participants.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would offer the list that the witness has compiled as Exhibit D. NZ76 and ask you to direct the registrar to provide copies to the parties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's admitted and so ordered. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ76 admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could I just have a look at it, please?  Could I see the list?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Issa, I think the Judge would like you to collect the list from the witness and show it to the Bench.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what was discussed at the meeting on the 10th of April and by whom?  
A.	The meeting of the 10th of April dealt with security in the city of Kigali.  Each conseiller depicted the situation prevailing in his secteur.  The préfet chaired the meeting.  In general, they dealt with security in the city of Kigali.  
Q.	Now, we have seen from the Radio Rwanda broadcast of that day that Préfet Renzaho ordered that roadblocks were forbidden during the daylight, those roadblocks set up by the population, and they should be mounted only during the evening and supervised closely by the security committee in the respective areas.  Was there a discussion about roadblocks at the meeting itself?  
A.	We mentioned the fact that the Interahamwe had erected roadblocks in neighbourhoods.  We also said that Tutsis were targeted victims of the killings.  And if he made statements on the radio to the effect that the roadblocks should be dismantled, as far as I'm concerned, that did not resolve anything.  It was not enough.  The fact was roadblocks were still standing in Kigali, and this was until the end of June.  
Q.	During that radio announcement, Préfet Renzaho warned all of the wrongdoers and requested the population to fight against killers and thieves and others who threatened their security.  Was that discussed at your meeting on the 10th of April?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Could you remind us of the date of this broadcast, or could you make it -- link your question specifically to one of the exhibits that you put in evidence?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I'm referring specifically to Exhibit D. NZ74.  

MR. WEBSTER:
What was the date of that, please?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Ten April.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, was there any discussion about assisting or requesting the population to fight against people who are killing and looting?  
A.	No such thing was discussed during the meetings.  No one spoke to say the killings should be stopped, that the population should be protected.  I am not aware of the content of the communiqué broadcast on the radio.  I do not know when that communiqué was broadcast.  But if you do not question the bourgmestre, if you do not send gendarmes on the ground, it's pointless.  I think this communiqué was drafted by someone so that it could be produced in a court.  I do not even know if the communiqué was read out on the radio.  In all the meetings that were held, no instructions were given to the effect that the roadblocks should be dismantled.  
Q.	And after each of the conseillers reported about the killings in their secteurs, what was the discussion or result of the meeting by those who were -- 
A.	Basically it was said that the bodies that were visible along the roads should be removed.  That is the point that was stressed.  There was no emphasis put on stopping the killings.  Nothing was said about that.  I do not know how the préfet can account for that.  If that is the version he is giving you, well, that's another matter.  But a lot of emphasis was put on the removal of bodies that were visible along the road.  
Q.	Was there any discussion about participation by the Red Cross in the removal of bodies?  
A.	The Red Cross asked to be allowed to intervene.  That is part of its duties.  The Red Cross intervened to pick up the corpses.  Therefore, this issue was not debated during the meeting.  All communes were operating at the préfectoral committee.  No communal committee met to take a decision on the matter.  All those decisions were made at the préfectoral level.  
Q.	And was there a representative of the Red Cross in attendance at this meeting on 10 April?  
A.	Several people were present.  I do not remember the person who represented the Red Cross.  The Red Cross was not one of the authorities whose representatives had been invited.  I did not see anyone representing the Red Cross in the city of Kigali.  I must point out there was a Red Cross body at the préfectoral level.  
Q.	Now, after the meeting on the 10th of April, you have told us that sometime that day you had a discussion with your brother about events that had occurred at the Hotel Diplomat.  And I would like you to be given a piece of paper and have you write down the name of your brother that told you this information, and it's going to be placed under seal.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, if that document can be collected from the witness and admitted as Defence Exhibit D. NZ77?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ77 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, can you tell us approximately what part of the day on the 10th of April did you see your brother?  
A.	It was in the afternoon around 3 p.m.  I remember it was between three and four in the afternoon.  
Q.	And where did this take place?  
A.	He found me at my house.  
Q.	Was there anyone else present when the two of you discussed what had happened at the Hotel Diplomat?  
A.	No.  He was my brother.  So when my brother came to see me, I did not seek to invite other people.  There was just my brother and me.  
Q.	And what was your brother's position in the Interahamwe?  
A.	He was a member of a cell of the Interahamwe that I mentioned.  So he was an Interahamwe in my secteur.  Moreover, he was the one in charge of that cell.  
Q.	So he was the head of the Interahamwe in a particular cellule in your secteur; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And when you saw him on the 10th of April, did he have a gun?  
A.	Yes.  When he came to my house, he had a weapon that he had just collected from that place.  
Q.	Prior to the 10th of April, did he have any weapons?  
A.	No.  I had never seen him with a weapon.  I had never seen him with a weapon.  
Q.	Now, can you tell us, when he described what had occurred at the Hotel Diplomat, did he tell you who had spoken to the people assembled there?  
A.	He told me he was with other Interahamwes who were natives of other secteurs.  He told me firearms had been provided to them at that place by soldiers, that the person who had spoken was Callixte Nzabonimana, minister of youth and community associations.  He said they should help the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Now, did your brother ever say that Mr. Nzirorera was present at the meeting at the Hotel Diplomat?  
A.	He said to me that when the ministers had spoken to them, they'd said that leaders of the MRND party at the Diplomat Hotel had other duties.  So, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, he said, had other duties, that they had discussed with members of the army; and a decision had been taken that they should collaborate with the soldiers -- that the Interahamwe should collaborate with soldiers.  
Q.	And as far as what your brother told you, neither Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Nzirorera, or Mr. Karemera had participated in this meeting; correct?  
A.	He told me that the person representing these officials was Nzabonimana, Callixte.  He was also an MRND member.  So there was no need for me to dispute statements by those ministers.  I could see my brother carrying a firearm.  I did not attend the meeting, so that I cannot tell you if Mathieu, Joseph Nzirorera, or Édouard Karemera were in attendance.  I merely had to rely on what my brother had said.  I, therefore, did not know if they had attended the meeting, but he told me that the three were at the Diplomat Hotel.  
Q.	I'm going to read to you what is contained in a report of interview with you on the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th of April 2004, here at the UNDF, by a representative of the Office of the Prosecutor.  And after meeting with you, this is what he reported that you said on that occasion, that "According to the witness, between 8 and 10 April 1994, very probably on 10 April, his brother, who was the leader of Interahamwe in a specified cell, had informed him that he had just participated in a meeting held at the Hotel Diplomats, with Nzirorera, Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera, Interahamwe national committee, Kigali Interahamwe leaders, and their men in attendance."  

It goes on to say that "His brother had told him that during the meeting, there was a call to unite Hutus in their fight against their only enemy, the Tutsi.  And at the end, new arms brought from Kigali camp by soldiers were distributed in the presence, notably, of Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, to Interahamwe who had not been given arms in the past."  

So, Witness UB, did you tell a representative of the Office of the Prosecutor, in April 2004, that Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera and Karemera participated in this meeting with your brother, and that Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera were present when the weapons were handed out?  
A.	I said that my brother had informed me that the meeting had been held at the Diplomat Hotel; and that the person who had spoken was the minister whose name I mentioned; and that Nzirorera and Mathieu were at the same hotel.  I did not say they were in the place where the meeting was held.  They were at the hotel.  And the person I mentioned took the floor to address those people.  That is what I told the Prosecutor.  I said that when that person took the floor, Nzirorera and Mathieu were at the hotel.  
Q.	Well, what's recorded in this interview report is that Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse and Karemera participated in the meeting; and Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse were present when the weapons were handed out.  Now, did you tell the representative of the Office of the Prosecutor that?  
A.	I said that -- what I said was based on a report to me by my brother.  I did not say the meeting was held at the Diplomat Hotel, which meeting was chaired by Nzirorera.  So I said my brother said that Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse were carrying out other duties.  That is what he told me, and I clearly remember this.  My younger brother gave me this information.  
Q.	Well, how can you account, then, for what appears in your interview report by the Office of the Prosecutor?  
MR. MORLEY:
If I may rise to my feet at this point, my learned friend has asked -- perhaps if the witness might remove his headphones, please.  

My learned friend has asked the same question twice.  And the question has been, did the witness say what the investigator has written down as being what the investigator thinks the witness said or means; and he has denied it twice.  And my learned friend is now asking the witness to account for why the investigator may have written down something that the witness says he did not say.  And in my respectful submission, it is not a proper question for this witness.  It is a proper question for the investigator, if the investigator is called.  

I remind Your Honours that -- and I know Mr. Robinson knows this -- the account given by this witness of what happened with his brother appears in the witness's handwritten document at paragraph 15, handed in to the Court at one point, relating to the events on the 10th of April.  And I fully understand why my learned friend wishes to embarrass the witness, as best he can, by an inconsistency between what the investigator has written down in what is an unsigned and previously unseen account, and what, of course, this witness has said in his own handwriting in the report he filed on the 15th of December.  

Insofar as my learned friend is trying to demonstrate an inconsistency, the difficulty he has is that that report is something unseen by the witness, and if one wants to go to inconsistency, one can go to the handwritten document, but, unfortunately, there is no inconsistency there at all.  It's my respectful submission, the last question is inappropriate.  It's a question for the investigator, not for the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I think perhaps Mr. Morley is correct about that.  I think I can ask the investigator.  We'll add him to our witness list, and he can testify to what exactly this witness told him.  So I'll move on.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, did you ever tell anyone from the Office of the Prosecutor that you, yourself, had attended meetings at the Hotel Diplomat around 10 April, when the MRND executive bureau and Colonel Bagosora had ordered that guns be distributed to militiamen?  
A.	No, I never took part -- I never attended any meeting at Diplomat -- Hôtel des diplomates.  I told you how I learnt of the distribution of the weapons.  I told you that my brother came home with a firearm.  I never took part in any meeting at Hôtel des diplomates because I was not an Interahamwe.  So I never said I attended a meeting at Hôtel des diplomates on the 10th.  I told you that it was what my brother told me, reported to me.  He came back from that place with a firearm, and there were other people who had received arms at that time.  And I say, yet again, I did not attend a meeting at Hôtel des diplomates.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have a request of the Trial Chamber.  In paragraph 89 of the pre-trial brief, it says that Witness UB will testify that he, too, attended meetings with the MRND executive bureau and Bagosora at the Hotel des diplomates around 10 April, and that they ordered that guns be distributed to militiamen.  

At paragraph 125 of the pre-trial brief, it says that Witnesses HH, UB, and AWE will testify about having attended meetings at the Hotel des diplomates sometime around 10 April and that guns were distributed to them, for use on the roadblocks, by the MRND executive bureau -- or in their presence, with their knowledge, or with their apparent assent.  

And I don't see, from any of the disclosure that has been given to me, where Witness UB has said that he was personally present at the Hotel Diplomat on the 10th of April.  So I would ask the Trial Chamber to direct the Prosecution to either disclose the source of the information in its pre-trial brief or strike it.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend's argument is interesting as always, but it's premature.  That is a 98 bis point.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, with respect to disclosure, Mr. President, the witness is here on the stand.  If there's information in the possession of the Prosecutor to support the statements in the pre-trial brief, it should certainly be disclosed before the witness finishes his cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend has all the relevant disclosure.  He also knows that there are other witnesses.  He also knows that this witness is under a judgement in Rwanda.  The point that's being raised is a point to be raised after we've heard all the evidence, at the conclusion of the Prosecution case, under a 98 bis motion, as Your Honours know, a motion which examines what Prosecution evidence has proved what.  My learned friend's invitation is plainly premature.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, in relation to this witness's participation in the meeting, does the Prosecution intend to prove that?  
MR. MORLEY:
There are other witnesses who will be called, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
To prove this witness's participation?  
MR. MORLEY:
There are other witnesses to be called, and that's as much as I can say at the moment.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President.  Sorry. 
(Pages 39 to 49 by Wendy Molnar)



































1700H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I have decided what to say now.  I was just wondering since it was only you and Mr. Robinson who were involved in this discussion.  It would have been politically correct to say "gentlemen".  
MR. MORLEY: 
It may not apply to me, Your Honour, but certainly for Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Politically correct, but maybe not so accurate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think that Mr. Morley's application to strike is in -- Mr. Robinson's application to strike is, in fact, premature.  But, Mr. Morley, you have said something which has caused us some concern, which raised the possibility that you may have witnesses that will contradict what this witness has said.  Now, if that is in fact the case, that would be a Rule 68 disclosure.  And we would just like to put on the record that we can see that to be a Rule 68 matter, if you have other witnesses who will be contradicting what this witness has said on oath.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Of course, it would be.  And all I can say at the moment is, if there is material, then it will be in my learned friend's hands as soon as we have it.  That's all I can say.  

Your Honour's looking at me in a way in which I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. MORLEY:
I have seen it before in other jurisdictions.  All I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, what that statement suggests, it suggests things that you ought to say and haven't said.  It suggests that you don't have it now.  It suggests that you might get it.  Well, if that's the case, why can't you say it?  
MR. MORLEY:  
Mr. Webster is going to come to my rescue, Your Honour will be pleased to hear.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't mean to suggest whether Mr. Morley needs any -- any rescuing, but as a practical matter, every witness that's listed for trial on this case, we have made complete disclosure.  So to the extent that one witness contradicts another, all of that material is in the hands of the Defence.  In fact, with respect to Rule 66 disclosures, there's probably only two or three witnesses whose statements are disclosed in redacted form, but for the most part, everything in this case has been disclosed in unredacted form.  

I don't -- in my review of the material, and I've been going through it as the Court was deliberating on the issue, I have not seen any -- any contradictions and I've gone through the disclosure for AWE, for HH, for UB, for the witnesses that are mentioned in the pre-trial brief and I don't -- from what I've reviewed, don't see any contradictions but as a practical matter, all of that material is already in the hands of the Defence, and most of it, with the exception of three witnesses is disclosed in unredacted form, so there should be no problems for Mr. Robinson to look at the materials, examine them, investigate on the basis of those materials, and draw his own conclusions.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I can tell you I have a pretty good idea of what is in the disclosure.  And I think Mr. Webster is correct that the -- there is no disclosure of any witness who says that this witness was present at the meetings.  I think Mr. Morley, frankly doesn't know his case well enough so he's bluffing you, "Well, these other witnesses  ..." but he doesn't really know.  But I think from what we do know is that paragraph 89, which speaks only of Witness UB, says that "Witness UB will testify that he attended these meetings."  

Now, if there is some factual basis for that in the disclosure relating to UB, where it said that he attended a meeting, this meeting, we don't have it, so we want it.  On the other hand, if this is a mistake, if the Prosecutor simply was careless or made a mistake in his pre-trial brief, they have to say so now and either strike it or at least place on the record that they are not contending that he was present, because the pre-trial brief -- you are using that against us as putting us on notice all the time of things that we should be preparing for.  And if there is something -- so it's not satisfactory to wait till the end of the case about the pre-trial brief.  If there's something the Prosecutor knows is in the pre-trial brief that's not accurate, it ought to tell us.  And if it is accurate, then we ought to have the disclosure behind it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Robinson, there is a lot of merit in what you have said, but I don't think it's something that the Court should make an order about at this time.  It's something that has just arisen.  I think that the point you have made is legitimate, that is the Prosecutor, after review, decides not to pursue that allegation, it will be beneficial to the conduct of the case for them to say so.  And I don't think that I can make an order at this stage, striking that from the pre-trial brief.  I think it would be premature for me to do that.  But I think the Prosecutor's heard the comments you've made and if they don't intend to prove that allegation, it would be helpful to the trial process if they said so.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  

Does Mr. Webster, want to say something on this point because there is another point I want to raise?  

MR. WEBSTER: 
I don't want to extend the discussion unnecessarily, but, I mean, the allegations that we are intending to prove are the allegations against the Accused.  We are not prosecuting UB.  So, the pre-trial brief is an overview of the evidence that we will adduce.  All the -- inevitably, there will be contradictions or slight contradictions between witness testimony.  It's inevitable, you know.  In any -- if you get three or four people together and ask them to describe an event, there will be differences between the three or four descriptions.  We concede the fact that at some point witnesses may contradict each other, but on the fundamental issue, which is whether the executive bureau of the MRND caused guns to be distributed at the Hôtel de Diplômates, it's consistency between -- among the witnesses that we've listed on our list and the accounts that we've provided in pre-trial brief.  And I go back to the point originally made by Morley, which is that these are issues to be addressed at the end of the Prosecution case.  It's wasteful of our time to discuss these issues now.  And this follows, you know, the same line of motions that 
Mr. Robinson has raised in the past, and we can't keep re-assessing the evidence at this stage in the proceedings.  There's a time to do this, and it's at the end of the Prosecution case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the only point on this is that -- as I mentioned, I don't think it's a matter that warrants an order from the Court, but once allegations are alive, then is the issue of efforts to rebut them.  So it does save time if there were issues which were not alive that you gave notice of.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, but, I mean, on that point, Your Honour, the allegation is not that UB attended a meeting in -- at the Hôtel des Diplômates, the allegation is that the MRND executive bureau, which would include, necessarily, Ngirumpatse, Karemera and Nzirorera, were present at the Hôtel des Diplômates, and were aware that guns were being distributed, and either ordered them to be distributed, or knew and encouraged that they be distributed.  That's the allegation.  That's the allegation that's alive in the indictment, that's alive in the pre-trial brief, and that's we set out to prove.  We're not proving -- there's no intention on our part to prove that UB was -- was present at the Hôtel des Diplômates.  UB is providing evidence for the allegation that the MRND executive bureau was responsible for the distribution of weapons.  So, I don't know if we're talking at cross purposes here, but I think, you know, I rely on my previous submissions that these are issues that are better addressed at the close of the Prosecution evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I won't hold my breath for any amendments to the pre-trial brief or further disclosure, but I think you've done what is probably the most you are going to do on this situation.  So if we can move on to my next application, which is:  I make an application for a disclosure of the hand-written notes of the investigator, if they exist, for the statements of the 26th to the 29th of April 2004, which contradict this witness.  Because I think, as Mr. Morley has pointed out, it's necessary -- it's going to be necessary and material to the preparation of our Defence that this investigator gives evidence.  And his handwritten contemporaneous notes of the conversation are probably the best physical evidence that exist concerning what Witness UB told him.  And I would ask that you order that those be produced, at least for inspection, under Rule 66B. Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Why do these applications have to take place now?  We are all concerned with moving the case ahead.  We have a witness on the stand.  These are not issues that have to be resolved at this time.  
Mr. Robinson's objections -- or his applications would be alive on the 17th of March when we start to decide how we go about making arrangements for the next trial session.  Can we proceed with the cross-examination of this witness so we can finally bring it to an end?  All of these applications, and I'm referring to Mr. Robinson's evidentiary objections and applications, are better dealt with when we don't have a witness on the stand to testify.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we take note of your application.  We don't rule on it right now.
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  

If somebody can keep track of it so that we do receive a ruling at some point, I would appreciate that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And we would like an opportunity to -- to respond.  I will respond to it, but I would prefer that we proceed with the witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, this line of objection was actually started by the prosecution.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe the Court can refresh my recollection on that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, there isn't too much time to do that.  But do you have a brief answer you will state in one sentence or two to Mr. Robinson's motion?
MR. WEBSTER: 
His motion is inappropriate.  The Court need not order contemporaneous handwritten notes to be delivered.  The investigator's report is a reflection of the investigator's recollection of his conversation with the witness.  And beyond that, he can speak to the investigator.  If he wants to call him as a Defence witness, that's another matter, but this Court should not require the investigator to produce his set of handwritten notes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I won't bother you with a reply to that.  I'm ready to proceed with my cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just have ten minutes more, so let's move on.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Witness UB, with respect to the information you received from your brother about the distribution of weapons in front of the Hôtel des Diplômates on the 10th of April, were you informed that 
	Georges Rutaganda and Bernard Muniragaba were participating in the distribution of weapons on that day at the Hôtel des Diplômates? 
A.	Yes, I did receive information according to which some members of the national Interahamwe committee took part in the distribution of firearms.  When he said members of the national committee, I already had the answer, I didn't ask for further information, but he did tell me that those people were present. 
Q.	And by "those people" are you referring to Georges Rutaganda and Bernard Muniragaba? 
A.	When I say the members of the national committee, as regards Muniragaba, I don't doubt his presence.  He had to be present, as well as Rutaganda, Georges Rutaganda, were all available in Kigali town.  I say they were present not because I was there, but on the basis of information given to me. 
Q.	I understand, Witness UB.  Thank you very much.  Now, were you aware that on the 10th and 11th of April 1994, the leaders of the national Interahamwe committee toured the secteurs of Kigali, including your secteur, and transmitted a message from the interim government and the MRND leadership to stop killing? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  On the 10th, I noted that the killing was continuing -- continuing, but I was never informed that such people had received such instructions. 
Q.	Now, we've heard testimony in this case from a member of the Interahamwe national committee that on the 10th of April 1994, the members of that committee went to your secteur, and that in your secteur, Bernard Muniragaba spoke to the people at the roadblocks, and told the people that the government had given them a mission to stop the massacres and to bring back the dead bodies to the road, and that the people in your secteur agreed to do that.  And I'm quoting from testimony given on the 
	18th October 2005, at page 33.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	I was not informed of that because nothing was done -- nothing like that was done.  I know that on the 10th an Interahamwe shot an inhabitant in my area, five -- not 500 metres away.  I am not aware that Bernard came and made any such speech in my area, at least I wasn't informed thereof. 
Q.	Okay, had the conseiller of your secteur had members of the Interahamwe national committee come to your secteur with a military escort and instructed people at the roadblock to stop killing, do you expect that that's something that would have been reported to you?  
A.	Had that happened, the killing would have stopped.  It was not necessary that I be informed.  Had such an order be given, the killing would have stopped.  I didn't need to be informed because he wasn't under my orders.  What I know is that the killing never stopped from that time until we went to -- into exile, whether Nyakabanda or Biryogo or Nyarugenge secteurs.  In the Gitega secteur where Muniragaba was a responsable, I can't say that he would have given such an instruction and then continue the killing in the secteur where he is a responsable.  If a committee national -- a member of the national committee gave such an order, it was never followed.  I never heard that the Interahamwe had stopped the killing in any given secteur. 
Q.	Now, Witness UB, we are at the end of your testimony for today, and I'm going to ask you if you would be willing to do some homework to make our session go faster tomorrow.  You've produced a list of names of persons who attended the meeting of the 10th of April.  Tomorrow we are going to discuss the security meetings of the 14th and 16th of April, and my request to you is that in the evening or tomorrow morning before you come to court, you take the copy of this list that you've created, and on a blank piece of paper, you write "the 14th of April," and you have two columns, one is plus and one is minus.  In the plus, you write the names of people who were present on the 14th but who were not present on the 10th; and in the minus, you write the names of the people who were present on the 10th and who were on your list, but who were not present on the 14th.  And that you do this on a separate piece of paper for the meeting of the 16th of April as well.  Are you willing to do that?  
A.	I don't think it would be quite so easy to draw up this list because I told you that I can speak of the participation of conseillers -- of councilors, but as to other people, that is difficult.  If there was a list available, I could say, "Yes, I remember so-and-so attended."  The list I prepared was of people who usually attended meetings.  Otherwise, I can't tell you that on such-and-such a day, so-and-so didn't come because I didn't take notes whether one conseiller or the other was present or not.  I can't tell you that at such meeting so-and-so was present, but at another meeting so-and-so was not present. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President -- 
THE WITNESS: 
I was not appointed secretary.  I'm not in a position to prepare the list you've asked me to prepare.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'll -- very well, Mr. President, I will proceed tomorrow as best I can.  Would you be ready to take the break now or would you like me to continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, it's time to take the break now.  Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe Mr. Robinson could help us with an inquiry I had made earlier.  Earlier he stated that with respect to these four meetings, several -- or some of them he claims never took place, and some of them he alleges were mischaracterised in terms of the content of what was actually discussed.  And if he could clarify that for the record.  I think he mentioned that he would come back to it, but I haven't heard that come up today.  I don't know if he has plans to do that tomorrow, but it would be appropriate for us to know that today.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, as much as the Prosecutor is trying to get inside into our case, I do plan on covering that with the witness and I think that's the extent to which I'm required to provide that information at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, gentlemen and ladies.  We -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, not that I'm disappointed, but I thought that we were going to start the day today with a discussion of timing and how long the cross-examinations are going to continue, and to get some sense of how many witnesses we'd complete by the end of this session.  And we've come to the end of the session -- the trial session today.  I think it would be appropriate to release the witness, but I think it's in every one's interest to get some clarity on how we are going to proceed from here, for the rest of this week and next week.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not convenient for us to do it now.  In fact, on reflection, we could have done that this morning when we were waiting for the witness to look at the video.  But I am anxious to do something of that nature as soon as possible.  So I don't know if we can see if you could fashion 30 minutes some time during tomorrow to see if we can arrange it.  We'll try and see if we can find some time to do that, but I think we have to leave now.  

We take the adjournment until tomorrow now.  

Mr. Witness, you are reminded, as usual, not to discuss the -- your testimony of the case.  
(Court adjourned at 1733H)
