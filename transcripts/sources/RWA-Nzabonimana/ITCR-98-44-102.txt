P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The session is opened.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  We are beginning slightly late because it would seem there had been a problem with witnesses.  Things are now back in order, I believe, and I am told that Mr. Hooper and maybe Mr. Robinson also wish to present a motion.  Is that correct? 

Yes, Mr. Hooper, you may go first. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Good morning, Madam President.  It's not so much a motion as reflection of difficulties that have arisen.  As I stand here, I have no idea which witness of three is going to step into that witness box this morning.  I received, at seven o'clock on Friday evening, that's when it reached me, a transmission of a direction of this Chamber to inform me, and I quote, "That the Chamber has decided to authorise the Prosecutor to lead the evidence of Witness GIN on the new allegations disclosed to the Defence on the 23rd of April, to include paragraphs 10 and 11 of the statement."  And that I understand; it's plain.  "Secondly, the Chamber further grants additional time to the Defence of M. Rwamakuba to prepare for the cross-examination which will take place on Friday, May the 7th, 2004."  Reading that, I assume that GIN will now be giving her evidence, or cross-examination, on Friday, which concerned me because of the limit naturally enforced by the weekend, the fact that we are not sitting the next week and also that this Court just doesn't generally sit on Friday.  And I wasn't clear even to what extent it was going to sit on Friday. 

So I prepared for other witnesses other than GIN, while at the same time having to keep one foot, as it were, on the possibility that GIN would be giving some degree of limited evidence today.  That's the first matter. 

So my practical difficulty is that I have been wrong-footed, if I can put it like that, to the extent that I don't know which witness is coming forward this morning, which is a necessary -- or which is a -- quite a handicap when it comes to preparing cross-examination, because one isn't in a position then to focus entirely on one but has to focus on three. 

The second matter is this -- so it would assist me, first of all -- there is another matter but perhaps I can keep that separate at this moment -- to know what the position is this morning, which witness we are having, and subject to that, there will maybe be a further application in respect of that witness from me.  And I'd also like to contribute an observation in respect of the Kayanga evidence itself being dealt with on Friday, but can I leave that initial matter that I've raised with Your Honours and seek clarification, what the position is, this morning as to which witness?  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia?  Do you wish to respond? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Go ahead. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  It takes us as a surprise, Your Honours, that Mr. Hooper doesn't know which witness is appearing today.  When I finished my cross-examination -- examination-in-chief of Witness GIN on Thursday of last week, it was with the understanding that it was pending the ruling that was to be rendered by Your Honour with respect to the Kayanga health centre.  There was never any doubt that, whichever way that ruling went, it was the continued cross-examination or continued examination-in-chief of Witness GIN.  Therefore, this morning, Your Honour, the witness who is to appear before you for her continued examination-in-chief is Witness GIN, to be followed by GIT, as scheduled by the Prosecutor's order of appearance given last week, and even before that, with respect to Witness GIN, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, yes, we did leave Court at half past one or so on Friday, but I've received a notice that says, "The Chamber further grants additional time to the Defence of M. Rwamakuba to prepare for the cross-examination which will take place on Friday."  Not part cross-examination but the 
cross-examination.  So it isn't clear.  I understand the Prosecution are ready, and I'm not sure whether that complies with the Court's intention.  Did the Court intend GIN to carry on today and then have a divided cross-examination?  Or what was the position? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
For the Chamber, matters were quite clear, Mr. Hooper.  Ms. Makwaia was to conclude her examination-in-chief today; in other words, on the additional material on Kayanga centre.  As for you, we have given you additional time, about one week, so that you can prepare yourself with regard to the additional material, because with regard to the formal allegations, there were no problems about that.  You had already prepared yourselves.  What was problematic, obviously, was these -- this additional material on -- regarding paragraphs 10 and 11.  Consequently, what we want -- and that's the message we transmitted on Friday -- that today, Ms. Makwaia will conclude her 
examination-in-chief, including matters on the additional information, additional charges, additional evidence, but next Friday, you will have had time to prepare yourselves in order to cross-examine the witness on the additional evidence.  This is what the Chamber stated and we are now clarifying, if that had not been clear for you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, thank you, Madam President.  The difficulty sometimes arises that what is clear in one's mind doesn't get conveyed, and I can say that all Defence counsel that I've spoken to, in any event, this morning are in the same position as me.  The transmission that we got was quite clear:  
Cross-examination would take place on Friday.  That's what it says.  And I can see perhaps a sympathetic nod, to some extent, from one of you Judges.

Now, the point is this for me.  Over the weekend, I was preparing for -- because I thought it was quite possible GLM might come as a witness today.  There have been such surprises before.  And so I prepared or tried to prepare for three witnesses to arrive this morning.  Now, if it is to be GIN, my preparation is fairly complete.  My one problem has been a logistical one, inasmuch as photocopiers weren't working and haven't been working.  Now, the result of that is that there are documents that I may very well be referring to, which I haven't had the opportunity to copy.  I can get round that by reading parts of those documents out, for example.  Most of them deal with transcripts of evidence given -- in fact all of this, in terms of this witness, will deal with evidence previously given in another case.  But I would feel better prepared if I had an opportunity to photocopy some parts of those transcripts.  I would have thought that that would take -- I don't dare say how long that will take because it depends if the photocopiers were working, and they work only 50 per cent of the time, but that's the only difficulty I have in terms of that. 

Now, it may be that if there is going to be further evidence, Madam President, perhaps I could raise the matter again -- perhaps I could raise the matter again when we finish, as it were, this witness's evidence-in-chief, because that may take a little while, I don't know, by which time Ms. Benga will have tried to convince the photocopier to work and perhaps I don't have a problem.  So can I leave it as it were at that point?  So I'll send Ms. Benga off to do that chore -- she's much better at it than I am -- and hope that something satisfactory comes out of it. 

So I'll move on, if I may, to my second point. 

This is in no way, at least not directly, seeking to go behind your decision in terms of time for the Kayanga evidence, or the exclusion of the evidence, which, of course, is my application last week.  By putting my cross-examination off until Friday, in respect of that, will not help me because it won't provide me with any effective time.  I get time but no effective time, for two reasons.  First of all, I'll be, of course, fully employed and engaged here, in terms of a sequence of witnesses.  Secondly, my investigator is here in Arusha, and in order to get him to Rwanda, where the necessary inquiries will have to be made, will take a little time because of the administrative demands that are made when such an application for such a mission is to be considered by the registry.  They are always very helpful but it does take some time.  So between now and Friday, or between last Friday and this Friday, there is nothing further that I could do that I haven't done.  And that must be relatively minimal because where you're going to get -- the product of any investigation or inquiry is going to be in Kayanga or amongst people who know what happened there.  And at present, I'm not even assisted by a date, for example, as to when this particular event took place, which leads me then to the difficulties of researching potential alibi in respect of Dr. Rwamakuba and his position.  So the position is this:  As far as Kayanga is concerned, I do not anticipate I'll be in any better position on Friday than I am today because, between now and Friday, I cannot put myself in an adequate position to cross-examine on Kayanga.  I put that before the Court for its earnest consideration.  It would better assist me, and more conveniently assist me, if, for example, Kayanga could go over to the next week.  After all, we do have a week off.  I can send an investigator.  I may be able to find some things out over that week and we could start again with the witness on Kayanga, or revisit Kayanga, on the Monday, because I'm quite content in some respects to deal with what I can today on that subject, but there may be matters that will, I hope, emerge.  The witness itself -- herself, as you'll come to hear, cannot be, I would have thought, too greatly inconvenienced because, as far as I know, she's a convicted prisoner in Rwanda and I suspect her conditions here are probably a lot better than they are there, but that's a personal reflection.  So she is rather in a different category.  So that's my position on that. 

If you're still holding out Friday to me as an opportunity, it's not an opportunity that much helps me, and I don't feel I'll be greatly assisted by it.  But perhaps I can fully reserve my position as to that to the end of my cross-examination, which will embrace Kayanga today.  Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Ms. Makwaia, please.  For the continuation of the cross-examination of the witness, if we do not do it this Friday but the other Friday -- in other words, the 14th -- would that cause any problems for the Prosecution? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, the Prosecution wouldn't have any problems.  Our only fear is it will have to be finished so that Witness G can commence.  He's scheduled on the 17th.  That's the only fear we have, because once in cross-examination, it's out of our control.  But we wouldn't have any problem if this particular aspect is put off to the 14th, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Ms. Makwaia, for that. 

I now want to turn to the Defence.  We had allowed a break from the 10th to the 14th of May so that you can prepare yourselves for Witness G.  If there are no difficulties for the Defence -- and when I'm saying "Defence," I'm referring to the Defence of the four Accused -- we are ready to give you another week, Mr. Hooper, for your preparation, but we would at least inform Mr. Hooper that he had already the opportunity to present a request last week for his investigator to be sent to Kigali.  But we are ready to give you an extra week if all of the Defence counsel are ready to make this effort so that we meet here on the 14th of May, Friday, the 14th of May. 
MR. HOOPER:
For my -- sorry.  For my point of view, that would be slightly better.  I'll still moan and say it's not enough time and -- but it's always better to get more time.  The -- I know fellow counsel had plans to attend to investigations, work and research in that time.  That may cause them difficulties in having this Friday.  When one looks at the circumstances, I would have thought that the Kayanga 
cross-examination is unlikely to take more than an hour, and one wonders, in those circumstances, whether, despite the concerns with Witness G, it might not be possible to have that cross-examination first thing on Monday, the 17th.  It's unlikely to run past 10:30.  I see a lot of shaking of heads from the Prosecution end of this Chamber.  I've obviously stepped into very holy ground here.  I'm not quite clear why.  But it might possibly assist everyone.  I don't want to make myself deeply unpopular with the Defence teams as well by this request.  I'm in enough trouble already.  Thank you. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Just an additional matter, Your Honour, I should have addressed earlier.  We do have pending another witness, Witness GIT, whom we had expected to hear this week, but given the pace, Your Honours, we would like an indication from Mr. Hooper, and perhaps the others, on how long they might be taking in their cross-examination of Witness GIN so we would be in a position to advise the WVSS on whether to return this witness until the following session or to retain her here. 

And to Mr. Hooper's submission that we take the cross-examination on the 17th, Your Honour, we do not think that's a good idea.  A lot of logistical matters are being taken into consideration to ensure Witness G's evidence starts on the 17th, and we wouldn't like it to be hitched by any witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the Chamber will be aware of my acute awareness of judicial economy, and I can, I hope, safely assure the Prosecution that, notwithstanding any wholly exceptional and unforeseen circumstance, that this witness and the next witness should be completed, and completed easily, this week. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson? 

MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  First of all, I don't have any problem if on the 14th we hear the 
cross-examination or if we do it on the 17th, but I want to -- I think it might be an appropriate time to make the motion that I had intended to make at the beginning of this session, and that is, I would like to make a motion to the Trial Chamber to reconsider the granting of Witness G's testimony during this session.  And my motion is based upon the new circumstances that have arisen with respect to the case of Prosecutor v. Bizimungu. 

As the Trial Chamber may be aware, that case was supposed to start today and has been suspended because the Presiding Judge has resigned, and it's going to be necessary for a new Trial Chamber to be constituted or at least a new Judge to replace him.  The reason why we were all required to take Witness G this session was because there was a plan to have him appear only once for the three cases, Bizimungu, the Military case, and this case.  Now, it appears impossible for Witness G to testify in the Bizimungu case in May or in the beginning of June, and therefore the reasons for scheduling Witness G this session, then, and disrupting what was otherwise our plan no longer exist. 

So it's my request that you take another look at whether it's even wise to have Witness G come this session, given that he'll have to come back again for the Bizimungu case, and wouldn't it be better for all of us to continue without any breaks, to finish all the witnesses for this session, and then take Witness G at the same time, perhaps in July, when the Bizimungu case has been recommenced and they can again take all three trials, his testimony in seriatim, as had been planned. 

I also want to let you know that this weekend I plunged into the materials for Witness G, to try to begin my preparation, and we have some serious problems because of the lack of translation.  There are 292 pages of transcripts of interviews by the Canadian authorities that are only in French, and I had my legal assistant do a summary, he did about a 15 page summary in English for me, and the materials that are contained in those cassettes are extremely important.  In many instances they seem to contradict the other statements that this witness has made, and I need a translation of this material into English before I can adequately cross-examine Witness G. 

Secondly, Witness G makes -- is linked inextricably with another Witness, Witness T, who was his best friend and who was also a member of the Interahamwe committee and who he has many, many events, from the 6th of April through the end of July, in context with this witness.  Witness T has 39 cassettes of transcripts, none of which is in English, in which he describes these same events, and in just a cursory review of those transcripts by my legal assistant, it appears that there are tremendous contradictions between the events related by Witness T and the events related by Witness G.  And so I need to have that material translated so I can work with that so I can confront Witness G with inconsistencies with Witness T, as well as his own inconsistencies, which I'm only finding exist in French. 

Now, I know I'm supposed to try to work in both languages, and I spend almost an hour a day trying to learn French, but I'm not able to work in French to that extent that I can translate material by myself.  And I don't have a co-counsel, and I haven't had one now since the middle of January, that can do this job for me. 

So I'm asking the Trial Chamber to -- considering all of these circumstances, to reconsider its order and to, instead, take the witnesses that were planned on calling for this session and have Witness G come in July or some other time when he can come in all three cases and when in the meantime the materials can be translated into English.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President.  Thank you.  I completely support the motion made by Mr. Robinson, for the same reasons that he advanced, but I should pay homage to the suppleness which he himself and Mr. Hooper have displayed when they say they are ready to abide and deal with the constraints caused by disclosure from the Prosecution.  I don't have that same flexibility.  I am shocked that the Defence can be asked, day after day, to deal, in just a few moments, with materials that are always disclosed systematically late.  This is not accidental.  We had this problem with GFA.  We had it in the past during the first session.  We had this same problem now with GIN.  We also had it with G.  Because we have to abide by these constraints and to continue with the order in the session. 

Now, all of this does take examination, and we each time have to deal with these constraints and the Prosecutor's agenda. 

For me -- perhaps Mr. Hooper supports this and Mr. Robinson can deal with this -- but for me, this is not something I can deal with because this goes against all of the principles established by the Rules and goes against all of the principles of equality of arms.  If the Prosecutor has had three years to discover, on 23rd of April, that there was new charges, new allegations, brought against Mr. Rwamakuba in potential statements given by GIN, we logically would need 60 days to work on that, and not to work Friday, on 17 May -- or Monday, 17 May, or 14 May, the Friday.  We are at the Prosecutor's mercy. 

I would ask that this entire trial be subjected to the Rules, and the Prosecutor says, "Well, we need -- we want to bring new allegations," and if we respect your control of the proceedings, you must tell the Prosecutor, "We will not hear those new allegations.  We will not admit for you to argue those new allegations, and the trial can continue without the Defence having to be in a position to have to deal with these constraints." 

I have an application regarding our team, Madam President.  I have examined the transcripts of Witness GIN that were disclosed to us recently.  I have discovered that we cannot work without having all of the transcripts of GIN, because, by reading the transcripts of 14 September 2001, I see, at least on ten occasions, statements made on 17 April 2001 under seal.  Without those statements, under seal, without the transcripts, of 17 April 2001, I can't continue.  I need them.  I would ask the Chamber to order the Prosecutor to disclose those transcripts of 17 April 2001, and they are mentioned ten times during session 14 September 2001.  And if they are mentioned ten times, that means that they are of interest.  And for the cross-examinations that we need to proceed with for GIN, we need entire, complete, full disclosure of those statements, including those that we have just learned of by reading the transcripts.  And that disclosure should have been done spontaneous by the Prosecution.  The Prosecutor had to know about them, because the Prosecutor most certainly did read the transcripts of 14 September 2001.  This is my application, respectfully, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, can I respond to some of the matters raised by Mr. Weyl?  Now, with respect to the transcript that he's been reading about of the 17th of April 2001, Your Honours, the reason he's not been served with that transcript is because, as a result of the death of late Judge Kama, the Kamuhanda trial was restarted de novo, Your Honours.  So that transcript does not form part of the official record.  We have served on the Defence counsel all of the transcripts that they should be served upon with respect to Witness GIN's testimony. 

Now, he's also addressed some disclosure issues, Your Honour, in a very general manner so it's a bit difficult for to us respond to it.  If he's got anything specific in mind, could he please tell us so we can address the omission, if any?  

Now, with respect to Counsel Robinson's submissions on whether or not there will be a Judge sitting in the Bizimungu case as of the 17th of May, this year, Your Honours, we will not join in the speculation on this fact, Your Honours.  It may very well be by that date there may be a Judge sitting in that Trial Chamber.  Your Honours have already made a ruling in respect of the testimony of Witness G, and the Prosecution intends to proceed on the 17th of May, subject to any other -- any other conditions that may arise then, which we shall address when they arise in real fact and not in a speculative manner, Your Honours. 
The Prosecution is now ready to proceed with Witness GIN. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, can you please sit down?  We are still deliberating.  Thank you. 
	
	Very well.  The Chamber maintains what it said before.  Cross-examination regarding the new allegations with respect to GIN will take place on Friday, 14 May.  We also maintain the dates regarding Witness G.  The Chamber cannot change, on the basis of speculation, its decisions.  If it becomes necessary to change, we can adapt our decision.  However, but for the time being, we maintain the dates that were given. 

We remind the parties that we will not sit on Friday, so you will have an extra day to conduct your investigations and you also have the time and the week off to prepare the cross-examination of Witness G, and prepare, rather, for the examination and cross-examination of Witness G. 

We will now usher in the witness. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very briefly, please. 
MR. WEYL:
I remind you of my motion for disclosure of statements of 14 February 200 -- September 2001.  Counsel Makwaia told me that the death of Judge Kama put an end to that first session of the trial, but I didn't think that it annulled statements made under seal, and they are referred to at great length in subsequent trial days in that trial, and so I remind the Chamber of my motion for disclosure of statements of 14 September 2001. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we have taken due note of your motion, and we shall respond to that motion. 
MR. WEYL:
The difficulty, Madam President, is that those documents are necessary for us to conduct the 
cross-examination of the witness who is going to appear in the box. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia, very briefly, please. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Madam President, if Counsel Weyl is insistent on his demand for these transcripts of the 17th of April, Your Honours, then there is another step he's got to undertake.  He needs to file an application before the relevant Trial Chamber to have these closed session transcripts unsealed and served upon himself.  That is another matter he needs to undertake.
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President, sorry, can I interrupt?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You are two counsel -- two counsel standing.  One needs to sit down. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper, you have the floor. 
MR. HOOPER:
The witness is in the witness box and is not wearing earphones, and I'd like it left like that, please. 

There has been a motion before the relevant Trial Chamber for the disclosure of all the transcripts relating to this witness, including that of April the 17th, 2001, and as far as I know, that motion was allowed.  What concerns me is this:  Do the Prosecution have possession of the April transcripts of this witness?  And if so, why haven't they disclosed them to us? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
In response to Mr. Hooper's question, no, I haven't got possession of the transcript of the 17th of April myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, we need to stop with this and proceed.  If you have one last issue to raise and then the Chamber will make a ruling. 

Mr. Weyl, you have the floor. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President, thank you.  I will come back to what I pointed out.  I don't understand Ms. Makwaia's argument.  Mr. Hooper gave a very clear response. 

Next, if we received the transcripts tardily, because I had them tardily, I discovered by reading them, those transcripts, that I wasn't able to do all this on this weekend because we can only work on the basis of the tardy disclosures that we have, if I only have this weekend to find out about transcripts that I didn't know about, that were hidden from me, I would ask the Chamber to adjourn so that I can make a motion so that the Chamber can make a ruling so that we can take up the debate again, given the decision for the communication and disclosure that was made by the other Chamber.  But I cannot be asked to go and see another Trial Chamber when I have not been given time to work under normal conditions and learn normally of the existence of transcripts that I can't imagine the Prosecutor did not read. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We shall deal with this issue, Mr. Weyl.  We are in the process of seeing what we can do.  Thank you very much. 

Madam Witness, good morning.  Madam Witness, we should like to remind you that you are still under oath.  Counsel for the Prosecution, Makwaia, shall continue the examination-in-chief, and that examination-in-chief will deal with new allegations that you have made. 

Counsel Makwaia, you have the floor. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Madam President.  
WITNESS GIN,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness GIN, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Now, after seeing André Rwamakuba at the trade centre following the killing of the young chap on the motorbike from Rutongo, did you see him again? 
A.	I did see him again.
Q.	Where did you see him? 
A.	I saw him come to the centre and greet people who were there.  He continued on his way.
Q.	And which way was he going, do you know? 
A.	He went into the following secteur, Kayanga, but I don't know what his final destination was.  At any rate, he did continue on his way towards that secteur.
Q.	And which month was this; do you remember? 
A.	It was in the month of April, April 1994.
Q.	Are you in a position to tell Their Honours approximately how many days was this after you saw him, after you first saw him at the trade centre during the killing of the young man?
A.	A few days went by.  I would say between two to five days had elapsed.
Q.	And do you remember during which time of day this was, when you saw him? 
A.	It's been a long time.  I will try to remember.  I think it was between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Q.	And where were you when you saw Rwamakuba pass through the trade centre? 
A.	I was ********, because ********** is located close by the road.
Q.	Now, did people subsequently come to ********** on that day?
A.	Yes.  People came to **********.
Q.	Who came to **********? 
A.	There was the brigadier of the commune, and the accountant as well as some policemen who were with them.  They came to ********.
Q.	Now, starting with the brigadier, can you please tell Their Honours his name? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MS. MAKWAIA:
And can that be spelled by the Kinyarwanda interpreters, please.
THE WITNESS:
His name was Nyarwaya. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Nyarwaya is spelt N-Y-A-R-W-A-Y-A, Nyarwaya.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And what was the name of the accountant? 
A.	His name was Rubanguka, Mathias.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rubanguka is spelt R-U-B-A-N-G-U-K-A.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	And the name of the policemen? 
A.	The policeman was from Bumbogo.  I do not know his name.  He was with those two -- those two.
Q.	Were there other people at *********?  And if you're related to them, please do not state their name. 
A.	Yes, They were.
Q.	Can you tell us how you're related to them?  
A.	The first person was my husband, and the others were my children.  As for the others, they were just neighbours, no relationship between myself and them.
Q.	And why did Brigadier Nyarwaya, the accountant and other people come to **********? 
A.	They had come to transport other policemen and Interahamwe to go and help them in the killings of persons who were at Kayanga, at the Kayanga health centre.
Q.	Did these people go with the brigadier to the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	Yes, they did.  They went with the brigadier.
Q.	How do you know? 
A.	They spoke about it.  They were ***************.  And they were saying that they were going to Kayanga.  They got on to two vehicles.  My husband left with those people, and when he came back, I asked him what had happened, and he spoke about it to me, and he told me about where all those events took place.
Q.	So what did your husband tell you happened at the Kayanga health centre when he came back? 
A.	He told me that the Tutsis who were at the health centre -- he said, first of all, Hutus and Tutsis were separated, and that subsequently the Tutsis were killed and that their bodies were thrown into pits which were there.
Q.	Did he tell you who killed the Tutsis there? 
A.	No.  He didn't give me all the names of the killers, but I do recall those who had left with him.  He said that all the people who were with him had participated in the killings and that they were assisted by others, and that the doctor who had taken the decision to have those people killed was together with Rwamakuba, and that's how he -- he witnessed the killings.
Q.	Now, did your husband tell you if Rwamakuba was present when he arrived? 
A.	Yes.  He told me that Rwamakuba was there.
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me.
THE WITNESS:
	And that the group arrived at the time when Rwamakuba was speaking with the doctor of the health centre. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Oui?
MR. HOOPER:
That was a leading question.  It was the second.  I didn't interrupt on the first.  Can my friend be careful not to lead the witness into evidence in that way?  Grateful. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I believe the witness had already testified that Rwamakuba was among the killers.  So she had already placed Rwamakuba in that particular location, Your Honours. 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Now --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceed, Madam Makwaia.
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Witness, you just testified that your husband told you that when he arrived, Rwamakuba was speaking to the doctor in charge of the health centre.  Did he also -- did he tell you what happened next? 
A.	The doctor had said that Rwamakuba had ordered that the Tutsis be killed, including even the wounded.  It's under those circumstances that the attackers began to kill people.
Q.	Did your husband tell you how long Rwamakuba remained at the health centre? 
A.	No.  I didn't ask him about that, because I didn't think questions would be put to me on that matter at a later date.
Q.	Did he tell you if Rwamakuba was present when they started the killings or he was just there for the first aspect of it, the organisational part? 
A.	He simply told me that once the decision to kill the people had been taken, that Rwamakuba was there but that he didn't remain at the spot for a long time.  He did not tell me how long Rwamakuba stayed there, but he said that at the time the killings had started, Rwamakuba was present.
Q.	Now, Witness, are you in a position to tell Their Honours what was the time that had elapsed between you seeing Rwamakuba going towards Kayanga and Brigadier Nyarwaya arriving at **********? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, can you please repeat your question? 
BY MS. MAKWAIA:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you in a position to tell Their Honours what was the time that had elapsed between you seeing Rwamakuba going towards Kayanga and the arrival of Brigadier Nyarwaya at **********? 
A.	That happened a long time ago.  It's difficult for me to recall these events.  But I can try and remember what happened.  Rwamakuba left.  One hour or an hour and a half later, Nyarwaya came to the centre in order to try and gather together his colleagues for the job they had to do.
Q.	Witness, when Brigadier Nyarwaya and the others arrived at **********, and when they left **********, including your husband, were they armed? 
A.	Yes.  They were always armed.  All those people were carrying weapons.
Q.	Can you tell us what kind of weapons, if you can? 
A.	The Interahamwe were armed with clubs, machetes and hatchets.  As for the policemen and the other Interahamwe, they were carrying firearms.
Q.	And this is my final question:  Which ethnic group did your husband belong to? 
A.	He was Hutu. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Thank you, Your Honours.  I have no further questions for the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Ms. Makwaia. 

Is it Mr. Hooper who will begin? Yes, Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President. 

With regrets to those members of the public who are in the public gallery, the first part of my 
cross-examination may well elicit answers that could reveal the identity of this protected witness, and in those circumstances, I am necessarily forced to ask that the next 20 minutes or half an hour of my questions be in closed session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Any objections from the Prosecution? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
No, Madam President, no objection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you. 

Very well.  We shall declare a closed session.  We do apologise to the public, but this is for the protection of the witness and in the interests of justice that we are from henceforth sitting in closed session. 
	(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 16 to 29] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
	(Pages 1 to 15 by Mark Porter.)



























	1140H
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, I'm speaking to you.  We are now in open session.  

Mr. Hooper, you may proceed.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That's all been in closed session.  We are in open session now, and for the benefit of the public transcript, which the public will have access to, I want to revisit or make a statement that ... (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted, and filed under seal) ...is that correct?
MS. MAKWAIA:
I object, Your Honours.  Your Honours, could that be stricken off the record, please?  These matters were addressed in closed session, they should remain in closed session.  Counsel chose to bring them out in closed session himself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Objection sustained.  Counsel, can you please move on to something else?  We are no longer in a closed session.  We are now in open session.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I was going to deal in greater detail with that matter, but it's my submission that the fact that this woman is a ... (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted, and filed under seal) ... is a matter that should be on the public record.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please.  Please, Mr. Hooper.  

Yes, Miss Makwaia.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I've already made my submissions in respect to this line of inquiry by Counsel.  The objection was retained.  I've made a submission, Your Honour, to have it stricken off the record.  The objection was also retained.  Can counsel move on? 
MR. HOOPER:
In my submission, the only basis for striking off the record would be if it identifies the witness.  I'm quite happy if the date of this ... (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted, and filed under seal) ... many years subsequent to the events that we deal with is a matter of public importance.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honour, Mr. Hooper clearly has no respect for your orders.  You've rendered a ruling.  He's going back to the matter again, reading on to the record the exact thing you've asked him to refrain from doing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we, as a Chamber, we have been very patient with -- but however, try, please make the effort -- if it's difficult for you, make the effort to respect and abide by decisions made by the Chamber.  You are not the one to make rulings; we are the ones to do so.  And please, you must comply.  And we have said that you should move on to another line of question -- questioning.  We were in closed session and you dealt with the matter, and you should no longer go back to that issue.  We are now in open session. 

Obviously, we are going to ask that everything be struck from the transcripts regarding the matter which has just been dealt with.

Mr. Hooper, you may proceed.
MR. HOOPER:
May I have a ruling, please, why that order is made?  Is it for the protection of the witness or is it for another reason? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
As is usual, it is for the protection of the witness and also in the interests of justice.  That is why we made our ruling. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, prior to talking to the Prosecutor here or giving evidence here in Arusha, or at any time, have you spoken about the events in Gikomero to any Rwandese prosecutor or official?
A.	No.  No one thought it useful to ask me any questions regarding the events that took place in Gikomero. 
	(Pages 30 to 31 by Karen Holm-Porter)














	1145H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have you not on a previous occasion before this Tribunal, stated that you have indeed spoken to prosecutors in Rwanda?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Can I have the citation of the transcript from which this information is being acquired, Your Honours? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Can I first of all have the reply from the witness as to whether she is saying yes or no?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, no.  You need to provide information first of all and then you will get your answer.  This is an objection which has been raised in regard to the matter you are dealing with. 
 MR. HOOPER:
April 2001, page 160.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, what do you say to that, that you have given a different response on a previous occasion?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, one moment.  Mr. Hooper, we have heard April 2001.  Can you give us the exact date, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
April the 17th. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Did you say 17th April 2001, page 260?
MR. HOOPER:
Page 160.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One hundred and sixty.  Very well, thank you.  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, is it possible for --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia for the  Prosecution.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, unfortunately, that is the transcript Mr. Weyl was claiming for this morning, which I don't have.  Mr. Hooper obviously has it.  Now, could he kindly read the question that was put to the witness and the answer, Your Honours, so that we can follow him more in a systematic manner? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In passing, Mr. Weyl, please be informed this was indeed the document you were looking for.  It is in the possession of Mr. Hooper at the present moment. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I have not received anything from my learned friend. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, we were looking for this document; unfortunately, we have found it with Mr. Hooper.  No, I am not saying that this was for the discussions.  I was saying that was going to now be obtainable for you from your learned friend. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you very much, Madam President, for that information. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, as I subsequently indicated, can I pass up to -- would you like a copy of the transcript?  Would that assist?  I am afraid we have only been able to print out in English because there is no photocopy facility, and there hasn't been for several days.  We managed to get access again this morning, but it only spoke English this morning, it hasn't done the French.  Can I pass the English -- I know you all understand it, and there is a copy for the Prosecutor as well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Please give us the document in English. 
MR. HOOPER:
And my friends don't have a copy of this, so can I read it?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And, Witness, you can understand -- incidentally, Madam Witness, do you speak English? 
A.	I think that you must have understood that I requested that I testify in Kinyarwanda, and I would therefore wish not to change language. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, do you have an objection to raise?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Going back to counsel's prior question, Your Honours, with respect to inconsistency with her testimony to date and what she said on the 17th of April 2001.  The question put to the witness, 
	Your Honours, was: "Did you speak to Rwandan authorities?"  

Now, if you look at the transcript, Counsel has kindly handed out, it clearly says --
MR. HOOPER:
Can't the witness deal with this?  Do you need to interject at this moment?   
MS. MAKWAIA:
The question that was put to the witness was:  "In April 17th, 2001.  So could you assist us to who you gave information?"  And she was very categorical in her response, Your Honours, it was to the -- the information was given to the judicial police officer.  Now the way the question was framed by 
	Mr. Hooper, it was so broad, Your Honours.  What kind of answer did he expect?  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Mr. Makwaia, and I am sure the witness may too. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Witness, can I -- do you understand English at all?  I understand Kinyarwanda is your language, but do you understand English at all? 
A.	To what use would that be to you understanding English -- whether I understand English or not, Counsel?
Q.	You were three years in Uganda receiving education, which is in English, isn't it?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I need guidance from the Trial Chamber.  Is it a criminal act for any witness to speak English, French -- to speak English or French apart from Kinyarwanda?  Is it something that should be taken against the witness, Your Honours?  I need guidance on that. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's a --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, you can state whether you understand a little or not at all this language and that would be all and we move on to something else.
THE WITNESS:
I understand some English, just like someone who does not speak Kinyarwanda but can say, "Good morning," in Kinyarwanda. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  It's just a small point but when you started your evidence on the 17th of April, page 118 of the transcript, you were shown details of who you were, all the details similarly as you were here and you said, "The details of my identity on this document are correct."  And you were then asked, "All right.  You recognise them even though they are written in English?"  And you said, "Yes."  You didn't have the difficulty you had at the beginning of your evidence here.  Do you remember that?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I object to that because I also read this transcript.  I don't have that particular one in hand, but my recollection of the witness's response was also that "This document had been shown to me before coming to court."  If counsel can locate that particular part before he starts impeaching this witness on that aspect, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, maybe I misunderstood a moment ago.  But for the record, I wish that it should be noted that Ms. Makwaia had indeed read the transcript of the 17th of April. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia, can you go on? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
No, Your Honours, it wasn't the 17th of April.  I read it in other parts of the transcripts, and if Counsel wishes, by tomorrow I could locate that position. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mrs. Makwaia confirmed that she has not seen the transcript of the 17th of April, given her last reply. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Mr. Hooper. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you will remember my question and you said that no one had bothered to come to speak to you, they didn't seem to find you interesting or words along to that effect.  I can't remember the exact words.  Now, let me put your answer to this question.  It was put to you on the 17th of April.  "Did you make any effort to approach the authorities, to tell them what you knew, that is, about the offences in Gikomero?"  You answered, "Anyone who came to see me seeking such information, well, I gave them the information."  Do you remember saying that, and, secondly, is it true? 
A.	Let me tell you one thing, Counsel, before I answer you.  You are asking me this question today.  You should know that the answer I gave depends on the manner in which the question is put to me.  I answered by saying that I gave information to the investigator of the ICTR who wanted to ask me some questions.  I do not see why you are distorting my answers. 
Q.	Or is it that you are holding on to the lifeline that was thrown to you by Ms. Makwaia a moment ago? 
A.	Do you think that human beings have different souls and different behaviour?  I am giving you my answer depending on my behaviour.  I am not answering in response to what had been said by 
	Ms. Makwaia. 
JUDGE LATTANZI:
Mr. Hooper, if I remember right, you had asked her whether someone from the Rwandan prosecutor's office had asked her questions regarding the events that took place in Gikomero.  So you then went on and asked her another question, unless I am mistaken. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we will go back in due course to the transcript.  But I think my question was broad enough to cover people approaching her generally about questions other than the Prosecutor here.  I can go -- I see you disagree.  Well, I will have to be judged on the transcript.  I can't remember the exact form of my question now.  But let's just establish what the position was because --
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you give any information to anybody to do with the Prosecutor or judicial authorities, investigators, in Rwanda? 
A.	There you are now you are asking the question such that I can understand you.  No one in Rwanda ever asked questions relative to those events -- the Accused here present.
Q.	What about the offences committed in Gikomero that you witnessed.  Did anyone come and talk to you about that, yes or no? 
A.	Let me make it easier for you.  Since we need to rebury all our victims in dignity, from time to time we provide information to persons who have nothing to do with this Tribunal. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia.
MS. MAKWAIA:
With your permission, coming back to the question of Counsel Weyl and Counsel Hooper, whether I had read the transcripts of the 17th of April with respect to my submissions of her response, I have actually located the portion she gave -- the response I gave to the Chamber.  This is found in the transcript 4th of September 2001 and her answer is found at line 17 to 25, page 17, Your Honours, just to set the record straight. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, let me go back to your testimony in April, and I am going to read the transcript, and I am going to ask you if it is true or not, so that we get a picture of what the position is.

You were asked at page 159, just before we come on to 160 -- I will complete the question because the Judges only have page 160. 

"Were you aware after the genocide that the authorities were gathering information about the perpetrators of the offences?"  And you responded, "Yes, I was aware."  Do you remember saying that; is it true? 
A.	If you read the statement correctly as you said, I didn't give that information.  I said that I knew those people. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, is it possible for us to have the documents that you have?  We don't have a single page.  We only have one page as you said earlier.  You are speaking of page 159, 160 but apparently, you have those documents.  Perhaps we can also have copies so that we can follow what you are saying.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I had difficulty getting this transcript.  When I did get it, we couldn't make copies because of the difficulties that I have already explained.  There is just one line, maybe we renew the problem, but I will carry on down on page 160 which you have.  I am just putting in the context of what she was being asked.  She was being asked whether she was in a position to -- whether she was aware the authorities were gathering information about the perpetrators of the offences, not a particular offence, and she said, "Yes, I was aware," and she agrees to that.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And then the next question, Madam Witness, in this:  "In view of your evidence today, did you make any effort to approach the authorities to tell them what you knew?"  And your answer to that was, "Anyone who came to see me seeking such information, well, I gave them the information."  Is that true you gave people information about the perpetrators of the offences?  Is that true? 
A.	Let me give you an example.  If the Tribunal investigators based in Kigali come to see me, I will give them information.  If investigators based here in Arusha come to see me for information, I will give them that information.  If authorities from Kigali come to see me asking for information, I will give it to them.  You have to make a distinction between things.  I think that you are mixing things up, and that is why the answer that I give to you in response to your question is not satisfactory to you. 
Q.	I will try and be clearer.  You were then asked this question, and I will read it slowly because I appreciate the booths don't have this document either.  "So, could you assist us as to who you gave you information -- sorry, as to who you gave information to prior to giving your statement to the investigators for the ICTR?"  And just pausing there, did you make a reply?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you indicate the page for us, Mr. Hooper?  Are you still on the same transcript and on which page?
MR. HOOPER:
Page 160, in the centre, second question. And the third answer on that page -- and just before I come to that, I asked the witness:  "Did you just give the name of somebody that you gave information to?"
THE WITNESS:
You want to know if I gave a name to Tribunal investigators?
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	No, I thought, that as I was speaking, you mentioned a name, one name.  If I am wrong about that, I will move on. 
A.	Counsel, you are making things difficult for me.  This happened in 2001.  Many questions were asked of me.  I don't know if I can remember giving a name.  This is very difficult for me. 
Q.	So, it's largely my fault.  Let me go back to your answer to who you gave information to prior to the information you gave to the ICTR investigators, and your answer was: "The first person to whom I gave the information was the judicial police officer of the Gikomero commune.  The purpose was to assist him in arresting those whom I saw participating in the massacres.  Secondly, I spoke to journalists during the burial of the other members of my family who were killed.  I also provided the same information to the Prosecutor's office of the Republic of Rwanda."  

Now, is that right?

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may speak, Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Madam Your Honours, Defence counsel is mixing things up.  Sometimes he asks me questions regarding the information that I gave to the Prosecutor's office in Kigali and mixing it with information I gave to Tribunal investigators.  That is why he is not satisfied with the answers I am giving him.  If it is possible, can you ask him to ask me questions that are more clear?  Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, currently, Counsel is speaking of statements that you made in the Kamuhanda case, evidence you gave in that case.  He is speaking of a transcript dated the 17th April 2001 in the Kamuhanda case. 

Mr. Hooper, if you can be more specific in your questions, perhaps this will assist the witness in answering your questions. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is it right that you gave information about the people who committed offences in Gikomero to the judicial police officer for Gikomero and also to the Prosecutor's office of the Republic of Rwanda?  Is that correct? 
A.	When I gave information to the judicial police officer of the commune, that information regarded people who were arrested at that time.  The judicial police inspector was speaking to people who knew the suspect.  When the person questioned -- knew the suspect, the person would give information regarding the suspect. 
Q.	Did you give information to the prosecutor for the Republic of Rwanda about the perpetrators of the genocide in Gikomero? 
A.	I did give information to the office of the prosecutor of the Republic of Rwanda. 
Q.	Did you mention André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I explained to you that when you give information, you speak of the person who was arrested at that time.  André was not arrested, and so his name wouldn't come up.  He was not in Rwanda.  It was not necessary for me to speak of him. 
Q.	But didn't the Prosecutor want to know who was responsible, whether they had been arrested or whether they hadn't been? 
A.	Well, I don't know if the Prosecutor was informed of that.  So not to speak of Rwamakuba at that time, Rwamakuba was not arrested, and so there was no reason for me to speak about him. 
Q.	So you didn't mention Rwamakuba to anyone make making enquiries from the Republic of Rwanda? 
A.	No one.  You were asked questions regarding arrested persons. 
Q.	On the 3rd of February 1998, you made a statement and I want to ask you questions about that statement.  First of all, do you remember the circumstances in which you came to make that statement?  How did it come about, can you remember? 
A.	I remember investigators from the Tribunal based in Kigali came to see me.  The first time, they were unable to locate me but I did know the people who had come to see me.  The second time, they showed up and we spoke.  They asked me questions.  They wanted to know if I knew a certain Rwamakuba.  I answered that I did know that person.  They wanted information about that person and I accepted to give it. 
Q.	So, is it your evidence that they came to see you about Rwamakuba? 
A.	They wanted information about Rwamakuba and about Kamuhanda.
Q.	But, who did they come to see you about principally?  Can you remember? 
A.	Both persons were being prosecuted for the same crimes, and so they needed information on both of them. 
Q.	Would it be right or wrong to say that you were asked about Kamuhanda and only as an afterthought was Rwamakuba mentioned?  Is that right or wrong? 
A.	I wouldn't have given information about Kamuhanda only without bringing up Rwamakuba.  If I gave information about Rwamakuba, it is because they needed to know something about him.  So I was asked questions about Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Have you any idea why those investigators came to you?  What caused them to come to your door? 
A.	I am certain, sure, that that was their objective.  They did it in the framework of their work.  So they know why they came to see me. 
Q.	Did they mention Rutabagirwa to you as someone who had suggested you might help? 
A.	They told me that Rutabagirwa had given them my address, but he did not ask them to come and see me. 
Q.	And among the two investigators who came to see you, was a man called Sidibe S-I-D-I-B-E?  Do you remember that? 
A.	If you have my statement before you, you can find that information.  It's been a long time, I didn't know those people.  There were people who came to see me as part of their mission, and so I can't remember those people.  And they didn't leave a copy of the statement with me, furthermore. 
Q.	Would you be assisted if I provided you with a copy of that statement?  Can you read English sufficiently to read that statement? 
A.	I didn't call you a liar.  I didn't say that there wasn't a Sidibe who came to see me.  I just don't remember that person.  That is all I am saying.
Q.	I accept that it is a very long time ago.  And I have moved on to ask you whether you would be assisted by a copy of the statement and asking you, would it help you?  Could you read it in English at all?
A.	How could that help me?

JUDGE ARREY:
Counsel, the witness has already said that there is no doubting. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you made that statement, and I remind you that it was the 3rd of February 1998, how long did you spend with the investigators? 
A.	Our meeting lasted from one hour to two hours, perhaps an hour and a half.  It is just an estimate I am giving you.  I wasn't counting the time.  I had an opportunity to speak freely and I didn't pay attention to the time. 
Q.	Can you remember whether the investigators were writing notes? 
A.	If they hadn't taken any notes, you wouldn't be having my statement before you.  Of course, they took notes.
Q.	And in addition to a note, do you remember if they had a tape recorder with them and using it? 
A.	No, they didn't have a recorder.  If they had one, it was hidden; I didn't see one. 
Q.	Did they then go away to come back on another day with a statement prepared? 
A.	They did. 
Q.	Did you sign that statement as being true? 
A.	I did. 
Q.	Did they read the statement to you before you signed it?
A.	They did.  They read it to me. 
Q.	Did they explain the content of the statement to you? 
A.	Yes, they explained in a few words.  I was at work, I didn't have enough time.  I was given a small break to deal with that matter. 
Q.	But did they read the statement to you so that you understood it? 
A.	Perhaps, you can rephrase your question.  I think I have already answered that one.  I told you that the statement was read to me. 
Q.	And when it was read to you, did you make any changes to it? 
A.	Yes, I corrected a few passages in the statements because the person who drafted it could have made a few mistakes in some places. 
Q.	But when you came to sign it, you were content and happy that it contained the reality of what you were saying? 
A.	I don't know what being satisfied means to you.  I believed that what was contained in the statements was, indeed, what I had said. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now I want to go in some detail into that statement.  You said you won't be assisted by a copy and I won't provide one to you, I will read it to you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Madam President and your colleagues, do you have a copy?  If not, I can provide you with one but it will be in English.  Would you like that or have you got copies?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have the witness statement, Counsel.  
MR. HOOPER:
In due course, I will ask that this be exhibited should I neglect to do that later.  And can I provide the interpreters with a copy?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters have a copy.  Thank you, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
It sounds being more efficient than usual on this side.  Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, at the time you made this statement, way back in February of 1998, were the events related in the statement fresher in your memory than they are today? 
A.	At that time, yes, I would say so.  It was closer to the events; it occurred in 1994 compared to today. 
Q.	Now, the first paragraph of the statement is a short one and I don't read it.  It relates generally to background.  My next paragraph in English commences: "I know Dr. André Rwamakuba."  And I am going to ask you some questions about this aspect of your evidence.  It may be better rather than read it disjointedly to you, if I take the opportunity now to read through much of this paragraph that I am going to refer you to, so that we can see its general context.  So I am going to read it slowly so it can be translated into Kinyarwanda over your earphones.  And it reads as follows:  And the interpreter can, of course, follow and translate from the statement.
	"I know Dr. André Rwamakuba, for I saw him driving his car many times.  I do not know the make nor the colour of the car.  The last time I saw him, I was able to see him closely.  He arrived in Gikomero secteur, the commune office of which was in a small centre which bore the same name 'Gikomero'.  It served as a refuge for threatened people, be they Hutu or Tutsi.  This happened on 12th of 
	April 1994, between 10 a.m. and 12 noon.  ********** was about a 100 metres from that house.  I was shocked by what he did to two people.  He had their certificates and tore them up.  I do not know how the certificates got to the hands of Rwamakuba.  I only saw him tear them.  I think he must have asked them for their identity card.  But as it was dangerous for the Tutsis to present them, it was common practice for them to say that it was lost, and produce any document which did not reveal their ethnic group.  

"I asked my husband who that man was.  He told me he was Dr. André Rwamakuba.  I then told him that I had seen the man several times.  The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba was wearing a pair of trousers and a shirt with the MRND party colours; that is, green and yellow.  He was wearing a cap of the same colour -- sorry, colours, with a hoe and a pruning knife called oronana in Kinyarwanda.  Rwamakuba was stout, average height and fair in complexion."  

	You then go on to say who he was with.  You talk of vehicles.  You talk the two people being taken away to be killed.  You talk about later the man on the motorbike and being killed.  And I will come to that in more detail in due course.  

And you end up saying on Rwamakuba, "I did not see Rwamakuba again." 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know, Madam President, if you found that in the French --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we found it.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
"I did not see Rwamakuba again but the massacres intensified.  After André Rwamakuba left for Kigali, the Interahamwe militia and elements of the Presidential Guard arrived in the afternoon.  With the help of the population, they started killing the refugees, more than 4,000."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, please.  I think that the Prosecutor wanted to intervene.

Yes.  Madam Prosecutor? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, is there going to be a question on all this, because counsel has read extensively the passages of the witness's statement.  Now if he is going to elicit any omission or contradiction from the witness, then he should do it in -- he should break it down, Your Honours, because now he is reading passages of the statement onto the record, moving to another aspect of the statement, reading that passage onto the record, Your Honour.  And when is the question going to come?  If he is going to pose any particular question to the witness about omissions or contradiction that she's given in respect of her oral testimony in Court today and her written statement, then he should do so,   Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  So let me just finish this little bit and then we will have the complete section so that we don't lose sight of it all.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I hope it helps you, the witness.  You don't have this statement in front of you, do you?  And you finish saying, and I will revisit it.  "I did not see Rwamakuba again." 
JUDGE ARREY:
Mr. Hooper, please, we all have copies of the statement, so it is not necessary for you to read everything.  Why don't you just go directly to show the portions that contradict what she has said in Court and then we proceed, please?  

MR. HOOPER:
Yes, indeed.  I am coming to the question.  It was fairness to this witness.  Can I just finish this last bit because then comes the question?  
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, Counsel Hooper knows very well how to cross-examine, admit it, and he knows.  If he is perceiving an omission on a particular aspect, he should put that omission or contradiction to the witness, afford her the opportunity to explain that contradiction or omission and then moves on to the next one.  He cannot lump five, ten, fifteen omissions -- perceived omissions without breaking them down and giving this witness the opportunity to explain herself, Your Honours.  He shouldn't just be allowed to read onto the record parts of the statement that he deems have got contradictions or omissions on them.  He should break it down. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, of course, I should. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So could you go about that step by step.  I think this will help us and will certainly help the witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So let's get to the beginning there of what you say.  You state there that you know Dr. André Rwamakuba, for "I saw him driving his car many times."  That is not something you told us in evidence today.  Is it right or is it wrong? 
A.	That would depend on the question put to me by the person interviewing me; that is the reason. 
Q.	How do you know André Rwamakuba?  What is your answer, please? 
A.	At any rate, I was asked a question in that regard.  I told them the number of times I saw him before the war and the number of times I saw him during the war.  Do you want to put this question to me to find out whether I know him by appearance or what?  What is your question dealing with?
Q.	Don't you worry about that.  I asked you a question:  How do you know Dr. André Rwamakuba?  How do you answer that?
A.	I knew him because I saw him often.
Q.	You have told us you knew him because he had been introduced at a wedding and then he visited a house that you had been there and he introduced himself to you there.  There is no mention of that in this statement at all, is there? 
A.	You can ask me a question at a given point in time.  At some other time, someone else can ask me a question.  So even if we get to the same answer, it would all depend on how the question was asked.  Let me give a concrete example. 
Q.	Yes.
A.	You can ask me the following:  How many times did you see Rwamakuba and what was he doing?  I can tell you that I saw him on two occasions and that he was moving or he was speaking to someone or that he had come to visit a family and so on and so forth.  

Someone else can ask me:  Under what circumstances do you know Rwamakuba?  And I can answer that I saw him in Arusha during a trial and that he was a sitting on the Accused's bench.  

At any rate, I have given you an answer.  I have given you information on Rwamakuba, but these questions were provided in response to the questions which were put to me, and these questions, and even the answers I have given, do indeed demonstrate that I know Rwamakuba. 
Q.	I wasn't clear about what you just said.  Do you see Rwamakuba in here today?
A.	It was only an example I was giving you. 
Q.	"I know Dr. André Rwamakuba," you told the investigators in 1998, "for I saw him drive his car many times."
A.	One can summarise an answer and say that one saw the person.  I saw him on several occasions.  Because what you want to know is that I saw him more than once.  At that point in time they wanted to know where I had seen him.  Unless you need other information, I believe I have answered that question, the number of times and where I saw him when that question was put to me. 
Q.	Why didn't you mention, for example, that he had been introduced to you at a wedding by name? 
A.	No.  At that time that question was not put to me in that manner.  I was asked how I knew him, whereas here I had been asked for details, where I had seen him.  I had said where I had seen him.  But  during my interview with the investigators, I said what I said.  I wasn't pushed any further.  I knew that I knew him.  I said that I knew him, and I said that I had seen him more than once and I gave other details, including what he was doing, and I believe that was sufficient.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think that you have put this question to the witness on several occasions.  The witness has responded.  She has given you examples to try and make you understand why she answered in a given manner in such and such a place and another way elsewhere.  So I think let's make a headway, let's move on.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Prior to April, when did you last see André Rwamakuba driving his car many times? 
A.	More than once.  When he came to the wedding he was behind the wheel and when he came to Etienne Ngirukwaya's house, he was driving his car.  I don't know.  When you talk about several times, many times, I don't know what you understand by that.  But for me more than once, it is already many times.
Q.	There was a massacre at Gikomero secteur Protestant school, and that was the greatest of the tragedies of Gikomero, wasn't it?
A.	No, that is not true.  At Gikomero there were two sites where there were massacres, at least massacres which were of a larger scale than what happened elsewhere. 
Q.	But that was one of them, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm, but I am saying it is not the only site at which large-scale massacres took place. 
Q.	Where was the other site? 
A.	You know, there were killings in all of Gikomero, but in my understanding, it was in the Gishyaka area, at the place which you mentioned, the place where there is a school complex at the secteur office. 
Q.	The Gikomero Protestant school is very close to where you lived, isn't it? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And in your statement, you claim that 4,000 people were killed there. 
A.	I never confirmed that figure.  The victims could have been fewer than 4,000 or more.  It was only a guess that I was making given the number of refugees that I saw there. 
Q.	But the killings there, on that basis alone, was a very significant event for you, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And, it may very much assist us all in this case if we can put a date to that.  And is it right that that massacre, as you say in your statement, took place the same afternoon as you say André Rwamakuba arrived in Gikomero secteur? 
A.	I cannot be specific about the time of the massacre that happened a long time ago.  But I think I did explain that on that day, the day of the massacres to the school complex, it is not the same day that he came to Gikomero.  I think that it was some days after -- a few days after the killings at the school complex.  

In regard to that date, the persons who wrote the statement may have made a mistake, but I had said that that was the day that Rwamakuba was seen in Gikomero. 
Q.	So let's be very clear what you are now saying.  First of all, there was a massacre one afternoon at the Gikomero Protestant school, and that was a very extensive massacre, in your evidence. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I don't think the witness actually said "afternoon", she said she couldn't remember the time; it was a long time ago. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is that right, Witness? 
A.	Please, repeat your question?  Reformulate it for me. 
Q.	What time did the massacre at the school take place? 
A.	I told you that I do not remember the date but I had tried to take a guess regarding the period of time the massacre took place.  I don't know what else you are asking for.
Q.	What was that time that the massacres took place?  Forget the date at the moment. 
A.	Actually, I don't think I was asked about a date.  I said that I wouldn't be able to know the time at which the killings took place because that happened a long time ago. 
Q.	And you've now forgotten the time, is that the position? 
A.	Actually, I don't know what your question is dealing with.  Is it the time, the date, the month or the year?  I haven't forgotten everything, but my problem is that I don't know what you want as an answer.
Q.	Well, I have asked you about the time repeatedly, and you said that you can no longer remember the time.  You can't remember whether it was morning or afternoon, is that the position? 
A.	I gave an approximate time between noon and 2 p.m.  You know, it's difficult to give notion of time because at that point in time, I didn't think I would be asked any questions about that, otherwise, I would have remembered.
Q.	Very well.  Now, in respect of the massacre at the school, is it your evidence that Kamuhanda turned up with militia and then went to the school and you heard the shooting? 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yours Honours, if Counsel is going to cite the witness's evidence in the Kamuhanda trial, then he should refer us to the transcript where this question was put to the witness, in fairness to the witness and her answer, but he can't just summarise it and put it to her.  We need a bit more context, Your Honours. 
MR. HOOPER:
I was hoping to do it rather more quickly, but if you want precision, I can provide it and I will.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Before I do so, can I remind you, Madam Witness, of what your statement says?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours?
MR. HOOPER:
And it is very difficult with these interruptions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Makwaia.
MS. MAKWAIA:
I am interrupting because of the manner he is proceeding, Your Honours.  I don't want to interrupt.  Is he going to glean out an omission or a contradiction to the witness, or is he just going to band the things around, Your Honours?  That is the trouble I have.  I am trying very hard not to interrupt, but sometimes it is difficult given the manner in which he is proceeding, Your Honours. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  I will try and be specific. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your statement, you say that after André Rwamakuba left Kigali, the Interahamwe militia and elements of the Presidential Guard arrived in the afternoon; is that right?  Is it after André Rwamakuba left that they arrived in the afternoon? 
A.	Let's state things clearly.  I am the one testifying in this case.  I have not changed anything in my position.  I came here to speak the truth and that is what I will do.  Maybe you should consult your notes, Counsel, but if someone were to consult your notes, someone would realise that there were mistakes therein.  So the person who took down my statement may have committed errors because it is human to err; even computers make mistakes.  

So if we agree that I am the one who is testifying in this case.  I have told you that Rwamakuba was not at that location on that day; that is what I have told you.  Rather, I said that it was Kamuhanda who came to launch the killings at that school and not Rwamakuba. 
Q.	So what day do you say André Rwamakuba was there in Gikomero doing what you have described in relation to the killings at the school?  Was it before the killings at the school or afterwards? 
A.	No.  I never implicated -- well, at least, Rwamakuba in the killings at the school.  Rather, I implicate him in the killings which took place at the Gikomero trading centre.  Three people were killed there.  And then there is Rwamakuba in the Kayanga events.  You see, we are talking about events which we witnessed. 
Q.	You haven't answered my question.  Was it before or after the killings at the school that you saw Rwamakuba killing, you say, the three people, before or after, simple question?
A.	I have told you that it was after the events at the school complex because I did not see him at the school complex. 
Q.	And how many days after the killings at the school complex did you see him? 
A.	I tried to give an estimate.  I think you have my statement.  I said that it had been a few days that those killings had taken place.  I said that it was between two and five days.  That was an estimate that I was giving. 
Q.	Can I come back then to your statement where you talk of the arrival of André Rwamakuba in your statement?  And you do say, I suggest, in the very clearest terms, you describe him coming and you say this happened on the 12th of April 1994, between 10 a.m. and noon.  Now, when you provided that date and time to the investigators, was it, as far as you know, the truth that you were telling the investigators? 
A.	I am here before the Chamber, I am testifying on events that I witnessed.  I did not transcribe the content of statement.  You know, I am someone who is speaking about facts.  There are other persons who wrote down what I told them, but they are human beings.  I gave them dates which I remember and I can repeat the same.  You can accept them as I say or you can reject them. 
Q.	And when the investigator came back to you, did the investigator not read the statement to you as you have told us he did?  Did you not make such corrections as you thought necessary, because you signed statement, didn't you, it was true?  Didn't you notice -- are you saying that when you say that André Rwamakuba came on the 12th of April between 10 a.m. and 12 noon, that that is something that the investigators got wrong?  Is that what you are now saying? 
A.	I don't know.  Someone -- I am not someone who is stupid.  I am not educated, obviously, but I cannot make confusion between Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba.  At this moment, I am saying that we are here face to face.  I cannot at any point in time confuse Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba and thereby confuse the dates on which I saw them.  When Kamuhanda came to Gikomero,  do you agree with me, Counsel, that you can consult the statement which I gave on Kamuhanda?  I don't know whether we agree on that.  So if it is to the contrary, then you will accept what you want. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it is now 1300H.  I think this would be a good moment for us to take our lunch break, and we shall proceed at 1430. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The session stands adjourned. 
	(Court recessed at 1300H)
(Pages 32 to 48 by Sithembiso Moyo)























	(Court resumed at 1435H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Good afternoon to all.  

Mr. Robinson, you have something to say?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President.  Very briefly, I would like to make a motion that the Prosecutor be sanctioned pursuant to Rule 66(A)(2) for failing in its duty to produce all of the statements of this witness.  And I'm referring in particular to testimony of 17 April 2001.  I raise this because Ms. Makwaia took the position that because the proceedings had terminated by the death of Judge Kama that somehow the Prosecutor was relieved of its obligation to provide the prior testimony of this witness given on that day.  I think that position is very untenable.  If a witness gives a statement or gives testimony in any proceeding, the ultimate outcome of those proceedings are totally irrelevant to the duty of the Prosecutor to disclose a prior statement of a witness.  And so I believe that the Prosecutor has failed in its duty to provide that statement, and some sanction should be imposed -- or at least it should be made clear so that this problem doesn't arise in the future -- that the Prosecution has an obligation in such an instance to disclose prior testimony, regardless of the ultimate outcome of those proceedings in which the testimony was given.  

And so I also simply wish to point out that Rule 66(A)(2) is a Rule which provides for disclosure of items in possession of the Prosecutor in general, not the individual person who happens to be handling that witness.  And clearly, since the Prosecutor was a party to the Kamuhanda case in April of 2001, they were in possession of that transcript now for three years -- more than three years and had a duty to produce it.  And there is no excuse under the law that Ms. Makwaia herself, personally, didn't have the transcript in her possession.  

So with that, I ask for a formal sanction and make a ruling on it after hearing from the Prosecutor.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours. 

The Prosecutor undertakes her obligations to disclose statements or any other documentations that are relevant to a witness's evidence to all Defence counsel.  In this instance, Your Honour, we disclosed to the Defence all the transcripts, all the prior transcripts of this witness's testimony that were in our possession.  Further to that, Your Honour, the order that you gave -- the order that was given in granting Counsel Hooper's request to unseal testimony by Trial Chamber II was specific to trial transcripts. 

Given the fact that the transcripts of 17 April 2001 do not fall within trial transcripts, per se, we couldn't disclose them.  As I speak, we are trying to locate and secure these transcripts, Your Honour.  I don't see any prejudice that can be suffered by counsel.  This witness was recalled as a Prosecution witness when the trial started de novo, and these matters were put to her.  

Therefore, by that very disclosure, Your Honours, Defence is on notice of the kind of evidence they should be expecting from this witness.  I don't believe the remedies of sanction to the Prosecutor, Your Honour, who has tried on a consistent basis to meet disclosure obligations in respect of all her witnesses.  That's my submission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, very briefly, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President.  Thank you.  This morning Counsel Makwaia specified to me, and for the record, that some phrases in the discussion were, indeed, on the transcripts of 4 September.  I don't think that is the issue at hand.  When that was at hand when I showed surprise that she said she wasn't aware of the 17th of April transcripts.  I had never mentioned those before September.  The transcripts will be faithful.  We have the transcripts from this morning.  When my colleague, 
Mr. Hooper, brought up the transcript of 17 April, it seems to me that Madam Makwaia said there's no such thing found in that transcript.  That made me say that if she knew what was not in the transcript, that meant that she read the transcript. 

I come back to the first question brought up by my colleague Mr. Robinson.  It is inconceivable for the Office of the Prosecutor, which is indivisible, to not be aware of transcripts that exist, that the Chamber, it seems, implicitly ordered that they be disclosed.  And it is regrettable that I still don't have those documents.  I must say that Counsel Makwaia has told us that the transcripts of September are sufficient.  

I'm waiting impatiently, extremely impatiently, to see what is contained in that transcript of 17 April, and it is so disturbing for the Prosecutor that they intend to hide those transcripts from us.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, may I?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel Makwaia.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, we take strong objection to counsel's choice of words.  The Prosecution is not hiding anything.  I am not hiding the transcript of 17 April 2001, Your Honours.  I haven't read them.  I've already stated before this Court I'm not in possession of them.  And if I was, counsel would have them disclosed to him. 

Now in respect of the issue of the 17th April 2001 transcripts, the 4th of September 2001, that was brought out by Counsel Weyl and Hooper in requesting how did I come to the conclusion of the summary that I gave the Chamber in respect to the answer to the witness that was posed.  That's why I referred Your Honours to the transcripts of 4 September 2001 where I read that information and not from the transcript of 17th of April '01, which counsel are relying upon.  This witness was recalled, many of the questions were repeated, and that's where I got my answer Your Honours.  If we are in possession of that transcript, Your Honours, that will be disclosed to Defence counsel.  The Prosecution has got nothing to hide.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, if I could make a very brief reply.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  I think, Madam President, this is just simply a question of law that should be decided.  As Ms. Makwaia said this is not a trial transcript, and I just point out that Rule 66(A)(2) has been held by the Appeals Chamber to include prior testimony of a witness.  And so calling it not a trial transcript, which I don't understand since it was testimony given during the course of a trial, is no answer to the failure of the Prosecution to disclose this under 66(A)(2).  It is not sufficient that we now receive it.  This is material due 60 days before the trial started.  So there has to be a sanction so that this Rule of law is made clear; it doesn't happen again, and so that for some remedy for the breach of the Prosecutor's obligation to disclose.  Thank you.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Chamber shall make a ruling in due time on this issue.  Right now we shall proceed with the cross-examination of this witness, and we recognise Mr. Hooper for that purpose.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Madam President.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I want to come back to that statement that I was dealing with before the luncheon adjournment and to what you say there.  Now, first of all, do I understand you correctly to be saying now that the first time you saw André Rwamakuba commit these acts was several days after the killings at the school.  That is your position today, is it not?
A.	You misunderstood me, Counsel.  I gave an estimate, and I said it was only a few days, not several days.
Q.	Perhaps no matter.  Looking at your statement, I suggest that you state in there, quite clearly, that you saw André Rwamakuba at the centre in Gikomero between ten and twelve on the 12th of April.  Now, do you accept that that appears in your statement?
A.	We spoke about this before the break.  I told you that I could not confirm the dates that you've just advanced.  I don't know why you dwell on that issue.  Do you want to know what Rwamakuba did or don't you.
Q.	I'm asking you about your statement.  Do you accept that in your statement you state that 
André Rwamakuba came between ten and twelve noon on the 12th of April 1994.  Do you accept that is what your statement says?
A.	Let me repeat it to you.  We spoke about this at great length.  You dwell on the date.  I told you that I was not sure of the date.  I don't know why you keep dwelling on that date.  I've already told you that I'm not sure of it.  All that I do know is that he did show up.
Q.	Let's leave aside --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, your microphone.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let's leave aside the accuracy of the date.  I'll come to the 12th and the accuracy of the 12th in a moment.  I'm asking you a simple question.  Do you accept, Madam Witness, that in your statement you stated that he was there between ten and twelve on the 12th of April?  Do you accept that or do you not accept it?
A.	I do not accept it.  I never said that it was on the 12th, to be sure.  Please don't dwell on that date, Counsel.  I'm telling you the truth, and before this Chamber, please listen to what I'm saying before the Chamber.
Q.	Let me put it like this, I'm going to read one sentence to you, from your statement.  "This happened on the 12th of April '94 between 10 a.m. and twelve noon."  That's the sentence.  It appears in your statement.  Can you help us as to how it came to get there?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One moment, please.  One moment please.  One moment, Witness. 

Mr. Hooper, you need to be more specific.  If you are simply saying the 12th of April between ten and 12 noon, the witness may not know what you're talking about.  It would be a good idea for you to 
re-read the sentence that begins, "I know Dr. Andre Rwamakuba."
MR. HOOPER:
With great pleasure.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'm going to read the extract so that you have it all in context, and you can understand my concern. 

Here's how your statement reads: "I know Dr. André Rwamakuba because I saw him driving his car many times.  I do not know the make nor the colour of the car.  The last time I saw him I was able to see him closely.  He arrived in Gikomero secteur, the commune office of which was in a small centre which bore the same name, Gikomero; it served as a refuge to threatened people, be they Hutu or Tutsi.  This happened on the 12th of April 1994 between 10 a.m. and 12 noon."  I'm read on one sentence, two sentences more:  "********** was about a hundred metres away from that office.  I was shocked by what he did to the two people, he seized their certificates and tore them up." 

Now, Madam Witness, do you appreciate, my having read that passage, that narrative of what André Rwamakuba did and when, according to your statement?  Now, do you remember saying that to the investigators who took this statement; yes or no?
A.	You're making my life difficult, Counsel.  I don't know why you are asking me to say yes or no.  I wanted to give you more information on that issue.
Q.	Please do. 
A.	Very well.  I want to say the following.  The document you have before you was drafted by human beings.  You would agree with me.  People can make mistakes.  It's human error.  He has mixed up the Kamuhanda statements and those made about Rwamakuba.  I came before this Chamber to explain things that are not clear; so allow me to give you explanations.  There is human error.  Those who drafted the statement made a mistake, and they did not correct the mistakes, and I'm here to clear that up.  Please accept what I'm telling you.  I'm a witness who's come before this Chamber to shed light on issues that are not so clear.  I don't know whether you would agree with me, Counsel, on this.
Q.	Perhaps I don't, but that's not the point.  What I'm asking you is, why didn't you correct that when it was read back to you by the investigators and before you carefully signed it after you told us of making some corrections?
A.	There are two things that I can say and change what I said before.  When they came to see me I was at work.  I had no time.  I told you that they gave me a summary of what I had said.  Second point, they gave me a second chance, that of coming before this Chamber to better explain things that were not clear.  I don't know if we understand each other or whether you would agree with me.  I've  come before this Chamber for that very fact.
Q.	Now, you say they merely gave you a summary.  Is it not the fact that they read that statement back to you?
A.	I acknowledge that they read the statement for me.  They read it to me.  They gave me the statement.  They read it very quickly.  I was at work.  I did not have enough time for everything to be systematically read back to me.
Q.	You are a careful person, are you not?  We saw you correct an "E" from an "A" in the document before the beginning of this trial.
A.	I think that we've dealt with this at great length.
Q.	I think not quite enough.
A.	If I had corrected everything, I would not have had to come before this Chamber in that case.
Q.	But this is a central part of your statement and of your narrative. 

Can I ask you this question?  Do you remember later meeting someone from the Office of the Prosecutor here?  And I'm looking -- this wouldn't help you, Witness, but for the Judges and Prosecution, I'm looking at a document dated 27th of April this year, which is headed "Prosecutor Final Witness List," filing 27th of April.  And I'm looking at item 44, Witness GIN, which states --
MS. MAKWAIA:
I object to this mode of proceeding.  This was a summary that was filed with the Court in respect of Rule 73 bis, and it has nothing to do with this witness.  It's a summary generated by the Office of the Prosecutor to facilitate the process.  It is not her statement.  In fact, she has no knowledge of it, Your Honour.  I would object to any questions being put to her.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I refer to it for few reasons, first of all, it's plain, and we can see it from the supporting materials, in other words, the indictment, the Prosecution against André Rwamakuba has always been, until very recently, that he was there on the 12th that was plainly based on this witness's testimony.  But the point that I'm very interested in, in item 44, is the second paragraph at item 44 on that page, which refers to a confirmation of this witness's statement.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MS. MAKWAIA:
This new fact that Counsel Hooper has been questioning the witness about for ten minutes, I'm sorry Your Honour, is clearly indicated in under Rule 67(D) service that I undertook upon in serving other counsel is paragraph no. 6, Your Honour.  If he wants to go into other documents generated by the Office of the Prosecutor, I've already objected to this, Your Honour.  It is not the witness's statement, Your Honour.  She can be questioned about her own statement and oral testimony before you.  Counsel should not be allowed to bring other documents into play.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam President --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm --

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very, very briefly.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm not challenging the authenticity of the document.  I merely seek to put to this witness circumstances of the confirmation process, which is confirmed by that document at item 44.  In fact, it's the only notice I've had of any confirmation process at all, and it's dated -- the confirmation process is dated -- 27th of May 2003.  So it is quite significant.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, this is a document from the Prosecutor's office.  The witness does not know that document.  It is for that reason there is an objection.  Try to question the witness differently, but don't use a document of which the witness is completely unaware.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well, Madam President.  I understand.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, did you undergo a confirmation exercise about your evidence with someone from the Office of the Prosecutor on the 23rd of May of last year?
A.	I do not remember the date on which I met them, but I do remember that it was in the year 2004, 2004.  That was the first time I saw the Prosecutor, by the way.
Q.	Well, when you say "the first time that you saw the Prosecutor" -- pardon me -- when you say "the first time you saw the Prosecutor," do you mean the Prosecutor in this Court?
A.	Yes, I am, indeed, referring to the Prosecutors here in this Court, not the one in Rwanda.
Q.	You see, I have a document that asserts that you were seen by someone from the Prosecution on the 23rd of May of last year.  I doubt the Prosecution would seek to contest that, so I'm asking you, do you have a recollection of that happening?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please, Mr. Hooper, which Prosecutor are you referring to?  The witness spoke about this Prosecutor here in this Court.  Are you referring to the same person, yourself?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Madam President, I don't have any details provided me as to what this confirmation exercise concerns but I do know that confirmation exercises take place, as you know, between the witness and officers, legal or otherwise, from the Office of the Prosecutor.  This is a Prosecution document I have in my hands that asserts that such a meeting took place.  I'm exploring it with the witness.  It may assist us all if the Prosecution could confirm that that confirmation took place, as, indeed, they assert in their document.  It is not the document I want to put to the witness, it's to know what went on and what her opportunity was on that occasion to correct.  It plainly was, in my submission, a correcting opportunity and, therefore, significant.

JUDGE LATTANZI:
Mr. Hooper, please try and be clearer in your question.  You should also know that the witness does not know everything that you know about the organisation or about the Office of the Prosecutor.  For the witness, the Prosecutor in this trial is the person, the lady who is leading her in chief.  So you see, her answers will be in conformity with that opinion she holds, and which is a correct opinion.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, let me rephrase the question.
MS. MAKWAIA:
May I have a brief opportunity to speak to counsel's submission that he was not served with any confirmation?  As a matter of fact, Your Honours, confirmation reports are covered by Rule 70 of the Rules of Evidence and Procedure and are, therefore, not disclosable to Defence.  This, I would submit, Your Honours, is part of the preparation of the case.  When I interviewed this witness, Your Honour, and I came across significant additional new information I promptly served it on counsel, under Rule 67(D).  To now question this witness about other processes that she's not aware of, Your Honours, is improper.
MR. HOOPER:
Let me put my question in a different way, as Madam Judge suggested.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is it right, Madam Witness, that you met with someone from the Office of the Prosecutor -- I don't mean any of the lawyers in the courtroom today but somebody from the Prosecutor for the United Nations?  Did someone come and see you last year?  You would have been in prison at that time.  Do you remember someone coming to see you and asking you about your statement or is that something that you've forgotten about?
A.	You're saying that as if you were present, but please allow me to tell you the truth.  They did, indeed, come to see me.  And it was difficult for them to see me.  I was told that I needed to come and testify before this Tribunal here, but what I changed is that I told them that everything which had changed in my status is that I changed religion.  As for the statement, we didn't refer to that at all.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well, while I'm on it, can I put the Prosecution on notice that I request any correction to what the witness has said, that the Defence be informed, given the content of item 44 of the document which I've just looked at.  And I'll move on.
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, before leaving this issue, I also would like to request disclosure of the confirmation statements under Rule 68.  And Rule 68 provides that if there is evidence which contradicts the Prosecution's evidence or questions the credibility of that evidence, then it must be disclosed.  And it's our position that Rule 68 and that obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence, plus the provisions of Rule 70 which allows the Prosecutor to withhold internal documentation, because it simply cannot be the law that Prosecution can withhold exculpatory evidence simply because it is contained in an internal document.  So I'm asking the Trial Chamber to order the prosecutors to disclose the confirmation statements under Rule 68.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if my proposal seconds that, but it supports my earlier contentions.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You have done that.  Very well.  

Now, Ms. Makwaia, do you wish to respond?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, Madam President.  If there is any material pertaining to this witness or any other that we are aware of that falls within Rule 68, Your Honours, the Prosecution will disclose that material.  Confirmation reports form part and parcel of documentation that is covered by Rule 70, Your Honours.  I can't just disclose that to Defence counsel because Mr. Robinson or Mr. Hooper believe there is exculpatory material in it.  If there is any exculpatory material, the onus is upon the Prosecution to make such disclosure.  I do not think we require an order from the Trial Chamber to do so.
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps I can go on, just briefly reminding that the witness's evidence was the only matter that was touched on was a change of religion.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Setting aside any subsequent opportunities you've had since making your statement, including the five days spent in this Court and the various weeks spent in a safe house here, during your previous testimony, I'd like to ask you this following question.  You say that André Rwamakuba came to Gikomero after the killings started, after the terrible massacre at the school; that's correct, isn't it?
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	No doubt in your mind about that, at all?
A.	Unless you want to cast doubt in my mind, but I know that's how it happened.
Q.	So, can I ask you this about your statement and perhaps, again, with Madam President's leave, and I hope without objection from the Prosecution, I'll read the passage, four sentences, five sentences, relating, starting, Madam President, "At that time the killings had not started in our commune."  Madam Witness, I think the parties with the statements have found that and, of course, it's in the context of André Rwamakuba coming to Gikomero, quite plainly, I suggest.  And what it reads is this.  "At that time the killings had not started in our commune.  I'm sure that it was in an attempt to give a green light that Rwamakuba came.  I followed all that was said and done.  I was in front of my door, which was about 15 metres from the crowd made up initially of about 100 people, but which later swelled when the people realised that the massacres were about to start.  This was how I was able to hear what was being said and see the things I have described.  Rwamakuba came to sensitise the people, so that they could start the massacres.  After assembling some people upon arrival he asked them, 'Why have they not started killing?'  in fact, he said, 'There are police and military reservists who can help you.  Do you need anything else?  What is stopping you from starting the killing?'" and a little later on, after you refer to the motorbike incident, and Brigadier Niyaya, and the motorbike being the trees by brigadier Niyaya this sentences appears:  "After these incidents," and I pause, the incidents of the young man on the motorbike, you say, "After these incidents, Rwamakuba told the people they had just started the killings and that it was a good start."  You see, Madam Witness, that is completely the opposite of what you're saying in your evidence today, isn't it?
A.	And my opinion is that what I've said is not contradictory.  Do you want to talk about the launching of the killings at the primary school?  When he arrived, he didn't know that there had been killings at the school.  And I didn't tell you that I saw him doing the killings at the school.  What I want you to understand is that when he arrived the killings immediately started at the small centre where the young men were killed.
Q.	When were the first killings you saw at the small centre, in relation to the killings at the school?  Can you tell me that, please?  The same day, the next day, a few days later?  Can you please tell me?
A.	The killings which took place at the Gikomero centre, at the place known as Umkupangu (phonetic), as I have said, in response to your questions, after the killings took place at the primary school the killings at the centre happened a few days later, and I said between two to five days.  I don't know whether you want me to tell you something else, because I see that you want to make me go backwards.
Q.	I'm merely seeking to get a defined account from you, Madam Witness, as to what happened.  

And so let us just take stock for a moment.  There's killings at the Gikomero school, extensive killing, some days later André Rwamakuba comes, and there's the people who were killed in the centre.  And you're saying, now, he came to give the green light to that.  Is that your position?
MS. MAKWAIA:
I stand corrected, Your Honours, but that's what counsel put to the witness, that last piece of information.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me rephrase it.  Your position is that there were killings at the Gikomero school, extensive killings.  A few days later André Rwamakuba came and there were then the killings that you've told us in the centre.  And those were the first killings in the centre; is that correct?
A.	You're telling me that there were killings at the primary school.  I would like to agree, but those killings were not ordered by Rwamakuba.  Rwamakuba came subsequently, and he ordered the killing of the people who were at the Gikomero centre.  I really don't know why you want me to speak to you about the events at the primary school.  Why do you want me to do that, whereas they do not concern Rwamakuba?
Q.	Well, there would be a very good reason for that, as I believe we are beginning to see already.  I'm going to put part of your testimony of the 17th of April 2001 to you which appears at page 145.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have that document, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
I have copies, ten copies.  Now, they are still, only, I'm afraid, in English, but the point is it is not an extensive passage.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please proceed, Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In context, I should say that you had earlier in this transcript, a copy of which I can provide, stated that though you were aware of the killings at the school, you had heard shots, whatever, you didn't directly witness those killings.  And then you say this at page 145:  "I was witness to the killings that occurred in the centre where I lived, killings that occurred at the commercial centre -- centre close to where I lived."  

Judge Sekule, who is asking you about this, "That was on the next day?"
	"Yes.
	"How did she witness them?  Can she explain?" the Judge asks.  And you say, "The commercial centre I'm referring to can be seen ******************* through the windowpanes."
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We do not have what you are reading.  All you gave us was one sheet, one page.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, there has been -- it's my error.  I must have marked it up wrongly, but can I just add that it's a very short bit that I'm referring to, and I'm not going further in respect of this matter.  She says that, "The commercial centre I'm referring to can be seen ******************* through the windowpanes, the window about 10 to 15 metres away, and we could see the Interahamwe killing people." 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, do you remember saying that, Madam Witness?
A.	Many people were killed at the commercial centre.  It wasn't only a matter of three people.  I saw those killings, and I was ********************************************************* able to see what had happened.  And the killings took place over several successive days.
Q.	And how many people do you say were killed in the centre over those two or three successive days?
A.	Maybe you can give me some time, so that I can think about it and be able to estimate the number of victims, even though I didn't have the time to do a body count.  That wasn't of interest to me.  All I did was to see the bodies.
Q.	In your transcript in April you said 30 to 50 people.  Would you accept that now?
A.	Did I advance any definite figure?  This is why I'm saying you should let me have some moment, so that I could make an estimate of the number of victims.
Q.	Perhaps we can say on the 12th of September --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone to counsel, please.
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  On the 5th of September -- 4th of September, you gave evidence relating to this aspect and if we look at page --
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, if I may intervene at this stage, is there a contradiction in all of this?
MR. HOOPER:
There certainly is.
MS. MAKWAIA:
What?
MR. HOOPER:
I thought it was self-evident from the witness's testimony today.  But this witness has said that she saw three killed.  I'm asking her -- well, I'm not going to go through it.  I say it's self-evident.
MS. MAKWAIA:
No, Your Honours, counsel is reading from transcripts of the witness's testimony in April, on the 17th of April 2001, and the 4th of September 2001, and he's not reading -- I've got the transcript of the 4th of September 2001 and he's not reading the question that was actually put to the witness and the answer that was generated by this witness, where she gave an account of killings taking place on subsequent days and advance this figure of 40 to 50.  If Mr. Hooper wants to impeach this witness on her prior testimony, Your Honours, he should do it properly and he knows this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, really, we have been quite disturbed because it's not coherent enough.  We cannot take one sentence from here and another from there, especially since we don't have the documents here with us.  This is absolutely necessary and paramount that you put questions to the witness which are understandable, and by everybody, by presenting statements in a manner which is in conformity; in other words, that you should take everything into account.  But we do not want to be dispersed here and there, because the documents are not in possession of the Judges currently.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, as the Court will know, despite Defence efforts, we came into possession of these documents relatively recently and we haven't been able to photocopy them extensively as we would like to do, because probably this Court would be best assisted for having full transcripts and being able to range about and see the context.  I can, in due, course provide these transcripts and put them in and, indeed, perhaps it would be best to do it like that.  At present I'm responding to comments that the witness is making from the witness box.  So my questions have been based on a reply I got this afternoon.  So I haven't been able to prepare, in that sense, by getting necessary comments that goes to the particular issue.  But I can do it, I hope, quite succinctly with the witness, as I had intended to do, and the transcripts themselves speak for themselves.  I think that must be pretty evident.  So let me put my question in this way to the witness.  I see Prosecutor is on her feet.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Madam President, I am extremely sorry about the interruption.  Counsel has already made a citation in passing to the transcripts of the 4th of September 2001, for example.  I'll read for the record, Your Honour, the question that was put to the witness, with your permission.
MR. HOOPER:
What page is that, please?
MS. MAKWAIA:
That would be page 12 of the 4th September 2001.
MR. HOOPER:
I was going from nine onwards, actually, if you want to start from 12, please.
	(Pages 49 to 61 by R. Lear)






















1530H
MS. MAKWAIA:
But if you're going to put questions, you have to get them in their context; you do agree.  Now, the question that was put to the witness -- one of the questions, Your Honours -- was, "The people that you saw being killed at the trade centre, how many people do you think, approximately, did you see killed on those days?"  And the witness gives her answer, "Well, on that day, when they came to begin the killings at the school, I would say that between 30 or 50 people were killed at the trade centre, and among the people killed there were those that had been arrested on their way and that were wounded and had just been finished up."  

Then at page 10, Your Honours, there was another question put in relation to the killings.  "And how many days after the shooting at the school did you see that occur?"  And she gives her answer, "On that day when they came back from the killings, they killed the survivors at the very place, and even the next day and the following day," so there is a whole context, Your Honours --
MR. HOOPER:
Can you finish that sentence, please?
MS. MAKWAIA:  
You can do that at your time.  I'm going to now bring out the context that you've been missing out.
MR. HOOPER:
No, please, in fairness, finish that sentence. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
So, Your Honours, as I was submitting, there's a whole context that Counsel Hooper has not been putting to the witness, which is totally unfair because then this witness cannot respond accordingly.  Now, if Mr. Hooper wants to proceed with what I've been reading, he's very welcome to go on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I think I can deal with it quite succinctly because these are not difficult points for you, Madam Witness.  I will complete the sentence because it is the sense of what you are saying throughout this testimony on this subject, and we are talking about the day of the Gikomero protestant school killings.  You say, "On that day, when they came back from the killings, they killed the survivors at that very place, and even the next day and the following day, they continued to execute people at the trade centre where we lived."  "The trade centre where we lived." 

Now, Madam Witness, this is my question:  Where in that context does André Rwamakuba fit in to come to give the green light for the start of the massacres?
A.	I would like to answer you thus:  If a question was put to me as to whether, after the massacres which took place at the school, there were no other killings, I answered that the survivors from the school were finished off, and the killings at the centre continued in the subsequent days.  But the question was not put to me as to who -- it was who gave the green light for the killings which took place at the trading centre.  The question to which I responded was dealing with Kamuhanda.
Q.	Let me go back to your statement, then, and ask you, as the Prosecution asked me to, to do it 
line-by-line so that you have an opportunity to respond.  This is after you've talked about the arrival of André Rwamakuba, and the killing of the two young men, and it starts, "At that time, the killings had not started in our commune." 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Counsel, you have already read that passage.
MR. HOOPER: 
I read it at your request at length.  I'm now going through it line-by-line.  It's very significant, 
Madam President.  I'm sure you see the point, but the witness doesn't seem to be brought to it.  I have to bring this witness to this point, and the question is this.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, it's necessary.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
But we remind you, you have already read this passage twice, and you now want to read it 
line-by-line.  We will be here until tomorrow with this exercise if we continue that way.  I think it would be better, Mr. Hooper, if there are contradictions, to point them out, what she has here with what she said at that time.  And you say here, "Here is the contradiction; this is what you said on that day; now this is what you are saying."  So point them out simply, Mr. Hooper.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	"At that time, the killings had not started in our commune."  Now you are saying thousands had been slaughtered at the school, a stone's throw from *********; 30 or 50 had been massacred in the marketplace in front of your kitchen window or windows.  How does that fit in with your testimony now?
A.	I see no difference whatsoever, unless you are trying to create a difference.  I said that the massacres began at the primary school.  Those were the first massacres that I witnessed.  I was asked other questions about the massacres that took place at the commercial centre in Gikomero.  According to you, where is the difference here?  Where is the contradiction?
Q.	Or is it that you are just brazenly facing this out, brazenly facing out your contradictions? 

Let me ask you about another contradiction, because I haven't understood what you say on this.  "I'm sure that it was in an attempt to give a green light," which I understand, incidentally, means "go", "that Rwamakuba came."  Is that right, after all those killings?
A.	I shall respond to you by putting a question to you.  Can we do that, Counsel? 
Q.	Strictly not, no.  Just answer questions, please. 
A.	I concede that.  If Rwamakuba showed up in Gikomero, he didn't know that Kamuhanda had come through.  That's at least what I think.  If he came, and he gave the order, the order to kill, he didn't know that someone else had come through.  He showed up so that his opponents be killed.  He was aware that the Tutsis were targeted.  That is why you have that answer.  Did he have photographs showing that Kamuhanda had come through, or were there photographs of people killed?  That's what I wanted to say to you, Counsel.
Q.	The protestant school is about, what, 300 metres from **********?  Or would you say further or less?  How far is it where these 4,000 people or so were killed, as you say in your statement?
A.	Before I respond, I will ask you to excuse me.  I didn't measure the distance.  If I was given the opportunity, I would have done so, but to make things easier, I will tell you that it's just behind **********.  If you want me to give you an estimate, it would be two to 300 metres, but, please, don't use that as an exact distance.  I didn't measure.  I didn't measure that distance.
Q.	And now your account is, "Well, and André Rwamakuba came, but he would not have known of these killings, so he still thought he could or should give a green light and start the massacres."  That's what you're saying now, is it?
A.	Do you want me to repeat what I have already said?  Otherwise I think that you clearly understood me.
Q.	I seem to have understood you.  I hope I understood you.  I don't want to be accused of not understanding you.  Tell me this, I can see from your statement, and indeed we have heard from your evidence, that when you saw Rwamakuba first, he was with the bourgmestre of the commune, Rutaganira; Brigadier Nyarwaya; the commune's accountant, Rabanguka, who was a member of the Interahamwe, I think, is that right, and other Interahamwe?  Do you think that Rabanguka could have arrived there and not known that thousands had been killed around the corner, a stone's throw away?  Are you seriously suggesting that?
A.	Why do you want to confirm that he was aware of that fact?  Perhaps he was informed after giving the orders.  Perhaps you know that.  Ask him that question.  You see him.  I cannot see Rwamakuba to ask him that question.  I have no idea.  I can only tell you what I thought, and I'm saying that, in relation to what he said, what someone says can lead you to think about what that person is thinking.
Q.	But your statement doesn't say anything like that, does it?  It talks about starting the massacres, congratulating people and, after killing those three people, told the people that just started the killings that it was a good start, and everybody listening to him let him live on in his ignorance, is that right, not telling him, "There's thousands of bodies just around the corner all down to us"?  Is that your position?
A.	No, that's not what I wanted to say.  If you wish, you can ask me, and I will give you clarification.
Q.	I suggest you have radically changed your story, haven't you, between giving your statement and giving your evidence?  You have radically changed it; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, I changed nothing.  You are the one who wants to say that it's changed.  You have interests.  I made a statement, a written statement, and if you think that that statement is mine, well, you look at it.  I didn't change anything.  If you think it belongs to someone else, you have a right to think so.
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba was a minister in the new government?
A.	When he came to Gikomero, he wasn't.  At least, that's what I think.
Q.	Would it surprise you to know he was sworn in on the 9th April as the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education?  Does that surprise you to learn that?
A.	What would surprise me, according to you, Counsel? 
Q.	Does it surprise you that he was already a minister when he turned up in his yellow shirt?
A.	Do you think that ministers have particular dress, shirts that are their own?
Q.	Let's just look at your evidence in your statement about that, shall we?  I turn back to that, and this --
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I wanted to remind Defence counsel the following.  I'm very ill at ease with him.  He's telling me that the minister who wore a yellow shirt was already a minister.  I don't know why he wants to beat around that.  He's asking me questions, and I would ask you to ask him to put questions to me that are comprehensible.  I'm here to answer the questions.  That's why I came here.  Otherwise we are just going to keep wasting time.  He has interests to conduct himself that way.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me ask you this direct question.  How often does a minister of the government visit Gikomero secteur, in your experience of living there?
A.	That is a very sensitive question, but I'll answer it if you want me to.  I was an ordinary citizen.  I was of no importance, and so planned visits of ministers were not given to me.  I had no way of knowing.
Q.	I understand that.  Let me put it like this:  For a serving minister of the government to come to that little place, that little backwater, was very rare, wasn't it?
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Please, Counsel, please put questions that are of interest to us.  You are putting questions that have nothing to do with these proceedings and waste our time.  Just put direct questions: "What would André Rwamakuba go to do over there?  He was a minister."  That is where you want to get to.  Please move on.  

We are losing too much time in this cross-examination.  Please be more direct.  The witness is here to answer your questions.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Let me put it like this then.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did nobody there tell you that André Rwamakuba was a minister, neither your husband, his friends or anyone else?  Did no one there say, "It's the minister"?
A.	I had no interest in knowing that.  We were at war.
Q.	I suggest for a minister to come to that place would be something that you would learn, and learn very quickly.  I'm suggesting he never came, you see.
A.	Why are you saying that he did not come to that place?  I'm telling you he did come there.
Q.	Now, in your statement, you describe the man you saw, but before I come to that, let me ask you this: Your evidence is that before André Rwamakuba came on that day, you already knew him, you knew who he was and recognised who he was; is that correct or not?
A.	I don't know.  You're speaking of his make up, his personal life?  Please be more clear.  Please ask the question more clearly.
Q.	Did you know who André Rwamakuba was before he came that day?  Yes or no.
A.	I knew that André Rwamakuba was, first of all, a human being.  Second, when I saw him --
Q.	Please answer the question.  Did you know who he was before he came that day?  It's a simple question.  It hardly needs an interruption.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, can we get the rest of the response before counsel puts the question again?  She had answered.
MR. HOOPER:
We were into human beings.  I don't know how far we were going to go along, but, yes, certainly, let her answer, if she's going to give an answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What is your answer, Madam Witness?
A.	I will continue.  First I knew it was a human being, and I told you that I had already seen him on two occasions when he came to Gikomero, when he came to a wedding, and then when he came to visit a family later.  Do you want to ask me if I knew what his position was, that he was an authority?  What do you want to know?
Q.	I'd ask you that if I do --
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Please let the witness finish before you put another question to her, because we did not get the interpretation. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President's microphone was not on during the --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We did not have the end of the answer, nor did we have the beginning of your question.  Please let her finish her answer and then you can put the next question to her.  We are lost here, Counsel. 
THE WITNESS:
I was saying that before the war, I had seen Rwamakuba on two occasions, and I think you will remember what I said.  I saw him.  He was visiting a family of friends, and then I saw him at a wedding of a colleague.  For the rest, I don't know exactly what you want to know.  I don't know if you want to know what his position was.  It's not clear to me.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Did you know who he was if you saw him?
A.	If you read my statement, you will see that I said I was able to recognise him, but when you see someone a second time and there is someone next to you who can give you information about that person, you can recognise him, and I think that's what I did.  That's contained in my statement.  If the statement is unknown to you, I can speak of it.
Q.	We have carefully read that statement to you so that you know what is there, and you have put your finger on the problem, because in this statement you say, after you saw this man arrive, you say, "I asked my husband who that man was."  That's right, isn't it?
A.	Move on.  Continue so that we can hear the rest of the sentence.
Q.	"He told me he was Dr. André Rwamakuba.  I then told him that I had seen the man several times," and you had earlier said in the statement you had seen him driving his car many times.  You didn't need to ask your husband who the man was, did you, if you had been introduced to him on two occasions?
A.	Would you agree with me, the person who I spoke to was my husband?  I had a right to ask him more information on anything.  Would you agree with that, Counsel? 
Q.	And you agree also, that there is no mention of these two previous introductions by 
André Rwamakuba in your statement.  I think that's drawing the circle on that subject.  That's right, isn't it?  
MR HOOPER:
I see there's another interruption.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Yes, there is another interruption, Your Honours, because Counsel has seen in the witness's statement that she has said that she has seen the man several times.  She has already explained earlier, Your Honours, that she has given more details as to the several times.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So let me move on to another contradiction.  "The person my husband told me was Rwamakuba was wearing a pair of trousers" -- no contradiction in the trousers -- "and a shirt with the MRND party colours, that is green and yellow."  Why did you dress this man, Rwamakuba, who is a member of the MDR, in MRND colours in your statement?
A.	I didn't give him those clothes.  Perhaps he decided to dress himself that way, or his wife did, not me.
Q.	So are you agreeing he was wearing MRND party colours, green and yellow?
A.	Let me make things easier for you.  If we continue with the way you're asking questions, we will never end.  I described his dress on that occasion.  Do you agree with that, Counsel?  I'm giving a description.  I don't know.  According to you, did the members of the MRND wear yellow shirts?  Is that what you are saying, Counsel?  If that is the case, we can move on.
Q.	You have the point; you're not facing it.  I'm asking you again, why did you say he was in green and yellow, that is MRND party colours?
A.	I'm not avoiding your question.  I will answer you.  Now I understand.  To start, you said that I said Rwamakuba was wearing an MRND uniform and he was a member of the MDR.  In fact, when I answered the question that was put to me, when I was asked to describe how he was dressed, do you want to know what the answer was that I gave? 
Q.	What was your answer?
A.	I said that he was wearing black trousers and a yellow shirt.
Q.	You go on in your statement -- let me ask you this:  Do you know what the symbol of the MRND is?  Is it a hoe and a pruning knife?
A.	I don't know.  I wasn't a member of the party.  You are trying to describe what was on the cap of party members, but I wasn't a member of that party, and so I can't tell you if that was the emblem or not.  I think you're asking the questions that you already know the answers to.
Q.	In your statement, you see, you say he was wearing a cap of the same colours, that is MRND party green and yellow, with a hoe and a pruning knife called oronana.  You're clearly describing an MRND member, aren't you, in your statement?  Would you agree with that?
A.	If it's written or not, I'm here before the Chamber.  The Prosecutor is there.  Let the documents be shown and let's become aware of the corrections that I asked be made.  I'm telling the truth.  We even say that, yes, that is indeed a description of an MRND member.
Q.	And this is the statement you've signed after having it read to you, as you told us, and that you had a chance, I suggest, to alter in May of last year, and which you have only recently, in the last week or so, come to alter.  That's correct, isn't it?
A.	I asked that corrections be made to the statement, and I asked that of the Prosecutor.
Q.	And a final matter really on this description in your statement, you describe Rwamakuba as being stout, average height and fair in complexion, and can I just pause there, because the word "stout" appears in French as "forte corpulence".
JUDGE ARREY:
Just a minute, Counsel.  This description is not going to help the Trial Chamber, because we don't have the opportunity of comparing the description with the actual person.  We don't know who Rwamakuba is, so this one is not important to us.
MR. HOOPER:
It is important to you, but it may not be today.  It is important to you, though, and it's important to make a note.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In English it's described as "stout"; in French, it's "forte corpulence".  What word do you use in Kinyarwanda for that?  Can you give us the word, please?
A.	It would have been much easier for everyone had the client been here with us.  To begin with, you will have seen that I would have been able to identify him and recognise him.
Q.	Well, he's not here because he doesn't like the Prosecutor, but that's not a matter or (indecipherable) for us.  Can you please give us a word --
MR. WEBSTER:
I object to that last statement, and if we are going to talk about rumour and what your client likes and does not like, the rumour that I have heard is that he does like his co-defendants, and he does not want to be in a trial with the other three MRND persons.  That's the rumour that we hear in the Prosecutor's office, so if we are going to descend into your client's preferences and dislikes, let's have a complete record of it.
MR. HOOPER:
I can't dispute that there was an application for a quick, severed, expedited trial three years ago, I can't dispute that, and you responded very well in respect to it, so successfully, in fact, that we are here together this afternoon.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What is the word you'd use, madam?  Can you help us, because --
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Very well, I think we can move on to something else.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	What is the word for -- how would you describe Rwamakuba?  The words that are going from me to the booth into Kinyarwanda and to you is the word "stout" and the word "forte corpulence", and I'd be grateful if we could have a Kinyarwanda word which is your word.
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I'd rather hear it from the witness's mouth today as opposed to what is recorded in the statement, which could have been the choice of word by the investigator taking this statement.  Let's hear it from the witness, and not a suggestion from the Kinyarwanda interpreter after Counsel's words of what is recorded in the statement -- "forte corpulence" in French and "stout" in English, 
Your Honours.  She's here today; let's hear what her description of the Accused is.
MR. HOOPER:
We had the description last week.  He was described as neither big -- neither too big, nor too small; neither too light, nor too dark; not too tall; not too short, and I'm referring to a word here that has been used and whether she recognizes that word.  Think it's significant.  It may be, because there is a difference between "stout" and "forte corpulence", and it's our contention, that Rwamakuba, if he ever sees the light of day here, certainly doesn't fit that.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Counsel, since we do not speak Kinyarwanda, we will have to be satisfied with the interpretation.  She has already made a description here, so move on from there and try and make headway, because we don't have your client in the courtroom.  Maybe he could have lost weight in the interim period and nobody would know.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm going to ask you about another part of your evidence given on 17th April, and if we have it, it's page 122.  It's a very short passage. 
MR. HOOPER:
I can provide it later, or I can seek to provide it now if we have it, but it would be quicker if I just read out slowly the matter.  It's a matter of record, anyway.  It's page 122 of the transcript of 17th April 2001.  We do have some copies.  

As we have the previous page as well, in context, page 121, I'll pick it up there.  I won't read every sentence, but to put it in context. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You're asked about how do you know -- this is page 121 in the English at line 8.  Question: "How do you know Mr. Kamuhanda?" and you explain that, and how long you have known him, where you met him.  You were asked at page 122 if you recognise him in the courtroom, and you say where he is in the courtroom, and then there is this series of questions and answers which interests me.  Question: "Do you know a man called Dr. Rwamakuba?"  Answer: "Yes."  Question: "How do you know 
Dr. Rwamakuba?"  Answer: "The first time that I saw him, it was in front of our house."  Question: "And when was that?"  "This was in 1994."  Question: "In what month?"  Answer: "The month of April."  

Do you remember being asked those questions and making those replies?
A.	I remember about that.  Rather, ask me why I answered in that way.  We were in the Kamuhanda case and we were speaking about the period of war, but we did not speak about the time that I saw him before the war, during peacetime.  The context was the war period.
Q.	You'd been asked no other questions; there was no context.  That was right at the beginning of your testimony, and the pages that have been provided illustrate that, so the first time you are asked about when you had seen André Rwamakuba, you say it was in April '94 in front of **********, but we have heard your answer.

Now, we have spoken quite a lot from time to time of the day --
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, going back to that question, and in fairness to the witness, at page 120 where 
Mr. Fleming puts the question to the witness, "Witness, in 1994, at the beginning of April, where did you live?" and it would follow the subsequent questions would have been restricted to this particular period, as correctly answered by the witness, Your Honours.  I'm just directing your attention to this passage as well so that when you read these matters, you don't read them out of context.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I want to come back to what, for me, is a significant matter, and it's the date of the Gikomero parish massacre and what date you say it is.  Now, you have told us that you don't know the date, and you place it somewhere between the -- was it the 6th and the 20th that we ended up?  I have to remind myself of your evidence, but I'll stand corrected if I'm wrong.  It was between the 6th and the 20th, is that right, or is it a shorter period?  When do you say, the best you can do at the moment, as to when the Gikomero parish massacre took place?  When do you say that was?
A.	Did I ever say any date in this regard?  I think that if you need a date regarding these events, you should ask me about it, but I have not, as far as I know, given any date.
Q.	Well, we know from your evidence that the Gikomero massacre really started the killings; that is your account now, so when did the killings start?  What date was that?
A.	At least in my area, I can speak of events that took place in my area, but as for other secteurs and the whole commune, I cannot confirm anything.  Maybe other events concerning the primary school -- I believe those killings took place between the 10th and the 14th.  It was during that period of time that Kamuhanda came to give the green light for the killings perpetrated at the school complex.  I don't know whether that answer is satisfactory to you, Counsel.
Q.	So now it's Kamuhanda who is giving green lights, is it?
A.	I'm referring to the killings which took place at the school complex, and I have repeated this on many occasions.
Q.	Right, and do you think that that took place -- the killings at the school complex was between the 10th and the 14th; correct?
JUDGE ARREY:
I'm sorry, Counsel, I think you had already posed this question to the witness, and she said, "I cannot remember the date of the massacres, nor the time it took place.  It might have been between noon and 2 p.m."  She didn't give a date, so this date you are talking about, I don't know.
MR. HOOPER:
Let me just go to a review.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Would you accept, Madam Witness, that in your statement in February '98 you placed the massacre at the Gikomero school complex as the afternoon of the 12th April?  Do you accept that that's what you said then?  Yes or no.
A.	No.  When you say the 12th, do you, yourself, recall that it was in the period between the 10th and the 14th?  If we were to use the date that you are advancing, that is the 12th, you must recall that I said that the period of time was between the 10th and the 14th.
Q.	Let me refer you, then, to your most recent testimony on this previously, which was in January of 2002, transcript page 71, and it's a very short one line or two lines.  Perhaps I can save everyone the time.
MS. MAKWAIA:
The date, please?  Can we have the date?
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, 13 December 2002.  Sorry, I misquoted myself, and we have copies if people want to see them.  Would you like a copy?  Can you pass that up, please, Mr. Registrar?  

I notice it's headed 13th December, but in fact, that may be a printing error.  It's either 13th December or 13th January.  I believe the actual hearing was in January, and if you go over the subsequent pages, it transmutes into January, but perhaps we can clarify that in due course.  This is an authorised trial transcript, and I'm looking at page 71, and I'm looking at the second question.
BY MR. HOOPER.
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that this is what you said, and I read from the transcript: "Are you able to say approximately what date you went to Kibobo, please?"  And your answer, "I think that the massacres at the school were committed on the 12th, but I'm not quite sure about it."  

Is that, in fact, the position, that you think they occurred on the 12th, but you're not quite sure about it?
A.	I'm going to answer your question, but before I do that, I think you will agree that one can make a mistake about dates because, a moment ago, you were saying that maybe you, yourself, had made a mistake on a date.  Now, as for your question, I would like to say that the killings which took place at the school complex took place between the 10th and the 14th.  If you want us to adopt the date of the 12th, fine.  Fine by me.  The fact is that I have indicated to you a period of time during which I thought the killings took place and the date you advance is included in that period of time I mentioned.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Precisely, Your Honours, the witness just took my objection out of my mouth.  Can Counsel please move on?  There is no contradiction whatsoever in this regard, and he has come back to the question of this precise date in more than three questions now, Your Honours.  He has been answered.  If he doesn't like the answer, he's got to live with the answer sometimes.
MR. HOOPER:
Someone is going to live with this answer. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But the point is, Madam Witness, and this is the point, that if the killings were at the school on the 12th, then your statement of February '98 is consistent --
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Please.  Yes, what is happening? 
MS. MAKWAIA:  
Your Honours, now counsel is actually putting it to the witness that it's the 12th.  The witness has clearly stated on more than one occasion it was between the time period she has given.  She never said the 12th.  For Mr. Hooper now to come back to the witness and actually put it to her that she said the 12th, Your  Honour, I'm objecting to that.  I am strongly objecting to that.
MR. HOOPER:
It's always been the Prosecution case, Madam President, that the massacre at the Gikomero church was on the 12th.  It was opened by Mr. Fleming in Kamuhanda and 26 witnesses --
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Please, Counsel, please.  Mr. Hooper, there has been an objection raised.  What are you trying to do?  Are you responding to the objection?
MR. HOOPER:
I'm concerned that the Prosecution are standing in the way of known facts.  Their case was opened against Kamuhanda on the basis that the massacre took place to the 12th, and they called endless witnesses to prove that point, and here they are this afternoon muddying the waters.  Can they accept that that is the date and that the witness's belief -- I appreciate it's ten years and a long time ago -- is correct?
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Please, please.  The witness here told us that it was between the 10th and the 12th -- between the 10th and the 14th, and you, yourself, said that the witness had said that "The massacres started on the 12th, but I am not sure regarding that date."  That is what you read.  So, we are still within that same period which falls between the 10th and the 14th.
MR. HOOPER:
And this is my last point in respect of this which I was just trying to make. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	We have your statement, Madam Witness; you heard it read out.  You state there Rwamakuba came on the 12th, and you state there that that afternoon there was the massacre at the Protestant school.  Your statement to that extent is consistent; do you understand that?  It's only now that you are changing and altering things so that they fall out of that consistency.  Is it the case --
A.	You are asking me questions, but you are basing yourself on the statement concerning Kamuhanda.  You have all the documents with you.  I don't know how you organised all these documents, but you will see that it was between the 10th and the 14th.  Even if you look at all the documents, you many see that period of time being involved.  That period of time is indicated somewhere.  I do believe I mentioned it somewhere.
Q.	After the killings at the Protestant church -- after the killings at the Protestant church, is it right that your husband took you to a safe place at Kibobo down by the lake, and hid you there?  Is that right?
A.	I don't know.  Maybe we don't understand one another.  I'm not saying that you are putting the question to me in an improper manner, but I need to explain that before the killings at the school complex I was hiding at Kibobo.  Later on, I said that I fled following the shooting between the RPF and its enemies.  I went to Kibobo, too, and I do believe I said that I went back to my area when security was restored.
Q.	When was security restored?
A.	There was the insecurity caused by the Interahamwe.  There was also the fighting which brought about a state of insecurity.  I do not know to which of the two types of insecurity you are referring to.
Q.	I'm asking you when was it safe for you to return to ********* at the trade centre.  When was that?
A.	I had a baby.  I didn't have any problem.  I no longer had any problem, and I got there in August, and from what I could see, the security had been restored.
Q.	So when did you go down to this safe house at Kibobo?
A.	I told you that I went to that place when the RPF reached Gikomero and was trying to liberate those who had been expecting death.  Don't ask me about the date, I don't remember, but that's when I went to Kibobo.  Furthermore, when we left the area, our house had been occupied by RPF men.
Q.	How long after the Gikomero school killings, massacres, was it before you went to Kibobo?
A.	I went to Kibobo on two occasions and I think I've mentioned that quite clearly.  The first time was before the killings at the school complex.  I also confirmed that at Kibobo there are two places which are referred to as Kibobo and which are distinct.  Now, the second time around was when the RPF was liberating that area.
Q.	When you went the first time, that's before the Gikomero school massacre, so you must have come back, is this right, to be in Gikomero to witness what you did?  So how long before the Gikomero school massacre did you return?
A.	When I went to Kibobo, that was in the morning, and I went back home that evening.  Even if *******
           ********************************************************************************he wasn't certain that he may not succumb during those events, so I spent the night in Kibobo, and that was for the first time, and then I went back home.  
Q.	How long before the Gikomero school massacre was it when you went home that time?
A.	One day elapsed between the two events.  One day elapsed between the two events.
Q.	So you went to Kibobo, you stayed the night, you came back, and a day later, the massacre at the school; is that correct?
A.	I don't know where you get that information from.  I went to Kibobo, we spent the day there.  Now, that evening we went back home.  Actually, we went to Kibobo in order to see what was happening there, but we came back home that evening.  The following day, the killings at the primary school took place.
Q.	I was just trying to butt in, just to clarify so that we know.  You didn't spend a night there, then, on that first visit?
A.	I told you that I didn't spend the night at Kibobo.  I've said this many times.  Is this due to the fact that I'm speaking Kinyarwanda that you're not understanding me?
Q.	So you go down, you have a look at the place, you go back home, and the next day, there's the massacre, or a day later, there is a massacre at the school.  I understand that.  When did you next go to Kibobo?
A.	But I hope that you are not coming back to this question, but I'm going to answer you.  I told you that I went back to Kibobo.  It's not the same place.  There are two different sites -- locations which are referred to as Kibobo.  Now, the second time around, it was because of the fighting and because the RPF was trying to liberate that area.  Now, how many times am I going to answer this question?  Are you expecting something to the contrary?  I don't know where you're going.
Q.	You have said the contrary, I will come to that in a moment, but at the moment we've got you going for the day, coming back, massacre at the school, and now going down to another Kibobo when the RPF attack the area.  How long after the killings at the school did the RPF attack the area that led you to go to Kibobo the second time, or to a place called Kibobo the second time?
A.	No, I don't think -- are you saying that I contradicted myself somewhere?  I don't know what you're saying there.
Q.	Just answer the question.
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Counsel, we have not seen any contradictions.  I think that it would be better for you to put more simple questions to this witness because it's quite confusing.  You are trying to repeat what the witness is saying, but you are not repeating it verbatim and this is creating a certain amount of confusion.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, let's try and unconfuse it. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I think we are clear about your first visit to Kibobo.  In terms of your second visit to Kibobo, you point out that that's another place with the same name.  I asked you when you went there, and you said it was when the RPF started their attack in that area, in your area.  And so we might be helped, would you agree, by when you went a second time to a place called Kibobo if you could tell us when the RPF attack took place?  Now, I know you're not good at dates, but you may be able to put a time in relation to this killing at the Gikomero Protestant school.  How long after that killing did you go to Kibobo?  Can you answer that simply?
A.	I do not remember the date on which the RPF arrived at Gikomero.  It was during the war.  We were afraid.  Furthermore, I didn't think that I needed to keep those dates in my head so that I could answer any possible questions subsequently.  I don't know any specific date, but all I'm trying to do is to locate the events, to situate the events.  The killings took place between the 10th and 14th in Gikomero, but throughout the month of April people were being killed, and the same applied to the month of May.  I do believe the RPF came to Gikomero either in May or in June, but I'm not very clear with regard to dates, but those are the periods of time at which I can situate these events, but these are approximations, you'll understand.

	1630H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So tell me this:  between the time -- between the day of the Gikomero Protestant school massacre and the coming of the RPF, when you went to Kibobo, which may have been May-June, did you stay in Gikomero secteur at ********** by the market in the intervening time?  It's a very simple question. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I think it is a very compound question.  What exactly is counsel asking?  It's a long drawn-out question; it's not clear what's being asked of the witness. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'll ask it very simply.  In the intervening time, did you stay at ********** in the marketplace at Gikomero secteur? 
A.	I said that when I went to Kibobo I had left that house, yes.  When I was a witness of the killings, I was not in Kibobo, I was ********. 
Q.	You were ******** between the time of the killings at the Protestant school and the time the RPF came; is that correct?
A.	Yes, but that doesn't mean that I was always ********.  You can look back to my statements in Kamuhanda.  You will see that sometimes I left **********, the family's house, and I would come back.  That doesn't mean that I was constantly ********. 
Q.	Sorry.  And where would you go?
A.	I would go to ***********************************************, in a place called Gasagara, G-A-S-A-G-A-R-A.  I also would go to neighbour's houses in Gikomero.
Q.	But did you ever go to Kibobo?
A.	I told you that I went to Kibobo.  On which date?  I don't know if you have a specific date in mind regarding the previous question.  I did say that I went to Kibobo at one point in time.
Q.	In fact, have you said that you went to Kibobo on several days immediately after the massacre at the school, in previous testimony?  And I can bring it up, but it's a long and -- a long process, and I am asking this witness, trying to shorten it. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, in fairness to the witness, there is no shortening of the process.  He should do it properly, please.  

A further objection, Your Honour.  What's the relevance of this line of inquiry with respect to the Accused (sic) before you? 
MR. HOOPER:
I suggested to this witness yesterday that for a period of time she wasn't, in fact, in Gikomero at all but was at Kibobo, and that this -- particularly in the days or both before and during, but also after the massacre at the school.  Now, in my questions this afternoon, I assert that this witness has given highly contradictory answers about her passages to Kibobo.  I understood it to be clear that she had gone once for a day and come back, that she went again, many weeks later when the RPF attacked, and she has wholly omitted to any reference going there in the days that concern me.  Now she is drifting back to that. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, if there is any contradiction, he should just put it to the witness in a direct fashion, instead of going round and round hoping to confuse and then he can impeach her on different answers taken here and then.  If he receives any contradiction with respect to her going to Kibobo, then just put it to the witness, Your Honours.  We can't have this going round and round in circles.  Actually, this line of inquiry is not even relevant, Your Honours.  That's my submission.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, you must be more specific.  We indeed are having problems.  You are saying there is a contradiction.  Well, break it up. That way we can proceed, because we haven't seen that yet.  

Yes, Madam Witness, you have something to say? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes. Thank you, Madam President; thank you Your Honours.  I wanted to remind Counsel to verify the testimony I gave in Kamuhanda.  I don't have the transcripts here, but what I said is that when I came back in 2002 or 2003, I think the explanations that I gave at that time are sufficient.  I said that I lived in Kibobo and not in Gikomero.  When I was in Kibobo, the massacres had not yet began.  When I came back to Kibobo, the Inkotanyi were librating Gikomero.  This is indeed contained in the Kamuhanda documents.  If he looks through those, he will be able to find such testimony.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Witness. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Briefly, there are various references.  I am going to put one to you.  It's on the Kamuhanda, 13th of December 2002, variously 13th January 2003 document, which the Court already has, page 71, and the question was:  "Are you able to say approximately what date you went to Kibogo, please."  Did you ever go to a place called Kibogo -- K-I-B-O-G-O -- or was it meant to be Kibobo, K-I-B-O-B-O? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I meant being in Kibobo.  But perhaps you don't want me to say that.  You want me to deny it.  I acknowledge that I indeed was in Kibobo. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I am acknowledging that there may be a spelling error here and it should be not G but B.  But the question isn't concerned with that, it goes to this.  Your answer was, "I think that the massacres at the school were committed on the 12th, but I am not quite sure about it."  And we have had that bit of the answer.  The next bit reads, "And we went to Kibobo" -- as you would have it -- "the day after the school massacres."  Now, s that correct?  Did you go to Kibobo the day after the school massacres?  Did you go to Kibobo the day after the school massacres -- that's the simple question -- and, if so, how long did you stay?
MS. MAKWAIA:
Your Honours, I find it rather difficult in the selective manner Counsel Hooper chooses to rely on the transcript -- prior testimony from the transcript of this witness.  I will just take an  example of this date that he keeps insisting on of the 12th of April 1994, Your Honours.  He has even accused the Prosecutor of muddying the waters in that respect.  Now, if you refer to the transcript of the 3rd of September 2001 of this witness at page 179, Your Honours, it is clear, in response to a question that was put to the witness, she answered, "I mentioned that he came to distribute the weapons on the 10th and came back to arrange for the killings to start between the 10th and the 14th at the primary school."  This is the very same Protestant primary school that counsel has been referring to throughout.  Again, when the witness is asked in respect of this -- of the massacres at that school, Your Honours, she states, and I am going to quote at page 12 --
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you'll get your opportunity to do this.  I am not quite sure what your exercise is at the moment. 
MS. MAKWAIA:
My exercise at the moment, and you know very well, is to direct Their Honours' attention to the fact that this witness has given different responses at different times on the massacres, and it's not predicated solely on the 12th of April 1994 as you seem to be putting it.  At various stages, she has given this date in different parts of her transcript, and you are doing a selective reading, I've noted, of a prior testimony.  If you want to confront her, then in fairness to the witness, you should bring out all the response she's given.  So then she is afforded this opportunity to choose which of these two time periods she wants to stick to, but you can't throw to her one particular date that you seem to appreciate. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'd already settled on a decision to, in fact, draft an extract of transcripts for the Judges so that there is no difficulty covering every mention she has made of dates, because I don't see any other way, fairly, to deal with it.  And I bear in mind that her very last note on this was that she thought that it was the 12th.  I have just dealt with that, but I am not on that subject at the moment.  I'm on a somewhat different subject and I'd be grateful if I could proceed with it. 
JUDGE LATTANZI:
The Judges also want to see these events clearly.  However, I am not able to see the contradictions regarding the first trip to Kibobo --  first trip made by this witness.  Here before us, this Chamber, she said that, "The first time, I went after the massacres at the school."  Here it seems that she is saying "one day after."  Perhaps we can say that in the testimony in the other case, in the transcript there was more specificity but not a contradiction.  I am not able to see the contradiction.  We also have an interest in understanding this.  As such, can you put very short simple questions to resolve this issue -- resolve this issue of two visits to Kibobo?  Thank you, learned Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I note -- I note the time, and it may be that the transcript will better and more clearly show -- the draft transcript, which may be available later.  It won't be later today I am told; it will available tomorrow.  I was going to say I could raise it again tomorrow.  But my understanding was that she has said certain things about Kibobo, but included in that was a statement just a short while ago, as I heard it, and I stand corrected, that she had gone to Kibobo the first time before the massacres,  and that she went the second time, only when the RPF arrived in May or June.  And I put those matters very clearly to her, twice.  Now, if I am wrong, or I have -- or there has been a misinterpretation, which very rarely happens, may I say, then I have got -- I am confronted with this different account.  The contradiction is that she said on a previous occasion -- and again it's -- the transcripts are littered with these references that she had gone to Kibobo on several days.  So that's where we are.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I am sorry if you are confused by the matter.  Did you go to Kibobo on several days immediately following the massacre at the school?  
A.	There is a problem.  In the Rwamakuba case I never mentioned Kibobo, but I will answer you.  I went to Kibobo one day prior to the massacres; massacres took place the next day, the day of my departure.  That's what I explained, and I remember that some people said that I was not in Gikomero when the massacres took place.  

You dwell on one simple word that you try to analyse.  You said that I was in Kibobo on the second time and then I went to Kibobo twice, number -- Kibobo two, rather, after the arrival of the RPF.  

The first time I was in Kibobo, the massacres had not yet started at the primary school.  The second time the RPF had just arrived in Gikomero.  I think that it is clear now. 
Q.	It is, and that's where I thought we were at a dozen questions ago.  But are you saying you didn't go to Kibobo then between the killings, the massacres and the RPF coming?  Is that your evidence?
A.	No.  I did not go to Kibobo between the two events, between the massacres and the arrival of the RPF.
Q.	Right, I am going to leave that point so that I can, as I expect, deal with it far briefer tomorrow perhaps with, I hope, fingertip precision in terms of the transcripts and get an extract, and the Prosecution can have their extract as well, and we can deal with that aspect of your evidence. 

Now, you are a Tutsi woman and you were -- is it right you were known to be a Tutsi in the area where you live?
A.	Yes, they were aware.
Q.	You were very vulnerable, weren't you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Indeed, you had heard, is that right, looking at your testimony, you had heard Kamuhanda telling your husband that if there was a problem killing Tutsis -- problem because they were married to Tutsis, they should start with their wives.  That's right, isn't it?  That's what he said to (By order of the Court, this name has been expunged from the record), wasn't it?
A.	I see you are making reference to Kamuhanda, but here we are dealing with Rwamakuba.  Why are you speaking of Kamuhanda?  This is Rwamakuba's trial.  But if you want, I can answer your question.
Q.	Did Kamuhanda -- according to you, did Kamuhanda tell your husband (By order of the Court, this name has been expunged from the record) - sorry, sorry -- tell your husband -- and can that be struck -- did Kamuhanda tell your husband that if there were difficulties in respect of their being married to Tutsis, that they should start by killing their wives?
A.	No, that is not my point of view.  That is what I heard and I explained that to the Chamber.
Q.	That is what you overheard Kamuhanda saying to your husband; is that right?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The name of the husband mentioned by Counsel in this room must be expunged from the record.  I do not want to repeat the name.  I hope that you can find that so that that name must be struck from the record.  I would like to ask the technicians, but this is going to be difficult, when possible, that that be -- transmission to the public of such things be suspended.  Very well.  

Mr. Hooper, as we said before, you must be very careful with protected witnesses. 
MR. HOOPER:
I am sorry.  I was in error there. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphone not activated) ...correct, Madam Witness, not that I was in error, the question that preceded it:  Is it right that you overheard Kamuhanda tell your husband that if there was a difficulty because he was married to a Tutsi in starting the killings that he should start with his wife?  That's something you overheard said; is that right?
THE WITNESS:
Perhaps you want me to express myself in another language, but I have already explained myself on this.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me pass on.  So why are you standing outside ********** in front of this crowd when it's being told to kill Tutsis?  Why are you doing that?  Why aren't you hiding? 
A.	I wasn't close to them, no.  I never said that I was close to them.  There is a difference between seeing killers in the act of killing and being close to them, being with them.
Q.	But you told us you were only 10 metres away, able to hear every word that was said.  That's very close, isn't it?
A.	I was in front of ********** with my husband.  Rwamakuba did not live in that neighbourhood, so he couldn't look at me and know that I was a Tutsi.  He couldn't kill me.
Q.	But all the Interahamwe knew who you were; didn't they?
A.	I have never denied that even my husband was among them.  He could be with them.  He could be one of them.  He was armed, and I have never denied that.
Q.	Your husband didn't stay with you all the time, did he?
A.	Where do you get that from, Counsel?  Perhaps he wasn't with me.  He had taken measures, however, to protect me. 
Q.	And what was that?
A.	At times he had me flee.  At times he locked me in the house.  If you need me to tell you other measures that he took, I can tell you.
Q.	Was it simply this, that your husband locked you away in a house in Kibobo?  Isn't that what happened? 
A.	Why would he lock me over there in the house?  I said that I spent a few days, and he did lock me up in the house, but it was for a few hours; in the evening, we went home. 
Q.	In your account in your statement is the position this, that when it came to the lad on the motorbike, the crowd were then in front of the secteur office and that was where he was stopped and where he was dealt with, on your account.  Did you follow the question?  Let me read the part -- the passage to you, because I don't think you can follow the question unless you know what's in your statement, and I don't expect you to remember.
A.	What do you want me to remember, Counsel?
Q.	Let me just read you this bit, Madam Witness.  And it's after you've spoken about Rwamakuba coming to give a green light and all that.  You say, "My husband prevented me from approaching the crowd and made it clear to me that I was personally threatened because I was Tutsi."  Now, first of all, is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's what I am saying, and you have just read it yourself.  I told you that I did not go near them, but I heard what they were saying and I could see what they were doing.
Q.	And I am dealing with the second incident with the man on the motorbike, and I'm going to read out here what it says:  "After the gory task" -- that's with the two young people  -- "the crowd came back to the front of the secteur office.  Five minutes later, a young man arrived on a motorbike."  And you go then into detail.  The question I want to ask you is this:  Is that correct that at that stage the crowd were back in front of the secteur office?
A.	I think that when you showed the photograph I did indicate where the people were.  They had gone up to the secteur office.  They arrived close to the tank for dipping the livestock, it's near the secteur office.  Are you satisfied with my answer, Counsel?
Q.	Isn't the secteur office right the other side of Gikomero centre, about as far away from ********** as it's possible to get?
A.	In my testimony I gave you an estimate of the distance between ********** and the secteur office.  I also gave you an estimate of the distance between ************ the place where the young man aboard a motorbike was stopped.  Don't tell me that the secteur office is close to **********.  That I don't agree with. 
Q.	Well, I am not suggesting the secteur office is near **********. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Hooper, it is five o'clock, 5:02 to be exact.  We are going to adjourn the hearing for today, until tomorrow.  We would like to know how much time you think you need to finish with your cross-examination of this witness. 
MR. HOOPER:
An hour and a half, leaving aside the Kayanga matter, to which, incidentally, perhaps I can attach now the Kibobo matter because it's really more relevant to that than the initial citing.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I was actually going to follow up on the last question from the Court, Your Honour, in terms of scheduling to find out how many of the other Defence attorneys were going to cross-examine this witness because we would like to plan for our next witness; whether we should bring that witness in the afternoon or the second half of the morning and so on and so forth.  But I did notice that Mr. Weyl stood up.  I don't know if he has another concern.  So maybe I should let him express himself if it's on a matter of scheduling.  But I'd like to state something else on the record once Mr. Weyl has completed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Madam President. The Chamber knows how far I've -- how stubborn I am, but also you will know how difficult it is to speak of documents that we don't have before us.  I will come back to the problem regarding the transcript of 17 April.  How can we have the document and how can we prepare a cross-examination without it?  And that should take place tomorrow in the latter half of the morning.  How can we not have that document that we should have had 60 days ago?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are there any other counsel who wish to speak?  

Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW:
I just wanted to point out that I will have a few questions, but that will depend about -- on, rather, the continued cross-examination of Mr. Hooper.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel. 

What other counsel wish to cross-examine this witness?  We would like to know how much time you anticipate, Counsels. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I thought that would go without saying.  I would definitely go in for cross-examination of the witness and this would depend on what will be revealed to me by the transcripts of the 17th of April.  I think that would take me an hour, hour and a half, but in any case, we would indeed require cross-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The only person --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is that all?  Mr. Robinson? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Madam President, I was hoping not to question this witness, but I would insist that before I be precluded from doing so I have the full disclosure that was requested, including the transcript of the 17th of April and the -- any exculpatory material from the confirmation statement of this witness.  So, after I receive those materials, I can let you know definitely one way or the other.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, it would seem to me that it makes very little sense bringing the next witness to the courtroom before the afternoon session, because if Mr. Hooper is going to go on for another hour and Mr. Weyl is going to be on for another hour and a half, clearly, I don't think we are going to finish in the morning.  So that's what I will do, unless directed otherwise by the Trial Chamber.  

As for Mr. Robinson and his request for exculpatory material, we have disclosed whatever exculpatory material we have.  If you look closely at Rule 68, it does not state that we have to disclose confirmation interview reports, which are covered under Rule 70.  The dictates of Rule 68 is that we must disclose the existence of information.  That was done with our entry in the summary of witness testimony.  It was also done in the notice that was filed under Rule 67(D).  So, as far as we are concerned, we have complied with our obligations under Rule 68, as far as this witness is concerned.  

I must say I am rather concerned about the way the cross-examination is going.  It seems to have gone far and wide and went into areas that were not particularly relevant for the determination of the issues for this Court.  My colleague, Ms. Makwaia, took around two or three hours with her direct examination and here we are, almost three sessions later, counting sessions in terms of the half days, this has gone on very long, and I think -- my submission is that the Court may want to exercise a bit more control so that we move ahead expeditiously.  

My concern specifically is on the issue of contradictions in prior witness statements.  If we are going to adopt the procedure of reading through a witness statement with the witness, maybe the Prosecutor should do that in our direct, and we will take each witness statement and we will go through it line by line and the witness will have an opportunity to explain everything that she's said previously, and that may be a way of expediting things.  But I think it is unfair, actually, to have us conduct our direct examination, simply by eliciting testimony from the witness and then on cross-examination going over the same things two and three times line by line and then paragraph and half pages and so on and so forth.  Those are not contradictions.  And if this is the way we are going to proceed, then we'll adopt the position of reading through the witness statement with the witness during our direct examination, because that would be eminently fairer to the witness.  

So, those are my concerns, and I would request that the Court give it some thought so that we can move along at a faster clip when we resume tomorrow. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, if I could respond briefly.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We are going to adjourn now.  We shall resume all this tomorrow, if you will, because, unfortunately, we need to rise at this specific moment.  Thank you.  Thank you everybody, and have a good evening. 
(Court adjourned at 1710H)
