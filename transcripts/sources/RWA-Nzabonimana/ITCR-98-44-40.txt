         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could   

         3        the registry introduce the matter coming before this 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning, please.

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         6        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed 

         7        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, 

         8        Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and 

         9        Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, 

        10        today, Wednesday, the 9th of October 2002, for the 

        11        continuation of the Defence case in the matter of the 

        12        Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, 

        13        Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T. 

        14        

        15        I am most obliged, Mr. President.

        16        

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu, for the registry.  May 

        18        we have the appearances of the parties starting with the 

        19        Prosecution, if we may for the record, please?

        20   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        21        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        22        attorney and Ms. Marotine, case manager. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 

        24        the appearance of the Defence, please?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds,   

        26        representing Mr. Kajelijeli and assisted by 

        27        Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe, who is the 

        28        interpreter.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Professor Hinds, 

        30        how do we stand with regard to witnesses today?

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: I wish I could have good news for you, 

         2        Your Honour, but I have been informed that the witnesses 

         3        cannot be produced during this session.  

         4        I spoke to -- as the Court instructed, I spoke to 

         5        Mr. Amoussaouga yesterday.  I spoke to him after Court 

         6        also on Monday and so I followed up and the last 

         7        information I got yesterday -- late yesterday, was that 

         8        it was unlikely that the witnesses would -- well, not 

         9        unlikely that the witnesses simply could not be produced 

        10        at this session.  However, I asked the Witness and 

        11        Victims Support Section if it were possible once the 

        12        formalities had been made to see if it may be possible 

        13        to produce the witnesses, trust them they are here so 

        14        that at least they will be here and we could begin 

        15        working with them so that by the next session we could 

        16        not have any impediments.  I think he is here; he can 

        17        speak upon the issue.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thank you, Learned Counsel. 

        19        Yes, Mr. Amoussouga, do you have any further comment on 

        20        this issue?

        21   MR. AMOUSSOUGA: Thank you, Mr. President.  In fact, I spoke 

        22        with the Defence counsel and I explained to the Defence 

        23        counsel that for the time being he will not be able to  

        24        produce the witnesses for the court today, as we have 

        25        requested the transfer of those witnesses in due course.  

        26        But unfortunately, the minister in charge of the 

        27        processing of the document was aware.  So we couldn't 

        28        proceed forward.  Therefore, we have maintained contact 

        29        with the office of the Minister of Justice and we are 

        30        made to believe that they are prepared to cooperate and

         1        to secure the transfer of those witnesses for us and 

         2        this might likely happen in the course of this month.

         3        

         4        I agree with the Defence counsel that the registry would 

         5        do all its best to ensure that those witnesses are 

         6        produced here early next month to make them available 

         7        for the Court, I believe, on 18th of November.  That is 

         8        what I can comment and what Mr. Hinds said to you.  

         9        Thank you. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Amoussouga for the witness and 

        11        victim section of the registry.  

        12        

        13        Yes, Mr. Prosecution, do you have any comment at this 

        14        stage, please?

        15   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, well, we continue to be 

        16        disappointed despite having great sympathy for the 

        17        position of the Defence as well, because we, as Your 

        18        Honours will recall, we were in the same position at the 

        19        end of our case on 6th of -- 8th of April this year.

        20        And we may be well in the same position in other cases 

        21        from time to time.  

        22        

        23        We are concerned though with a couple of issues.  

        24        We will do anything necessary to ensure that the  

        25        witnesses continue to be called, and I can give an 

        26        example of what we were prepared to do in the sittings.  

        27        For example, we were quite happy to have the witness 

        28        Nzirorera interposed.  Now, with that being the case and 

        29        we were able to put him in a week in which, he was, the 

        30        chances are we wouldn't have lost of some of the days

         1        that we have.  It appears in my calculation that we 

         2        might lose something up to five days, almost five days 

         3        of the sittings.  

         4        

         5        We in no way want to tell our learned friends how to run 

         6        their case, but what we say, we are always willing to 

         7        accept any witness that comes forward and is in the  

         8        witness box.  

         9        

        10        Your Honours, we cannot really take it move forward than 

        11        that at that the moment.  Thank you.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes, do you have 

        13        any comments to approach us on this issue, Professor 

        14        Hinds, briefly?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, briefly, Your Honour.  With respect to 

        16        Nzirorera, as the Court knows, we for the Defence had 

        17        put on eleven witnesses.  We put the witnesses on; we 

        18        moved  them around so that there would be absolutely no 

        19        delay with respect to the proceedings.  We had two 

        20        witnesses every day, ready to go.  

        21        

        22        The issue with Mr. Nzirorera, everybody knows, is that 

        23        Mr. Nzirorera had to be represented by counsel.  The 

        24        problem we had with him was that his lawyer had to leave 

        25        at a certain time.  So as we were moving people around 

        26        in order to accommodate witnesses who were available, we 

        27        reached the point in time where we -- Mr. Nzirorera's 

        28        lawyer had to leave and so we just had to put him over 

        29        to the next session.  And in the meantime, we then move 

        30        with the other witnesses who are available.

         1        So that is where we were.  Now, we would have been  

         2        willing to put Mr. Nzirorera on this week, but we 

         3        couldn't because, again, he needed his lawyer here and 

         4        his lawyer was involved in a trial in the United States 

         5        and he couldn't be there.  So those are the unavoidable 

         6        problems that we have.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes, I think the 

         8        Trial Chamber takes note of the problem.  Of course, we 

         9        have had the issue of these ten witnesses coming in  

        10        almost throughout this session.  We cannot at this 

        11        moment but take note what the witness and victim section 

        12        of the registry, what they have said and maybe just ask 

        13        them to keep this matter alive and follow it very 

        14        closely with the relevant authorities so that these 

        15        witnesses are transferred in a timely manner and are 

        16        available during the next session, which is scheduled to 

        17        resume on the 18th of November 2002.  We prefer to start 

        18        with them immediately -- sorry -- we will prefer to be 

        19        useful if they could be here and we start with them 

        20        immediately when the session resumes on 

        21        18th November 2002.  Yes?

        22   MR. AMOUSSOUGA: Mr. President, we believe that we will be 

        23        able to produce those witnesses early next month because 

        24        we got assurances from the government that it is just a 

        25        matter of putting together some processing and then 

        26        those people will be able to be transferred in time.  

        27        Thank you.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Very well then.  That is very good.  We hope 

        29        that those processes would be completed as soon as 

        30        possible.  All right.  Thank you, Mr. Amoussaouga.

         1        Maybe you can leave if you have some other matters to 

         2        attend to.  We will deal with the other aspects before 

         3        we conclude this session.  Thank you.  

         4        

         5        Yes, we have some issues that we are -- still to be 

         6        completed with regard to -- we understand the statements 

         7        from some of the witnesses who testified.  Where do we 

         8        stand?  We would like that stance finalised.

         9   MR. FLEMING: I understand, Your Honours, that there was a 

        10        meeting between Ms. Ojemeni and Professor Bompaka 

        11        yesterday afternoon.  I am not sure it is yet completely 

        12        finalised, but I am sure it is coming close.  It is 

        13        finalised. 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Very good.

        15   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, My Lords. 

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: So what's the position, may we know? 

        17   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, there has been agreement on -- the 

        18        Witnesses HRU30, HRU -- I think in respect of RHU30.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: RHU30.

        20   MR. FLEMING: RHU30, Your Honours.  They are highlighting in 

        21        both the English and the French.  We tender that. 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: That is the statement of which date, Mr -- 

        23        just for the record?

        24   MR. FLEMING: This is the statement of the 20th of March.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: 20th of March.

        26   MR. FLEMING: Two thousand and two.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: As highlighted?

        28   MR. FLEMING: As highlighted, Your Honour.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: This is in French and English?

        30   MR. FLEMING: In French and English, yes.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  So there is no objection, 

         2        Professor Bompaka?

         3   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Yes, objections on Witness RHU30.  If you 

         4        look at these documents, Your Honour, you will see that 

         5        paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, there is an excerpt that 

         6        has been underscored.  It is called Interahamwe 

         7        Amahindure, underlined, sorry.  So in the same paragraph 

         8        you have a section which has been underscored, I mean, 

         9        underlined, sorry -- highlighted here.  Now, if you turn 

        10        to the next page.

        11   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: We would like to underscore that 

        12        interpreters do not have the copy of the statement.

        13   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: First paragraph first -- second page, a 

        14        passage has been highlighted and it is "Interahamwe I 

        15        have recognised two among them who stayed very close ****

        16        ****.  It is Ndahayo, son of Barata, and it is him 

        17        who killed Ntugari.  I have also recognised L'homme who 

        18        currently is in prison.  Ntugari was shot by Ndahoya".

        19        

        20        Your Honours, we have read the statement of this  

        21        witness before the Court and we have seen that there is 

        22        an agreement, so to speak, with the written statement 

        23        under the testimony in the court here.  So there is no 

        24        contradiction, Your Honour, between the testimony and as 

        25        the statement of RHU30.  I conclude on that front. 

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Do you have any objection?  That is the 

        27        question, because there are certain issues that are 

        28        matters of argument, you know, in the closing arguments.  

        29        For example, if a paragraph is presented, and we have an 

        30        example as a contradiction that the other party 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                        9 OCTOBER 2002



         1        perceives, maybe there might be no contradictions.  

         2        Those are the issues that are going to be canvassed 

         3        before the Trial Chamber to determine and to see exactly 

         4        whether there is a contradiction because the marking 

         5        does not make it the end-all.  Those could be matters 

         6        that be subject for argument.  So the question is, do 

         7        you have any basic objection to those?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think what Professor Bompaka 

         9        is putting into the record is our objection.  What he 

        10        has pointed out is that the areas that have been 

        11        highlighted by the Prosecution in RHU30 do not reflect 

        12        any inconsistencies between the statement and trial 

        13        testimony.  And so, therefore, we are objecting to those 

        14        notations because they do not reflect, in fact, 

        15        inconsistencies, and he is putting that in the record 

        16        specifically why we are taking objections to those.  

        17        The Prosecution can still put their documents in but we 

        18        are putting them in directly at this spot, the reasons 

        19        why we are objecting to those notations they are making.

        20   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honours, may I be heard on this?

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please.

        22   MS. OJEMENI: Yesterday when I met with Professor Bompaka, he 

        23        just simply wanted to know the basis for the 

        24        highlighting we have done before, during the Prosecution 

        25        case, and what we usually do is to underline the 

        26        paragraphs referred to in the course of the proceedings 

        27        and that is basically what I was told.  And he didn't 

        28        raise any objection with me.  So we seek to tender the 

        29        documents as highlighted.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  In that case we will take note of 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        the objection of counsel for the Defence, 

         2        Professor Bompaka, and the documents should be admitted 

         3        as an exhibit after having noted those exhibits.  That 

         4        would be the Prosecution Number?  

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: 22, My Lords.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: 22.  Let the statement of RHU30 of 

         7        20th March 2002 as highlighted in both French and 

         8        English be collectively admitted as 

         9        Prosecution No. 22 and the same shall be kept under seal 

        10        as it may contain the personal particulars of this 

        11        witness who is a protected witness.

        12        (Exhibit No. 22 admitted)

        13   MS. OJEMENI:  The next one is RHU23, statement dated 

        14        23rd September 2001 in French and English, Your Honour.  

        15        We seek to tender it as an exhibit, Prosecution 

        16        exhibit --

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: As highlighted.  Professor Bompaka, any 

        18        objection?

        19   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Mr. President, once again, here also we do 

        20        have objections because we have several paragraphs that 

        21        have been highlighted in the first paragraph, in the  

        22        second paragraph, in the third paragraph, fifth and 

        23        sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth.  I repeat, several 

        24        paragraphs have been highlighted and we have compared 

        25        the written statement on one hand and the testimony of 

        26        the witness before the Court and we have noted what 

        27        follows.  Now, as relates the first highlighted passages 

        28        in the first paragraphs, now these passages are included 

        29        in the oral testimony of the witness and we are in a 

        30        position to disclose the references; namely, where these 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                        9 OCTOBER 2002



         1        passages are found.  

         2        Take for example the transcript of 24th September 2002 

         3        in closed session.  You will see these passages so there 

         4        is no discrepancy between the written testimony and the 

         5        testimony before this very Court.  

         6        

         7        Now, let's go to the second paragraph.  As concerns the 

         8        second paragraph, there are discrepancies between -- the 

         9        inconsistencies between the written statement.  You can 

        10        see the references in the transcript of 

        11        24 September 2002, closed session page 248, lines 12 to 

        12        25, and page 249 and lines 1 to 16.  

        13        

        14        Mr. President, I don't know if there is need to read all 

        15        these passages from the transcripts.  Would that be 

        16        necessary?  So let me continue; I can see that the Court 

        17        is allowing me.  So in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, the 

        18        Prosecutor has highlighted "7:30 in the morning".

        19        We don't have any objections.  Now, as to what follows, 

        20        the Prosecutor has highlighted "and given that people 

        21        were agitated, it was impossible to go up to the maize 

        22        factory".  Now, this passage, Your Honour, is also found 

        23        in the testimony of the witness and we are in a position 

        24        to provide, to disclose the references -- I mean, the 

        25        transcript of the 27th September -- 

        26        25th September, open session, page 9, lines 1 to 10,  

        27        pages 17, lines 23 to 25; and page 23, lines 21 and 22; 

        28        page 25, lines 7 and 14 -- 26, sorry.  I read, "From my 

        29        house" --

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: I don't know whether we are together with

         1        regard to what was supposed to be done at this stage.

         2   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Your Honour, we are on the same 

         3        wavelength.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: And, Counsel, for example, as far as the 

         5        Chamber is concerned, we do not have those statements.  

         6        Some of us do not see those statements until they are 

         7        tendered into evidence.  And one of the reasons why we 

         8        think it is important to highlight whichever areas, 

         9        important things, there is a difference between the 

        10        testimony in court, his oral evidence and some aspects 

        11        in the statement, is precisely so that they are able at 

        12        a later stage to see the context, to see exactly what is 

        13        in the record in the statement and oral statement.  And 

        14        once they are highlighted, it becomes easy to follow 

        15        them up.  I know they can be traced up in the 

        16        transcripts and that is the basis of the highlighting.  

        17        So, it is possible.  There might be argument to and fro 

        18        with regard to these issues, but that the issues can be 

        19        properly addressed at the end.  To see, for example, 

        20        whether there is any discrepancy with regard to the 

        21        evidence of a particular witness in a particular issue 

        22        and whether if indeed there is one, whether that 

        23        discrepancy is material with regard to the credit to 

        24        that witness, those are the issues that can be gone 

        25        into.  And so I don't exactly -- we don't seem to follow 

        26        you, Professor, how exactly you want this.  

        27        

        28        It is possible, as we said earlier on, that there could 

        29        be a number of interpretations on some of those passages 

        30        which are going to put on.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Absolutely, Your Honour.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: And we will hear the parties at an appropriate 

         3        time.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we are in complete agreement 

         5        with you, but we believe that and the process that was 

         6        used in the past was that sometimes we had sets of 

         7        statements that went in.  We reviewed the statements 

         8        that were highlighted by Prosecution side and we are 

         9        stating that these highlighted portions do not reflect 

        10        any inconsistencies in the testimony.  

        11        

        12        Now, but these are going to on -- at some later stage 

        13        you are going to look up these.  And we would be making 

        14        arguments at the closing, but at this stage, the 

        15        question has been put to us:  "Are there any 

        16        objections?"  We say, "Yes".   What are the objections?  

        17        And we don't intend to read all of the statements, but 

        18        we do feel we should highlight which particular 

        19        paragraphs we have objections to so that it is part of 

        20        this record.  Otherwise, what we have is a perfunctory 

        21        process.  If these documents go in that are highlighted, 

        22        we have objections.  The question is, what are the 

        23        objections of the Defence?  Nobody knows.  

        24        

        25        You sit down six months or a year from now, you are 

        26        reading this, what are the objections?  So we undertake 

        27        two minutes with respect to each of the documents.  

        28        We have objections.  We state them.  If there are no 

        29        objections, there is nothing in the record.  How much 

        30        are we taking in order to, in fact, highlight the

          KAJELIJELI                                        9 OCTOBER 2002



         1        objections with respect to the particular areas?  And 

         2        that is what 

         3        Professor Bompaka has been doing.  He has given the  

         4        references without reading the transcript because we 

         5        spend a lot of time looking at this.  We are not making   

         6        argument at this time, but that will come later on.  But 

         7        we are putting in the record the purpose for the 

         8        objections with some degree of specification, unless the 

         9        Court just wants us to object without setting out the 

        10        basis of the objection.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: The -- maybe raising the objection does not 

        12        mean the Defence or the other party agrees with the 

        13        purpose for which the purpose of the document is 

        14        tendered.  The other party claims that they are 

        15        tendering for this and that, you see.  So it is not 

        16        raising an objection does not mean that the other party 

        17        is agreeing that the purpose is correct because argument 

        18        will be expected at the end, nonetheless.

        19   MS. OJEMENI: If I may assist the Court.  What we did in the 

        20        past was to have two sets of statements.  If the other 

        21        party did not agree with the other, the party that is in 

        22        opposition will highlight his own statement. 

        23        For instance, in the case of Witness ACM, we did not 

        24        agree with the highlighting done by the Defence, and we 

        25        had our own statement.  We handed our own statement and 

        26        they handed in theirs and the Court never allowed the 

        27        Defence because they have always attempted to argue, you 

        28        know, what they should do in the closing address if need 

        29        be, you know.  And I know the Court has always requested 

        30        them to highlight the statements, and that is what we

         1        did in the case of ACM.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we are together.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, in all issues, as we do not 

         4        trespass upon the Court's speech, we have objections.  

         5        We are reserving our right to respect these objections 

         6        without going into the specifics.  Our position is that 

         7        the Prosecutor, their highlighting goes far beyond  

         8        inconsistencies with respect to each document, and so as 

         9        it comes up we will just note our objections.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: But, otherwise, you have no objections for the 

        11        documents being produced?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: We have no objections for the process.  

        13        We have the objections to the substance.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Okay.  Let the statement of 

        15        Witness RHU23, on the 23rd of September 2001, in both 

        16        English and French, as highlighted, be admitted as 

        17        Prosecutor Exhibit No. 23 and the same document shall be 

        18        kept under seal as they may contain -- they do indeed 

        19        contain personal particulars of this witness who is a 

        20        protected witness.

        21        (Exhibit No. 23 admitted).

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Next?

        23   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, we tender as Exhibit 24 the statement of  

        24        RHU31 --

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: RHU31.

        26   MS. OJEMENI: -- dated March 23, 2002, and highlighted in 

        27        French and English. 

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel for the Defence.

        29   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: We have objections regarding this witness, 

        30        but we shall not go into details.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: So let -- we note the indications of the 

         2        Defence, so let statement of Witness RHU31, of 

         3        20th March 2002, in both English and French, as 

         4        highlighted, as Prosecution No. 24.  And the documents 

         5        shall be kept under seal as they contain the personal 

         6        particulars of this witness who is a protected witness. 

         7        (Exhibit No. 24 admitted) 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Next?

         9   MS. OJEMENI: Next one is RHU29, dated September 23, 2001.  

        10        Your Honour, we seek to tender the statement both in 

        11        English and French, as highlighted, as Exhibit 25 and we 

        12        request that the same be kept under seal. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Bompaka, please?

        14   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Your Honours, we have objections regarding 

        15        this witness but we shall not go into details thereof.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: We shall take note of the observations of the 

        17        Defence that the statement of Witness RHU29 of 

        18        23rd September 2002, in both English and French, as 

        19        highlighted, be admitted as a Prosecution Exhibit No. 

        20        25, and the documents both in English and French be kept   

        21        under seal as they contain the personal particulars of 

        22        this witness who is a protected witness.

        23   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lords.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  That concludes the statements.  All right.  

        25        Yes, next?  Yes, Counsel, we were proposing -- because 

        26        there are no other matters that I think are still 

        27        pending before the Trial Chamber today, we are proposing 

        28        to have a status conference, but of course, the 

        29        proceedings with regards to the session will be formally 

        30        adjourned today, but we were proposing to have a status

         1        conference tomorrow at 11:00 just to talk about in a 

         2        more specific way some of the amount of the work that 

         3        remains to be done going into Defence case with regard 

         4        to the witnesses, just to get a clear picture and how we 

         5        could possibly proceed from here for the next session 

         6        and  possibly as well as next year.  So, we propose that 

         7        we have a status conference tomorrow at 11:00.

         8   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours, that's appropriate to us. 

         9        There is one issue that I want to raise in open court 

        10        before we adjourn.  This is some matter of gravity from 

        11        the Prosecutor's perspective.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: We have agreed on tomorrow at 11:00 for the 

        13        status conference.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, for the Defence, it will be here?

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Here. All right.

        16   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  The matter, as I said, 

        17        is of some significance insofar as the Office of the 

        18        Prosecutor is concerned.  It is this.  There is, as 

        19        Your Honours well know, a large number of people 

        20        detained and against whom continuing investigations are 

        21        being conducted.  In the course of the investigations in 

        22        respect of one of those parties, it has come to our 

        23        attention that the Office of the Prosecutor or an 

        24        investigator has taken statements.  Now, it came to our 

        25        attention late on Monday afternoon.  I have been trying 

        26        to ascertain how this happened, without great success, 

        27        and I am wanting to obtain an affidavit if necessary to 

        28        put before this Court. 

        29        

        30        But, in fact, first, on the 24th of September 2002, 24th 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        September, a further statement was taken from one of our 

         2        witnesses, GAP.  We have the continuing obligation to 

         3        disclose and GAP has given evidence sometime and we have 

         4        those documents to give to our learned friends.  More 

         5        importantly so far as this Trial Chamber will be 

         6        concerned, the witness, RGM -- RGM was interviewed.  

         7        That interview took place on the 

         8        23rd September 2002.  Now RGM is one of our 

         9        learned friend's witnesses, one of the witnesses of the 

        10        Defence and of course there is a protection order in 

        11        place in favour of that person.  

        12        

        13        Now, it would appear at first blush that inadvertently 

        14        the Offices of the Prosecutor in investigating another 

        15        matter has gone behind that witness protection order and 

        16        has taken a statement from that witness.  Your Honours, 

        17        I consider it a matter of significant gravity myself.  I 

        18        am sure our learned friends would consider it a matter 

        19        of even greater gravity.  I am informing the Court 

        20        because it is a matter where we appear to have breached 

        21        a witness protection order.  My indications are 

        22        inadvertent but I obviously have the obligation to 

        23        produce those statements or that statement to our 

        24        learned friends as well.  Now, Your Honours, we put them 

        25        on notice.  It is obviously a matter that they may well 

        26        want to take up before Your Honours, but we certainly 

        27        came before Your Honours and say we may have, we have 

        28        inadvertently breached our witness protection order in 

        29        place in respect of this trial.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, to say that the Defence is 

         2        concerned is to understate the situation.  We were 

         3        informed at least two weeks ago that our witness, RGM, 

         4        who the Prosecutor knows, has confessed to genocide in 

         5        Rwanda, is a leader of the Interahamwe in Busogo.  They   

         6        know that.  It is in our pre-trial brief.  This witness, 

         7        they know, they know is the key witness for the Defence.  

         8        We have a motion to hold the first deputy prosecutor in 

         9        Rwanda in contempt for attempting to intimidate -- 

        10        intimidate our witnesses.  This is not a trivial matter 

        11        in all jurisdictions.  This is a criminal matter.  You 

        12        interfere with a witness, you go to jail.  Within these 

        13        Rules of the Tribunal, it is also considered, it is a 

        14        serious matter.  And individuals held guilty of 

        15        interfering with a witness face a fine of ten thousand 

        16        dollars and imprisonment.  

        17        

        18        We would notify that the same first deputy prosecutor on 

        19        two occasions, not inadvertently, called RGM in and 

        20        again attempted to have the witness change his decision 

        21        to come here to testify.  This a very serious situation.  

        22        There are no benefits to somebody facing death to come 

        23        here as a Defence witness.  There is no benefit to that 

        24        person.  This witness is a fragile person.  It is a very 

        25        very serious matter.  We had not brought this to the 

        26        Court's attention because, quite frankly, we, you know, 

        27        we hear a lot of things and some of it is rumour.  We 

        28        are not quite sure we are still right investigating 

        29        because we have no way of getting access to the inmates. 

        30        We hoped that they would have been here and we could

         1        have interviewed them to find out what would have really 

         2        happened.  But we were informed that on two separate 

         3        occasions, the first deputy prosecutor in Ruhengeri from 

         4        Rwanda called RGM and maybe others, but we know 

         5        specifically of RGM, and again attempted to have that 

         6        witness withdraw from coming here to Arusha.  

         7        

         8        Now that Mr. Fleming has put on record that it is a fact 

         9        that such an incident took place on the 23th of 

        10        September, according to the notes that I have taken it 

        11        might not have been on the 23rd, but I thought he said 

        12        the 23rd.  We think that we are going to take a closer 

        13        look at the circumstances here and bring the appropriate 

        14        application to this Court, but it is a matter of grave 

        15        concern to us and it should be to anyone who is 

        16        interested in fair play and justice.  

        17        

        18        I know that if I were to go and talk to Prosecution 

        19        witness and try to have a Prosecution witness change 

        20        testimony, I would be in handcuffs.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes?

        22   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we don't underestimate the gravity 

        23        of it at all.  That is why I came to this Court to tell 

        24        this Court the first paragraph of this statement there 

        25        reads:  "This is my first formal interview with 

        26        investigators from ICTR and I am prepared to testify 

        27        before the Tribunal in Arusha if I am invited to do so.  

        28        I have, however, been approached by Defence counsel for 

        29        Kajelijeli before but I did not give any written 

        30        statement because he did not find my information 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        19

         1        interesting".

         2        

         3        So that was the situation confronting the investigators 

         4        in the field and they continued to take this statement.  

         5        Now, I will myself continue the investigation and have 

         6        prepared an affidavit as to how this could possibly have 

         7        happened.  

         8        

         9        I will ensure also that there is a complete review of 

        10        our office to ensure that it can't happen.  Witness  

        11        protection orders are of great significance and without 

        12        that for a moment under-estimating the gravity of this, 

        13        there is a long period of time during which their 

        14        protection orders are in place, that neither Prosecution 

        15        nor Defence, nor the identity of the witnesses who are 

        16        protected, and that is one situation.  By the 23rd of 

        17        September, we did know the identity of this man.  So 

        18        that is a second situation.  So we intend, obviously, to 

        19        produce this now immediately to our learned friends and 

        20        the matter is entirely in their hands and in the hands 

        21        of this Trial Chamber.  And, as I said, we continue to 

        22        ensure that there is an investigation done and also that 

        23        it can't possibly happen again.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, thank you.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: May I, Your Honour?  Twenty-third September 

        26        was a date that these people were supposed to be here.  

        27        They were supposed to be testifying.  This -- I can't 

        28        underline the importance of getting those witnesses here 

        29        under the protection of the Tribunal and, that is, we 

        30        are so concerned again that the witnesses may be sitting 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        in Rwanda and not here because they are fragile 

         2        witnesses subject to whatever, and that is our 

         3        particular concern at this point.  Not only is there a 

         4        protection order, but that the witnesses were supposed 

         5        to be here testifying when they were interviewed, now we 

         6        know, by Prosecution staff on 23rd.  

         7        We also know that there were prior interviews, prior to 

         8        the year 2001, by the Prosecution office and under 

         9        Rule 68, and we were entitled to that information and we 

        10        asked for it and we never got it. 

        11        

        12        I mean, it is a vexing problem that we certainly are not 

        13        even able to get close to any Prosecution witness.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Yes, we take note 

        15        of the observations made by the Prosecution for raising 

        16        this matter.  It is certainly a matter of grave concern, 

        17        but as the parties have indicated that they will be 

        18        following it up, that is well and good because we really 

        19        have to think about the protection of the witnesses of 

        20        all sides it is a cornerstone and it is important, and 

        21        the general principle of fairness which is an essential 

        22        attribute to justice which is that justice must be done 

        23        and must also be seen to be done.  

        24        

        25        So we will say no more on that because there could be 

        26        some development which might come to the Trial Chamber 

        27        for determination, but we thank you for having that 

        28        matter raised.  Okay.  Any other matters?  No.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Not on the side of the Defence, Your Honour.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming?

         1   MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honour.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Before we adjourn, there is another matter.  

         3        Perhaps by way of information we did follow the question 

         4        of the investigator, Professor Hinds, and formal report, 

         5        the conclusive report we got from the registry was they 

         6        have given you two assistants and one of them is 

         7        supposed to deal with the questions that are being 

         8        addressed concerning the translations, interpretations 

         9        between you, Counsel, the parties and the Accused 

        10        person.  So there is no justification for having the 

        11        investigator for that purpose.  

        12        

        13        There is also the question of expense.  So if that is 

        14        where the matter stands, and I think the reasons given 

        15        if not controverted, they appear to be reasonable. 

        16        

        17        So we will adjourn these proceedings for this case to 

        18        the 18th of November 2002.  We will like as well to  

        19        thank the counsel from both sides for their work in 

        20        helping the Tribunal and the Chamber to carry on its 

        21        work.  Thank you.  

        22        

        23        We would also like to thank all the various officers 

        24        particularly our officers in front of us here, the 

        25        interpreters, for their understanding sometimes with us, 

        26        and the recorders and everybody who has been involved in 

        27        servicing this session.  We thank all of you.  And all 

        28        those who have been travelling from Arusha we say to 

        29        them bon voyage.
