Dr. Des Forges.  
ALISON DES FORGES
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Yesterday we left off, we were still talking about the pre '94 period.  And I would like to stay with that for another 10 or 15 minutes and then move on to the '94 events.  

Based on your expert report, and portions of your testimony yesterday, Dr. Des Forges, you were talking about -- oh, we started our discussions with a review of pre-colonial state structures and compared them to the MRND party state under Habyarimana.  I believe you stated that you found parallels between the two in terms of their capacity to control the population and to mobilise the population.  Would that be a fair repetition of -- summary of the things we discussed yesterday? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, with the introduction of multi-party politics, did the MRND as a party lose its capacity to mobilize the population or to control the population in any way?  Or how did that impact upon its ability to do those things? 
A.	In certain parts of the country which were MRND strongholds, and that included, primarily, the northwest, parts of Kibuye, Cyangugu, Gikongoro and some parts of  Kibungo in the east, scattered areas in other préfectures as well, in those areas of strongholds the MRND retained its control.  The arrival of multi-party politics did not make any substantial difference.  

The areas controlled by the MDR abutted on the MRND areas in a number of places, and that resulted in outright clashes.  For example, on the borders between Gitarama and Gisenyi where the territory was actually fought over by the different militia.  But in terms of the way that powerful people, authorities related to ordinary people, the pattern continued to be the same.  With the MRND officials controlling resources and power in their areas of greatest strength, and with the contenders from the newer formations, particularly the MDR, but in Butare the PSD, and to a limited extent the PL, their officials behaving very much in the same way of the MRND officials but in a more circumscribed part of the country.  

It is difficult to draw a precise political map in 1994 because the situation was still dynamic.  And bourgmestres would switch their loyalty, according to their immediate interest.  And the loyalty of the bourgmestre could have a lot of importance in terms of the way the rest of the commune went.  So, in rough terms, it looked like the MRND controlled somewhere in the vicinity of two thirds of the communes in early 1994, but in other parts of the country it would be the MDR that was the primary threat to MRND control. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, yesterday you also described the coalition government that was put in place in April of 1992 as -- or when you described the government that was put in place in 1992, you mentioned that the opposition entered the government.  To the extent that the opposition entered the government, where was the sense of opposition?  If we look at the MDR, the PSD, PL, which are the three main parties that you identified and I think the fourth is the PDC.  How did they relate to the MRND in the context of this coalition government? 
A.	It was a very uneasy alliance.  The opposition parties remained opposition parties in the sense of continuing to be opposed to the MRND and to the president himself; but they were no longer opposition parties in any formal sense because they were part of the government and jointly bore responsibility for government decision.  This became extremely complicated in the negotiations for the Arusha Accords, because the chief civilian negotiator for the government was, in fact, a member of the MDR, not of the MRND.  That was Mr. Nkulinzira.  And because he was from a party opposed to the MRND, those people dissatisfied with the Accords were able to blame him, and by extension opposition political parties in general, for having arrived at an agreement that was, in their view, unfavourable to Rwanda as a whole.  And that then fed the propaganda accusations that the opposition parties had basically betrayed the government, sold away the country for their own personal or partisan interest.  
Q.	Well -- thank you.  In your report, you mentioned a military commission that President Habyarimana had set up in December of 1991, I believe, and you talk about a certain document.  And what I would like to understand is the notion of the enemy, how was the enemy of Rwanda defined when that document was produced and in the years following it? 
A.	The first serious negotiations at Arusha took place in July and August 1992.  And it's, I think, of great importance that this document defining the enemy was circulated in September 1992.  In other words, you would think that a government which had just taken the first steps on the path to peace would feel relatively confident and relaxed; but instead this document, which was circulated, and the cover letter by the commander and chief of the -- or the chief of staff of the armed forces specifically says, watch out, don't trust those negotiations, which would seem, certainly, an unusual message to be sending to the troops if one were, in fact, sincere about carrying forth those negotiations.  

And there is substantiation for this point of view, also this point of view that there is a segment of the military structure opposed to the negotiations even as they are being continued in another letter which was written by the head of military intelligence, Colonel Nsengiyumva, to President Habyarimana saying, basically, you are heading in the wrong direction with this idea of negotiations.  If you continue, you are likely to face a military coup or the newly installed coalition government is likely to be overthrown.  And, indeed, a few months after, there was an aborted coup against the new government.  And in this letter, which was the 27th of July 1992, just as the negotiations are getting serious, the head of military intelligence warns the president, if this continues and the RPF continues to be powerful and to advance, the military, the soldiers will rise up and kill the politicians responsible for these kinds of negotiations; and the people will rise up and kill the Tutsi.  

So a very powerful explanation long before the genocide of exactly the kind of programme that is followed on April the 6th with the killing of those opposition political leaders thought to be responsible for the negotiations, and the widespread killing of Tutsi civilians.  So, that was July.  

Then you come to September, and the chief of staff of the army takes this document, which has been in the drawer since the early part of the year, and finds it important to circulate that to all men in the ranks, and to direct his subordinates to particularly underline the part of the document which has to do with the definition of the enemy; and to report back to him on what impact this document has had in the ranks.  At this point, there is a concern about morale in the army.  There is a concern about the movement of some members of the military force to a position of support for the opposition parties rather than for Habyarimana and the MRND.  

And in part, this definition of the enemy and the circulation of this document goes back to the explanation I gave yesterday about the very first focusing on the ethnic element of the conflict in October of 1990, where those surrounding Habyarimana decide to scapegoat the Tutsi, to put the responsibility for the conflict on the backs of an ethnic group within the country, in order to deal with their own internal conflicts among Hutu.  So that the possibility of recreating the solidarity they once had among their own ethnic group is seen as best -- as most likely to occur if anyone who tolerates the idea of working with the RPF is automatically assigned to the category of enemy.  And the definition of the enemy is primarily an ethnic one, but it includes also any Hutus who are willing to work together with this group, which is defined as a group coming, essentially, from Tutsi -- a Tutsi pool of the population. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Dr. Des Forges, just one moment please.  

Your Honour, I have been thinking about how -- a constructive suggestion I could make here.  And I'm still not sure, but perhaps one suggestion is this that perhaps if Dr. Des Forges, after she has finished a sub-topic of the topic could just pause for a moment before she moves on to the sub-topic, because I need to try and take some kind of note, and I'm finding it very difficult.  I know it is not her fault.  But, perhaps, she can -- well, can she recap a little bit on what she has just gone through.  But in going through these details, perhaps, she can go through a sub-topic, pause a bit, then start on to another sub-topic.  In other words, sort of five or six sentences, pause, five or six sentences.  Is that possible, Dr. Des Forges?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would like to respond.  My understanding of the procedures this morning is that we are -- I am conducting a direct examination of the witness.  All of the parties have received Dr. Des Forges' expert report, where the same thing that she is testifying about this morning are quite explicitly laid out over  40 pages.  She has testified numerous times.  Nothing that she is saying this morning should take anybody by surprise.  I would think that anyone that wanted to take notes could look at her previous testimony in any one of seven other trials and find the same types of information.  

I will continue, but the Defence will have an opportunity to go over everything in cross-examination.  But I will slow the paces down and I will try to break things down in more bite-size portions. 
THE WITNESS:
And I'm afraid the difficulty is mine, because I see so much of an interconnection between all of these different parts of the puzzle, that it is difficult to make arbitrary stops in the context.  But I will attempt to keep in mind the difficulty of getting it all down. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, would you be able to remember how the enemy was defined in that document?  Would you recall -- can you recall that from memory or would it assist you to look at the document?  It has been entered into evidence and we can actually look at it, if necessary. 
A.	That is probably a good idea, because the central passage has been much disputed in a number of trials.  And rather than risk a problem of misquotation, I think would it be good to look at the exact words. 
Q.	I think you will find it at tab 4 in your working binder, and everyone else will recognise as P. 15.  It is number 55 on our exhibit list, and I believe it is in Volume II of our main file.  And we have it in French and English.  So, if you turn to Tab 4 you should be able to find it there.  
A.	If we look at the page which is, I believe, K003410 -- it is probably 103, although the numbers are rather blurred on the copy I have, this is the second page after the cover letter which is much more easily read.  The cover letter is K0034182.  And that is a cover letter which was signed by the chief of staff of the Rwandan Armed Forces, ordering the diffusion of this document attached to it. 
Q.	And before you go on, let me just indicate for the record, we are looking at the French text, it is P. 15, I would assume P. 15A since we are using A to denote the French.  Continue please.  
A.	At the heading you will see, "Definition of the ENI" which is the standard military abbreviation in Rwanda for enemy, from the French ennemi.  And it says, basically, the enemy is divided into two categories, the principal enemy and the partisans of the enemy.  And it says, "The principal enemy is the Tutsi from inside or outside," meaning inside or outside of Rwanda, "who is extremist and nostalgic for power, who has never recognised and will never recognise -- and who has never recognised and still does not recognise the realities of the social revolution of 1959, and who wants to re-conquer power in Rwanda by all means, including arms."  So a general association of the enemy with people of the Tutsi ethnic group. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Sorry, Your Honour.  Just a point of clarification from the Prosecution.  The Prosecution says it is their exhibit number 55 in Volume II.  That is causing us some difficulty, is that correct?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is what I have in my notes.  I don't have the binder in front of me because I am working from a separate set of documents, I will check with one of my assistants.  

As she looks to confirm that, maybe I should also clarify for the record that the document that             Dr. Des Forges was reading, I have just been told it is in binder 4. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Four, not 2. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me, Dr. Des Forges was reading a document that was in French and I assume that she made her own translation. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, if I could ask you to just please read it in French, and we will have the interpreters translate it and then you can go on with your testimony.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Just pause a moment while we find it, please.  Do you have a page number for Volume IV? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
It is in Volume IV, and there is a tab that indicates 55. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, sorry.
THE WITNESS:
In French the passage reads, "The enemy is subdivided into two categories; the principal enemy, the main enemy and the enemy supporters.  The main enemy is the Tutsi, whether within or without who are extremist and nostalgic for power, who never have recognised, and still does not recognise the realities of the social revolution of 1959 and who want to re-conquer power in Rwanda by any means -- by all means, including by use of arms.  The enemy supporters or partisans is any person who brings any assistance -- gives any assistance to the main enemy." 

The document goes on further down that same page to talk about les milieux enemy, the enemies social context, shall we say.  And under the social groups from which the enemy is recruited, you will see a number of references in the text to Tutsi:  Tutsi refugees, Tutsi of the interior, foreigners married to Tutsi women, and the Nilo-Hamitic people of the region.  Let me pause for a moment simply over that term Nilo-Hamitic.  

I talked yesterday about the imposition of European ideas, basically, 19th century ideas of racial categories which led Europeans to presume that Tutsis were a group apart from other Rwandans; that they had come from outside of the country and that they are superior.  At one time that group of people who were identified with northeastern Africa were called either the Hamite or the Nilo-Hamitic.  And this was the term used in opposition to the category Bantu.  And so using those terms, Nilo-Hamitics would be Tutsi and Tutsi-like people, as opposed to Bantu, who would be Hutu people.

You will note that by the time you have included Tutsi refugees, and Tutsi from inside, you really have covered all of the Tutsi in the area, because you have gotten those inside and outside who constitute the reservoir for recruitment of the enemy.  And you will also notice that thus far in the document, we have not seen a reference to the RPF, that is to the military political force, which is the actual combatant against whom the Rwanda government is fighting.  Instead, it is the enemy and the word Tutsi associated with that definition of the enemy.

And then, again, on the next page talking about the milieux of activists supporting this enemy, you have Tutsi living in, and then a list of countries, all of the countries where Tutsi could be found where it is said that they are supporting the enemy.  And then you have a mention that there are Tutsi who have infiltrated into national organisations, another reference to Tutsi displaced from 1959.  Sort of a repetition of this term "Tutsi".  
And then I would draw your attention, also, if you could turn over to page K0034108, at the very bottom, and here I will read in French, again, if the interpreter would be so kind as to translate.  (French spoken) -- I'm sorry, does the translator have it at the bottom of that page?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
Is that okay?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes. 
THE WITNESS:
"In its sensitisation campaign, the enemy has been able to recruit certain former Hutu authorities and other dis --  Hutus who are dissatisfied with the regime, with the existing order, with a view to hiding, concealing the Tutsi label from their policy of hegemony and thus bring over Hutus to their cause." 

If you recall, yesterday I mentioned the great military rival of President Habyarimana,                    Colonel Rubunangwe, a Hutu from Ruhengeri who had left, who had fled for his life in 1980, and subsequently was recruited as the president of the RPF.  So, here you see this continuing concern for former Hutu authorities, who are able to use their continuing network to potentially draw Hutu to the side of the RPF.  

And then further over on K0034190, there is a passage that I find also very important.  It begins just above number 2 (French spoken), second small paragraph above that.  And it begins (French spoken), these are defined as strategies of the enemy.  "Stirring up hatred between individuals and between regions.  Deviation of national opinion from the ethnic problem to the social-economic problems between rich and poor."

This document indicates a refusal to acknowledge any real internal problems in the Habyarimana regime, and instead is attempting to tell readers, and that included, in this case, the members of the armed forces, that there were -- really were no issues in the country, except for those falsely created or accentuated by the enemy.  So, all of those apparent problems of corruption, of poverty, of leadership that has taken the country, apparently, nowhere, those were not real problems.  They were only created by the enemy in an attempt to destroy Hutu solidarity in order to make it easier to conquer the country.  

And there is one final reference on page K0034194, where it talks about the political advantages of the enemy.  And it says that, "One advantage is the beginning of multipartyism, because multipartyism has helped the enemy by causing social dissension within the country.  So again, see this association of the enemy from the outside with that internal threat, which is essentially a threat to Hutu solidarity.  
And immediately after that, as one of the advantages, "A single political will and a single political ideology", which is Tutsi hegemony.  And this is a phrase that recurs in the propaganda before and during the genocide repeatedly.  The idea that the Tutsi want only to take complete control, restore the monarchy, restore the old system, undermine the gains of the revolution.  And, it is worth pointing out that, in fact, the RPF had nothing to do with the former monarchist movement and kept its distance, because it wasn't interested in a monarchy.  It was interested, of course, in political power, but not in restoring the king.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know how widely this document was circulated in 1992? 
A.	The orders of the chief of staff were that the document was to be given -- that the content of the document was to be communicated to all members of the armed forces.  And I have no reason to believe that that was not done.  It was widely discussed in the months after September 1992 in the press and among people.  And I think that shows that it did, indeed, have wide dissemination and wide impact. 
Q.	Did it generate any criticism in the press at that time? 
A.	I do not recall specific articles, but, certainly, it did -- it was brought to the attention of human rights organisations.  And it was regarded as a very significant document at the time. 
Q.	Now, it seems from what you are saying that this document is rooted in a military commission and is connected with Habyarimana.  I would assume that means that it is connected to the MRND.  Can we attribute any portion of this document to any of the opposition parties?  Does it implicate the government at all, or is it just the MRND and the military that is implicated? 
A.	The document had an echo the next day in a press release issued not by the MRND, but by the CDR.  The CDR we have not spoken of yet.  That was a party established in March 1992.  The Coalition for the Defence of the Republic was its proper name.  And the CDR was very closely affiliated with the MRND.  And, occasionally, would publicise points of view that were too extreme for the MRND itself to espouse.  The day after this document was circulated by the chief of staff, the CDR issued a press release using very strong language along the same lines.  And in what appears to be an example of close coordination, the military document list a series of Tutsi by name as being enemies.  And two of those same names appear the next day in the press communique of the CDR political party. 
Q.	Do you know if there was any official response to the document by the MDR party or the PSD parties, or the other parties that were together with any coalition government -- if you know, please? 
A.	I do not recall an official reaction to this document as such.  But approximately, two weeks after the document was issued, there was a subsequent directive to the commanders of all military units, ordering them to prepare lists of those people under their command whom they regarded as supporters, or possible supporters of the enemy.  And that letter did elicit a very sharp official response by the prime minister who was, of course, a member of the MDR and, hence, of the opposition within the government, who wrote to the commander in chief after the first of year saying, "The time for 
	witch-hunts is over, and this is, obviously, not the correct way to proceed.  If there are people to be accused of betraying the nation, we have laws and we have procedures for doing that and drawing up lists on military bases is not the way to do it." 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you read a term in French in the ENI document that I would like to look at a bit.  You used the words -- or the document uses the (French spoken) partisans of the enemy.  There are other terms that were used in 1992 and 1993 and, thereafter, that evoke the same concept.  And here I am thinking of the word "accomplice" in English.  It is same words in French, "accomplice" and the word Ibyitso and Icyitso.  Could you distinguish those words or those terms for us and tell us if they are linked in anyway to the concept of partisan of the enemy as it is mentioned in that document? 
A.	In Kinyarwanda, the term is Icyitso, I-C-Y-I-T-S-O, in the singular, Ibyitso in the plural.  And it was a term equivalent to the idea of an accomplice or partisan and was used interchangeably with that term in the propaganda of the period.  It was a term used to criticise and to stigmatise those members of opposition political parties who supported the Arusha Accords, and who were said to be supporters of the RPF.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	I would like you to discuss two events that took place in November of 1992.  They both were public speeches that were made by MRND affiliated leaders.  One by Habyarimana in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November and other by Leon Mugesera on the 22nd of November 1992.  What was the impact of these speeches; how were they thought of at the time?  Do you have any thoughts yourself on the impact of those two particular events with hindsight?  But, first, we would like to understand how those speeches were appreciated in context? 
A.	I spoke yesterday about the heavy and competing pressure on President Habyarimana, pressure from within the ranks of the army among his own close circle, pushing him back away from the peace process.  And at the same time, great pressure from outside, particularly from the donor nations that were provided essential financing to advance in the direction of negotiations.  This led to his adopting a zigzag course; where he would give something and try to take it back, because he was trying to deal with so many conflicting pressures.  

I mentioned a few minutes ago that the letter of the chief of military intelligence at the end of July, threatened a coup against the newly -- relatively newly installed coalition government.  And, in fact, there was an aborted coup in October.  The next in these series of events in the zigzag nature were these two speeches in November.  The first one on November 15th by President Habyarimana, himself, who spoke of the Arusha Accords with destain, as a piece of paper, something that did not have to be taken seriously.  
The reaction to that was one of extreme concern on the part of the diplomatic community.  And I remember being in Kigali not long after that, and having several diplomats involved -- who were involved in the peace process say to me, "It is difficult to maintain confidence in this process when the president himself has given the signal that what he agreed to in August is no longer taken seriously in November."

The week following that, a linguist, highly educated professor at the university, who had subsequently become part of the government administration, a man who had a doctorate from a Canadian university and who was vice president of the MRND in the northwestern préfecture of Gisenyi, in other words, a man of enormous importance in terms of his rank and prestige, gave a speech, which, by its crudity and the violence of its language drew immediate attention.  

In this speech he spoke of the failure of the 1959 revolution being the fact of having allowed Tutsi to escape the country.  In other words, not having finished the job.  And he, in one passage, called for sending the Tutsi back to Abyssinia.  This was the reference we made yesterday with the idea that the Tutsi came from outside; they came from the northeast.  And he said they should be sent home by the river route.  Now, what did that mean?  

The river which passed through this region of Rwanda eventually feeds into the Nile, and, therefore, goes back up into northeastern Africa.  But we are not talking about someone taking a boat back home.  We are talking about the practice begun in the years of the 1960s of slaughtering Tutsi and throwing their bodies in the river.  So sending the Tutsi home by the river route was a call for killing them, throwing their bodies in the river, and disposing of them that way.  And in case the point were not clear, the speech concluded with a phrase, "Remember, the person whose throat you do not cut, will cut yours."  So, sounding the theme again of self-defense, you are justified in using violence against this enemy because this enemy has the intention of harming you, and perhaps wiping you out.

The speech also was violent against members of the MDR, another Hutu-led political party, because it was given in one of those border regions where MRND and MDR were fighting for control.  And the language of the speech also called for violence against any MDR partisans who came into the area to try to establish their party there.

This speech, parts of which were broadcast on the radio, caused an immediate reaction.  And the minister of justice, who was of the opposition MDR party, issued an immediate warrant for the arrest of this speaker.  But with the assistance of various soldiers, he managed to escape from Rwanda and ended up in Canada, where his case has finally just been adjudicated by the Canadian supreme court with the finding that the speech was, indeed, an incitement to violence, and that this man has no right to claim -- to be a political refugee in Canada.

THE WITNESS: (continuing)
Another member of the MRND party, who was an intellectual and college professor, also reacted to the speech at the time by writing a letter of reproach to his colleague and saying, "You, as a linguist, you who know the power of words, how could you possibly make such a speech?"  So this was regarded as -- at the time as well as in retrospect -- as a brutal call for violence against Tutsi, as well as against members of opposition political parties.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you've just described criticism of the Mugesera speech by the opposition.  Did the Habyarimana speech -- did the Habyarimana speech of the 15th of November generate any similar type of criticism from the political opposition? 
A.	It did and there was criticism, of course, that Habyarimana was giving a signal to his own partisans that they could back away from this arrangement; that it was not, in fact, an arrangement that bound the government because the MRND was not in accord with it.  

But in the next few weeks, there was some very strong language used by the MRND, then very close to the CDR, the two of them together basically calling this arrangement thus far made by the negotiators at Arusha as an act of treason.  But then in a swing back in the other direction, in January of 1993, Habyarimana signed another protocol, another of the part of the Arusha agreements confirming the division of political power with the internal opposition and the RPF.  So he pursues this -- this zigzag course throughout the period of 1992 up until the time of the genocide, obviously beleaguered on both sides and unsure which course to follow. 
Q.	I believe yesterday that you stated you were a member of an international commission of inquiry that investigated human rights abuses in Rwanda.  When was that because it seems as if it's beginning to coincide with the events that you are describing now?  Can you tell us how you participated in that commission, what its mandate was and what its findings were? 
A.	The international commission of inquiry into human rights abuse in Rwanda since October 1990, was an ad hoc commission created by several human rights organisations:  The Inter-African Union of Human Rights and People's Rights based in Ouagadougou; the Canadian Centre for Human Rights; the Defence of Human Rights and Democracy based in Canada; the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues based in Paris, and Human Rights Watch based in New York. 

Those four organisations put together an ad hoc group of lawyers and area regional specialists who conducted inquiries in Rwanda in January of 1993, and documented the existence of mass graves in north-western Rwanda, graves of Bagogwe, victims of earlier periods of violence, and documented other abuses of human rights carried out by the Rwandan government as well as violations of the laws of war and human rights abuses on the side of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
Q.	Can you tell us when your report was issued? 
A.	The report was issued March the 8th, 1993.  
Q.	Did anything transpire between the time that you undertook your investigation and the issuing of the report -- anything of significance for Rwanda's political development? 
A.	As I mentioned, the Habyarimana government along with, of course, the other members of the government had signed another of the Arusha protocols in early January and this had created considerable opposition with the MRND and CDR political parties. 

As we arrived in Rwanda in early January, there were reports of killings of Tutsi and members of the political opposition and in, at least, one of those places, members of the commission were told that the violence had been halted because of the presence of the international commission in the country, and that people had been told that they could resume killing the Tutsi once the international commission left.  And, in fact, as the commission members were en route to the airport to leave the country, the news came of the renewed assault against Tutsi civilians and Bagogwe civilians, particularly in north-western Rwanda.  So that this new series of killings added to the pattern described previously of assaults against Tutsi civilians. 

Those killings had ended by the end of January.  But on February the 8th, the RPF violated the ceasefire and launched a new massive military advance across an entire spectrum of the -- of the northern part of Rwanda and moved rapidly southward until they were finally stopped with the assistance of French troops. 

But that massive movement -- that massive RPF advance in early February, caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people to such an extent that for a brief period of time about one million people or one-seventh of the national population were displaced. 

Under international pressure, the RPF pulled back to its earlier positions and a buffer zone was established.  But that military advance was of enormous importance in two ways.  First of all, it convinced the French that the Rwandan army could never withstand a concerted RPF attack without French support, and it caused the French to reconsider and to decide they no longer wanted to provide that support.  And so, this then led to the increasing vulnerability of the -- of the Rwandan government and of the Rwandan army as they became aware of this French decision not to support them. 

The second important impact of this RPF advance was that it drove a wedge between the RPF and certain members of the internal political opposition parties that had previously supported it. 
If you recall yesterday, we talked about the creation of the RPF's collaboration with the MDR, the PSD, and the PL in June of 1992.  Well, by Jan -- by February 1993, with this advance of the RPF, some of those members -- some members of those other political parties began to seriously question the sincerity and intentions of the RPF and began to pull back from that cooperation. 

This was the beginning of what would be a long process of increasing division within opposition political parties that would end finally with October 1993, some eight or nine months later, with the creation of Hutu Power.  So this was the beginning of that dissolution of the third bloc -- of the three blocs that were taken as the building blocks for the Arusha Accords and would result in the complete bipolarisation with the fatal consequences that it had at the time of the genocide.  And the first step in that new reorganisation of the political scene was the reaction to the RPF political -- military advance.  And indeed, a person important in the RPF at that time told me February 8th was a great military vic -- military victory, but it was a political catastrophe.  
Q.	Can you tell us when the Arusha Accords was finally concluded?  Do we have a date or a period in which we can say the Arusha Accords had been finalised and the stage had been set for political transition?  
A.	August 4, 1993. 
Q.	And now, you mentioned October 1993 as the birth of Hutu Power.  Can you perhaps explain a bit more what you mean by Hutu Power and what the impact of that was for the future of the Arusha Accords?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Just a moment, please.  Can I just ask that on this area things are taken particularly slowly and carefully. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.  I didn't have my -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
May I just request that on this area things are taken slowly, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So Dr. Des Forges, we will take it inch by inch because what interests me, and I think what's essential for the trial of André Rwamakuba is understanding how the political opposition was split and what the ramifications of that were.  So when we get to October of 1993, we have an MDR party that is split into two halves.  How did that split occur and what were the ultimate ramifications of the MDR party splitting in October of 1993?  
A.	The process of division within the MDR and other parties began essentially with that RPF attack in February of 1993.  That was the first symbolic event.  The second was the period surrounding the accords themselves and the contest over who would have the position of prime minister in the government that was to be created as a result of the accords, the transitional government.  And the third event, which we'll get to in a moment, is the assassination of the Burundian president, Melchior Ndadaye, N-D-A-D-A-Y-E. 

So we've dealt with the first.  Now, if we look for a moment at the second.  This was a period of incredible dynamism and political competition.  There was a lot of fluidity; a lot of opportunity for advancement, for ambition and for losing out.  

Political actors, many of whom espoused political programmes that were essentially very similar, differentiated themselves in part for personal gain.  So some of what transpires during this period is really an unseemly scramble for position and for the opportunity to advance. 

The MDR party, as I have described it, was the greatest potential challenger to the MRND.  It was in the interests of the MRND to weaken the MDR by any possible means.  It appears that the RPF may also have seen an interest and, at least, temporarily cooperating with Habyarimana in his attempt to weaken the MDR. 

The struggle within the MDR came to a head at the end of July 1993, just before the final version of the accords were signed, and the issue was essentially a decision taken by Faustin Twagiramungu to put himself and his people in control in the MRND slots to be allocated under the Arusha Accords. 
This was contested by another part of the party led essentially by Froduald Karamira, K-A-R-A-M-I-R-A, and Donat Murego, M-U-R-E-G-O. 

The ideological explanation for their separation -- the separation of these two parts of the party -- had to do with their interpretation of the Arusha Accords and the desirability of continued close collaboration with the RPF, the Karamira-Murego wing of the party, holding that the MDR should step back from this collaboration, while the Twagiramungu wing wanted to proceed in close alliance with the old coalition, including the RPF. 

The MDR held a party congress at the end of July at which point they disavowed and even expelled Twagiramungu, and this made concrete and explicit the division within the party.  Subsequently, there was a similar kind of division within the Liberal Party, which came to an open split.  With the PSD, the division was never as clear cut, but there were serious strains that were more or less papered over in the interests of party unity up until the period of April 6.  But this whole question of how far to go in terms of accepting a continued relationship with the RPF became the central breaking point along which parties divided. 

But, in addition, there was, as I have said, the personal ambition of various actors in terms of who stood -- with which side did one stand a better chance of getting the post one wanted.  And in addition to this, actors from the MRND, including President Habyarimana himself, were stirring the pot because it was in their interest to stimulate this type of internal dissension among those whom he identified as political rivals.  So that then meant there was this sharp clash inside the MDR at the end of July, and the two parts of the party never came together again.  

At the end of October, the president of Burundi was assassinated.  He was the first Hutu president, freely and fairly elected the previous June, and he was assassinated by Tutsi soldiers.  The political history of Burundi was quite different from that of Rwanda, and until June 1993, the Tutsi remained dominant in the army in the political system, in the economic system.  So the victory of a Hutu president in the first free and fair presidential contest of that kind was considered an enormously hopeful and promising sign, including for many Rwandans, because with previous violence inside Burundi hundreds of thousands of Burundians had been refugees in Rwanda, particularly in the southern part of Rwanda, and had developed connections, friendships with Rwandans.  So Rwandans also, in a sense, saw the victory of Ndadaye as a victory for Hutu and including Rwandan Hutu and, naturally enough, saw his assassination as a serious blow to their hopes of seeing a Hutu political control emerge in Burundi. 

The -- by this time, the partisans of the MRND and CDR had created a radio to put forward their points of view.  This was Radio RTLM, Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines.  The radio had been founded, in part, because the -- with the establishment of a multi-party government, a ministry of information had been created, which was to control the national radio.  And that ministry of information was in the hands of the MDR. 

So that with the beginning of multi-party politics, the national radio, which had been a big propaganda arm of the MRND, was called into line to be a more neutral media form; in part, to counter that loss of the radio waves in terms of the national radio; in part, to counter the establishment of an RPF radio, which had been broadcasting from the outer regions of the country.  

The MRND and CDR created a radio for themselves and that was Radio RTLM.  It began broadcasting shortly after the final signature of August 1993.  But it really took on its clearly virulent anti-Tutsi tone in October and particularly after the assassination of Ndadaye.  It broadcast inflammatory speeches and inflammatory reports, which were inaccurate, including accounts that Ndadaye had been mutilated -- his body had been mutilated; his eyes had been gauged out; that he had been castrated, which was a detail that carried enormous significance in the Rwandan context, because in historical times, the Tutsi king used to decorate the royal drum with the genitalia of defeated Hutu rulers.  So the idea that here you have a new Hutu president, freely and fairly elected, who was killed by Tutsi soldiers and then you say he's been castrated, well, that calls up a whole range of sentiments and emotions on the part of the Hutu listeners. 

But it wasn't true; it was simply untrue.  I was part of a commission in Burundi that did an autopsy and determined the cause of death of President Ndadaye, and his body was in no way mutilated or castrated.  So this heightened considerably the atmosphere of ethnic tension.  And it did in two ways:  One, for the Tutsi, the -- let me go back a step.  After the assassination of Ndadaye, tens of thousands of Tutsi were killed in Burundi.  This then was followed by massive reprisals against Hutu by the Tutsi army.  So you had massacres that killed tens of thousands of civilians in Burundi starting at the end of October. 

The Tutsi saw the killings of Tutsi -- the Rwandan Tutsi saw the killing of Tutsi in Burundi as a demonstration of what could, in fact, happen to them, and they then used that to -- that then led to an increased sense of the need for protection.  Conversely, the Hutu saw this as one more proof of the Tutsi perfidy; the Tutsi deception, and saw it as an indicator that eventual Tutsi cooperation and power sharing in Rwanda would lead to the same result -- that is, the Hutu would be wiped out and the Tutsi would remain in control.  

The second important part of this was that there was no international reaction.  The international community intervened to the extent of getting the Tutsi military to return to their barracks.  And instead of their remaining openly in control, after having killed the president, they created a strong government of civilians essentially at their designation.  This is a pattern which, of course, is repeated whether deliberately or not.  It is the same pattern essentially of April 6th, 1994 when the president and 
prime minister are killed.  There is an attempt made at establishing a military government, partly under international pressure, that collapses and a civilian government is put in place, essentially called into being by the military forces. 

The other part of this was that there was no international consequence for the massacres.  The killings of civilians in Burundi passed basically unnoticed and unpunished, and that was a lesson that was referred to explicitly by RTLM during the period of the Rwandan genocide. 
Q.	If I can interrupt for one second -- you can complete that thought and then I'll ask another question.  
A.	I was going to say that the assassination of the Burundian president was followed several days later -- very soon after by a massive political rally at Amahoro stadium in Kigali where Karamira, the MDR political leader, announced Hutu Power in a very -- in a very dramatic speech, inciting to violence, reminding people of the heritage of the 1959 revolution, saying very explicitly, "We are not here just to heat up heads.  We are not here just to talk; we must have action."  

And at the end of his speech the acclamations of the crowd saying, "Hutu Power, Hutu Power, Hutu Power, MRND Power, MDR Power, Hutu Power", and the coming together under that umbrella, after that particular rally of those parts of the MDR, the PL and eventually the PSD, who were affiliated with the Hutu Power ideology.
Q.	Actually, part of your answer supplanted my question.  I was about to ask you how public was the split in the MDR.  Well, you've just described this public rally in October, was the split at the party congress in July a public event?  How well-known was that throughout the population?  Was this something that was simply internal to the MDR? 
A.	It was highly publicised.  Everyone new about it, including the various shifts in position, the fact that Madam Uwilingiyimana had resigned from her -- from the nominated post of prime minister and then eventually taking up that post and so on.  This was all well covered on the radio and in newspapers. 
Q.	With respect to André Rwamakuba, do you know what wing or where he was situated ideologically within the MDR in July or thereafter? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I'm afraid I have to object to that question.  Under Rule 94, you are entitled to be given notice of what this witness will testify about.  We were supplied with a report; that report deals with the generalities of the conflict in Rwanda.  It does not deal with this witness's personal knowledge of Dr. André Rwamakuba.  We have no notice whatsoever that this witness is to testify personally with regard to the activities of Dr. André Rwamakuba. 

Indeed, at the status conference in March of this year, when I was making my first noises about transcripts, Mr. Webster indicated that this witness was being called for context.  That is how the Defence has understood the position.  That is where we are today.  We are in front of a witness that, as far as we're concerned and we've always been put on notice that that is the case, that this is a witness for context.  There is nothing in the report about Dr. André Rwamakuba and, therefore, I object to this line of questioning.  The Defence has been misled. 

If I may just add, Rule 94 bis makes it quite explicitly clear that the Defence is entitled to the full statement of any expert witness at least 90 days before the witness testifies.  That what my learned friend is about to embark on now is a highly significant matter on which we, if -- if there was an intention to pursue it, we should have been put on notice. 

And may I add that this is not something which is just coming out of the witness's mouth; this is something which the Prosecution is deliberately leading from the witness and has given us no notice at all of.  I object strongly to this, Your Honours. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think Mr. O'Shea knows full well that we provided an expert report from this witness.  It was filed on a timely basis; it was provided for context.  But the witness is before us as an historian, and I would think that in that capacity I could ask her any question about the recent history of Rwanda and she can respond on the spot.

I have no idea, quite frankly, how the witness is even going to respond to this question.  But if the Court deems the question inappropriate, we will look at some documents and then we will put some documents before the witness and she can analyse the documents and answer the questions to the best of her ability.  And in preparation for that, may I direct the witness to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it's 10:30.  
MR WEBSTER:
-- tab 2 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it's 10:30.  It's about time for a morning break.  It's 10:30 now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Should we break at such a dramatic moment, Your Honour?  It seems like this is a good time to look at an issue and make a decision, and then we can come back and address it after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I'm more interested in keeping temperatures down. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think this is a very cool debate, quite frankly.  If the Court finds the questions to be inappropriate, I will rephrase it.  But this is an issue that I think I'm entitled to go into, and I will go into it through documentary sources if the witness is not allowed to answer on the basis of her independent knowledge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, just as a general -- general comment at this stage, I think that Mr. O'Shea's point should be well taken in that one would expect that the requirement of notice about what a witness will testify about should be complied with.  It's one thing amplifying a witness statement.  It's another thing addressing a subject matter, which is not contained in the statement.  And so, that's one -- one issue. 

Secondly, I was a bit surprised that you said that you didn't know what the witness was going to say and yet you asked the question.  That is also another reason for not necessarily allowing that line of examination to be pursued, because one would expect that the witness conform to the outline that -- in which notice had been given. 

This not really a history class; we are doing a case, which is limited by the indictment.  And so I would certainly not permit a general examination of recent history of Rwanda; I would not consider that relevant at all. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That I understand, Your Honour, but this question could not be more closely aligned with the indictment.  The indictment -- it is particularly André Rwamakuba's political ideology that -- that brings the issue straight on point with the indictment.  And if the question is inappropriate, which is, I believe, is what the Court is saying, allow me to proceed with another question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What the Court is saying is it's time for a mid-morning break. 

I will rule after the break, but you have got an idea of my perception of the law. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I do.  Thank you. 
(Court recessed at 1035H to 1103H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now. 

Mr. Webster, we think we have to disallow the question on two grounds:  One, that no notice was given of this -- of this line of inquiry from this witness, so there would be a breach of the rules requiring disclosure at an early stage of what the witness will be adducing evidence about. 

And there's the other issue, which some reference was made, which is also -- also of concern to us was the -- the basis upon which this testimony is being offered.  And there was no prior indication of the witness being called as an expert on the issue of Rwamakuba personally. 

So those -- I know -- I don't anticipate that is what you're actually doing, but I think I should mention that at this stage as -- as you proceed.  Because we would prefer -- as you know, we would prefer you to self-monitor than for me to have to constantly get involved. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll respect the -- the Court's direction, but I would, however, point to page 28 of Dr. Des Forges' expert report.  This is a portion of the report where she is talking about the interim government and there's a sentence in the first full paragraph that reads:

"The interim government presented by Bagasora to the military officers for their approval seemed in accord with the terms of the April 1992 agreement under which previous coalition governments had been formed, but it violated the spirit of the agreement because the persons chosen represented a single point of view, that of Hutu Power." 

Now with a sentence like that in her expert report, I -- I find it difficult to understand why the Defence has a problem on the issue of notice. 

I can reformulate the question, but this is an issue that I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have the report before me.  Is it page 28? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm looking at page 28 of the English language report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have the English language report before me. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Page 28, the first full paragraph at the top of the page; it's the last sentence of that first full paragraph, and I'll read it a bit slower.  I may have been too fast before for the interpreters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I have it now.  But you can read it again, if you may.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm assuming I went too fast, so:  "The interim government presented by Bagasora to the military officers for their approval seemed in accord with the terms of the April 1992 agreement under which previous coalition governments had been formed, but it violated the spirit of the agreement because the persons chosen represented a single point of view, that of Hutu Power." 

And then when we look at the indictment itself, we can turn to the first paragraph in the indictment.  The last line of that first paragraph where it states:  "André Rwamakuba also served as spokesman for the interim government and was a member of MDR party associated with that party's Hutu Power wing." 

And continue to paragraph 3 of the indictment, where it reads:  "Following an extraordinary congress of MDR" -- excuse me -- "Following an extraordinary congress of MDR political party held at Kabusunzu in Kigali on or about the 26th of July, 199" --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, please, sorry, slowly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Became associated --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The translator is requesting a slower pace.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin again.  Paragraph 3 of the indictment, I'm reading from the English:  "Following an extraordinary congress of MDR political party held at Kabusunzu in Kigali on or about 26th July 1993, André Rwamakuba became associated with the party's extremist Hutu Power wing as a member of its executive team along with Froduald Karamira, a leader of the party and Jean Kambanda, a leading politician who had subsequently become prime minister of the interim government of 8 April 1994." 

On -- on the issue of notice, notice to the Defence is not simply -- is not limited to what is in a witness statement.  It's to allow the Defence to prepare their defence globally. 

For me, it's beyond dispute that the Defence has been placed on notice that André Rwamakuba was being accused of being a member of the Hutu Power wing of the MDR party, and that an allusion to that appears even in Dr. Des Forges' expert report, so this is not a notice issue.  But I can address the question by other means and what I would like to do or what I propose to do is to have Dr. Des Forges look at an exhibit and she can bring her historic -- her expert opinion and her historical analysis to a document that is already in evidence,. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it is clear from the indictment that it is alleged that the Accused, Rwamakuba, was a member of the MDR Hutu Power wing.  That's a clear allegation in the indictment.  

What was not clear was that this witness was going to talk about that.  And so, the issue really was have the Defence been put in a position to prepare themselves to address that issue during the context of this witness's testimony. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The question that I was attempting to put to the witness had to do with whether it was apparent that André Rwamakuba became a member or was associated with the Hutu Power wing of MDR in July or October of 1993, and that's the portion of the question that I was unsure whether the witness had sufficient knowledge independently to answer.   

But the issue of whether he is member of Hutu Power in April is clearly indicated in her expert report because she characterises the entire interim government as a government of Hutu Power, and he's a member of that government.  And that is also clear, not only in terms of an admission from the Defence in terms with their -- our common statement of uncontested facts, but because there is other documentation that is in evidence that lists him as a member of that government, and she has characterised that government in her report.  

So I don't -- I -- I still would submit to Your Honour that this is not an issue of notice, but I can approach it differently. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that solves the issue for now. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So picking up again, Madam Des Forges, and we're not going to dwell on this, and if you do not have an independent basis to confirm or deny the information we're looking at in these documents, please -- please say so and we'll move on to something else.  
But I would like to direct your attention -- I'd like to begin by asking you with respect to this extraordinary congress of the MDR that was held in July of 1993, would it be fair to describe or to characterise that congress as itself a breaking point in the MDR party?  Was the congress itself organised to split the party or -- an indicia of the split, or was it a context in which matters were debated which subsequently led to the split? 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, I'm not going to raise a specific objection to this question, but I notice Mr. Webster's methodology in his questioning.  

I'm going to allow him to -- to put this question, but I'd like to ask him, please, to observe the rules of court with regard to leading questions.  This is an intelligent witness.  She does not need that kind of assistance.  Mr. Webster can put his questions in the form of open questions, but in the context that we've just past through, I'm now very wary of leading questions.  I wasn't before, but I am now and I'd therefore ask him to -- to stick to the rules. 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, this not a witness of fact, this is an expert witness.  Her report has already been handed up to the Court.  The debate over whether the question should be leading or direct questions, that really is not appropriate for this witness.  But I understand your concern and I simply would request that the witness respond to my question, and we'll move on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, even an expert witness can be asked a question which is leading.  Now, the -- the effect of a leading question on an expert witness may not be as dramatic as it would be on a witness of fact.  But as a matter of law, even an expert witness can be asked a leading question.  And it's really not necessary.  I don't know understand why this debate is necessary at all.  I'm quite certain that the witness is capable of answering questions -- you should not put in that format to provide the testimony that she came to give. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I'll move on. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, do you recall the question? 
A.	Yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  The congress was called as a way of working out the conflict, which already existed within the party.  It was a kind of showdown among people who had already chosen their positions.  But because it resulted not in a resolution of their differences, but rather than in an open split between the two parts, it became, in addition to that, a further symbol of the dissension in the party and cause of resentment between the two different wings of the party. 
Q.	Would an attendance list of those who participated in that extraordinary congress be indicia of their ideology with respect to the split?  
A.	It is likely to be the case, yes.  Not necessarily for every single person, but it is likely to be the case, yes. 
Q.	If you were to look at an attendance list for that extraordinary congress of July 1993 and the name André Rwamakuba appeared on that list, would you be able to draw -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, there's an objection.  I'm sorry, I think we're back to square one.  This witness has not been called at an expert on Dr. André Rwamakuba.  That is the issue. 

So Mr. Webster, you know, what he's effectively trying to do is he's trying to do exactly what I'm complaining about in different ways.  I would ask him to take the ethical position:  Understand the issue is that this witness is not an expert on Dr. André Rwamakuba and proceed in the way that he has led us to believe up until now he was going to proceed with this witness.
(Pages 12 to 24 by Jean Baigent)

























1115H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, your question did ask for an opinion about doctor -- Dr. Rwamakuba.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm asking the witness for her opinion on the nature of the congress that was held in July of 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was nothing wrong with that question, but then you went specifically and asked for an opinion about Dr. Rwamakuba.  And that is what's being objected to.  And it's also leading.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
May I have the court officer provide the witness with P. 6 in evidence, please.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, can you give us the reference in our bundles, please?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I do not have the reference for P. 6.  If you'll hold on one second.  

I have it as item number 24 on the Prosecutor's exhibit list.  I believe it would be in volume II.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Second volume?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's actually -- I think it's listed as 24 and 24A. 24 is a type-written document and 24A is a handwritten list.  But I believe they were admitted together as P. 6 and P. 6A. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, just for clarification, I'd made certain assumptions as to what your position was, but I should ask you, just for clarification, are you saying that this witness is being set up as an expert on 
Dr. Rwamakuba?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The witness is called as a witness on the history of the Great Lakes --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Right.  And the history of -- the recent history of Rwanda, at least in the last --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.
MR. WEBSTER:
-- the one hundred years, with an expertise in human rights violations in the Great Lakes region, specifically Rwanda, and the genocide in Rwanda.  And I would think that the split in the MDR party would fall within those parameters 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not sure if the witness has that before her.  Was it given to the witness?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	With respect to the document, P. 6, would you read the title of the document, please, and what is mentioned at the top of the page? 
A.	I've been given two documents, document 24, which is a typewritten document.  It's headed congres national extraordinaire du MDR du 24 juliet novembre 3, 1993.  The other document is a handwritten document entitled liste de participant congres -- MDR congres national du 23 juliet '93. 
Q.	I'd like to direct your attention to the second page of that second document that you mentioned, the handwritten document.  I'm looking at the page that has the K number K0504032.  
A.	I have that page. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That -- which K number is that again, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's P. 6A and it was identified in our bundle as 24A. So the exhibit list number from the Prosecutor is 24A, but exhibit number under which it was admitted is P. 6A.  And I'm looking at page 2.  It bears 
K number K0504032, and I'm asking the witness to direct her attention to number 19 on that list.  
THE WITNESS: 
I see number 19.  It is handwritten, "Dr. Rwamakuba, André, Gikomero," followed by what appears to be a signature.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And can you tell us what is at the top of that list?  How is the list itself on that particular page identified? 
A.	This page is headed "MDR, Kigali-Ngali, congres du 23 juliet '93, which would be MDR for Kigali-rural. 
Q.	Now, Dr. Des Forges, based on your knowledge of Rwandan history and your familiarity with this particular chapter and its history, could you draw any conclusions, any -- or any reasonable conclusions that you could draw with regard to the ideological position of someone, such as André Rwamakuba, whose name appears on the attendant list for this particular congress? 
MR. O'SHEA: 
The court is going to start losing patients with me, but --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not, that's not necessary.  

Mr. Webster, that is exactly the same question and it's also leading in the context of this witness on this issue.  It's completely unnecessary to push a matter of this kind.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Right, I will move onto another -- another issue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	With respect to the Arusha Accords, Dr. Des Forges, can you tell of -- can you tell us if they were ever implemented in any way? 
A.	The accords were a complex series of protocols, some of which were implemented or implemented in part, and others of which were not.  They called for -- for example, for the installation of a broad-based transitional government, and in -- the first stage of that provision, was fulfilled by the swearing in of Juvènal Habyarimana as president under the term of Arusha Accords in January of 1994.  But the rest of that part of the accord having to do with the completion of the swearing in of the new government, was never implemented.  In the same way, some initial steps were made in terms of integration of the armed forces and disarmament of the city of Kigali, which was declared a weapons-free zone but, in fact, the arms remained there and the integration of the armed forces was never carried to completion. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the timetable was for implementing the broad-based transitional government under the terms of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	The timetable was very short calling for the implementation within a period of weeks, and for the arrival of a UN peacekeeping force to guarantee the terms of the accords -- or, rather, to facilitate the implementation of the terms of the accords.  But, in fact, the process became stalled relatively early on, and the peacekeepers came late and fewer number and the -- in the meantime, with the killing of the president of Burundi and the clear formation of Hutu-Power on the side of President Habyarimana, the paralysis between the -- what became two blocks, prevented any effective movement forward towards the final implementation of the agreement. 
Q.	Were there any ramifications for -- with the swearing of President Habyarimana as the first step?  What was result, politically speaking, of his taking the oath of office? 
A.	With his taking the oath of office, of course, the first step suggested that other steps would follow, but, in fact, the attempt to swear in members of the assembly was impeded immediately after the swearing of the president by forces of Hutu-Power militia in combination with soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces, so that those members of the assembly were not sworn in.  And a second attempt in the same vain also failed.  This meant that the government had as its head, someone who had been sworn in under the accords, but that the rest of the government remained in limbo.  And this made it extremely difficult to come to any agreement on steps forward in the peace process 
Q.	Can you tell us -- we are going to start to look at the events of April 1994.  Can you tell us what you know about the 6th of April?  What was happening on that -- at that time, please? 
A.	Given the apparent paralysis in the peace process, a number of leaders of government of surrounding countries called for a meeting in Dar-es-salaam, normally to discuss conflicts in Burundi, but, in fact, also to attempt to resolve the stalemate inside of Rwanda.  The donor nations at the same time increased very much their pressure on both sides to move ahead and to resolve one of the outstanding issues, which was the question of the possible seat to be attributed in the assembly to the CDR political party.  

The CDR had initially disavowed the accords, had not participated in the peace arrangements and had refused to be bound by it.  But after January, the Hutu-Power group and President Habyarimana, began to see a need to get the CDR into the assembly in order to create a two-thirds majority which would allow them -- or in order to prevent a creation of a parliamentary situation, which could lead to a possible impeachment of Habyarimana.  He became very concerned that he could himself be brought to justice for killings that he had ordered in the past.  So a great deal of attention became focussed on getting the CDR seated, even though it had not previously been party to the peace accord.  And with the decision of the international community to, in effect, back that arrangement, Habyarimana was said to have been persuaded to agree to moving forward with the actual swearing in of the government.  

This agreement supposedly was settled at a meeting at Dar es Salaam on the evening of April the 6th, and Habyarimana flew home to Rwanda, in company with the then president of Burundi, and various other dignitaries of his government.  The plane was shot down as it approached Kigali airport at approximately 8:24 in the evening on April the 6th, and all passengers aboard were killed.  

In the immediate aftermath, a small number of military officers came together to discuss the situation.  At that point, Colonel Bagosora who attempted to assert control over the process, was discouraged by others -- for what reason, we are not absolutely sure except it seems that there were perhaps some questions about his competence or his intentions -- and the -- at the same time, members of elite military units took to the streets and began killing, initially Tutsi, who were identified by name and on lists, and members of the political opposition as well.  Barriers were put up throughout much of the city impeding the movement of ordinary people.  And shortly after, a curfew was declared which required ordinary people to stay in their houses.  

But despite these regulations, the Interahamwe and others who joined with them, and certain soldiers, were out on the streets beginning assassinations of politicians opposed to the MRND, as well as the killing of Tutsi. 
Q.	Did there come a time that a government was assembled after the 6th of April? 
A.	On the 7th of April, a larger group of military officers came together and agreed, once again, that a military coup was inappropriate, and created a crisis committee, which was charged with making contact with political leaders in order to arrive at some formulation, which would allow for the installation of a civilian government.  

Those contacts were made on the morning of April the 8th and by later that day a government had been constituted and was presented by the military to the larger group -- by the crisis committee to the larger of military officers.  

The -- in the interim, the centre event had been the assassination of the prime minister, as well as of other leaders from the MDR party and from the PL and PSD parties.  In effect, through this programme of targeted assassinations, the military eliminated those political leaders who were known to be opposed to Hutu-Power as an ideology and opposed to Habyarimana as a person, by selecting the targets to include potential speakers of the national assembly, two of them, the president of the Supreme Court, who ordinarily would swear in members of the government, and various ministers, as well as the prime minister.  These military officers, directing these actions and the civilians who were certainly in collaboration with them, effectively made it impossible for a continuation of the 
	Arusha Accords -- or the implementation of the Arusha Accords as designed in August 1993. 
Q.	I'd like us to take a few moments to look at some of the documentations that was temporaneously generated.  Can we direct our attention to P. 7 in evidence.  It's listed as number 20A on the Prosecutor's exhibit list.  

I think, Dr. Des Forges, you'd find it in tab 3 of your working binder.  So if you start with tab 3, we're going to look at a series of documents.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Which -- which of your bundles, please, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
In two is it -- is it number 2, the bundle?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, it is.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Looking at P. 7 in evidence, I believe there is a -- an English translation already, which is P. 7B.  What I have before me is the minutes of the meeting of the directeur de cabinet from the night of the 6th to the 7th.  Is that what you have in front of you, Dr. Des Forges? 
A.	It is. 
Q.	I would like to direct your attention to paragraph 5.  First of all, tell us if you've seen this document before, if you've ever examined it independently.  
A.	I have. 
Q.	And what do you understand its content to entail? 
A.	It is a brief memo of minutes of meeting -- of the meeting which I referred to a few moments ago that took place with a small group of military officers, chaired by Colonel Bagosora, who was then the directeur de cabinet of the ministry of defence on the evening of April 6th, shortly after Habyarimana's plane was shot down. 
Q.	Do you know what the objective of that meeting was? 
A.	The objective basically was to decide where to go from that point, who would take control, and how they would take control. 
Q.	Do you know what was decided during the course of that evening -- or that night in that meeting? 
A.	There was the initial attempt, as I say, by Colonel Bagosora to take control of the situation, some resistance by other military officers, and then finally, the position taken by General Dallaire who was the commander of the UN peacekeeping force, who was present at the meeting, basically saying that a military takeover could not be possible and encouraging the implementation of the Arusha Peace Accords.  

According to General Dallaire's testimony and to his written memoire, as well as conversations I have had with him, he recalls being particularly emphatic at that meeting in encouraging the military to immediately be in touch with the prime minister.  Because, of course, this was a government which included -- which was headed, not just by a president, but by a prime minister.  The prime minister was alive and well at that time and, was, in fact, once she was informed of the situation, planning to go to the radio, to the national radio, to make a statement to the nation about the situation.  But Bagosora vigorously refused to make contact with the prime minister, and those military officers supporting him, agreed with his position.  They characterised the prime minister as a traitor and, I believe, as a whore for the RPF, and they refused to grant her the legitimacy which was her right as the head of government. 
Q.	Do you know if the special representative of the secretary general, as part -- who is the head of the mission of UNAMIR, if he had any role to play as to how things should be handled that night? 
A.	At the insistence of General Dallaire, Colonel Bagosora and other officers agreed to go meet with the special representative of the Secretary General, Jac Roger Booh-Booh, who also reinforced the idea that there must be a civilian government established and to encourage the military officers to facilitate the establishment of that civilian government and particularly in implementing the Arusha Accords. 
Q.	Looking at what was placed before you or what we've identified for the record as P. 7, would this in any way document any of the things you've just mentioned or the intention that evening expressed by Mr. Booh-Booh? 
A.	I believe this document substantiates my conclusions that at the end of the night of April 6th, as a result of interactions with the UN commander and with the special representative of the secretary general, that the military had, in effect, been put on notice that the intention of the UN and the international committee was to continue to implement the Peace Accord and that the expectation was -- their desire was that this should be done by calling upon the prime minister in this situation as a head of government to carry forward the peace process. 
Q.	I'd like to direct our attention to what's been admitted as P. 8.  It is number 20B on our exhibit list.  It should also be in volume II, volume II.  I think it's the next document in your working bundle, 
	Dr. Des Forges.  

You mentioned a bit earlier that the prime minister had intended to address the nation.  Looking at what's been admitted in evidence as P. 8, can you tell us what actually transpired the next day in terms of how the nation was put on notice of the ongoing crisis? 
A.	This was a communiqué issued by Colonel Bagosora, who was then the director -- cabinet director for the ministry of defence to the nation, announcing the killing of President Habyarimana and others on the plane, and encouraging the population to remain steadfast and courageous and particularly encouraging the armed forces to remain vigilant to ensure the security of the population, and then directing the population to remain indoors, pending further instruction. 
Q.	Do you know when this communiqué was actually issued and how it was issued? 
A.	It was issued, I believe, by radio broadcast on the morning of April the 7th. 
Q.	Did the prime minister ever address the nation that morning? 
A.	She did not.  Her home was surrounded by soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces.  She attempted to flee at one point, trying to climb over the wall to the adjacent residence of an American diplomat, at another point taking refuge inside a UN facility, but she was eventually hunted down by late in the morning of April 7th and assassinated by soldiers of the Rwandan Armed Forces. 
Q.	Were there any other messages delivered to the nation that day from military authorities? 
A.	I believe there was a second communiqué issued later on the day of April the 7th as well. 
Q.	Do you recall what the content of that second communication was? 
A.	It was, again, a communication from Bagosora, basically asserting that the intention was to carry forward with an attempt to negotiate with the RPF with implementing the Peace Accords and, again, asking for the population to be vigilant and to ensure their own security. 
Q.	Do you know if anything transpired between those two communiqués that has any significance for Rwanda's political future? 
A.	It was during that period between the issuing of the two communiqués that the prime minister was assassinated.  Others were -- others of her political leaning were assassinated earlier in the day but it was only at about noontime that she was effectively found and killed. 
Q.	Did that second communiqué address the issue of the prime minister's death, of the death of other political figures? 
A.	I believe it did not refer specifically to the killing of the prime minister but, rather, suggested, or even stated that there were -- that there was government in place which was called upon to begin implementing the Peace Accords.  It was, of course, a colossal deception because it was issued by the same person who had given the orders for the assassination of the prime minister, as best we are able to determine, and had he not been the person to directly give those orders, he was certainly well aware of the fact that she was being hunted down for the purpose of assassinating her, and yet, he made a pretence, and this was an important pattern which occurred throughout the genocide, the authorities making a pretense of something that, in fact, was not the case.  And here there was a pretense made that there was government in place that could be called upon to carry forward the peace process, when, in fact, to the full knowledge of Bagosora and others, that government had been, to a large extent, exterminated. 
Q.	Is there any other documentation that you are aware of that would assist us in understanding how the government was assembled, how this civilian government was assembled on the 8th of April? 
A.	There are, of course, a number of statements of witnesses who were present at that time.  But in addition to that, there is the protocol signed by the members of political parties who constituted that new government. 
Q.	I'd like to address your attention to P. 10 in evidence, P. 10A and B.  A is the French text; B is the English text.  And these are the protocol -- the amended protocol that were signed on the 8th of April 1994.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Just some indications as to where we can find it, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This would be at -- it's identified as 20 D in the exhibit list.  It would be in volume II of your bundle.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, directing your attention to this document, bringing your expertise as a historian and your knowledge of the Rwandan context, what could you tell us about what was going on on the 8th of April simply by looking at the signatories to this document and the content of it? 
A.	If we begin at the top of the document, considering the critical situation of an institutional vacuum created by the tragic death of the president of the republic -- in fact, it was not an institutional vacuum until the prime minister was killed.  So the justification which is frequently put forward by members of that government and members of the military who assisted in facilitating the creation of that government was that there was vacuum and therefore they had to step forward and take control of the situation because nothing else was there and the country could not remain ungoverned.  But considering that the people who facilitated the establishment and who participated in the establishment of this interim government were the same people who were well aware of and probably responsible for the killing of the prime minister.  You see the ultimate cynicism of the formulation adopted here, and this is under line 20.  

When you go to the next paragraph, "Considering the sudden death of the prime minister and certain members of her government", the death of the president is tragic, the death of the prime minister is merely sudden.  And, again, considering the responsibility of the participants in this new government and in its military backing for that death, the cynicism that comes out of this formulation is evident.  
Then if you go onto the next paragraph, "Noting the wish expressed by the representatives of the PSD party because of the exceptional situation prevailing at the helm of this party."  There's a beautifully cynical formulation.  The actual fact is that the leadership at the national level of the PSD party had all been assassinated, so that was the exceptional situation being referred to here.  And what that meant was that the participants of the PSD were not the normal PSD representatives but they had to drop down a level and take a partial representation of the PSD in order create the appearance that this was the same kind of protocol, the same kind of arrangement that had been in existence since 1992.  They didn't want to vary that; they wanted it to look like everything was normal and legitimate.  

And then going down to Article 2 of the idea that the parties altogether would replace the deceased prime minister, and that the prime minister would then prepare the list of ministers and so and so forth.  But let's look at who the persons representing the parties are.  

If you consider the leadership of the MRND represented as signatories they are the same people who have been the leaders of the MRND over a period of at least a year and a half.  For the PSD, as I indicated, none of the top national leadership were available because they had been killed, so instead you have simply members of the political bureau signed by the PSD.  For the MDR, you have the two persons whom I have previously identified as being the leaders of the Hutu-Power wing of the MDR, and no representation whatsoever from that part of the MDR previously represented in similar agreements; namely, the part of the party represented by the assassinated prime minister, by 
	Faustin Twagiramungu, who had gone into hiding and by others on that side of the MDR.  So only one side of the MDR is represented, and it is the Hutu-Power side.  And then for the PDC, again, they have a problem because the senior leadership of the PDC had fled.  So those persons who came together and put their names on this document were people who shared, clearly, a single point of view in terms of Hutu-Power and in terms of the Arusha Accord.  

Now, let's look up under Article 4 and you'll see that the new government has set for itself three tasks.  One is ensuring effective continuation of government business with emphasis on the rapid re-establishment of order and security for persons and property.  

This is April the 8th, when Tutsi are being slaughtered already in large numbers in the city of Kigali and elsewhere in the country by the militia belonging to the MRND party, whose signatories are represented on this document, and by the armed forces -- members of the armed forces, who are the very people who have called these politicians together and said, "Make us a government."  

So, I think, again, this is one more example of the cynicism of these kinds of documents at this period and throughout this period with the government attempting -- the interim government attempting with these party leaders who were to form that government, attempting to stress an atmosphere of normality, of legitimacy, of the re-establishment of order and security when they know full well that their army and the militia associated with them are in the process of killing large numbers of civilians.  

And then the second one, "Continued discussions with the RPF for the setting up of the transitional institutions".  Again, this is a -- a cynical ploy to attempt to portray themselves as anxious to resume the peace process, when in fact, they had decided to do something different.  

And then C, which is perhaps the only sincere and effectively authentic statement of their intentions, to attempt to deal with the food shortage and to assist people who have been displaced by the war.  So it is a, in my view, a carefully crafted document, one put forward as a smoke-screen for the reality of the situation 
Q.	Now, that protocol preceded the actual swearing in of the government.  Am I right in saying that? 
A.	It did by one day.  The government was sworn in the next day, and I see now, when I turn the page, I had overlooked the Liberal Party which is on a -- isolated by itself on the final page of this document.  And there also you'll see that those signing for the Liberal Party are those who represented a single political tendency within the Liberal Party, the tendency of Hutu-Power and that the representative of the other tendency who was said to be a minister of the government, namely, Landouald Ndasingwa, is not a signatory because he and his family have been slaughtered the day before. 
Q.	Once the government is in place, I believe -- or can you tell us if the political parties made any of the public statements with regard to either the crisis or the implementation of a new government around that same period? 
A.	There was a press release issued by the political parties on the 10th of April, the day after the party -- the government was sworn in. 
Q.	Do you recall what the content of that communiqué was or what it was supposed to address? 
A.	It was in the same vain as the document which we have just looked at, designed for public consumption and professing to call for restoration of order and security, but at the same time, clearly representing a certain set of views, namely, those of Hutu-Power. 
Q.	I'd like to direct our attention to P. 14 in evidence.  I believe you will find that document at number 20 on the Prosecution exhibit list, and it's in volume II of the main binder.  It does exist in English and French.  P. 14A is the French, P.14B would be the English. 

Perhaps you could assist us, once again, Dr. Des Forges, by making specific reference to aspects of the communiqué that bring to light some of the points you were making.  I'm particularly concerned with paragraph 3.  
A.	The general tenure of this communiqué is a call to order and security, as many were at this time, including a specific mention of the restoration of security regardless of party membership, ethnic, or region of origin, which on the surface seems absolutely correct.  

The next paragraph, which is paragraph 2, is very important because the parties call on administrative bodies close to the population to put an end to disturbances, massacres and looting.  And they particularly point out the conseiller, the head of cellule, and the heads of the neighbourhoods, that is the units of ten families, and how they have to get urgent information so that together with the people and the armed forces, they can provide the people with security so as to ensure that no one becomes a victim of attacks any more.  

The emphasis on the security of the people, which in French is la population.  There is a distinction between the people and la population.  La population becomes that part of the -- of the Rwandan population which is identified basically with the Hutu, so that the enemy becomes the enemy of the population, the enemy of the people.  You see that in the next paragraph where the parties thank the armed forces for continuing to make sacrifices for the defence of national integrity and the security of the population.  What are the sacrifices that are being made by the armed forces for the security of the population?  

The armed forces are in the process of killing the population.  We know that soldiers of the Presidential Guard, of the Reconnaissance Battalion, of the Para commando Battalion are out on the streets killing people.  So that you see the call to security, what does that mean when you are thanking the army for doing its job and assuring security?  

They strongly urge the people who have the means to do so to make sacrifices to support the armed forces.  And the next paragraph where they say, "The political parties urge all Rwandans, particularly members of their parties to support this government -- to support their government" -- and what sense is it, "their government"?  "To support their government set up in order to get the country out of the current impasse and to help this government restore security for all."  

The authorities who take charge of the political process in those first days used the military, used the administrative network, and used the political party channels to reach down to the ordinary population.  And here is an example of the use of the political parties as having them appeal to their members and asking them to join with the government in restoring security for all.  

And then the final -- the final paragraph number 5, the members of -- the officials of these parties want to thank -- thank the army which helped them set up the government.  Yes, indeed, that is what happened, the army helped them set up the government, and helped them set up the government in part by assassinating the prime minister so that this particular formulation of government was in fact the only choice left.  

If you look at the signatories of the document, many are the same as the -- those who signed the protocol:  Ngirumpatse for the MRND; Nzirorera does not appear, but Karamera does; for the MDR the same two people, Karamira and Murego, the same people for the PSD and for the PL and the PDC, I think it's a different person.  But, in any case, the PDC is not playing a significant role at this time.  And Agnès Ntamabyariro also for the PL, again on page --
Q.	Is -- Dr. Des Forges, is there anything on the documentation that we have or that was generated up to the 10th of April that gives you any sense of the policies of this interim government that was assembled? 
A.	The documents, by their cynical description of reality, show that there is a game being played here that is not a straightforward game, that things are being deliberately distorted in their presentation of reality.  That's the first thing.  

The second thing is if you look at the signatories and the participants in the government, you will see that both the people who set up the government from the political parties and those who join the government are of a single political tendency.  Also, what is not apparent -- so apparent from the documents -- the document here but which is, in fact, the fact of the situation, this is the first government in a very long time which includes no Tutsi.  It is a government which is all Hutu.  And then, of course, in addition to the documentation is the plan of actions.  The killing of the prime minister and of all of those associated with a political point of view opposed to Hutu-Power, either their assassination or their being driven into hiding or into flight.
Q.	When we move to the next day, the 11th of April, can you tell us if anything happened on the 11th of April that would full out the picture in terms of the documenting or evidencing the policies of the interim government? 
A.	In my analysis of events, the day of April 11 is highly significant, both in assessing the character of the government and in marking an important stage in its implementation of policy.  

On that day, the government called the préfets, that is the governors, the head of the préfectures, to Kigali to meet with the government.  It was not a very long meeting.  It was attended by most of the préfets then in office.  The préfet of Butare did not attend, and the préfet of Cyangugu, I believe, did not attend, and there were several préfectures that were empty at that point.  

The meeting discussed the situation in the préfectures, and the participants described relatively frankly those areas where the killing of Tutsi had begun.  At the conclusion -- rather, during the course of the meeting, a representative of the ministry of interior described the préfet of Butare, who was not in attendance, as inactive.  This is a very significant term because, in fact, the préfet of Butare, who happened to be Tutsi and a member of that part of the Liberal Party associated with Ndasingwa, that préfet was, in fact, very active.  He was very active in attempting to prevent killings and to ensure real security for all people under his territorial responsibility.  The characterisation of him as inactive leads eventually to his removal on the 19th of April, and another highly significant meeting, which we will examine in some detail, I'm sure.  The préfet of Kibungo also was regarded as someone who was not active in implementing government policy.  

At the conclusion of that meeting, the minister of defence directed that the -- that there be no minutes of the meeting.  The government, most of whose members were in attendance -- I believe the only one who might have been missing -- no, I think even -- I think all of them were present by that point -- had heard these reports of killings of Tutsi and had already heard the -- apparently the directive of the ministry of defence that there would be no account, no written account of this meeting.  

At the end, the prime minister told the préfects that the government would shortly be issuing orders to assist them to deal with the situation.  But, in fact, those orders were not issued until the 27th of April.  And, in the interim, the préfects were sent home.  Having reported to the new government on the killings of Tutsis civilians, they were sent home with no directions, with no additional resources, with no effective measures for stopping the killings.  

Rwanda was a political system that was highly centralised and very hierarchical.  When a subordinate in the system reports on a situation and he's told directions will be forthcoming, and there are no directions, the assumption is that the situation is to continue as described.  And that is, in fact, what happened. 
Q.	Thank you.  

You've mentioned a meeting or some sort of gathering in Butare on the 19th of April.  I believe that reference was in regard to the Butare préfet who was removed on that day.  I would like to turn our attention to number 39 on the Prosecution exhibit list.  It's in volume II as well.  It has not been marked in evidence.  It is a transcript of a radio broadcast of the 19th of April.  The audio recording is already in evidence but the transcript was not introduced earlier.  I would like us to look at that transcript as an alternative to playing the audio recording.  I believe you have this transcript, Dr. Des Forges, at tab 8 in your binder, and every one else would have about at -- I guess it's volume 3 of the main file, at number 39.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say, I only have the documents that were admitted in evidence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm going to suggest that Dr. Des Forges actually read the relevant portions of the transcript so that those who do not have the document in front of them will be able to hear her read them, but I think this is a much easier way of proceeding than playing an audiotape that would have to be interpreted.  The transcript is an official transcript but simply documents in writing what is stated orally on the video -- on the audio recording that is in evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to put the transcript in evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I am. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:

MR. WEBSTER: 
(Overlapping microphones) ... Your Honour.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, before we actually go to text -- or perhaps you could give us some more background for the event, and here I'm directing your attention to the meeting in Butare on 19th April.  How do you situate that in the progression of events from 11th of April and then we'll go and look at what Jean Kambanda is actually saying?  And, again, my concern is for the policy, the articulated policies of the interim government and how they were implemented.  
A.	On the 12th of April, the government left Kigali and withdrew about 45 minutes to the south to a small campus at a place called Murambi, near Gitarama, Gitarama town, in central Rwanda.  By the end of that week, that is the 15th of April, there were killings of Tutsi civilians being carried out in large parts of Rwanda.  But in parts of Gitarama and south of Gitarama, in Butare, the amount of killing was very restricted to such an extent that in Butare itself, where many Tutsi had fled from other parts of the country, people actually declined the opportunity to flee because they felt safe.  

The government took several decisions on that weekend of the 16th and 17th of April, which were implemented in meetings beginning on the 18th and 19th of April.  And the decision that is most important here, is the decision to extend the killing into those parts of the country which, until that time, had remained protected.  

In Gitarama, if you recall, I described that as the stronghold of the MDR party.  The killing of the 
	prime minister was interpreted by many MDR politicians in the first days as a takeover attempt by the MRND.  A number of the bourgmestres, the local government officials in Gitarama who were of the MDR, rallied behind their préfet, who was also MDR, in attempting to protect Gitarama from what they believed to be MRND incursions and takeover, and these incursions were in fact carried out militarily by militia groups of the MRND that attacked Gitarama from Kigali-rural and from Gisenyi and even from parts of Kibuye.  

But Gitarama had held more or less firm; Butare, as well, for the large part, had held firm, but on that weekend of the 16th and 17th of April -- and I would say just as a way of parenthesis, that it is, in my opinion, not coincidental that on the 15th of April, the UN security council concluded its day with the understanding that the entire UN peacekeeping force would be removed.  And that the representative of the government of Rwanda had a seat on the Security Council and certainly knew and transmitted that information home by the morning of the 16th, when the government met and took the decision to change the commander in chief of the armed forces -- the chief of staff of the armed forces.  And particularly important for this matter before us, to remove the préfet of Butare, and to remove the préfet of Kibungo, who had also resisted the killings somewhat less effectively because he did not have the power base to make it work.  And so he was essentially driven away and killed.  But he was removed that weekend as well. 

On the 18th of April, Monday morning, the préfect of Gitarama called together his bourgmestres to try to find ways to continue the protection of Tutsi.  When it became known at Murambi, some 10 to 12 miles away, where the interim government ministers were lodged, when it became known that the préfect was planing to meet his subordinates, they were all immediately called to the Murambi campus to meet in the presence of the government.  And at that meeting, the message was delivered to them, "Either you are with us, or you are against us; either you join in the policy of eliminating Tutsi civilians who are, by definition, the enemy or you yourself will become labelled as one of the enemy."  Following that meeting, a bourgmestre who refused to agree, who refused to toe the line was killed in a very public and very publicised incident.  

At the same time, the attacks of militia into Gitarama from surrounding areas increased.  And, at the same time, Radio RTLM began a campaign of humiliation and vilification for those bourgmestres in Gitarama who had not participated, who had not permitted the killing of Tutsi in their communes.  So you had multi-layered attacks on this centre which had been resisting the policy of killing.  And, eventually, much of Gitarama gave in.  

The next day, the government and a very important part of the government, went south to Butare to publicly disgrace and remove the Tutsi préfect who had attempted to stop killings.  And at that meeting in Butare, you had the president, the prime minister, and two ministers who were from Butare.  This has great importance in the Rwandan context where those local figures have now achieved great importance as heads of government.  They are "the local boys made good," and they are bringing the message home to the people of Butare about what the situation is and how they are to behave.  

If you recall when I talked about the killings that took place in the 1960s, I talked about ministers going home to incite violence in their place or origin, and that is what was happening in Butare.  And, in addition to the persons from Butare who were in attendance, there was also the minister of justice who was from Kibuye; there was the minister of primary and secondary education, who was from Gikomero, from Kigali-rural; there was the minister of information who was also from Kibuye; there was the minister of labour, who was, I believe, from Kibungo; the minister of commerce also from Kibungo; the minister of family, that was one from Butare; minister of transport and communication; minister of agriculture; virtually the entire panoply of the government has come to remove a préfet, a governor, and to install his successor.  

Now, the enormous importance of the arrival of this kind of delegation in the sleepy little down of Butare is just beyond description.  It is of enormous significance, and it is on the radio.  So its significance is not just in Butare, it is a message to the entire country that Butare is so important to us, it is so important to bring Butare into line with our national policy, that we are bringing all of these resources to bear.  And it is in that contact that you have to understand the speech of the prime minister and the speech of the president.  

I think we might leave the actual analysis of the speeches for after lunch because once we get into it, it would be hard to interrupt, I think.  But let me just mention that on the day before, on the 18th after the meeting in Gitarama, that the president already went down to Butare and before coming into Butare town on the 19th, he had already visited Gikongoro préfecture to the west, which was also an area where there was some resistance to killing, and particularly the commune of Nyakizu in south-western Butare.  Nyakizu was very important because it was one place where killing was actually already taking place.  The bourgmestre of Nyakizu was of the MDR Hutu-Power wing, and he had refused the directions and effort of his superior, the préfect, who had been trying to keep order.  And at Nyakizu, at the bourgmestre's instigation and direction, the Tutsi had gathered together in a church at the parish of Kahinda, and beginning on the 15th of April through until the 19th of April, there were repeated attacks on that church, which killed thousands of people.  

While those attacks are still going on and while a part of the Tutsi who survived have fled the church to a neighbouring hill top, the president of the republic comes into their commune and gives his approval to the killing at a public meeting attended by hundreds of local people.  The others who were at the church did not attend the meeting but immediately heard the president had been there, and it is on the radio that the president has been in Nyakizu where the people are attempting to resist the Tutsi enemy in the church who are going to attack the Hutu.  And the description of what happens in Nyakizu becomes a description of war, as if it is a battle, where the militia eventually backed by soldiers, including those using mortars, attack a church full of defenceless civilians, and this is depicted as a great instance of a population protecting itself against the enemy.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you for your response.  I would like to pick up on what Dr. Des Forges has already said which is that our review of the speech from the prime minister is going to take quite a bit of time so perhaps we could break now, and resume and go over that and that would also give us an opportunity to find the transcript and make sure that everyone has a copy for when we resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we will take the lunch break now for 90 minutes.

	(Court resumed at 1422H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good of afternoon, everyone.  We can resume now, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.

I believe we left off with a discussion of the meeting of the 19th of April in Butare and I wanted to pick up with a review of Jean Kambanda's speech during the course of that meeting.  I brought copies of the transcripts, two in English and one in French, for the Trial Chamber.  I hope that you have it before you.  And I think everyone else has copies of the same transcripts in their bundle at -- I think it's item No. 39 in volume 2.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I want to express special gratitude for the -- we have a French translated version.
MR. WEBSTER:
The English was intended for you, Your Honour, but I can give you a French, as well, and you can have two.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Myself and Judge Kam can exchange. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Mr. Webster, I think you said 39 in bundle 2, but your version 2 stops at 34.
MR. WEBSTER:
Then it's probably in the next one.  But I double-checked with the interpreters, and -- if they have it in their bundle, you should also have it in yours, but it may be volume 3 as opposed to volume 2.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Volume 3.
MR. WEBSTER:
	We'll not read through the entire speech, but we'll try to go through as much as is relevant to your prior testimony.  So if you could direct your attention to the top of page 7. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Sorry, I'm interrupting, helpfully, I hope.  It's Mr. Webster's intention to exhibit this speech.  It seems to us that it may be a time-saving exercise if we don't read parts of the speech into the record, but simply allow the witness to refer to those bits she wants to refer to.  Since we all have it, it is going to be in evidence anyway, there is no need to read it into the record again.  It's just a suggestion to save some time.
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  I'll proceed.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, could you direct your attention to page 7 in the English transcript.  It bears K-number K0273538 at the top of the page and it should be in tab 8 of your working binder.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel Webster, can you go about it a bit more slowly so that the interpreters can follow you?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm sorry.  I have K0273598.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Webster, even the court reporters cannot take down what is being said at the pace at which you are going.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  You're going to have a repeat that because I had my channel on zero.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, let me tell you.  We had a discussion sometime ago where I regretted making a certain remark which I think I should make again.  You have become notorious for the speed of your speech.  Now, it is being complained about again.  So please slow down.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, directing your attention to the top of page 7, with speaker Jean Kambanda, bears the number K0273598.  Could you begin by reading it through and bringing our attention to the portions of the speech that you find particularly interesting to the topics we've been discussing today.  You can start with the beginning and skip around. 
A.	As I noticed before lunch -- as I remarked on before lunch, the assemblage of important authorities for this speech was remarkable.  At the end of the first paragraph Kambanda remarked that, "Not all government ministers are because some are on mission either abroad or within the country in order to seek peace and calm for this country."  The awareness of the importance of international approval or, if not approval, at least international tolerance for the policies of the government, was a consideration from very early on.  And in April, in mid-April, the government was already taking decisions to send ministers abroad in order to present their case to various other national governments in order to secure their support.  This is important because it indicates this is a functioning government.  This is not a conjure of harassed politicians unable to get themselves together to decide what to do.  They are, in fact, functioning at the government level.  The preceding weekend they have taken the decision to change the chief of staff of the army, to change two senior administrative officials, and they have taken the additional decision to begin what is called a pacification campaign.  And it is in this connection that some ministers have left the country and others have been sent to other parts of Rwanda, with the bulk being reserved for Butare because of the importance of Butare at this point and extending the policy of genocide.  

I would like to use this also as an opportunity to remark on how government decisions were taken, because that also is relevant.  According to extensive information from persons inside the government -- and particularly the detailed accounts by Kambanda himself -- the government operated by consensus, that is to say there was not a vote taken and the majority vote prevailed but, rather, an issue was discussed until no one disagreed.  And at that point it became the decision of the government.  This was an issue concerning the document, which we may look at later, issued on the 27th of April, which was apparently originally brought under discussion on the 23rd of April, discussed for two days without resolution, and then finally a decision was taken and the document was issued on the 27th.  So this is one example of the kind of debate which could take place on issues that were of concern to members of government.  

Now, if you go down to the second to the last line on this page, you'll see a reference to "the unrest."  And I'm not sure what that was in the French, but I suspect it was inquitude.  In any case the English used here is "the unrest", and you will see those same words twice more on the next page at the end of the first paragraph and at the end of the second paragraph on the following page.  This is a continuation of the policy of obfuscation because certainly unrest is hardly the appropriate term to describe the massive slaughter which was begun the night of the 6th and carried on into the 7th of April.  

If you turn the page, you will see that the first paragraph is devoted almost entirely to remembering the president of Rwanda and the president of Burundi with comments about their tragic death.  And you will note, also, on the second line from the top, the audience is asked to stand to observe a minute of silence in memory of this hero who gave his life for our country, that is to say President Habyarimana.  There is no mention of the prime minister, who also gave her life for her country.  You find the prime minister appears only at the very end in a kind of passing comment, the right honourable prime minister is one of those described in that unrest, again completely inappropriate description for the assassination of the prime minister who did not fall in a general riot or some kind of popular uprising.  

You will also note at the end of that paragraph, the prime minister said, "As soon as Rwandans heard that news on the 7th that morning many of them took to the streets and started committing acts of violence to express their sorrow.  Property and human lives were lost in that unrest."  

But if you recall, there was a curfew.  People did not take to the streets.  The only people who took to the streets were those people authorised to be out on the streets, that means the militia and the soldiers, so, once again, a complete distortion of the reality of the situation in an attempt to convey an impression the violence was spontaneous, was disorderly, was not directed.  
Again, at the end of the following paragraph, you will see a reference to the prime minister who died in the unrest.  The following paragraph makes the assertion that it was necessary for some people to take power to try to restore calm.  Of course, had the prime minister been left alive it wouldn't be the same people who would have to take power to restore calm because the prime minister would have been there to carry through that particular duty.  Party leaders were invited to come together and set up the government.  

Now, the next page is very interesting, and I'm not absolutely sure how to interpret this reference.
Q.	Before you continue, you have to tell us what the next page is.  
A.	I'm sorry.  K0273600, page 9, down at the bottom. 
Q.	In the English text? 
A.	In the English text.  The next page is a discussion where Kambanda attempts to explain to the audience why it had to be done the way it was done in setting up this government.  And he particularly stresses that he wants to inform all the bourgmestres who are there that those who that it could have been done otherwise -- in other words, that it could have been done by continuing toward the Arusha Accords didn't closely analyse and read the accords.  So it sounds like there had been some bourgmestres who were saying they didn't have to do it this way, they could have continued on to implement the accords if the prime minister had been left alive and that may, indeed, have been the case, that that was the argument, because some of those bouremestres would have been MDR bourgmestre from the part of the party that supported the prime minister.  

At the bottom of that same page the reference that it was impossible -- the third reason it was impossible to implement the accords is that it was urgent to set up the institutions to reassure the population, because there was intense fighting, unrest was raging, and many people were dying.  Again, the hiding of the agent of the unrest, those who are carrying out the killings - namely, the military and the militia -- at the orders of political leaders or in conjunction with political leaders.  

Another disguising of reality is that the crisis committee, at the bottom of page 9, the top army officers invited leaders of the parties that made up the government that was led by Mrs. Agathe Uwilingimyiana.  That's turning over the page to K0273601.  Indeed, they were the same parties, nominally, as those that had been in Uwilingiyimana's government; same parties, different people.  And that's the part of the story that's left out here.  The same kind of point, midway down that page, the president of the republic asks the MDR, the prime minister's party, "To propose a candidate and that was me, Kambanda."  But, of course, the MDR, the prime minister's party, was no longer a unitary political formation, and, had it been so, the prime minister, herself, would have been alive and would have not been ceding her place to Mr. Kambanda.  

Turning over onto K0273602, just after the break in text, "After the government was set up on the 9th the cabinet immediately met in order to take some urgent measures with a view to restoring security."  

Now, if a government is confronted with widespread killings in the streets, pillaging, rape, other kinds of violations of law, it has at its disposal a number of tools to restore order.  It can make use of the police.  It can make use of the armed forces.  It can make use of its power to appoint or remove or discipline officials or army officers.  It has a whole series of tools in its toolkit to restore order, and here you see Kambanda's assertion that the government took urgent measures with a view to restoring security.  And if you follow through the rest of this speech, there is not a single urgent measure taken, except verbally.  That is to say, one measure is a request to the armed forces, another measure is an appeal, another measure is calling on someone.  In other words, it's all talk.  There is no muscle put behind the call for security.  No one is fired.  No one is demoted.  No one is jailed for these killings.  Instead, the government requests, appeals, sends messages, to say, "We must have security."  And all of those messages are double messages which carry within them the suggestion that the security is meant to be the security of the Hutu, and that the Tutsi can continue to be the targets of violence, and that this interpretation, which I give, is justified, is shown by the facts of the situation.  There was nothing done in concrete terms.  And in those few cases where local authorities, themselves, took the initiative and arrested killers and assailants and rapists, those people, except in one case or two cases, were immediately released when their arrest came to the attention of national authorities.  

There is a striking example described by Kambanda, himself, with all of his calls for security and for the end to attacks on civilians and innocent people, and yet he, himself, recounts how towards the end of May he was passing by the commune of Ndora in Butare, Ndora is spelled N-D-O-R-A.  The bourgmestre of Ndora had arrested people who were killing those passing by the barricades.  After arresting the killers, the bourgmestre took them into the town of Butare to have them put in the central prison, and in the town the judicial and police authorities laughed at him and said, "Take your people home.  What are you doing?"  He took them back to his commune.  He locked them up and the prime minister and minister of feminine affairs, Nyiramasuhuko, passed by and learned that the killers had been jailed.  And Kambanda personally ordered their release.  So, in that context, the verbal messages, the urgent measures, remain purely at the level of verbiage, intended, perhaps in part, to confuse the international community, but certainly not effective ways of dealing with an ongoing crisis situation where thousands of people are being killed daily. 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, if you were to direct your attention to the middle of that page. there is a sentence that begins, "We are happy to report that the security situation is slowly improving in Kigali préfecture."  Would that have been an accurate description of reality on the 19th of April? 
A.	No, it is not an accurate description, nor is the sentence before it accurate; that is, the assertion it was undisciplined soldiers who were responsible for the acts of insecurity; nor is the sentence further down in that paragraph, "Security is gradually being restored."  This is very interesting.  "Security is gradually being restored but we are sure that it cannot be totally restored as long as the RPF are still fighting."  And that becomes the central point of difference between the RPF and the interim government throughout this period whenever peace is discussed.  The RPF says, "We will not negotiate until you stop the massacres going on in your territory."  And the interim government says, "We are doing the best we can but we cannot stop those massacres until you give us a ceasefire and we can use the army to stop the killing."  But, of course, some of the army was already present at the site of the killing.  It was doing the killing.  So it was not that there were no soldiers available to keep the piece.  They were there.  They just weren't keeping the peace.  

If you turn to page K0273603, in the middle of the page he explains what the appropriate name is, in his view, for the government.  He says the government should be called the government of about Abatabazi, A-B-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I, meaning the saviours in Rwandan historical tradition, the Mutabatabazi was a figure who sacrificed himself the save the nation.  And Kambanda's explanation is that, "We came in after three days of killings.  So don't think we're the ones responsible.  We came in afterwards and we've been doing our best the reduce the scale of killings, which, in fact, we have achieved."  That's his message.  But he is standing there in Butare to remove the préfet who has been an obstacle to the killings.  So, how can it be taken with any seriousness whatsoever?  

Down at the bottom you will see again, "We sent another message."  They do a lot of sending of messages in this government.  On the next page, that is the one that ends 604, "We also gave a message to the patriots."  That's about line 5 or 6, then two lines from the bottom, "We sent another message to the leaders of the prefectures," so lots of messages being sent but nothing else in reality being done, except to send the ministers out to all corners of the country to, again, deliver the message.  

At the top of K0273605 you will find a reference to the meeting of Monday, the 11th of April, which is the meeting I referred to this morning as one of great importance.  And Kambanda says that it was a meeting, "with all the préfets but, unfortunately, some didn't attend.  Your préfet is one of those who did not show up and we don't know why."  But, of course, he pays the price for that by now being removed.  

The following paragraph is one of great importance, because it talks about the issue of the cell leaders.  The cell leaders are the lowest level of local administration.  When a multiparty government was established, the members of the opposition parties refused to pay the salary, or what was called the preem.  It wasn't really a salary; it was sort of a recompense to the cell leaders because they argued, "These people are MRND people.  They are really party people.  They are not unit officials."  So they refused to pay them and that continued to be a very hot issue until this point when the prime minister announces that that has been resolved, and that the government now recognises that they are entitled to this preem, to this allowance.  And why?  Because knowing that, you look at the three lines from the bottom of to that paragraph, knowing that will ensure that the cell leaders dedicate themselves to their work and they have an important role to play in restoring calm and security.  Now, knowing what Kambanda means by "calm and security," I think it is not unreasonable to conclude that the work the cell leaders are to do involved helping organise attacks on Tutsi.  

The next paragraph begins, "The message we gave to the préfet is the same message I am addressing to you today."  In other words, the policy that we are implementing here is the same policy that we had on the 11th of April.  It's the same policy we delivered to the préfet and bourgmestre in Gitarama on the 18th of April.  We are delivering it to you now, here, on the 19th of April."  And he says, "We started yesterday with Gitarama."  That's the reference to the meeting of the 18th of April.  "Today we have come to Butare," and he assures the audience the programme will be extended to other préfectures.  

That is, in fact, exactly what happened with ministers going into Kibuye, the prime minister on the 3rd of May; other ministers going into Ruhengeri, including the minister of feminine affairs, Nyiramasuhuko and Minister Rwamakuba; the prime minister goes into Kigali rural.  So the ministers are going to be going into the various préfectures to continue this policy and they are going to ask the bourgmestre to do two things: to ensure the security of the population, and to defend the country's sovereignty.  Now isn't that extraordinary, to be delivering those responsibilities into the hands of local administrators to defend the country's sovereignty and to ensure the security of the population?  Those are the responsibilities of a national government with control of a national police and a national armed forces.  It is carrying throughout the illusion that the war -- and this will be picked up in the president's speech, as well -- the war is the responsibility of every citizen and it is everywhere.  But, in fact, at this time there is no war in Butare.  The combat zone is far removed.  And so the ideas that "you must be aware of enemies and you must protect yourselves against enemies" simply doesn't fit the situation of the moment.  

If you look further down that same page, that is the one that ends at the number 606, "No commune should be infiltrated by the enemy, by the RPF.  We trust the population.  We have the confidence they will help you because they are willing and able.  They do not want us to be taken back to the 1959 yoke," the reference, "back to the 1959 social revolution, to the time when the evil Tutsi are overthrown", people do not want to go back to that time and so they will, of course, rally to follow the orders of their local administrative official who will lead them in attacking those Tutsis who are defined as the enemy.
Q.	Maybe we can look at the bottom of the page, Dr. Des Forges, bottom of page 15, which ends in 06, the same page you were reading from, the last sentence, beginning with "similarly".  Perhaps you can read that then comment on that briefly. 
A.	Carrying forward the theme of the need for each person to be responsible for his own security, rather than leaving that to the authorities, the text reads, "Similarly, members of the population are ensuring their own security."  He's speaking here with praise, with commendation for what is happening in the city of Kigali where, of course, Tutsi are being slaughtered in large numbers.  And he says, "There residents have organised themselves in each and each neighbourhood you cannot walk more than 500 metres in Kigali town without seeing a roadblock manned by residents who are ensuring their security, who are protecting the sovereignty of their country.  And, of course, the way they are doing that is by selecting those people passing their barriers who are Tutsi and killing them.  

The next paragraph in here, we're on K0273607, "The prime minister says he has asked the ministry of justice to start investigations pertaining to the unrest and the assassination of the president of the republic and the president of Burundi."  He is not asking for an investigation of the killing of the prime minister, but yet that should presumably also fall within the ambit of the Minister of Justice 
Q.	Excuse me for interrupting.  I think we've covered quite a bit with Kambanda.  Maybe you could simply turn to the beginning again and remind us of who was sharing the dais with him.  I believe that you had mentioned that at the end of the morning session, but he mentioned the minister of primary and secondary education.  Do you know who that was on the 19th of April? 
A.	I believe that was Dr. Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Can we turn now to speeches?  There were two that were disclosed; one was only disclosed earlier this week, it's item No. 38 -- excuse me -- it's -- one was previously disclosed.  It's item No. 38 on the list.  It's speech in Butare.  Another was disclosed earlier this week.  It's a radio broadcast from the 19th of April, and it deals with speech in -- perhaps we should start with the speech in Butare, and I'll allow you an opportunity to find it, then you can direct it through that text.  It should be through the same slot in your prep file.  The K-number begins K0133694 in the English text, No. 38 on the Prosecutor's list.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Which tab?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is listed as No. 3 in volume 2.  It's either volume 2 or volume 3 of the main bundle.  It has not yet been exhibited so it has no P-number, but it was disclosed to the parties and the actual recording has been exhibited, so this is the transcript of the recording that has been admitted in evidence.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Is it tab 38, volume 3?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it is.

I've just been informed that the K-number that I've referred to is included in a package of materials that was distributed yesterday or the day before in a folder, K0133694. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I've got something that was distributed to me yesterday, but it doesn't have that particular K-number you refer to.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I've got speech in Butare on 19th of April as K0129406 in the English.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not sure which - 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The Kinyarwanda is K0273518.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
If you're referring to the speech of Sindikubwabo 19th of April 1994, K0133693, English, then we've got it.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's what I stated earlier.  So perhaps we can proceed.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Before actually reading the next page, you can describe how this piece is appreciated historically and what it's significance was and then you can go to significance references in the text? 
A.	The speech was delivered before the assembled members of government but also the bourgmestres of the préfectures of Butare and all of the heads of administrative departments, so it was a large gathering.  The hall, which is the largest hall in Butare, was full to capacity.  At the start of the ceremony the préfet of Butare, who had been removed, was present but he, during the course of the ceremony, when it became clear that he would not be given an opportunity to speak in such circumstances -- ordinarily the outgoing préfet would also have said some words, but he was not given that opportunity, and he left.  He went across the street to the préfectural offices, which were directly across the small road from this hall.  In front of this préfecture offices there were a group of Tutsi gathered who had come for protection.  According to the testimony of an expatriate who was at the préfecture office that day, a number of trucks came in empty, took the Tutsi men who were in front of the préfecture, drove away, and returned again empty some 20 minutes later to take way yet another load of Tutsi.  While this is going on, the meeting is being held across the road where the prime minister is professing his concern for restoring authority.  And then the president, who was an elderly gentleman, a pediatrician, very well known in Butare, took the floor to make the speech which caused a sensation in Butare and nationally over the radio.  I spoke to one of the people who was present at that meeting and I asked him, "How did people react?  What did you say to each other when the meeting was over?"  And he said, "We said nothing.  We looked at each other and we left.  There was nothing to say."  So that was the atmosphere in the room after this speech was given.  

The president insisted a great deal in this speech, again on the cohesion of the government, that all the government was together in what they were doing, that the kinds of divisions that used to exist no longer existed, and that people were united against the common enemy.  He speaks at the start about having been in Gikongoro, the adjacent préfecture, and having been at Nyange commune, which I talked about this morning, and then he said, "Who are these refugees," meaning these people who are in the church.  "Who are these people who are assembled with weapons and grenades?"  In fact, that was not the case.  When the people assembled, they had sticks and stones some of them had machetes that were taken away from them.  And in the course of one of the armed attacks, when they protected themselves with sticks and stones, they overcame a couple of the communal police, who were among the assailants, and they took two firearms from them and used those firearms to protect themselves.  But they are described here as people who assembled with weapons and grenades, "heavily armed with guns and grenades," says the president.  And he goes on to say that in Gikongoro he gave a message to the préfet and he's going to deliver the same message, again the consistency here, the same message he is going to deliver here today, and, that is, the government does not have enough police and in the English they've used the word gendarme which is a word for national -- policemen of the national police corps.  The government does not have enough gendarmes to deal with the insecurity problem.  "Besides, this is not their duty.  They can intervene to ensure security only when the situation has deteriorated."  Now what can that mean?  When the situation has deteriorated then you can call in the gendarmes.  That means when you attack the Tutsi, if you can't overcome them on your own, then you can ask for reinforcements from the gendarmerie.  And that's what happened in many cases.  He says that he was disappointed the day before when he was talking to people and he said, "Where are the men in this commune?  Why aren't you getting out there and defending yourselves?"  And he was told that the men were all finished off by their big belly, that they had, in other words, gotten too greedy and eaten too much.  This was the constant theme and propaganda in the months before the genocide when the MRND contingent attacked opposition leaders for their big belly and said, "You people in the opposition, the only reason you are willing to go along with the RPF is they have paid you off."  And that's what is meant here, the big bellies have finished them.  They have come to terms with the enemy out of personal interest.  

At the top of page K0133695, the president returns to the constant theme of protecting yourself, protecting your neighbours and then the theme of part of the speech, which was particularly famous in Butare, the next few paragraphs, here he says, "Even in Butare we have the -- this is none of my business, people; those who think the situation doesn't concern them and those who think they know everything."  What he is protesting against is those people in Butare who are saying, "What happens in Kigali is not our affair.  We are going to keep it quiet here.  There is no reason for us to kill our neighbours.  This is not our issue."  

And he is saying to them, that is not true.  And he is accusing them of having some leaders who have actually gone to join the RPF and been trained with the RPF and come back.  This was an obligation that was never proved, but it was one allegation that was used from time to time to discredit the préfet who was a man in his forties who, as far as I know, had never had any military training.  

In the next paragraph the president expresses his satisfaction, "I am also happy since many cabinet members have attended this ceremony.  This should serve as a clear indication for you, since, as the prime minister has correctly remarked, governments used to rule through the radio but we are going to be the government that is close to the people.  We are going to be the government that has a single cohesive purpose and we are here to show you we are together."  

Further down that page he refers to a myth.  This is paragraph one, two, three, fourth paragraph from the bottom.  "There is something here in Butare that could be called myth.  I've tried to translate this in Kinyarwanda as Ubwiru, U-B-W-I-R-U.  Ubwiru was the esoteric code of the monarchy.  Butare was a préfecture that included Nyanza, the old site of the royal court.  So here, again, the president is raising that idea of, "you people, you continue under Tutsi influence, you continue under the mythology of the old monarchy." 
Q.	I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I take particular note at the bottom of page 695, the K-number 695 where it says, "Do not take my words as a joke."  A think there are several references to where he talks about how the audience should understand his whole words.  Could you comment on that, you read that whole sentence, starting on the bottom of page ending in 695, "Do not take my words as a joke."  
A.	"Do not take my words as a joke or think that I am speaking in a vacuum."  And this should refer you back to the paragraph before where he says, at the end of that paragraph, "This is the message I am giving to you.  This is a test I am giving to you that you have to pass.  You need to take me seriously.  You need to understand what I am really saying here or you are going to fail."  

And he says, a little bit further on, "We have come part way today."  That's at the bottom of K0133696.  "The idea we have come part way, we still have a long way to go.  We will examine everyone's behaviour."  

He's saying to them plainly, "Listen, I am removing your préfet.  You know what he has been doing.  It is up to you to read the signs correctly.  You need to take this as a lesson.  Bring your behaviour into conformity or you two will be removed.  And there you will see in the middle of his page, that is the page ending with 696, he excuses himself for the emotion in his voice.

THE WITNESS: (continuing)
And then he goes on to say, "I do not want you to take our messages, speeches and lessons as if they are mere words spoken in the air.  These are important messages because we are in a period of war.  What this means is that those who are irresponsible should be identified and brought out into the open."  Like the préfet that was being removed, he was irresponsible, he was inactive.  

And then continuing:  "They should step aside, stay away from us while we work."  And the word "work" is a word that became extremely important as a result of its link to killings of Tutsis in the 1960s.  To work in this context is to kill.

"Those who feel they are not concerned, or who are afraid, should step aside.  Those responsible for ridding us of such persons should do so quickly.  There is no shortage of good workers who are willing to serve their country." 

The message could not be clearer:  You are for us or you are against us.  You are ready to execute our line or you are not, and if you are not, we are going to get rid of you.  And, in some cases, people were gotten rid of, including the bourgmestre of Mugina in Gitarama, who just is, these days, is being gotten rid of in a literal and physical sense and as the préfet of Butare was eventually gotten rid of in a physical sense, along with his wife and his two small children, that was his consequence for being "irresponsible".  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, perhaps we can direct our attention to the second -- to the last paragraph in the Sindikubwabo speech.  It is on the page ending in 697.  It starts, "Dear fellows" -- and, again, he seems to refer to his own manner of speaking.  And could you read that paragraph and then we can move on to something else?
A.	"Dear fellows, I would like to stop here, but I have to repeat what I said.  You should listen to us and interpret our speech correctly.  You have to understand why we act the way we do and to analyse every word we say in order to understand why we say it.  Bear in mind that this is an emergency period."  But that should be read in conjunction with the paragraph, the second paragraph from the top on the previous page, that is the one ending 696, where he says:  "So far we have been lucky since the war has not reached this area."  So he admits that Butare is not touched by the war at this point.  There is no insecurity in Butare, and yet people must act to defend themselves.  
Q.	Based on your testimony, Dr. Des Forges, you seem to be saying that this is obvious for the audience that is actually hearing these words, the message is clear.  Couldn't an argument be made, or is there any substance to an argument that these words are completely innocuous?  Do you have to have specialized knowledge to understand what is being said here?  How blatant are they, and are there other ways of seeing these words that could be entertained reasonably? 
A.	We all know that the meaning of words depends on the context in which they are spoken.  In the context of a president and prime minister, accompanied by other ministers of a government where widespread killing is going on in the city of Kigali, and no extensive killing in the city of Butare, for them to come to Butare and remove the man who has been in charge, and praise the people of Kigali for their barricades every 500 metres, that is the context in which these words have to be understood, and were understood at the time.  So that there can be, in my mind, no other reasonable interpretation, given the context, given the actions of this government until that point.  And that was the way that people at the time saw it as well.  
Q.	I thank you.  Perhaps we can turn our attention now, very quickly, to the other document that I mentioned.  It is -- the English text, it begins K0275068.  This is a transcript of a radio broadcast which seems to be the 19th of April.  

I believe this was distributed to the parties yesterday or the day before; it was not originally disclosed.  It is available in French and in English.  And we can try to be a little bit quicker with our review of this text.  I would like to start with page K0275069, which is an unidentified speaker.  There are two or three paragraphs that situate this transmission in time.  Perhaps you can direct your attention, 
Dr. Des Forges, to the second paragraph down, that starts, "The Prime Minister, His Excellency, 
Jean Kambanda? 
A.	Right.  The journalist is recapping the meeting in Gitarama on the 18th of April, which we referred to previously where the government met together with the bourgmestres and the préfet, as well as with heads of religious organisations and political parties.  

I think we will, at one point, look at a document which pre-dates April, which is a plan for civilian self-defence.  And in that document you will see that there is a role for military leaders, for administrative leaders and for the heads of certain political parties.  And that was true when this plan was -- of self-defence, so called, was implemented throughout this period, that leaders of political parties were affiliated with the government in its action.  They took part in meetings up to and including the level of cabinet meeting. 
Q.	Now, perhaps we can turn to page 5072; it is page 5 in the English text, with the K number that identifies it as -- ends in 5072.  At the bottom, another journalist has taken up the same message again.  He appears to be making reference to the meeting of the day before.  But if you can read that bottom paragraph, starting with "The Prime Minister --" and that will set the context for the paragraph that I find a bit more pertinent to our discussion now -- that is on the middle of the following page? 
A.	"The Prime Minister, His Excellency, Jean Kambanda, yesterday presided over a meeting in Gitarama, grouping representatives of religious organisations, leaders of all political parties in the country, the bourgmestres of the communes of Gitarama préfecture and all of the heads of service of that préfecture."  Essentially, the same cast of characters as we find in Butare on the 19th. 
Q.	And when we turn the page and see how it continues, perhaps, you may want to look at those three or four beginning paragraphs and then comment on those aspects of it that you think are pertinent to your testimony?
A.	It is essentially, the same kind of information that we presented already, with the government saying it has a peace campaign that it is going to -- or has initiated.  And with the prime minister pointing out that the disturbances, as they called them, erupted again, suggesting no direction to it, but spontaneous violence after the death of Habyarimana.  And then stressing the measures promptly adopted by the government.  And once again, we find those measures are nothing but words taken to call for security.  

And then in the middle of the page, you will see that he says -- "he", meaning the prime minister, "referred during this meeting in Gitarama, inter alia to the appointment of the chief of staff of the Rwandan army, Major General Augustin Bizimungu, the appointment of préfets to préfecture where those positions were vacant, and the replacement of prefets who had clearly failed carrying out in their duty --" it should be, carrying out their duty "in recent times."  And, again, who are the two who have been removed, but the two in Butare and Kibungo who have resisted the killings.  
Q.	If we now direct our attention to page 8, the K number ends in K -- excuse me, ends in 5075.  At the bottom of the page we see that the President Sindikubwabo starts to speak.  Perhaps you could look, starting there and the next page, and if there is anything that we need to touch on, you can bring it to our attention, please? 
A.	Here, as in the other speech, I would draw attention, again, to the importance of the cell leader as the most local level mobilizer of the population, just referred to in passing here, discussed somewhat more at length in the Butare speech of the 19th.  

And then, again, in the middle of this page 076, at the end of the figure, reference again to the gendarmes and the military as being "available only in situations that the population itself cannot handle."  So the expectation that the members of the population are going to become involved in the active extermination of the enemy, defined as those Tutsi civilians who are affiliated with the RPF, the same kind of theme again:  "We are all concerned, don't think this doesn't affect you, it concerns primarily all of the members of the population.  

"We must identify those who are indifferent.  People have to know who they are, so that we can take charge of punishing offenders, and why they say they are not concerned.  What is your plan for each of you while waiting for the government to assist you?"  

So I think the same -- very much the same theme is coming through as consistently presented again in the more formal meeting in Butare. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like to go on to another set of documents.  I believe you will find them at tab 5 in your working binder.  The first one that concerns us is listed under number 30 in the Prosecutor's list, it is in Volume II, I think, of the main bundle.  It is marked for identification and admitted into evidence as P. 22.  And it is already available in English and in French text.  The original was in Kinyarwanda.  

It is a document that is dated the 27th of April 1994.  And this would be the directives to all prefets asking for the restoration of security in the country by Kambanda.  We don't have to read through the entire document.  I believe you mentioned it once before, Dr. Des Forges.  Perhaps you can comment on its content and explain its significance to us? 
A.	Okay, a word of background to begin with about civilian self-defence.  As early as the 1960s the government occasionally called out the population to either do patrols or to man barriers in the context of the incursions by the Tutsi refugees.  

When the war began and moved into its guerrilla phase in 1990 --  the guerrilla phase dating from 1991 on, there was a renaissance of this idea of civilian self-defence, particularly in the border regions.  
The idea was that firearms would be distributed to a certain number of civilians who would then go on patrol with soldiers.  This is not particularly an exceptional kind of idea that civilians could assist the military in a battle zone against armed combatants.  But as the internal divisions grew among Hutu, particularly, as those divisions were reflected inside of the army, Habyarimana and his group were no longer sure that they could rely 100 percent on the army.  

So the idea became current among some of them that what we need to do is mobilize the population in a massive effort of civilian self-defence.  Now, for some people this might have been legitimately a self-defence against armed combatants.  But because the enemy had been defined so eerily and so repeatedly as being an ethnic group, and the members of those ethnic groups -- of that ethnic group -- the civilian self-defence idea became assimilated into the programme of genocide.  And many of the same elements that existed in the early formulation for civilian self-defence became, in fact, the mechanisms for killing Tutsi, starting on April the 6th.  This is including the organisation of people at the cell level by their unit of residence.  The role assigned to reservist or retired military, people who were no longer in the active military and/or active soldiers who happened to live off the camp grounds in the neighborhoods, the recruitment and training of specialised groups who would be better able to use firearms and to kill -- and to carry out the most effective part of the killing in conjunction with the militia organisations, this was the armature, the framework which was put into effect on April the 6th.  

But the whole thing became formalised much later on.  This document of April 27th is halfway between the beginning, in fact, of civilian self-defence and its ultimate formalisation.  And it represents an effort to do several things.  First of all, to continue to persuade the international community that the government is trying to end the killings.  And second of all, it is to organise the whole violence more tightly, to keep it targeted on Tutsi, and to ensure that it does not turn back on itself, as it risked doing.  Because once the establishment had put guns, in particular, and other weapons in the hands of young people, many of whom were poor, had no job prospects, they saw the risks that those weapons could be turned against themselves.  So this was part of an effort to bring the killing campaign into tighter control, and to do that through the implication of local communal authorities who would become responsible for the setting up of barriers and for the implementation of patrols.  With this decree, essentially, the killing activity of the Interahamwe is brought under and given approval by government authorities and made much more formalised and subject to direction from the top.  
Q.	So, now, if we direct your attention to page 2 of the document itself in the English text, the K number, K0033067, I would like you to have a look at a paragraph in the middle of the page.  It starts, "Referring myself to the decisions of the council of ministers" -- it is the fourth or fifth paragraph down, but it is right in the middle of the page.  Could you read that paragraph aloud, please? 
A.	"Referring myself to the decision of the council of ministers who have been constantly examining the security problem, and addressing the people of Rwanda, messages aimed at safeguarding security in the country, and particularly, to the meeting which gathered the ministers and préfets on the 11th of April to the council of ministers on the 23rd of April and to the council of ministers on the 27th of April. 

So this reflects the history of that reaching out and recruiting the civilian administration into the government programme with the meeting that I have mentioned earlier, on the 11th of April.  And then, as I mentioned earlier this afternoon, the meetings on the 23rd and 27th where this policy was subject to long debate until ultimately a consensus was reached. 
Q.	And then the following paragraph starts, "On behalf of the government of Rwanda," could you read that.  And then we will switch to something else? 
A.	"On behalf of the government of Rwanda, I am writing to communicate to you the instructions to be followed by all levels in charge of security, and by the whole population so that security and calm, which have been troubled in all corners of the country, return quickly." 
Q.	Now, Dr. Des Forges, on the surface of things one would almost assume that the concern here is, in fact, the security and calm.  What is it that would indicate that this was not the case, to you, looking at this document with the eyes of an historian? 
A.	If you look at the first -- the first directive there, it is a request to organise security meetings at the level of the préfectures.  And then later on, it becomes security meetings at every level of the administrative hierarchy.  And we know at the security meetings, activities were planned for attacking and capturing Tutsi.  

If you look at number 3, "The enemy who attacked Rwanda is well known, it is the RPF Inkotanyi.  So we should explain to people to avoid anything that would bring about violence on the pretext of ethnic group, region, political parties, hatred, et cetera, because violence within the population constitutes a breach for the enemy."  That sounds perfectly acceptable.  But then you go onto the next sentence, "Nevertheless, the population must remain watchful in order to unmask the enemy and his accomplices."  

The idea that the enemy is lurking among you, he is in hiding, he has adopted disguises, you must unmask him and all of his accomplices, and hand them over to all of the authorities and get the national army to assist them where they prove incapable of doing that.  

By this time, the widespread massacres had attracted a considerable amount of international attention.  And although negative comments were only beginning to come in, the Rwandan authorities were sufficiently aware of the risks of international disapproval to want to insist, once again, that their ultimate aim is pacification.  So, the order goes out.  Instead of killing large numbers in the churches, in the schools, in the hospitals, instead, what you should do, is take these people and hand them over to the authorities.  And the authorities are to set up roadblocks and to be responsible for keeping the enemy from infiltrating.  

He then says at the end of the next paragraph, "Those on the roadblocks and doing rounds, shall not commit acts of violence against innocent population."  What is the innocent population?  Well, obviously, those are people who are not the enemy.  Who is the enemy?  The enemy is the Tutsi.  So the order is nowhere near as benign as it might be taken to be at the start.  

And to give an example of the context in which this is implemented, in a number of places the one that comes to my mind first, is in Gisenyi.  The graveyards that were dug where people were taken for execution were informally called the commune because the order was, "Take those people whom you capture to the commune."  So people would say, "Well, we are taking these Tutsi to the commune" but, in fact, they were taking them to the place of execution. 
Q.	At this point, perhaps, we can direct our attention to another document.  This you would find also at   tab 5 of your working document --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, if you are going on to something new, would this be a proper time -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break now.   
(Court recessed from 1542H to 1608H) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now, I think, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I would like to direct your attention to tab 5 in your binder.  I would like us to look at      P. 20, it is listed at number 29 in Volume II of the Prosecutor exhibit bundle, but it is already marked in evidence as P. 20.  And this is the directives of the prime minister to all préfets on the organisation of civil defence.  It is a document dated the 25th of May 1994.  

Since this is already in evidence, I am not going to ask you to read through the whole thing.  I am particularly concerned with paragraph 3 and paragraph 5, but if you would like to make some introductory comments in relation to the time that this directive was issued, that may be helpful.  But then, if you could address the text as well, we would appreciate that.  
A.	The civilian self-defence effort had a historical background, which I spoke of earlier.  The programme was put into effect in early April, and was used, primarily, to attack Tutsi but also to eliminate certain political opponents.  It involved giving arms and recruiting large numbers of young people; some of whom became sort of loosely assimilated into what was called the Interahamwe.  Others who were organised by their local administrators. 
	
	As the first two or three weeks came to a conclusion, it was increasingly apparent that some of those who had been given a license to kill, were using the license in the wrong way.  That is to say, they were killing not only Tutsi but also Hutu who were chosen sometimes, more or less randomly, according to their appearance of wealth -- that is, they were targeting anyone who came through the barriers who looked like he or she might be rich or attractive.  

And as a result, there was some concern within the government about exactly how to deal with this.  That concern was manifested first in discussions at the end of April.  But it took a very long time for it to become crystallised into official instructions, in part, because of different points of view on how best to carry forth the popular mobilisation.  

It is a little difficult to know exactly who was taking what stand inside the government, and what interests were at stake.  But it seems to have been, in general, a MRND versus an MDR kind of conflict.  But, in any case, agreement had been reached, because as I said, nothing was done without consensus.  An agreement was reached by the end of May, and these formal orders finally came out on the organisation of civilian self-defence.  

The key elements of the programme replicate elements which have been found in historical documents going back to January and February 1993.  So, these are same kinds of things such as, for example, the reference to the use of communal police and reservist, which is found at paragraph 7, on page K0236093.  And the stress on the close cooperation between the territorial administration and the political parties that uphold the republican and democratic ideal, that is found at paragraph 5, on page K0236092; stressing there that recruitment has to be done among those who uphold these ideals.  

And that same theme is found in a document dating to February 1994, which assigns tasks in a civilian self-defence system to the president's office, to the army general staff, to the police general staff, to the political parties that uphold republican and democratic ideals, not to all parties, but only to those parties, meaning MRND, CDR and those affiliated with them.   
(Pages 54 to 61 by Donna M. Lewis)


























	1615H
THE WITNESS: (continuing)
And to administrative officials as well, the selection -- the use of that particular group of people is clear from February on and is formalised here, along with the reliance on the retired military and the communal police as the instructors and the leaders of the groups that would lead the massacres against Tutsi. 

That document from February -- interestingly enough, the only senior government official not mentioned in the civilian self-defence plan is the prime minister.  So in that sense, that is not a government document.  It is not a government plan for civilian self-defence but, rather, it is an MRND-CDR document.  So this picks up this document of May issued by the prime minister and approved by the government as a whole -- takes up many of those elements of the civilian self-defence, which had been -- which had been announced in the year before and then especially in the months immediately preceding April of 1994.  

So if we look at paragraph 3, there is the condemnation of certain foreign governments that are said to be supplying the RPF.  And it is said that the most effective weapon to defend Rwanda is the people and the people are called upon to join the army in fighting against the enemy.  

In the document we looked at earlier today, the definition of the enemy -- there are several places in that document where the advantages and disadvantages of the two sides are listed.  And one advantage for the Rwandan government side is "the population" -- the people.  This is a strong current as well in RTLM propaganda where the people are called the ultimate weapon, who will back up the army.  

So the idea is here that in facing off against the threat posed by the RPF and Tutsi, in general, it is the majority Hutu population which can turn the course of the battle and ensure the victory of the Rwandan government.  I think that's certainly the context in which paragraph 3 is to be understood. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If we turn now to paragraph 5. 
A.	Yes, to paragraph 5.  There is an emphasis on utmost secrecy which is, indeed, a kind of strange element here.  But I think it's a carry over of the early idea that this whole plan was done secretly, clandestinely and without openly acknowledging what was going on, so I think that's simply a carry over of that. 

Then the emphasis on groups being trained in each cellule.  Again, this points out the importance of the cellule leaders -- that's why you have to pay those guys because they're the ones who are going to ensure at the grassroots level that the system works.  They're the people who are going to draw up the list of who's going to be on the barrier on Monday, who on Tuesday, who on Wednesday, and is going to make sure that the note gets nailed to the tree to say who's supposed to at the barrier and to make sure the system works -- so the cellule and the secteur as the fallback level -- as the centres of this self-defence. 

The residential basis of recruitment, which was important not just for logistical ease, but also to counter partisan conflict.  The problem that the authorities ran into with using the militia was that although the Interahamwe and the other youth militia cooperated once the genocide began, they didn't forget their rivalries.  And so it was important to try to find a larger more neutral basis of organisation instead of party loyalty and that was to be provided by the local residential unit. 

And then the final point there, which I've already talked about, the close cooperation between the territorial administration and the political parties. 
Q.	Thank you.  If we could turn our attention now to a document that actually bears the same date.  Here, I'm referring to what's been marked in evidence as P. 24.  It's a document that exists both in French and English.  You will find it in the same tab, tab 5, in your working binder, which is listed as item number 31 on the Prosecution's exhibit list and in that main bundle.  But it's already marked in evidence as P. 24 and here I'm referring --
MR. O'SHEA:
Just a moment, which bundle are you referring to?  Two or three?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have it in my notes as volume 2.  It's item number 31, it's marked in evidence as P. 24.  It's a memorandum signed by Edouard Karamera, minister of interior -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
Dated the 25th of May, 1994.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, I have it, thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The English text begins with K number K0033063, and the subject of the memorandum is listed as "Implementation, the prime minister's directives for self-organised civil defence."

I'm assuming everyone has the document in front of them now. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I'm particularly concerned with items that are on the second page of the text.  The reference to bladed weapons at the top of that page, but we can sort of look through the listing of measures that the minister of interior is suggesting be implemented in order to give effect to the prime minister's directives that we just reviewed. 

So if you could take a moment to look at the two pages and then you can bring our attention to those aspects of this document that are most significant for us to appreciate the policies that are being implemented by this government.  
A.	If we begin on the first page of the document, the minister of interior directs the préfets to draw up lists of all military reservists or gendarmes residing in the communes. 

This activity was actually done in Kigali itself on March 30th and 31st when the préfet of Kigali provided lists of reservists to the chief of staff subsequent to a meeting on March the 29th to organise civilian self-defence. 

So that substantiates my argument that this plan is a plan that -- that antedates April 6th, but after 
April 6th is put into operation in a fairly haphazard manner in the first couple of weeks in the sense that the superstructure is not in place, completely finished, until you get to several weeks later. 

The recruitment and training of young people is to include ideological and moral training.  So clearly, there's an ideological component to this.  There is a stress on ensuring that people are to know why they're doing what they're doing and that ideological component involves stress on the gains of the revolution of 1959 and the need to protect that revolution in all of its facets. 

You will see at the bottom of the page, establishing lists of people who have received or should receive firearms.  We know that that was done.  I, myself, found a significant number of those lists in communes in Butare, very neatly done out as was required, with name, and the identification information for the individual, identification number for the weapon taken, and so on. 

So, clearly, the distribution of firearms is important here.  And we know from Kambanda's statements that at the cabinet meetings that was a primary concern for all of the ministers -- was getting their hands on firearms to distribute to their party followers and to their regional bases even in those areas where there was no combat. 

But there was a practical recognition of the limits of firearms.  The country simply couldn't afford that many and after the 17th of May, there was an embargo on firearms.  So there was also an awareness, and this existed as early as January-February 1993 in the diary of Colonel Bagasora.  An awareness of the importance of also ensuring the availability of machetes, spears, bows and arrows and other kinds of what are called in French, arme blanche -- that is, weapons that are not firearms. 
Now, the importance of this is that the Rwandan authorities knew at this point that the RPF was a highly professional, experienced military force.  Against whom are the machetes and bows and arrows are to be used?  In all likelihood, not against the forces that are armed with mortars and rocket-fired grenades, but, rather, against people who are armed, at best, with sticks and stones -- that is, the civilian population. 

I'd also draw your attention halfway down that page to the requirement that local officials do a brief evaluation of local authorities and identify those who may possibly handicap the implementation of civil-defence strategy.  This harks back to President Sindikubwabo saying, "This is a test; you're being given a message and we're going to see how well you understand.  We've come part way today, we've gotten rid of the préfet and now we're going to see about the rest of you.  Do you understand?  And if you don't, there will be consequences."  And that is exactly what this is saying here.   

And throughout the end of May and June the government carried out the replacement of officials and the nomination of new officials in almost every case removing those who were opposed to Hutu-Power ideas, those who opposed killing of Tutsi, and putting into place those who were willing to implement those kinds of policies. 

The -- some of the bourgmestres who had been removed in the months before April 6th because they had been known abusers of human rights were able to reclaim their positions, like 
Bourgmestre Kajelijeli in north-western Rwanda in Ruhengeri was able to reclaim his post.  
The bourgmestre of Muganza in Butare is another example of someone who had been ousted and was able to reclaim his post.  And what was the criteria for these administrative changes?  The criterion was:  Are they for us or against us?  Will they implement the government policy?  The government policy is to identify and to eliminate the enemy. 
Q.	If we could turn our attention now -- thank you for that -- if we could turn our attention now to another exhibit.  It's marked in evidence as P.21.  It's in the same tab in your working binder; it's listed as 
	item 19 in the -- on the Prosecutor's exhibit list and it appears in volume 2 of the main bundle.  This also exists both in French -- the original language, which is French and an English translation.  

The document that was exhibited originally several weeks ago was a copy where the signature and the date did not appear clearly in the photocopy.  And I believe yesterday -- the day before, members of my staff took care to distribute to the parties and to the Chamber a much better quality photocopy, that includes the signature of Edouard Karemera and the date the 20th of June 1994.  But the text is exactly the same. 

So Madam -- excuse me, if -- Dr. Des Forges, if you could direct your attention to that document, which is two pages in its English translation, and bring our attention to anything that is significant in terms of the points that you have been making recently.  I'm particularly concerned with the reference to bladed weapons on page 2.  But there may be other items that you care to mention. 
A.	This is one of the documents which most clearly makes the link between the idea of civilian self-defence and the activities of the militia, which were commonly acknowledged to be attacking and killing Tutsi.  

Here is one of the places where you see the intersection and where you see the government acting as a whole as a cabinet of ministers, making a decision which shows that in their eyes the militia are, in fact, the civilian self-defence force.  They are incorporated in the civilian self-defence force. 

And you'll see that -- this has to do with authorising the préfets -- directing the préfets about what kinds of expenses are legitimate for money which has been distributed to them, previous to this. 
So on the 13th of June each préfet got a sum of money which had been collected from various sources inside Rwanda and outside of Rwanda.  There were actually a fund set up in the United States, in a 
US bank, for this purpose, until Human Rights Watch discovered it and was able to get the 
US government to close it.  This money was distributed to the préfectures and each préfet got this, and you'll see this in the second paragraph, "In order to create a préfectural cash resource for auto civilian self-defence" - yeah, préfectural civilian self-defence fund it's called in English. 

All right, so then the minister of interior who has just been named and who is busy cleaning up his shop and putting things in order gives the following directives about how this money is to be -- to be spent.  And if you look at the first item under A, it's translated in the English, "Catering expenses for the militiamen". 

Well, this isn't exactly the sense of the French version.  The French version is (French spoken) -- refreshments, really, for the militiamen.  Catering, sort of, gives the idea, you know, of a white tablecloth and candle sticks; that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about alcohol and drugs to be distributed to the people at the barriers and doing the rounds to give them the energy to keep on doing what they were doing.  So that's what the civilian self-defence fund is to provide for.  

In addition, the (French spoken) is also the beer and cattle and sheep and goats given to militiamen after they have carried out massacres in order to allow them to properly celebrate their "victory".  So that's what that term means. 

The second item under that, "means of transport at the time of interventions".  What is that?  That's the petrol.  That's the gasoline to go in the trucks, and the minibuses and the vans to carry the militiamen to the site of the attacks.  This also is a civilian self-defence fund expense. 

So the fuel and maintenance and repairs of vehicles and so on, health expense for those wounded in action, intelligence and information expenses, and so on -- instruments to signal the presence of the enemy, I don't think it means -- I don't think it means literally instruments to signal the enemy.  It means instruments to signal the presence of the enemy, obviously.  But then, under that, "purchasing of 
armes blanche" -- that is to say, the purchase of machetes, spears and other forms of weapons which are not firearms. 

So, again, you see this link here between the kinds of weapons used primarily during attacks against unarmed civilians as being an appropriate use of the government money of the civilian self-defence fund.  And then you get such wonderfully innocuous things as "standard office equipment" to be used by the coordination committees.  A small insight into the bureaucratic nature of Rwandan political life; that you also need office equipment for your militia and your civilian self-defence.  Why?  So that they could record properly their expenses.  

And look at number B, which is extremely interesting.  Letter B is for "Préfectures not yet affected by the war."  Why do you need transport costs to intervention zones as well as "catering" -- that is, refreshments?  Why do you need to buy machetes in zones that are not at war? 

Well, because the people you're attacking are not necessarily a combatant force because there are Tutsi throughout the country -- even in the zones not at war.  So here you are, to use your money -- even if you're not at war to buy your machetes, to pay for moving the militia around and to pay for rewarding them for their massacres.  So it's a really remarkable document. 
Q.	Thank you.  So we've covered in great detail the civil-defence program.  You've given us its antecedence going all the way back to the 1960s and its more recent form in 1993.  What interests me now, is the programme of pacification because, I believe, in your expert report you mentioned that as another policy -- articulated policy of the interim government.  You've mentioned that word before but could you spend a bit more time with it now and explain to us what was meant by pacification and how that programme worked?  
A.	We've seen in the documents presented here the repeated calls for security and for ensuring that innocent people not be attacked.  We have also talked about the April 11th meeting and then the 
	April 18th and 19th meetings as part of this programme of pacification, which was carried out by government ministers after a decision of the government to take this programme into the various préfectures to ensure that the message gets distributed. 

The use of pacification -- that term in the context of the time, clearly did not mean to pacify.  It meant to restore security in the sense of eliminating the enemy, the enemy defined as Tutsi civilians -- including Tutsi civilians. 

What is apparent from the context of the time -- from the behaviour of Rwandans and how they took that message and believed that message to be meant, is confirmed by the statements of Kambanda himself in repeated form in which he says, "pacification was merely a cover; it was the government giving approval to the killing carried out by the militia and other forms of killing."

The -- one example of this is the pacification meeting in Butare, which resulted in the removal of the préfet and where the killing began the next day.  With the arrival of militia and soldiers on the spot sent from the capital to carry out the killing, including the killing of those Hutu who refused to cooperate in the killing of Tutsi.  

Another example is Kibuye on May the 3rd where the prime minister gives a speech, again before the assembled dignitaries of the préfecture, along with the heads of the various political parties and again makes all of the same pronouncements and calls for peace and security and so on and so forth.  But also in the course of his speech, mentions that the authorities have written proof that in every commune in the country there are organised RPF brigades waiting to attack and kill Hutu and people must protect themselves; it is an exercise in self-defence. 

So that speech -- another perfect example of the double message sent.  And at the conclusion of that meeting, Dr. Hitimana, a Hutu physician in Kibuye, who had protected Tutsi orphans at the hospital, had the courage to stand up and ask, "What are we to do with the Tutsi orphans at the hospital?"  And there was no answer.  But when the meeting concluded, the militia attacked that hospital and killed the orphans; that was the answer. 
Q.	Thank you.  If we could look at another document now and I would like to direct your attention to tab 6 in your working binder.  For others, this would be P. 41, tab 41.  This is in the separate binder of transcripts of radio broadcasts.  It's in volume 4 -- I'm sorry, not volume 4, it's a separate volume.  If we were to refer to the identifying information for the audio tape itself, it would be KT001092.  Once again, it's P. 41, the exhibit number, tab 41 and it's a transcript of a broadcast from the 4th of May 1994.  I believe it's only available in French, and Dr. Des Forges, if you have it in front of you?  
A.	I do. 
Q.	I'm interested in the second and third paragraphs on that page.  But if you just took a moment to read through it, we don't necessarily have to read the text, but you can comment on the text and read those portions of it that you think are more significant. 

I believe you may find parallels to some of the things that you've just been discussing, if you could bring that to our attention.  
A.	It's a conversation between a journalist and the prime minister in which the journalist calls attention to the fact that there's a provisional government made up solely of Hutu.  And the prime minister says, "We say that the population has to defend itself against an aggression, come from the outside, come from Uganda, and under the pseudonym of the RPF."  And the journalist says, "By all means, 
	Mr. Prime Minister?"  In other words, they're to defend themselves by all means.  Kambanda's answer is:  "By all means.  It's understood, of course, by all means." 
Q.	I'm going to have to interrupt you a bit.  I have to correct the record because actually we've jumped ahead a bit.  There are three documents in that section of your binder. 
A.	I'm sorry.
Q.	We're skipping over the first two and going directly to the last -- the last of the documents there.  And it's identified at the bottom of the page for you as P. 41, tab 41. 

And at the top of the page you'll see it's dated the 4th of May 1994, and the K number that identifies that first page is K0344807.  So if you have that document in front of you, that's the one that concerns me now. 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Okay.
A.	This is a news broadcast on Rwandan radio concerning the campaign for pacification and it's a description of how this campaign has taken place in the préfecture of Gisenyi, particularly at the sous-préfecture of Ngorero where members of the government have gone to discuss with local préfectural and sub-préfectural authorities the appropriate strategies for ending the trouble which have -- have shaken the country, ethnic troubles exacerbated by the continuing attacks of the RPF. 

And it says that the meeting was chaired by the sous-préfet of the Ngorero, and the meeting was attended by ministers Nyiramasuhuko, Pauline and Dr. Rwamakuba, André, along with other members of the central administration and of the préfectural administration, including Callixte Kalimanzira, who is a figure known for his virulence and leading anti-Tutsi killings in Butare, and Mr. Shingiro Mbony-Mutua who is an important figure in MDR-Hutu Power circles.  So these were the people who were present at this meeting for the so-called pacification of this area in Gisenyi where, in fact, a significant number of Tutsi had already been massacred. 
Q.	Thank you.  We're going to skip ahead again and I would like to direct you to tab 7 in your working binder.  The rest of us will look at item number 62 on the Prosecutor's exhibit list.  It's in the volume 4 of the main file.  This is a newspaper article from the United States, in fact, that is dated the 25th of April.  It has an IP number; it was marked for identification.  I believe it was already moved into evidence, but I don't have a P number for it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe the registry could assist with this and clarify for me.  We debated this on my team a few days ago because I remember it as being marked into evidence, but we weren't able to find the number for it, and I believe we did contact the registry to try to clarify that issue and we haven't resolved it yet.  But if the registry could clarify it.  In any case, the witness will look at it and comment on it, and if it's not been marked in identification -- marked in evidence already, we will do it at the conclusion of this session.
THE WITNESS:
	This is a news report based on a statement by a UN spokesman in Kigali; that 170 hospital patients were slaughtered in Butare on Sunday.  That would have been -- the Sunday would have been what day -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, what is the heading of the document? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The document -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The K number would be sufficient for me. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The K number is K0018569. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  My note is that it was marked for identification IP4.  But it was probably our omission in not to admit it and given it an exhibit number, so perhaps we should do that now, if there is no objection. 
MR. O'SHEA:
No objection, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the number, Mr. Fry? 
THE WITNESS:
The paragraph -- 
MR. FRY:
Excuse me, Your Honour, P. 57 is the next.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. P. 57. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 57 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'm sorry we interrupted you.  Please continue. 
A.	Yeah, the paragraph in question reports on the killing of 170 hospital patients in Butare.  It says that this happened on Sunday.  The newspaper article is dated April 25th, so that would have been on the 
	23rd of April 1994, and the news item said also that the United Nations was getting disturbing reports of other massacres in that countryside. 
Q.	I do have a calendar from 1994 in front of me, and according to this calendar April 1994, Sunday was the 24th and Monday was the 25th.
A.	I see that on the next news article as well.  It's dated -- the date line is Monday, April 25th. 
Q.	All right.  So turning our attention to the next item, which is number 63 on the Prosecutor's list, it was also marked for identification. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	These four items were never given a P number.  I would assume that we can move that into evidence as P. 58. 
(Exhibit No. P. 58 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The K number that identifies the first page of that document is K0032381.  It's only available in English.  But if -- Dr. Des Forges, if you could direct your attention to the bottom half of that page, could you comment on the content of this particular document. 
A.	This is a New York Times report from April 25th referring to the same incident of the killing of 170 patients at the hospital in Butare, here with the added detail that it was not just patients but staff members who were massacred in the hospital. 

And it goes on to say that people who were, most of them members of the minority Tutsi ethnic group, were hunted down like animals as they hid in woods and forests.
(Pages 62 to 71 by Jean Baigent)















1650H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  Now, Dr. Des Forges, during this period, if I'm not mistaken, you were working with 
	Human Rights Watch and were commenting in international circles in the US and Europe on the events that are transpiring in Rwanda.  Do you have any independent recollection of your employer, or your organisation commenting on these same incidents? 
A.	I do recall dealing with that information in part from reports by the humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders, whose representatives had been present in the hospital at that time, as well as UN reports.  And we either put out a press release relating to these massacres, or in any case, I did a great deal of advocacy in the form of calls and visits to government officials in the US and in Europe, drawing attention to the serious extension of violence against Tutsi into Butare préfecture as represented by that massacre at Butare hospital. 
Q.	I'd now like to address our attention -- your attention, actually, to tab 7 in your working binder from the item that is identified as P. 41, tab 40.  It's number 40 on the Prosecutor's exhibit list.  It's identified as P. 41 in evidence, tab 40 in that separate bundle of radio transcripts.  But for you, Dr. Des Forges, you would look at tab 7, and I believe it's towards the back of that section and what concerns me, at the bottom you will see an indication P. 41, tab 40.  It should be the second to last item on the list.  Give me one moment.  

It's actually the second item at the beginning of the tab for Dr. Des Forges, at the top of the document, identified by K00337536.  It refers to an audio tape that's identified as KT001081, it's dated 27th of April 1994.  Have you been able to locate it? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'm a bit slow, can you help me?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sure.  If you look at the binder of broadcasts, it's the fifth binder that you have.  That binder was admitted into evidence as P. 41.  I believe it's volume III in the main file, but the whole binder was admitted as P. 41, and it's at tab 40.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	We only have it in the original Kinyarwanda with a French translation.  There is no English translation, but it's a very are short sentence.  Perhaps you can read it to us, Dr. Des Forges in French.  
A.	This is identified as an extract from Radio Rwanda, apparently a news broadcast, and it says: 
	"... Dr. André Rwamakuba refuses the information that was being broadcast by a foreign radio station, talking about the massacre of about 200 people by members of the national army who might have found the victims in the Butare hospital."  
Q.	Thank you.  Would you have any insight into this type of broadcast where you have a government minister speaking on the national radio about incidents of violence or alleged incidents and denial of such incidents?  Was that part of a policy of the interim government or is there anything that you can bring to this broadcast that would make it more intelligible for us today? 
A.	As we saw in the speech of the prime minister in Butare, he pointed out that not all members of the government were present because some had been sent on missions abroad, and in that connection, I stated that it was, in fact, the government policy to attempt to convince members of the international committee, particularly certain key governments and the press, that what was going on in Rwanda was unfortunate spontaneous violence that the government was doing its best to limit and, indeed, to end.  This position which was clearly untrue, was carried forward by various government ministers in foreign meetings, press meetings in Nairobi; for Minister Mugenzi and Mr. Ngirumpatse, meetings at the UN in New York; for Mr. Bicumpaka and Mr. Barayagwiza, meetings in Tunis at the OAU, everywhere.  Also I heard representatives of the interim government in Geneva at the meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission, always saying the same story, always saying, "Yes, there may have been some violence.  It's been greatly exaggerated but, in fact, Tutsi are not being killed, they are not being targeted in large numbers."  And, alternatively, the explanation, "Yes, this did, in fact, unfortunately in some places, but it was spontaneous and we are doing our best to end it.  Indeed, we have already ended."  

So you can take your choice of which variant of the story you wish to use at any given moment, but there was a conscious policy of disinformation vis-à-vis the international community.  And this I would conclude fits within that because certainly by the 27th of April, a minister in the interim government must have been well aware of the massacre at Butare hospital on the 23rd and 24th of April. 
Q.	Now, Dr. Des Forges, we are about to finish up with this portion of your testimony.  I'm going to be completing my direct examination in a few minutes, but I would like to ask you a few concluding questions.  At the top of the list is whether you would characterise the policies of the interim government as genocidal, and, if so, at what point could you say they became recognisably genocidal, and why would you draw that conclusion?  And, if you don't, tell us -- tell us why not? 
A.	For me, the initial clear demonstration of the governmental policy, as opposed to what may have been the policy of certain political leaders or certain military leaders, but the clear demonstration of government policy came out on April 11th with the meeting of the préfets when ministers of the government were all informed in clear and explicit language about what was happening in different parts of the country and collectively agreed to let that happen without any form of active intervention, restricting their "urgent measures" simply to language, and to no effective change in the personnel who were responsible for killings, with no punishments, with no arrests, with no judicial process, all of which were well within the capacity of this government to execute.  That -- I would say that indication of policy in the direction of genocide is clearly reinforced and restated on the 18th and 19th of April with the meetings with local administrators in those préfectures where killings had not been widespread.  And with the removal of the préfet of Butare and with his eventual execution, with the execution of the bourgmestre of Mugina and Gitarama, with no consequences for those killings, the policy was once again underlined as it was clearly stated by the prime minister and the president:  "You are either with us or against us in this fight and this fight is going to be carried out to the finish against those Tutsi whom we are identifying as part of the enemy." 
Q.	If -- if the only evidence -- and this is a hypothetical question -- if the only evidence that was put forward to connect a government minister with a policy of the interim government was his presence at the meeting in Butare on the 19th of April, that we've already discussed in great detail, if we restricted our examination to that meeting alone, the things that were said, and things that were readily observable on that day, do you think that would be sufficient to make it clear what the policy substance of the interim government were? 
A.	The convoy of government officials that left Gitarama and went to Butare on the 18th or 19th of April, depending which day they travelled, must necessarily have encountered numerous barriers at which Tutsi were being stopped; would, in all likelihood have seen the evidence of killing alongside the road; certainly those persons in the convoy had already seen the evidence of killing of people in the city of Kigali, killing of Tutsi civilians at barriers, to participate in a public way with a meeting, the intent of which was clearly to discipline, humiliate and remove one of the very few important public figures opposed to the killing, to me is a clear statement that the persons involved in that meeting consciously accepted the policy of the government which was to kill Tutsi, to regard them as banished from the protection of ordinary law because they had been defined as the enemy. 
Q.	Thank you.  And to conclude, Dr. Des Forges, is there anything in relation to your testimony today that would benefit from any greater emphasis or any further elaboration that will assist this Tribunal in appreciating your expert opinion evidence?  Is there anything that I have neglected to ask you that you think should be brought to our attention now that I am on my last question? 
A.	The -- it's clear that there were differences among members of the government on a variety of issues, but in the end it was a government that operated by consensus.  It was a government that did nothing to punish the killing of Tutsi, that rewarded people who encouraged in active killing of Tutsi and, therefore, whatever other differences that existed on partisan or political grounds among the members of government, they were united, at least in a public acceptance of this policy and are responsible for its consequences. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And, with your leave, I have concluded, Your Honour.  

If I may, though, I would like to suggest -- there is administerial matters that we have to address, the admission of the various exhibits that have not been marked and identified, but I would suggest that we do that at a later time.  We can even do that on a completely different day, unless the Defence is going to object to anything that we have discussed today being entered into evidence, but to push ahead, I suggest that we take care of those details at another time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I would suggest -- I think the Defence also has one or two outstanding exhibits to put in.  And maybe that you can get together and you can put them in as a bundle tomorrow afternoon.  

Thank you very much, Mr. Webster.  

Dr. Des Forges, it's now the time for the cross-examination.  We are coming to the end of our judicial term and we'll be sitting later than usual today.  We hope to sit up to approximately 6:30 and then we'll resume tomorrow.  And although Friday is normally a half day, we intend to sit into the afternoon until approximately 4 o'clock in the hope that we can conclude your testimony by that time.  

Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, thank you.  Your Honour, there is one matter that I am duty bound to draw to your attention which has occurred literally within the last hour.  I have received correspondence from my client referring to documentation my client wishes to discuss with me.  Now, that may have a bearing on how we've viewed matters up to now.  So I want to mention that quickly because I realise that it's -- it --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I would suggest that we -- we rise for two or three minutes.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I do not think it would make good sense to commence the cross-examination of Dr. Des Forges, if the odds are in favour of not completing your cross-examination.  So we'd just like to give us a minute or two to see if this new information impacts on that position.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, yes.  I'm -- I'm -- I'd like to indicate, however, that for my part, even if I can't complete, I would prefer to start.  The reason being this:  That I can section my cross-examination, and if there is going to be a long period of time between now and when we next meet, it would be disadvantageous to me, having reached a point in preparation, if I can put it that way, from an advocate's point of view.  So my clear preference would be to begin and I can -- I can section it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, still sit until 6:30 but we will -- at time we will evaluate whether we sit late tomorrow afternoon or not because it would be -- there would be no point in inconveniencing the entire Tribunal staff if you are not going to complete her examination.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, quite.  

May I, however, also ask for a very short break, if that's not inappropriate?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now?  Right now?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Right now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Five minutes, ten minutes?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Ten minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take a short break now.

(Court resumed at 1730H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's necessary for me to direct that you use your good offices to allow Defence counsel to have an opportunity to interview this client this evening.  It's all likelihood we'll still be able to stick to our stated schedule, if that could be arranged with the Registrar.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, I'll inform the appropriate parties.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Dr. Des Forges, your cross-examination will commence now.  We should go for about an hour this evening and reconvene at 8:45 tomorrow. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Most grateful. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Dr. Des Forges, I note from your CV that you have a position as an adjunct professor.  Is that at the university of Buffalo?  Do you still have that position? 
A.	The title is probably still there but, in effect, I am not teaching at the moment.  Since it's an unpaid position, it is not the kind of thing that one pays an awful lot of attention to if one does not have time to participate in the teaching load. 
Q.	I quite understand.  But it's an adjunct position, therefore you are entitled to a title, so shall I refer to you as Professor Des Forges? 
A.	As you prefer. 
Q.	And Professor Des Forges, I know you have a great deal of experience before this Tribunal and you, yourself, are aware how slowly things can move.  Therefore, I'd like to ask you to try to answer my questions as directly as you feel reasonably able to so that we can attempt to fit within the schedule that His Honours indicate.  

Now, you've written a book on behalf of Human Rights Watch and I think the (French spoken) entitled, "Leave None to Tell the Story", which was published in English and French in 1999.  Would it be correct to say that this is your most extensive research project and publication on the genocide in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Have you conducted any further research projects on the genocide in Rwanda involving field research following the publication of that book? 
A.	Yes, my responsibilities to Human Rights Watch include the ongoing documentation of human rights violations in Rwanda, as well as in other parts of Central Africa, and in that connection I saw no time limit.  So, if I have the opportunity to learn something more about the events of 1994, I do so. 
Q.	Have you conducted any specific research projects involving sending people out into the field to look for documents and speak to witnesses in Rwanda concerning the genocide following 1999? 
A.	There may have been one or two particular instances where I asked a colleague to check on a given piece of information, but, in general, because I am the person who ordinarily is involved in trials involving genocide, ordinarily I would be the person, rather than a colleague who would attempt to locate other information. 
Q.	And would that include interviewing witnesses? 
A.	It could include interviewing witnesses, looking for documents, attempting to find information in a variety of ways, yes. 
Q.	On how many occasions have you done that since 1999, can you estimate? 
A.	It's difficult.  I would say it's very difficult, perhaps a hundred or fewer.  I really haven't thought -- haven't tried to organise my work in that way, so it's difficult for me to say, without actually sitting down and looking at notes and so on, to be sure of that. 
Q.	I understand, I just wanted a picture.  Some time has passed since 1999.  With hindsight and with benefit of time, are there significant matters -- and I'm not here referring to minor errors in footnotes -- are there any significant matters that you would change in your book? 
A.	I would say that the information to which I have had access since 1999 has confirmed the general lines of interpretation presented in the book.  There have been, I would say, an addition of nuance and depth, of greater realisation of complexity of events and dynamics of events than were reflected in the research up until that time, but the general lines remain unchanged. 
Q.	So your fundamental conclusions have remain unchanged? 
A.	In terms of such important elements as the role of the state, the participation of the actors from the military civilians sphere, from the political sphere, those have remained unchanged. 
Q.	So, would it be fair to say that your own conclusions on the causes and effects of the genocide was substantially reached at the time of the publication of your book in 1999? 
A.	For the general lines of interpretation, yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Professor Des Forges, have you received a binder -- a Defence binder, bundle? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honours, have Your Honours received the Defence bundle?  

I don't know if the interpreters are happy they have the necessary bundles.  

And perhaps the registry would like one for an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is only in paper form. 

MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, yes, there are no videos, if that's what Your Honour means.  Oh, I see, there's no -- no, Your Honour, there is no electronic version.  I'm afraid I only learned how to copy and paste from my legal assistant.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought I would have to use a quarter of the (unintelligible). 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	Professor Des Forges, if you refer to tab 1 in the Defence bundle, you will there see an extract from the French version of your book.  I notice the page numbers have been Xed out, but I believe the page numbers may be page 38, I believe I'm right about that.  The reason why I refer to the French, because I notice that there are some differences between the French and the English.  I'm not sure why that is.  That's not anything of significance.  On the second half of that page, the final paragraph, you say this, Human Rights Watch (French spoken) recall that the presumption of innocence is a fundamental right and that nothing in the report can be interpreted as reversing that presumption.  Do you stand by that statement and believe in it? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	How do you see your role before this Court today?  How do you perceive your role? 
A.	I perceive my role as a person who can assist the Court in appreciating the historical context through which various individuals played a role in a period of tragic developments, where history and crime intersect. 
Q.	Do you see yourself as a witness of historical context? 
A.	Well, I would say more than a witness, as an analyst, and scholar, as a specialist who can assist the Court in understanding the context, not simply as an observer but as a person who has made a study of the events making use of the scholarly tools in order to reach conclusions based upon information about those events, so that is more than simply a witness. 
Q.	Do you see it as part of your role to support the Prosecution case? 
A.	I see it as part of my role to present the description of a historical context in the most accurate and truthful way that I can, as clearly as I can.  In instances where my interpretation does not coincide with that of the Prosecution's I would not hesitate to say so. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, now there's nothing wrong with this at all, but I would just like to ask you, in preparation for your evidence for this case, how much time have you spent with Prosecution discussing your evidence with this case?  I am sorry, there is nothing wrong with that. 
A.	I would say four to five hours. 
Q.	Now, I am aware of six trials in which you have appeared.  During your examination-in-chief you mentioned nine.  Could you, perhaps, list the trials in which you have appeared? 
A.	Akayesu, Gacumbitsi, Butare, Media, Military I, Government II -- Government I, yeah, Government I, that is to be clear because sometimes I confuse these, the trial involving Mr. Mugenzi. 
Q.	Government II. 
A.	Thank you, Government II, the current trial. 
Q.	Rwamakuba.  
A.	Yeah, but I think I'm missing one. 
Q.	You've mentioned Government I, but Government I is the former name of Karemera.  
A.	No, I wasn't counting that.  I meant Government II. 
Q.	In your CV --
MR. WEBSTER:
Would you like me to assist in that regard?  I believe the record would indicate she also testified in the Ndindabahizi trial. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	In your CV you also mention some national court proceedings as part of your experience but it's not clear to what extent those national court proceedings relate to Rwanda or other matters.  Could you perhaps clarify that? 
A.	I appeared before a military court martial in Switzerland, which tried a civilian mayor of the commune of Mucubati, I believe, for violations of the Geneva convention during 1994.  He was found guilty.  

I appeared at two jury trials at the (French spoken) in Brussels, one in 2000, I believe it was, and one several weeks ago.  

In addition, in terms of experience for the ICTR, I prepared an expert witness report for a trial in which I did not appear.  That was the trial of Colonel Simba.  

I also prepared submissions to U.S. District Court in the United States in connection with a civil suit against Jean Bosco Baryagwiza, and I have appeared in perhaps eight or nine administrative proceedings related to immigration issues having to do with persons accused of having committed genocide, and those were in the United States, in Canada, and in Belgium. 
Q.	Have you ever given evidence on behalf of Defence in national or international court proceedings? 
A.	I intervened in the sense of preparing information and a memorandum, that is in the French sense of (French spoken).  

In relation to an indictment at the ICTR, which was subsequently withdrawn in that case, I obtained access to Belgian military archives, which substantiated my own research regarding the impossibility that the major counts of this indictment could, in fact, be factually accurate.  And, as a result of the memorandum which I prepared on that issue, and perhaps other information available to the Prosecutor's office, the indictment was withdrawn. 
Q.	Ma'am, if I could perhaps move on to the parameters of your expertise, the scope, strength, limitations, it would be correct to say, wouldn't it, your expertise extends beyond Rwanda? 
A.	I work as well in Burundi and generally in the Congo, primarily in the eastern part of the Congo. 
Q.	You say you also have expertise on Burundi? 
A.	In a general sense I have expertise on Burundi, but I have never done the same level of historical research there as I have done in Rwanda. 
Q.	And what about Congo, not Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo? 
A.	I was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo, not Congo, Brazzaville.  My experience and work there is the most limited of the work in these three countries. 
Q.	Would you accept that you are not a military expert? 
A.	In the sense of understanding military strategy or identifying weapons, I am not a military expert.  In a sense of a historian who has a general knowledge of the development of certain military campaigns, I would say I have some level of knowledge, but perhaps not still what would be qualified as real expertise. 
Q.	That would be expertise as a historian? 
A.	That would be expertise as a historian and not as a military officer. 
Q.	Because as a historian you are an expert in history, you inevitably have to look at different aspects of human society.  I would say in that sense you know about aspects of the military which are relevant to your historical studies, would that be a fair way to put it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And would it also be fair to say that you are not an anthropologist? 
A.	I do not have a degree in anthropology but I did do a substantial amount of my graduate training in anthropology and in political science.  The degree of masters in African studies, which I received at Yale, was a degree that composed studies outside of the disciplinary field of history. 
Q.	What degree of expertise do you have in psychology? 
A.	I'm a mother. 
Q.	Is that the extent of it? 
A.	I have no formal training in psychology. 
Q.	Would you accept that you are not an expert in criminology? 
A.	I am not a trained expert in criminology, however I would say that I have absorbed a considerable amount of working knowledge in the last decade. 
Q.	Would you accept that you are not an expert in Rwandan constitutional law? 
A.	I dislike venturing into fields of constitutional law, for sure.  I have a brief acquaintance with the broad outlines of constitutions but I am not an expert in constitutional law. 
Q.	And I suppose it would be fair to say you are not an expert in international law? 
A.	That is correct, although Human Rights Watch does supply training to its employees in the field of the basic international legal conventions that deal with human rights issues. 
Q.	Would it also be correct to say you are not an expert in linguistics?
A.	I am not an expert in linguistics. 
Q.	If I may come to your knowledge of Kinyarwanda, you explained to the Court that you have a passive knowledge and that you can read documents.  That would appear to indicate that you recognise some limitation to your knowledge of Kinyarwanda.  Would it be right to say that you could not, for example, give your evidence in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	That is accurate.

1755H
BY MR. O'SHEA: 
Q.	Would it follow that you could not have a fluent, intellectual debate in Kinyarwanda? 
A.	Could not discuss Quil Gilgard (phonetic) in Kinyarwanda, definitely not. 
Q.	This is a question, which, perhaps, most witnesses have been asked but, perhaps, not you; I don't know.  Where were you between the 6th of April 1994 and the 15th of July 1994? 
A.	I was in many places.  I could not even give you the list of places without a great deal of effort.  They were not, however, inside of Rwanda. 
Q.	You have indicated, I think, that you have 40 years of experience with regard to Rwanda.  Do you remember when and in what circumstances was your first contact with Rwandese? 
A.	I remember that very well. 
Q.	Could you tell us about that? 
A.	I was an undergraduate at Radcliffe College, Harvard University, and bored by the study of European history.  I spent a substantial amount of time working as a volunteer in various social service activities coordinated at Harvard under a student-run organisation known as Phillip Brooks House.  At that time, there were a significant number of young African students at the university who observed our volunteer work and encouraged us to do similar kinds of work in various African countries.  

And with that supreme confidence of youth, we decided to do just that.  And a group of us organised a teaching project which was to provide secondary education for South African refugees in                   Dar-es-Salaam in order to enable them to complete their secondary education and have access to university scholarships abroad.  We raised money for this work.  We did some preliminary training of ourselves for this work.  And as we were about to embark, we received a request from Oxfam, which had a person working in Rwandan refugee camps in Western Tanzania, to provide two teachers who spoke French, who could assist in a teaching programme at a teacher-training college in western Tanzania where there were Rwandan students enrolled.  

Two of us were fluent in French and agreed to do this.  But once we had arrived in Western Tanzania, there had been a problem and the students had been expelled from the college.  As a result, we ended up teaching in a primary school in a refugee camp located about 100 miles from Bugogo in western Tanzania. 
Q.	What year was this? 
A.	That was 1963. 
Q.	Do you know what the political situation in Rwanda was at that time? 
A.	It was the period when a significant number, that is tens of thousands, and eventually, hundreds of thousands of Rwandese had fled the country and were living in refugee camps in the surrounding country -- the surrounding countries around Rwanda, and where there was considerable  tension building inside of Rwanda.  

After I left the refugee camp in 1963, there was the incursion, which we alluded to briefly, into Rwanda by Rwandan refugee militia, which then provoked large scale killing at Christmas time in 1963.  
Q.	And the refugees that you were teaching, what ethnic group were they? 
A.	I mentioned in my introductory comments about the history of this period, that the refugees who fled in those early years were not exclusively Tutsi, but, rather, were those Tutsi who had had positions of power in the colonial administration, and their dependents, or their clients, or their clientage, those people in a clientage relationship with them, and that included Hutu as well as Twa.  So that the population in the camp where I taught was predominantly Tutsi, but not exclusively so. 
Q.	So, did that young experience have quite an impact upon you? 
A.	It did. 
Q.	Did it, at all, direct your career? 
A.	Certainly, in the sense that the discovery of the richness and complexities of Rwandan history appeared to me far more interesting at that point than the separatist movement of eastern France and 
	Alsace lorraine, so that when I returned to the United States, I focused my study far move on the history of Africa, not exclusively Rwanda, but the history of Africa, and eventually did my doctoral dissertation in Rwanda. 
Q.	Do you think that you are at all personally affected by the stories you heard when you were doing that teaching back in 1963? 
A.	We were two young and totally inexperienced teachers, which is one reason that I say it was only the arrogance of youth to make us think that we had anything to contribute.  As a result, we were 
	hard-pressed to keep up with the burden of teaching, each of us teaching two levels of primary school during the day, teaching the teachers themselves after school because they were qualified Rwandan teachers, but they did not know English, so they could not become salaried staff in a Tanzanian school.  So teaching them and then at the end of that, running a medical clinic, because the closest source of medical assistance was 100 miles away.  

I would say that our days were extremely full and the opportunities to discuss history or personal accounts of refugees were extremely limited.  And limited, as well, by the question of language, because the numbers of people who spoke French fluently were relatively few.  So, it was not in any sense a systematic attempt to understand the various accounts of refugees.  There was just no time for that, but certainly coming into contact for the first time with people who had experienced a drastic reversal of their fortunes was for me an important experience. 
Q.	Would you describe yourself as a human rights activist? 
A.	Now or then?  
Q.	Now.  
A.	I would describe myself as a historian of central Africa, who has a pressing and urgent concern for human rights issues in the region.  Some people have described this as being a human rights activist, but I do not have a great deal of problem with that description. 
Q.	Well, if I was to describe a human rights activist as a person who believed that they wished to make a substantial contribution towards promoting the protection of human rights, would that be a fair description of you? 
A.	That is, indeed, an idea which moves me, yes. 
Q.	So, if we use that term human rights activist in that way, when would you say you began to become a human rights activist? 
A.	In the early 1990's.  I can't put a date to it, but in the early 1990's. 
Q.	Was there any defining moment as to why you embarked upon that particular mission? 
A.	Initially, it was a result of coincidence.  At the time when Human Rights Watch, or what was then called Africa Watch was established, and needed an administrative board, most of the people invited to join that board were people from the world of media or law, and there were very few who had any knowledge of Africa.  

Because I had an acquaintance with somebody already involved with the Latin American part of Human Rights Watch, I was asked to join that board.  And I did so.  That was in 1988.  In 1991 after the killings of Tutsis became known more generally, Human Rights Watch decided to send a mission to document those killings.  And I was asked to be the person to do that.  The organisation did not have the money to hire someone.  There was an intern, who was unpaid, and there was me.  And the two of us went, and that was my first experience in documenting human rights abuses. 
Q.	Who would you consider to be the foremost expert on the Rwanda conflict of 1994, other than yourself? 
A.	Filip Reyntjens, André Guichaoua.  There are a number of younger scholars whose work is just becoming known, which is very interesting, and who will -- who showed the promise of becoming recognised authorities in this field.  In addition, there are others who have a considerable amount to contribute in terms of personal observations, but who are not -- what shall I say -- who are not particularly scholars devoted to the study of Rwanda, but, rather, Rwandans who make intelligent and perceptive comments on the events of that period. 
Q.	Other than André Guichaoua and Filip Reyntjens, could you give other names?  You mentioned that there was, maybe a couple of promising experts?
A.	Younger scholars coming along, yes.  Scott Straus has done some interesting work, which is not yet published; Jenny Burnett is another; Catherine and David Newbury are recognised historians of this region, who have not published extensively on the genocide, but who are concluding a general history of Rwanda, which I am sure will deal with the genocide.  Claudine Vidal has published a number of serious pieces of work on the issues of genocide.  
Q.	Is there anybody, Rwandan, who could be described as an expert on the conflict? 
A.	About a year and a half ago, a scholar based in the United States undertook to organise an international meeting to bring together foreign and Rwandan scholars to discuss new research on the genocide.  In fact, the scholars who were finally available and willing to attend to discuss the genocide, included one who is based outside of Rwanda, and another who is based -- was based at that time inside of Rwanda, but no longer is.  

So, unfortunately, the younger generation of Rwandan scholars has not, as yet, emerged in terms of publicly presenting their scholarship. 
Q.	So there is no recognised Rwandan expert, I think, would summarise what you have just said? 
A.	I would say that I am not aware of a scholar who has undertaken to study the genocide in a scholarly fashion, who has, as yet, published his or her work. 
Q.	Would you consider yourself to be the paramount expert on the causes and effects of the Rwandan genocide of 1994 or would you accord that accolade to somebody else? 
A.	It is not a topic that I have ever spent any time considering.  In the field of scholarship, we are accustomed to a give-and-take among people knowledgeable about a given topic.  I suppose there may be some scholars who spend a great deal of time trying to decide whether they are the paramount expert, but I am not one of them.  It does not interest me to be the paramount expert in anything. 
Q.	I would like now to ask you some questions about your research methodology, the research project which resulted in your book of 1999.  When did you begin that research project? 
A.	The gathering of information, in an informal way began in April 1994, in the sense of taking notes about information received and telephone calls on a daily basis from people in Rwanda.  In a more formal sense, another stage in the beginning of the research was in August 1994, when I first did interviews in Rwanda.  And, yet, a third stage, in terms of organisation, was reached in February of 1995, when  together with FIDH, Human Rights Watch was able to begin a more extensive research project, which involved the documentation, originally intended to be documentation, focused primarily on Butare, which then became a larger project involving national and international aspects of the genocide. 
Q.	Were you the one responsible for writing the book? 
A.	I am. 
Q.	When did you begin the writing process; do you remember? 
A.	Probably 1996, but it might have been 1997.  I think it was probably in the course of 1996. 
Q.	And when did you complete the manuscript? 
A.	Some time in late 1998 or early 1999, I would say, but I don't recall the date. 
Q.	So the manuscript was completed between two and two and a half years, the writing process? 
A.	Yes, the most intensive part of that was really done in the year 1998, but the beginning stages, the first chapters were drafted earlier.  And then in the year 1998, for a variety of reasons, I was more or less confined to the United States, and during that period did most of the concentrated writing. 
Q.	Were there any pressures of time that you felt in the production of the manuscript? 
A.	Yes, of course.

1815H
BY MR. O'SHEA:
Q.	When you began, I know you have indicated that there was various stages in what can be called "the beginning", but when you began, what did you describe as your research objective? 
A.	When we began, it was generally conceded that the judicial authorities in Rwanda were not yet well organised.  The concern I had immediately was for the retrieval and preservation of documents -- being perhaps influenced by my historical discipline, not wanting those papers to disappear. 

But beyond those sorts of immediate logistical concerns, the objective was to attempt to document the causes and the development of the genocide, recognising that the best information was most likely to be available as close to the events as possible. 
Q.	If you could turn to tab 2 in the Defence bundle.  Again, on the second half of that page, the last paragraph, third sentence, you say this:  "We stress that this work does not and is not meant to establish judicial truth as to the guilt or innocence of any person, which is the responsibility of legally established national and international tribunals." 

So would you agree with me that when you were defining your research objective it was not to establish judicial truth?  
A.	I think that's obvious.  It's not the purpose of a human rights organisations to establish truth.  It's the objective of human rights organisations to attempt to document and publicise violations of human rights in order to draw attention to them and in order to promote some remedy to those abuses.  And where this involves prosecution for crimes, that of course, is also encompassed in the objective. 
Q.	Would you agree that had it been your research objective to establish the guilt or innocence of individuals for the commission of international crimes your research methodology would have differed?  
A.	We were clearly not a team of prosecutors; that was not our intention and that is not what we did. 
Q.	Of course.  You are a historian and you would presumably agree that the research methods of a historian differ in significant respects from the methods of an inquiry of a court of law. 
A.	There is some overlap, but there are also obvious differences. 
Q.	So, for instance, would you agree that a historian might reach a conclusion on a historical fact, which would be -- to put it simply -- based on all the evidence available? 
A.	That is normally thought to be the province of historians, yes. 
Q.	You would not in that process insist on satisfying yourself that there was proof beyond all reasonable doubt of any specific fact? 
A.	We acknowledge the limitations of our own form of work -- that is, without access to subpoena, without access to any means of compelling testimony or responses to our questions.  We acknowledge that, of course, our information is that which is provided voluntarily by the people with whom we speak and by documents which we are able to obtain. 
Q.	So when people give information voluntarily, you, for your part, do not impose any limitations on how they present that evidence to you? 
A.	Impose limitations?  I would say no, we do not impose limitations.  But we do, of course, take information in a systematic -- we do subject information to a systematic examination and do attempt to discern where that information may or may not be correct. 
Q.	Yes.  But you don't have any procedural limitations in the way that evidence is presented to you? 
A.	Procedural in the sense of legal procedure? 
Q.	No.  Well, one could say akin to.  In a court of law there are certain procedures which are designed to protect the quality of the evidence that's presented to it.  Presumably when you have spoken to people you have simply spoken to them and heard their story and written it down.  Would that be fair? 
A.	And subjected it to some critical examination. 
Q.	Yes.  But that critical examination would occur once you have taken the story and you go away and you analyse what you have?
A.	That is accurate. 
Q.	So you do not, for instance, discount hearsay? 
A.	We recognise that quality of information differs and that one criterion for assessing the validity of information is whether or not the informant was a direct observer of the events -- that, of course, is simply good sense. 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	It is not the only criterion to apply because someone who is an eyewitness can lie just as well as someone who does not -- who was not an eyewitness, and may remember wrongly, as may someone who was not an eyewitness.  So it is simply one criterion which can be applied in a number of -- one of a number of criteria, which can be applied in assessing the usefulness or the accuracy of information. 
Q.	Yes.  I entirely accept that there's a degree of common sense in the fact that if someone witnesses something first hand, that's -- at least, in one sense, a better quality of evidence than somebody who says, "I heard it from somebody else."  But for your part in your research you do not exclude or discount hearsay? 
A.	No, but we value it -- we evaluate it in an appropriate way, keeping in mind what the source of information was.  As I say, sometimes information which comes from secondary sources can be as valid and accurate as information from the original source.  It depends on the intention of the person with whom you're speaking as well as upon other unintentional factors, which may cause people to remember wrongly or to have been influenced by other accounts of the event.  Even an eyewitness may "remember" events in a way that was not exactly as they unrolled -- as exactly as they developed because the person who was the direct eyewitness may subsequently have discussed it sufficiently with other people to have experienced a transformation in his own sense of what the events were.  I think that's commonly acknowledged. 
Q.	Yes.  You would presumably accept that the fact that you, as a historian, have reached a factual conclusion on a specific issue, it does not necessarily at all follow that a court of law should accept that conclusion.  That's  meant to be no criticism of your research methodology as a historian, but merely a recognition of the fact that the fact that a historian finds that something is the case, one would not always expect that a court would come to the same conclusion, because they follow different methods. Would that be fair? 
A.	As I said in the text here, we stress that this work is not meant to establish judicial truth.  In no way do we attempt to challenge the prerogative of judges who are professionally trained in establishing the judicial truth in a given case.  But we do submit our work -- not just myself, but I think, other expert witnesses do submit our work as a serious, considered evaluation of factual information based upon long study and experience in the region; that's the best we can do. 
Q.	Yes, but do you do that as a historian and as a human rights organisation with the objectives of a historian and a human rights organisation? 
A.	I pretend to be nothing else.
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, that would be a convenient moment. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please don't forget tomorrow morning to mark a pause after the question and the answer -- I'm sorry -- to help the court reporters.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now.  We will resume tomorrow morning at 8:45.
