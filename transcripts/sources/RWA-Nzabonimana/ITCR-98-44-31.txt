         1        could you please remind witness -- tell Witness LMR1 -- 

         2   MR. KIYEYEU: My Lord, yesterday, we were in closed session.  

         3        I don't know whether you would like to go in closed 

         4        session on this matter or rather in open session until 

         5        afterwards.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: We will go into closed session after this.  

         7        Will you tell Witness LMR1 that the Trial Chamber 

         8        reminds her of the solemn declaration she made and that 

         9        she will continue with her evidence today on that same 

        10        solemn declaration.  We will now go into closed session 

        11        because of the nature of the evidence of the witness 

        12        maybe linked to the identity of the witness. 

        13        Yes. 

        14

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  And your next 

         3        witness, Professor Hinds?  Or, Mr. Bompaka, your next 

         4        witness.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Our next witness would be SMR2, and we are 

         6        making the same application with respect to closed 

         7        session, given the relationship between this witness and 

         8        the Defendant, without going into the details.  It's the 

         9        same relationship as the previous witness, LMR1.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Prosecution.

        11   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honours.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: We will go into closed session to enable 

        13        counsel to raise questions with the witness which could 

        14        have a bearing on the identity of the witness.

        15             

        16        Registry, are we there?
