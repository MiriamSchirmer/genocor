         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the case coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         6        

         7        Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal

        11        session, today, Thursday the 12th of December 2002, for

        12        the continuation of the Defence case, when the Chamber 

        13        will consider the admission of exhibits and thereafter 

        14        followed by a status conference in the matter of the 

        15        Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No.   

        16        ICTR-98-44A-T.  

        17        

        18        Thank you, Mr. President. 

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.

        21        May we have the appearance of the parties for the 

        22        record, please?  May we start with the Prosecution?

        23   MS. OJEMENI: With due respect, Your Honour, Ifeoma Ojemeni, 

        24        trial attorney.  I appear with Dorthée Marotine, case 

        25        manager, for the Prosecution. 

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        27        

        28        May we also have the appearance for the Defence, please?

         1        Professor Bompaka, Mr. Emilien Dusabe and Juliette 

         2        Chinaud. 

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

         4        

         5        Yes.  May we move on to the issues of exhibits that were 

         6        stood over when the witnesses finished their 

         7        testimonies.  Prosecution, what do you have?  

         8   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honour, we are ready with two 

         9        statements of MEM and RGM -- the witnesses MEM and RGM.  

        10        We have given the Defence copies and we intend to tender 

        11        them as exhibits now. 

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: As highlighted?

        13   MS. OJEMENI: As highlighted.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: So, which statements?  Let us go -- 

        15   MS. OJEMENI: I will start with RGM, and we seek to tender the 

        16        statement of RGM dated 24th September 2001 as 

        17        Prosecution Exhibit P27. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: September -- 

        19   MS. OJEMENI: Of 24th September 2001, as highlighted.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: As Prosecution Exhibit P --

        21   MS. OJEMENI: P27.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection, Counsel for the Defence? 

        23   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Mr. President, Your Honours, we have 

        24        examined the passages highlighted by the Prosecution in 

        25        the document of RGM, and we have observed the following:  

        26        that Witness RGM clearly developed these passages during 

        27        his testimony before the Chamber.  We will have the 

        28        opportunity to develop our objections later on. 

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: You have currently no objection.

        30   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: Mr. President, I did say that we will be

         1        developing our objections later on, because the witness 

         2        developed these passages during his testimony before the 

         3        Chamber. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, in your submission -- but as far as the 

         5        admissibility of it, you have no problem with that one.  

         6        Is that what you are saying, Counsel?  

         7   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: No, Mr. President.  The document may be 

         8        admitted. 

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.  All right.  So, let the statement 

        10        of Witness RGM of 24th September 2000 (sic), as 

        11        highlighted, be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 27. 

        12        (Exhibit No. P27 was admitted)

        13   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, we also seek that the statement be 

        14        kept under seal. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: My attention has been drawn about the date of 

        16        the statement.  I said the statement of RGM of 

        17        24th September 2001 as highlighted, be admitted as 

        18        Prosecution Exhibit No. 27, and the same shall be kept 

        19        under seal, as it may contain the personal particular of 

        20        this witness, who is a protected witness. 

        21   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, are they -- is it an English text?

        23   MS. OJEMENI: It is in English and French; handwritten in 

        24        English and typed in English and then French typed.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: And they are highlighted in both languages?

        26   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honour.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: And this is a -- these statements in both the 

        28        English text and the French text as highlighted be 

        29        collectively admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 27 and 

        30        both texts to be kept under seal for the reasons given.

          KAJELIJELI                                      12 DECEMBER 2002



         1   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord. 

         2   MS. OJEMENI: We also have the statement of Defence Witness 

         3        MEM dated 24th September 2001, and the statement is in 

         4        both languages, English and French.  We seek to tender 

         5        the statement as highlighted as Prosecution Exhibit 28, 

         6        and we also request that this statement be kept under 

         7        seal, as it contains confidential information that might 

         8        reveal the identity of Witness MEM, who is a protected 

         9        witness. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Any objection from Professor Bompaka?

        11   PROFESSOR BOMPAKA: We have read and observed the passages 

        12        highlighted by the Prosecution.  All these passages were 

        13        developed by the witness during his testimony here 

        14        before the Chamber.  We will have the opportunity to 

        15        develop those objections, but Kajelijeli's Defence team 

        16        does not object to the admissibility of the document. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        18        

        19        So, let the statement of Witness MEM of 24th September 

        20        2001, in both English and French as highlighted, be 

        21        admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 28, and the said 

        22        documents shall be kept under seal as they contain the 

        23        personal particular of this witness, who is a protected 

        24        witness. 

        25   MR. KIYEYEU: The registry has taken note, My Lord.

        26        (Exhibit No. P28 was admitted)

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Is that all, Prosecution?

        28   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honour, except the other matters that 

        29        were raised yesterday concerning the list of the next 

        30        witnesses.
