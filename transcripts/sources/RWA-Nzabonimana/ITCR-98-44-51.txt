         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the case coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning?

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         6        

         7        Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal 

         8        for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, 

         9        presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu, and 

        10        Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, 

        11        today, Thursday, the 5th of December 2002, for the 

        12        continuation of the case, when Defence Counsel, 

        13        Mr. Hinds, will continue with the examination-in-chief 

        14        of Witness ZLG (PW 20), in the matter of the Prosecutor 

        15        v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

        16        

        17        Thank you, Mr. President.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, may we have the appearance of the parties 

        19        starting with the Prosecution, please?

        20   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        21        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Marotine, case 

        22        manager. Thank you.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 

        24        the appearance of the Defence, please?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: May it please the Court, Lennox Hinds, 

        26        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Mr. Dusabe, 

        27        Professor Bompaka, who is also going to be here in a few 

        28        minutes and Ms. Juliette Chinaud.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Interpreter, could you please tell 

        30        Witness ZLG that the Trial Chamber reminds him of the

         1        solemn declaration he made yesterday and that he will 

         2        continue his evidence today on that same solemn 

         3        declaration.

         4   THE WITNESS: Very well.


         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Professor Hinds.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Witness, you recall the evidence you were telling us 

         9        about -- 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  The registry were informing us that the door 

        11        to the gallery has not been opened, and that is why the 

        12        lights are not on, but we are in open session.

        13   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Excuse me, Mr. President.  It seems 

        14        that there is something wrong in the French booth.  

        15        Could we get some help from the technicians, please?  

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, technician, there is a problem in 

        17        the French booth.  Can that be done -- can that be 

        18        fixed?  Is it done?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I think it is all right.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  So, tell Witness ZLG that we are in 

        21        open session, and that he should be careful not to 

        22        mention names which have a bearing on his identity.

        23        

        24        Go on, Counsel.

        25            EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Witness, yesterday before we adjourned, you had 

        28        indicated to the Trial Chamber the situation that 

        29        occurred in Kigombe on the 8th, 9th, and 10th in terms 

        30        of increased bombardment and refugees from particular

                                                           5 DECEMBER 2002

         1        secteurs in Kinigi that were coming from Kigombe.  Do 

         2        you have a map that you have prepared showing this, the 

         3        areas where people were coming from?

         4   A.   Yes, I have a sketch here with me.

         5   Q.   Witness, did you prepare the sketch yourself?

         6   A.   Yes, I am the one who drew it.

         7   Q.   And when did you draw the sketch?

         8   A.   I drew it before yesterday evening, because I had 

         9        expected to use it yesterday because I had opportunity 

        10        to do so.

        11   Q.   Okay.  Witness, could you, with the aid of the registry, 

        12        go over to the overhead projector?

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Could you show the sketch to Mr. Fleming,  

        14        please?  Can I see it -- I have not seen it.  Can I see 

        15        it?

        16   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, we renew our objection to this 

        17        evidence and now to the map.  Your Honours do not have 

        18        it yet on the screens, but we continue to say that what 

        19        this witness is saying is hearsay.  The best he can say 

        20        is that people appeared to be coming from this 

        21        direction.  Now, when you look at the map there is 

        22        obviously an attempt to say precisely where people were 

        23        coming from and we submit that evidence isn't 

        24        receivable, it is hearsay and it doesn't have any 

        25        probative value.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do I need to respond, Your Honour?

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness has testified that 

        29        there was increased fighting or increased activities of 

        30        bombing and gunfire coming from Kinigi area beginning on

         1        the 8th and intensifying up to the l0th.

         2        

         3        He has also testified that he saw individuals who were 

         4        driven from their localities -- I have not developed the 

         5        names of the people and where they were coming from, but 

         6        he had mentioned particular secteurs where people were 

         7        fleeing from this intense fighting, including the 

         8        secteur of Tero and also the secteur Nyarugina.

         9        

        10        Now, l intend to have the witness point out where Susa 

        11        is located on this particular map and to develop his 

        12        testimony with respect to people who were driven from 

        13        these particular areas who came to Kigombe where he was.  

        14        Now, that evidence is clearly admissible, clearly 

        15        probative with respect to the central issues to whether 

        16        or not at -- on the 10th of April whether a vehicle 

        17        allegedly driven by Kajelijeli could be driven into that 

        18        area in the face of intense fighting and people 

        19        immigrating from the area.

        20        

        21        We already have the evidence establishing that 

        22        roadblocks existed up -- certainly from this witness's 

        23        -- eye witness event, up to March -- end of March of 

        24        1994.

        25        

        26        We are now into the first week of April and in 

        27        particular April 8th to April 10th, what changes, if 

        28        any, had occurred within the demilitarised zone.  And 

        29        this is what this witness is going to testify about.

          KAJELIJELI



         1        The evidence is clearly probative and goes directly to 

         2        Mr. Kajelijeli's defence.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Counsel.  Can we have the map 

         4        screened her?

         5        Yes.  We will sustain the objection of the Prosecution 

         6        with regard to the sketch map particularly as seen and 

         7        demonstrated on the sketch with the directions where the 

         8        people are said to have said (sic) because that one is a 

         9        matter that actually in essence is a presumption.  

        10        

        11        But you can lead evidence as you have continued to lead 

        12        with regard to what the witness could have heard when he 

        13        talked to these people who were fleeing, and that is 

        14        hearsay.  It has probative value.  The actual probative 

        15        value will be evaluated by the Trial Chamber at the end 

        16        of these proceedings when it deliberates.

        17        

        18        But we do accept and sustain the objection of the 

        19        Prosecution with regard to the map and indications 

        20        specifically -- and the indications which seem to 

        21        indicate specifically where these people are supposed to 

        22        have come and it could be a presumption of where people 

        23        could have come from.

        24        

        25        But the evidence as you were trying to say and as you 

        26        were saying you can lead that evidence with regard to 

        27        those issues, but we reject -- accept and sustain the 

        28        Prosecution objection with regard to the specific 

        29        demonstration as appears to have been shown on the map 

        30        from this witness.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  Of course, Your 

         2        Honour, I was not able to lay the foundation by asking 

         3        the witness any questions concerning where Susa is 

         4        located, where people were coming from, who he spoke to, 

         5        etcetera.  And I am now going to develop that particular 

         6        information without the map and then proceed again to 

         7        make a proper application once that foundation has been 

         8        laid because the Court has said that the foundation has 

         9        not been laid.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Whatever foundation may be laid, the way the 

        11        map appears is a demonstration of what this witness 

        12        could have heard or could have been told.  So, we don't 

        13        see whether he can specifically say so and so was coming 

        14        from this and this and that and that area.

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Except if the witness told him that.  That 

        16        is the issue as to the weight of the evidence.  Isn't 

        17        it, Your Honour?  That goes to the weight of the 

        18        evidence, not the admissibility, the weight of it, how 

        19        much you want to give to it.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: That is the ruling that we have.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Witness, can you tell us what secteur, if you know --

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would like an adjournment.  

        25        Mr. Kajelijeli feels that his very essence of his 

        26        defence has been undermined.  I need to consult with him 

        27        as to whether or not we will proceed at this stage with 

        28        this witness.  He feels that his Defence is being 

        29        precluded and he does not want me to proceed at this 

        30        stage without consultation with him.  He feels very hard

         1        that his defence has been undercut -- pulled under him 

         2        and he has instructed me not to proceed without 

         3        consultations with him.

         4        

         5        And so, all I am asking for is some time to  talk to him 

         6        because he instructed not to ask any more question until 

         7        I talk to him.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: You can have your adjournment.  How many 

         9        minutes do you want?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think we will needed just 15 

        11        minutes, I just need to talk to him and explain to him 

        12        what the situation is.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  I think we adjourn for 15 minutes.  

        14        Okay, we will adjourn for 15 minutes and come back. 

        15        (Court recessed from 0930H to 0945H)

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:

        17             Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Yes, Professor 

        18        Hinds?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  Could we have the 

        20        witness, please be presented with Defendant Exhibit 39.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Witness, secteur is Susa located in?

        24   A.   Susa is in the Nyarugina secteur.  N-Y-A-R-U-G-I-N-A.

        25   Q.   And what commune is it?

        26   A.   Kinigi commune.

        27   Q.   And what is the neighbouring secteur?

        28   A.   The Nyarugina secteur is neighbouring to Tero and Bisate  

        29        as well as on the Mukingo side neighbouring to Shingiro  

        30        commune.

         1   Q.   Now, witness could you tell the Trial Chamber whether on 

         2        the 9th, 10th you saw any individuals from those 

         3        particular areas in Kigombe?

         4   A.   Yes, I know the people who came from Nyarugina and Tero, 

         5        as well as from other communes who had sought refuge at 

         6        Kigombe in Ruhengeri commune.

         7   Q.   Witness, can you, with the assistance of the registry go 

         8        to the overhead projector, please and let's put 39, 

         9        Defence Exhibit 39 on the overhead projector -- 39.

        10        

        11        Do you have the right map there, 39?

        12   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, Counsel.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay, fine.

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:  Witness, could you go over to the 

        15        overhead projector.  Now, witness, can you tell the 

        16        Trial Chamber the names of any individuals who, on the 

        17        9th, 10th or 11th you saw and spoke to in Kigombe who 

        18        came --who were fleeing the fighting in Nya--

        19   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, I object to my learned friend's --

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can I finish the question?

        21   MR. FLEMING: No, no, I am objecting already because you are 

        22        -- my learned friend is already leading the witness by 

        23        introducing the term "fleeing" the fighting.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am asking the witness to name 

        25        someone.  That, obviously is not a leading question.  

        26        And I should be able to pose the question in its 

        27        entirety before the objection is, in fact, made.  The  

        28        record has to be clear as to what the question is, 

        29        rather than Mr. Fleming objecting.

        30   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, he has already posed the question 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        8

         1        in leading terms and we object to that.  Has said who 

         2        were fleeing fighting.  Now, he must establish that 

         3        rather than put that as a proposition to the witness.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness has already testified that there 

         5        was fighting in the area, and he said with respect to 

         6        bombings and increased shootings and so on.  The witness 

         7        has said that.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Previously.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Previously.

        10   MR. FLEMING: The witness has never said that these people 

        11        were fleeing, Your Honour.  That is the point I make.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: You can break your question -- you saw them 

        13        and what were they -- in the circumstance that you saw 

        14        them?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I want the Court to rule with 

        16        respect to the issue that I am raising that Mr. Fleming 

        17        is not allowing me to put the question which was then 

        18        interrupted and you have not ruled on that.  Can you do 

        19        that?

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Put your question.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Witness, can you identify or name individuals you say 

        24        came from the area of Nyarugina on either April 9th or 

        25        10th that you spoke to in Kigombe?

        26   MR. FLEMING:  I object again, Your Honour, because there is 

        27        no evidence that he spoke to any of these individuals in 

        28        Kigombe.  That evidence is not there and it is leading 

        29        again.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness has said that he spoke to people

         1        coming from those areas.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: That appear to be our recollection, Counsel, 

         3        that yesterday he said he spoke to people from those 

         4        areas at Kigombe.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Of course, I can rephrase it again but it is 

         6        --

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Because that is the recollection that we have 

         8        of yesterday's evidence.

         9   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours, but I wanted to be very 

        10        clear that I will be objecting because my learned friend 

        11        said -- I accept your ruling but I don't want my learned 

        12        friend to lead in anyway whatever because he already 

        13        said that this is at the heart of his Defence.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: This is -- there is not leading.  The 

        15        witness is being asked to name people; how can that be 

        16        leading, Counsel?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Proceed, Counsel.

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   Can you name the people you spoke to in Kigombe coming 

        20        from Nyarugina secteur on either the 9th or the 10th of 

        21        April 1994?

        27   A.   ********************************.

        28   Q.   When did he come to your house seeking refuge?

        29   A.   He arrived at my home in the evening of the 8th.  But 

        30        when he arrived on the 8th he was alone because he

         1        didn't know where his little brothers had gone, and on 

         2        the 9th he went away again to look for his little 

         3        brothers.  On that date, the 9th, there were many people 

         4        who were coming from Kinigi and Gisura came back with 

         5        his little brothers.

         6   Q.   Did you learn why these individuals left their homes in 

         7        Nyarugina secteur?

         8   A.   Yesterday I testified that the RPF recovered zones they 

         9        had occupied in 1993, and it was on the 8th that the 

        10        Inkotanyi recovered these areas.  They occupied the 

        11        whole of Kinigi commune and the Inkotanyi were coming 

        12        from the volcanos.

        13        

        14        Yesterday too, I spoke about the taking over of the 

        15        Ruhengeri town by Inkotanyi.  It is because of this that 

        16        many people went down towards Ruhengeri in order to seek 

        17        refuge.

        18   Q.   Witness, can you point out where the mountains -- that 

        19        you call mountains on your -- on this map Defendant's 39 

        20        is located -- can you point out the area of the volcano 

        21        mountains where you say the RPF came from.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Could we get the witness a chair, please, he 

        23        is fairly tall, so he can sit down.  Thank you.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, registry.  And the interpreter as well if 

        25        he needs to -- he needs a chair as well.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Interpreter, you would like to be on your 

        27        feet?

        28   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Yes, thank you, nonetheless, 

        29        Counsel.

         1   THE WITNESS: The areas that you see here continue constitute 

         2        the volcanic area, and the zone extends towards Nkumba 

         3        commune. All the secteur that you can see here, 

         4        especially Bisate, Nyabisinde, Kabwende, Kagano and 

         5        Gasiza are secteurs which are bordering the forest.

         6   Q.   Now, witness you said that you testified that the 

         7        Inkotanyi had taken over the positions they had held 

         8        before up to all of Kinigi.  How did you obtain that 

         9        information or what was the basis of that information?

        10   A.   Firstly, the people who killed the inhabitants were not 

        11        members of the national army.  There were killings in 

        12        that area, and that is why the inhabitants were fleeing. 

        13        Secondly; the taking over of the Ruhengeri town was not 

        14        by the national army.  And then Gisura came and informed  

        15        me about the situation.  He told me that he, himself had 

        16        seen the Inkotanyi and he had to use another road in 

        17        order to avoid them.  He confirmed that the Inkotanyi 

        18        Nyange secteur.

        19        

        20        Furthermore, my paternal uncle also told me this and he 

        21        said that he himself had seen the Inkotanyi in Nyange.  

        22        He confirmed that there was a large presence of the 

        23        Inkotanyi in that secteur. 

        24        

        25        Furthermore, the soldiers of the national armed forces, 

        26        there was a movement of national armed forces on the 9th 

        27        and 10th towards that region, and we could hear the 

        28        firing indicating that there was intense firing -- 

        29        intensive fighting in that region.

        30   Q.   Witness, did you see any individuals coming from Tero

         1        and Kigombe on the 8th 9th or l0th?

         2   A.   There are people who came from Tero, Nyarugina, Musanze 

         3        and Gihora, and these people told us that they saw a 

         4        large number of Inkotanyi arriving in the area.  They 

         5        even told us that from time to time the Inkotanyi were 

         6        able to reach the area where we ourselves were.  And we 

         7        could hear gunshots in the area bordering Kigombe.

         8   Q.   Witness, could you shed the secteurs where you say the 

         9        people were coming from that you spoke to on either the 

        10        8th, 9th or 10th showing the areas on this map defence 

        11        Exhibit 39 proper?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, the areas are known.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: What is your objection to the witness, Your 

        14        Honour, shading the areas?  I have asked the witness to 

        15        shade the areas that he has testified to, and he has the 

        16        right to shade those areas.  This is our exhibit and we 

        17        are entitled to put on the evidence based upon the 

        18        witness's testimony.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT:  Counsel, we see these areas, they have been 

        20        referred in the record, the exhibit is -- it could be on 

        21        any map; we have Tero, we have Nyarugina, there is the 

        22        other area that you have referred to -- you can always 

        23        be referred to -- because we could be using any other 

        24        map, even the map of Ruhengeri for that matter.  The 

        25        names are there -- Tero and which ever name you want to 

        26        refer to.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: This is our exhibit, this is the Defendant's 

        28        exhibit.  If the Court is precluding us from having the 

        29        witness highlighting the areas on the basis that the map 

        30        speaks for itself I have no problem with it.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: The Exhibit was admitted -- it is a Court 

         2        exhibit -- a Defence Exhibit and the names are there, I 

         3        think they are sufficient on record for follow-up for -- 

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: I have no problem, if the Court says that it 

         5        is sufficient, I am only saying that we have a right to 

         6        use our exhibit and not be precluded from using our 

         7        exhibit, that is basic.  But if the Court is saying that 

         8        we cannot make markings through a witness who has, in 

         9        fact, drawn the map, the Court is precluding him from 

        10        making any notations on the map we accept the ruling.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, we feel that since the exhibit is on 

        12        record and the areas being referred to are clearly 

        13        marked out, we can go by that for the purpose of knowing 


        14        these areas that concern the evidence of this witness on 

        15        this particular area, Nyarugina, Tero and whatever are 

        16        on record, and they are visible and they will be visible 

        17        on any other map of Ruhengeri for that matter.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: I take note of the ruling of the Chamber 

        19        without any further argument.  But it is on record --

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber if you have a 

        22        recollection of any of the individuals you spoke to from 

        23        any of the other secteurs that you mentioned other than 

        24        Nyarugina?

        25   A.   Yes, I saw in Ruhengeri the conseiller of Kabwende 

        26        secteur.

        27        

        28        Let me add that when we left for exile on the 14th we 

        29        went to Zaire in an area known as Gomba, G-O-M-B-A.  In 

        30        Gomba there was a refugee camp for Rwandan refugees who

         1        had come from various areas that you see there.  People 

         2        came from this area here.  Those who were not killed by 

         3        the Inkotanyi were able to go through the forest in 

         4        order to reach Gomba on the Zairean side.  There were 

         5        many people who came from these areas, amongst these 

         6        people there was my grandfather.  We joined him in the 

         7        camp and he came from Kagano secteur.

         8        

         9        When we got to Gomba camp, the inhabitants of Kagano and 

        10        Gasiza informed us of the incident which occurred 

        11        involving a policeman when the Inkotanyi arrived at that 

        12        place.  The policeman was known as Jean-Damascène 

        13        Semateke, spelt, S-E-M-A-T-E-K-E, Semateke, 

        14        Jean-Damascène.  When the Inkotanyi arrived in the area 

        15        I surprised him, and they realised that this man only 

        16        had two fingers in his hands.  They asked the 

        17        inhabitants whether the man had ever served in the army.  

        18        The inhabitants said that Semateke was a communal police 

        19        and the Inkontanyi killed him.  We learnt of this from 

        20        the inhabitants who found refuge in Gomba and had come 

        21        from Kagano and Gasiza, because these two secteurs are 

        22        contiguous.

        23   Q.   Witness, did there come a time when you and your family 

        24        left Kigombe in April?

        25   A.   Yesterday I told you that the recovery effort had been 

        26        intense and my mother often told me that she wanted to 

        27        go away, but we could not leave Ruhengeri because of the 

        28        recovery fighting.  When we heard that the confrontation 

        29        was getting closer so that we could go away.

         1        But on the 8th the recovery effort was intense and we 

         2        had to leave Ruhengeri in order to go Nyakinyama.  Later 

         3        on we came up to Kigombe.

         4        

         5        Yesterday I testified about a person who decapitated by 

         6        a bomb explosion, and it was not only the recovery 

         7        activities that were taking place then.  The attackers 

         8        were getting close to Kigoma and the fighting became 

         9        widespread.  So we had to leave the area to do to Zaire.

        10   Q.   And, when did you go to Zaire, what month and what date?

        11   A.   I reached Kigoma on the 14th July 1994.  But earlier on 

        12        we left Ruhengeri, and we were going from one area to 

        13        another as war displaced persons.  And since there was a 

        14        great deal of movement of people who wanted to cross 

        15        over we were unable to cross over directly, immediately.  

        16        We first of all camped at Gisenyi.

        17   Q.   Witness, with respect to the events of April 10th of 

        18        l994, can you tell the Tribunal where you were when you 

        19        in fact spoke to individuals coming from the various 

        20        secteurs?

        21   A.   On the 10th of April I was still in Kigombe commune 

        22        where our home is.  I was in Kigombe with my younger 

        23        brother and other neighbours were still there.  But 

        24        sometimes some inhabitants would flee because of the 

        25        recovery effort which was intensifying and this would 

        26        happen from time to time.

        27        

        28        But since the elements of the national armed forces were 

        29        always fighting the RPF on the other side we were always 

        30        at Kigombe.  But some inhabitants who were afraid were

         1        able to leave.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: That may be the last question.  Let me just 

         3        check with Mr. Kajelijeli.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, do you know the APICUR hospital in Ruhengeri? 

         7   A.   APICUR was not a hospital, it was a secondary school, 

         8        and my older brother went there. That school is opposite 

         9        the military camp known as Camp Hoza.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Was that facility under RPF control on April 1994?

         4   MR. FLEMING: I object to my learned friend leading, 

         5        Your Honours.

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Do you know whether that camp was under any military 

         8        control, and if so, what military control on April 

         9        10th 1994? 

        10   A.   That military camp was not occupied by Inkotanyi in 

        11        1994.  That camp was close to our area -- our region.  

        12        Had that camp been taken over by the Inkotanyi in 1994, 

        13        the whole of the population in Ruhengeri would have had 

        14        to flee. 

        15   Q.   How about the Apicur school?

        16   A.   No, the Apicur school was not occupied, because Apicur 

        17        is opposite the Muhoza camp, and there is only a road 

        18        which is in between the two buildings, and the 

        19        inhabitants were still there.  There is a church lower 

        20        down from that school.  The inhabitants were still 

        21        there, and the inhabitants also lived beyond the school. 

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: No further questions, Your Honours.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

        24   MR. KIYEYEU: I am sorry, My Lord.  There is a camp name, 

        25        Muhoza.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, can you spell the name of the camp, 

        27        Muhoza camp?

        28   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Muhoza camp, Muhoza is spelt 

        29        M-U-H-O-Z-A.  Let me also spell the names of various 

        30        secteurs mentioned by the witness.  Nkumba is

         1        N-K-U-M-B-A.  Let me spell Bisate, B-I-S-A-T-E.  I will 

         2        spell Nyabisinde, N-Y-A-B-I-S-I-N-D-E.  Kabwende is 

         3        spelt, K-A-B-W-E-N-D-E.  He also mentioned Gihora, 

         4        spelt:  G-I-H-O-R-A. 

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is the direct.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Can the 

         8        witness get back to the witness box.

        15   Q.   Witness in 1993, you were aged 17, weren't you?

        16   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Could you please repeat the 

        17        question for the benefit of the interpreter, 

        18        Mr. Prosecutor?

        19   BY MR. FLEMING:

        20   Q.   In 1993 you were aged 17, weren't you?

        21   A.   Yes. 

        22   Q.   You had never been in the armed forces, had you? 

        23   A.   No.

        24   Q.   On the 7th, 8th, 9th or 10th of April 1994, you did not 

        25        go out into the areas where you say the war front was, 

        26        did you? 

        27   A.   That wasn't possible, indeed.  It is soldiers who 

        28        normally go to the war front.  Since I wasn't a soldier, 

        29        I couldn't go to the war front. 

        30   Q.   All of your information on where the war front was came

         1        from other people, didn't it? 

         2   A.   I was able to identify people who, indeed, gave me 

         3        information, but I was also personally able to see the 

         4        bombs which fell on the places where I was.  I could 

         5        hear the gunshots and this was persistent gun firing and 

         6        we could hear this.  There were people who were leaving 

         7        to go and join the front, I saw them.  Even if there 

         8        hadn't been anyone to inform on the positions at the war 

         9        front, I personally was able to see these bombs which 

        10        were falling.  I was even able to see the victims who 

        11        were affected by the recovery effect.  

        12   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  That is the 

        13        cross-examination of this witness.

        15        

        16        Any re-examination?  

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, Your Honour. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Judge Ramaroson has questions to ask.

        20        

        21        Mr. Witness, you testified that it was impossible to go 

        22        to Kinigi without UNAMIR escort, but when did the UNAMIR 

        23        leave Kinigi? 

        24   THE WITNESS: I wouldn't be able to know that.  I don't know 

        25        because I wasn't at Kinigi. 

        26   JUDGE RAMAROSON: That is all I have.  Thank you. 

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Interpreter, could you tell Witness ZLG this 

        28        marks the end of his testimony.  We thank him.  We shall 

        29        have time at a later stage to review and consider his

         2        again, we thank him.  He may leave after the curtains

         5        Yes, Professor Hinds, your next witness, please? 

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Defence calls Witness MLCF. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: MLCF -- it is quite a long pseudonym.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, ******************8.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, that is what we gather having heard TLA 

        10        and ZLG -- is he here or --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: My understanding is that witness and victim 

        12        protection were informed.  I just need to consult with 

        13        Mr. Kajelijeli. 

        14   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Mr. President, the witness has a 

        15        request.  He wishes to be provided the opportunity to 

        16        greet the Accused. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  I think that the registry can see 

        18        to it and see whether that could be possible.  They can 

        19        make that kind of arrangement, but certainly not now. 

        20   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord. 

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: What is happening with the witness?

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: He is on his way.  I don't know whether on his 

        24        or her way.  So it would take about ten minutes, 

        25        according to the witness and victim protection unit.  So 

        26        what we can do -- 

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: We had told them to have him ready, but I 

        28        think the problem -- one of the problems, Your Honour, 

        29        is that the witness -- because the witness was scheduled 

        30        for next week, they had planned to give him an

         1        orientation.  All these witnesses are in orientation, 

         2        and whatever problems they are having -- but we 

         3        instructed them to have the witness here this morning.

         4   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, I was informed, My Lord, that he was 

         5        brought here for orientation of the court, and then he 

         6        was sent back for breakfast, and I think that is why he 

         7        or she is on her way to the headquarters here.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Then we will take our break earlier to 

         9        accommodate the witness.  So we will adjourn at this 

        10        stage and resume at five past eleven. 

        11        (Court recessed from 1050H to 1110H)


        12   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  

        13        

        14        We have a witness on the stand.  Could you make him make 

        15        the solemn declaration?

        16        (Declaration made by Witness MLCF in Kinyarwanda)

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness MLCF, you have just made a solemn 

        18        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

        19        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        20        essential elements to you before you begin your 

        21        testimony.  

        22        

        23        You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the 

        24        Defence, who are seated on this side of the courtroom, 

        25        and one of them, Professor Hinds, is standing already.  

        26        Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        27        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        28        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        29        of you may also ask questions to you as you continue 

        30        your evidence, if they will have such questions to ask

         1        you.  If a question put to you is not clear or you do 

         2        not understand it, please say so, and such a question 

         3        shall be repeated or explained to you.  These are the 

         4        few essential things we want to bring to your attention.

         6        Yes, Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel?

         9                        WITNESS MLCF,

        10                   first having been duly sworn,

        11                       testified as follows:

        13                         ^^EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        15   Q.   Witness MLCF, how do you feel this morning?

        16   A.   I am all right, Counsel. 

        17   Q.   Witness, we will show you a document which contains your 

        18        particulars.  We would like you to review it, it is in 

        19        English.  We would like you to review it with the 

        20        assistance of your interpreter and see if the contents 

        21        of this document are accurate.  If it is accurate, then 

        22        we would like you to sign it and date it and return it 

        23        to me.  Do you understand this? 

        24   A.   The information contained in this document reflects the 

        25        reality. 

        26   Q.   Then, Witness, we would like you to sign and date the 

        27        document and return it to me, please. 

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, I would like this to be 

        29        admitted as Defendant's Exhibit 40 and since it contains 

        30        the particulars of this particular witness, who is a

         1        protected witness, we would like it to be sealed.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Any objection from the Prosecution?

         3   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honours. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: So, let the document containing the personal 

         5        particulars of this witness be admitted as Defence 

         6        Exhibit No. 40 and the said document shall be kept under 

         7        seal as it contains the personal particulars of this 

         8        witness, who is a protected witness. 

         9   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  May I -- please, Your Honour?

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        12   Q.   Witness, we are in open session which means that 

        13        everything you say could be heard by the public.  Listen 

        14        to my questions very carefully and in answering them, do 

        15        not reveal anything like places, names of individuals 

        16        that could reveal your identity.  If you are unsure 


        17        before you answer, indicate to the Trial Chamber and the 

        18        presiding Judge will advise you on how we will proceed.  

        19        Do you understand that?

        20   A.   (Answer not translated)

        21   Q.   Witness, how old are you? 

        22   A.   Before I begin my testimony, I would like to say that I 

        23        would like to express myself in Kinyarwanda, but it is 

        24        possible that once in a while a French or English word 

        25        might slip in.  In your response to your question, I am 

        26        36 years old. 

        27   Q.   Witness, are you married? 

        28   A.   Yes. 

        29   Q.   And do you have any children? 

        30   A.   I have three children.

         1   Q.   Witness, without giving us the names of the schools, did 

         2        you attend primary school? 

         3   A.   Yes.

         4   Q.   And when did you attend primary school, the years? 

         5   A.   I started my primary education in 1973 and I completed 

         6        in 1978. 

         7   Q.   Did you attend secondary school, and if so, during what 

         8        years? 

         9   A.   Yes, I had secondary education from 1978 and I completed 

        10        in 1985.

        11   Q.   Did you have any advanced education beyond secondary 

        12        school? 

        13   A.   Yes. 

        14   Q.   And could you tell the Tribunal what other education you 

        15        had beyond secondary school? 

        16   A.   If the name of the institution I attended would not 

        17        reveal my identity, then that is all right, I will be 

        18        ready to give you the name. 

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe the nature of the further education -- 

        20        would he -- perhaps without mentioning the name -- would 

        21        it be possible, Counsel?

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: I am just going to inquire without 

        23        getting the name.

        24   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        25   Q.   Witness, is it the type of institution that you obtained 

        26        education -- is it the type of profession that there are 

        27        only a limited number of people in Rwanda who would go 

        28        to that location.  Is that your concern? 

        29   A.   My fear is due to the fact that that institution did not 

        30        last long in the country.  It doesn't even exist.  So,

         1        there aren't too many people who attended at that 

         2        institution. 

         3   Q.   Okay.  We will get back to that in the closed session. 

         4        Witness, after you attended that institution, did you 

         5        attend any other institution of learning in Rwanda or 

         6        elsewhere? 

         7   A.   No.

         8   Q.   Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli? 

         9   A.   I know him very well.

        10   Q.   When did you first meet Juvénal Kajelijeli? 

        11   A.   I met him the first time in 1990.

        12   Q.   And at that time, did you know what he did for a living? 

        13   A.   At that time he was bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune. 

        14   Q.   Did you know him continuously while he served as a 

        15        bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune? 

        16   A.   Yes.

        17   Q.   Do you know whether or not he was bourgmestre in Mukingo 

        18        commune in April of 1994? 

        19   A.   No, he was not a bourgmestre during that time. 

        20   Q.   Do you know whether or not there came a time when 

        21        Mr. Kajelijeli was removed as bourgmestre? 

        22   A.   Yes. 

        23   Q.   And when was that, Witness? 

        24   A.   This was in 1993, at the beginning of the year. 

        25   Q.   Do you know who replaced Juvénal Kajelijeli in 1993?  

        26        When he was replaced? 

        27   A.   Yes, I know.

        28   Q.   Can you tell the Tribunal the name of that individual? 

        29   A.   Initially there was somebody who replaced him in an 

        30        acting capacity, and after that a bourgmestre was

         1        appointed to replace him.  His name was Harerimana.  


         2        Harerimana is spelt, H-A-R-E-R-I-M-A-N-A. 

         3   Q.   Do you know who replaced Juvénal Kajelijeli first in an 

         4        acting capacity?  Do you know the name of the person? 

         5   A.   Yes. 

         6   Q.   And what's his name? 

         7   A.   The person who replaced him in an acting capacity was 

         8        called Semahane.  I spell Semahane, S-E-M-A-H-A-N-E. 

         9   Q.   Are you sure of this, Witness? 

        10   A.   I am sorry.  Semahane replaced him at another time, but 

        11        initially, it was Conseiller Ndisetse who replaced him 

        12        as a bourgmestre.  I spell Ndisetse, N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Repeat.  They are familiar names but they are 

        14        not easy. 

        15   THE WITNESS: Ndisetse is N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E. 

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        17   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   And, Witness, do you know who replaced Ndisetse? 

        19   A.   Yes, his name is Harerimana. 

        20   Q.   And do you know how long Harerimana served in the 

        21        office? 

        22   A.   Yes.

        23   Q.   And what was the date Harerimana served up to?

        24   A.   Harerimana occupied the office of bourgmestre in 1993, 

        25        towards the end of the year, the last month of the year, 

        26        and he occupied this position until the 8th of April 

        27        1994, the date on which he died.

        28   Q.   And, do you know, Witness, who replaced Harerimana on 

        29        April 8th, 1994? 

        30   A.   Yes.

         1   Q.   Can you give us the name of the person? 

         2   A.   It is the person I mentioned earlier, Semahane. 

         3   Q.   Do you know whether or not Juvénal Kajelijeli became 

         4        bourgmestre again in 1994? 

         5   A.   Yes.

         6   Q.   And when was that? 

         7   A.   It was in June 1994.

         8   Q.   And do you know how long he served in that position? 

         9   A.   Yes, I know it. 

        10   Q.   And up to what date did he serve, to the best of your 

        11        knowledge? 

        12   A.   He occupied this office until mid-July, around the 

        13        middle of July, around when everybody was fleeing. 

        14   Q.   Witness, if Mr. Kajelijeli were in this courtroom, would 

        15        you be able to identify him? 

        16   A.   Yes. 

        17   Q.   Witness, we would like you to look around the Courtroom 

        18        and see if you see Juvénal Kajelijeli, indicate what he 

        19        is wearing, whether he is wearing spectacles or not, 

        20        what row he is sitting in or standing, and if there is 

        21        anyone sitting next to him, describe him in the context 

        22        of his location and who may be sitting next to him.  You 

        23        may stand if it would assist you in the identification.

        24   A.   I had already seen him and now that Counsel has moved 

        25        slightly, I can see him clearly.  He is wearing 

        26        spectacles, a black jacket and a white shirt. 

        27   Q.   Is he wearing a tie?  What is the colour of the tie?

        28   A.   He is wearing a tie and if I see it well, it is a bluish 

        29        tie with white dots on bluish background.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the witness has, indeed, recognised the 

         2        Accused Kajelijeli in Court and let the record so 

         3        reflect. 

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, are you a member of the MRND?

         6   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  It is beyond the scope 

         7        of what is in the summary that this witness has come to 

         8        testify. 

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do I need to respond, Your Honours?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: I think this issue has been coming up in the 

        11        course of this trial.  We think this question can be 

        12        answered by the witness. 

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you. 

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Witness? 

        16   A.   No. 

        17   Q.   After 1991, were you a member of the MRND, while you 

        18        were in Rwanda? 

        19   A.   Not at all. 

        20   Q.   Witness, have you heard the term Interahamwe? 

        21   A.   Yes. 

        22   Q.   And do you know what Interahamwe means? 

        23   A.   Yes. 

        24   Q.   What is your understanding of what Interahamwe means? 

        25   A.   First of all, when I was initially -- when I was in 

        26        Rwanda, Interahamwe meant the youth wing of MRND.  But 

        27        currently, everybody who took part in the killings is 

        28        referred to as Interahamwe or any person against whom 

        29        unfair charges have been brought is considered to be an 

        30        Interahamwe.

         1   Q.   Now, Witness, while you were in Rwanda, did you see 

         2        anyone who identified themselves as being Interahamwe, 

         3        when you were in Rwanda? 

         4   A.   When I was still in Rwanda, I was not able to identify 

         5        any person as being an Interahamwe.

         6   Q.   Between 1993 and 1994, in your secteur -- and do not 

         7        tell us the name of your secteur,  did you know whether 

         8        or not there was an organisation called Interahamwe in 

         9        your secteur during that time period?

        10   A.   No, I do not know it.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that we will need to go 

        12        into a closed session for a short period, where I need 

        13        to close a loop on a number of things, and then we go 

        14        back into open session.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  We will go into closed session to 

        16        enable counsel to raise questions with the witness, some 

        17        of which could have a bearing on his identity.  

        18        

        19        Can that be done, Registry?  And, Interpreter, could you 

        20        tell the witness accordingly?

        21

        23        transcript [pages 31 to 38] was extracted and sealed 

        24        under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Now, Witness, when did you first learned of the death of 

         4        the president?

         5   A.   I heard this for the first time on 6th April 1994.  I 

         6        was in bed.  It was around 23, 24 hours; I was listening 

         7        to the radio and I heard the news that the presidential 

         8        plane had been shot down.  I mean, President 

         9        Habyarimana's plane.

        10   Q.   Now, what radio station were you listening to?

        11   A.   I was listening to the RTLM Radio Station.  It's a 

        12        private station and RTLM means Radio Télévision Libre 

        13        des Milles Collines.

        14   Q.   Now, what, if anything, did you do when you heard the 

        15        news of the president's death?

        16   A.   When I heard that President Habyarimana's plane had been 

        17        shot down, I was in bed and I got scared, but 

        18        subsequently, I was able to sleep.

        19   Q.   Why were you afraid?

        20   A.   I was afraid because I had just heard that the 

        21        president's plane had been shot down, and I know that 

        22        when a president is involved in an accident, sometimes 

        23        he doesn't survive it.  And you know that when a 

        24        president of a country dies, a change would not 

        25        necessarily have to follow.

        26   Q.   Now, Witness, did there come a time --

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we were wondering from the English 

        28        translation, the answer of the witness does not come out 

        29        very well, whether it's a problem of interpretation or 

        30        what was said.  Can you repeat that answer, if you have

         1        it?  Sorry, Counsel.

         2   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: I will try, Mr. President.  I 

         3        was afraid because I had just heard that the president's 

         4        plane had just been shot down.  And when the president 

         5        of a country is involved in an accident, very often he 

         6        would not survive and when a president dies, a change 

         7        would necessarily follow.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Now, Witness, what, if anything, did you do after you 

        11        learned the news?

        12   A.   I told you that subsequently, I slept and then I woke up 

        13        at 6 a.m. the following day, and then I switched on my 

        14        radio again.

        15   Q.   And did you learn any additional information at 6 a.m. 

        16        the next day; that is, the 7th?

        17   A.   Yes, I heard additional information, but what -- the new 

        18        information I got was that everybody should remain at 

        19        home.

        20   Q.   And where did you get this information from, that 

        21        everyone should stay at home?

        22   A.   This information was broadcast on radio.

        23   Q.   Now, Witness, what, if anything, did you do when you 

        24        learned this additional information?

        25   A.   Subsequently around 7 a.m., I went out because I wanted 

        26        to know what my neighbours had learned.

        27   Q.   Now, who was home with you at that time when you learned 

        28        the news of the president's death?

        29   A.   That morning I was with my wife and three children.  So, 

        30        it's with them that I lived.

         1   Q.   And where did you go when you said you went out to see 

         2        your neighbours?  Witness, you must be very careful in 

         3        your answers, be very careful.

         4   A.   I came out; when I got to the courtyard, I met three 

         5        teachers who were my neighbours.

         6   Q.   And did you -- without giving us the names of the these 

         7        individuals, did you have any conversations with them?

         8   A.   I said that I came out, and when I got to the courtyard, 

         9        I found those individuals I mentioned.  I know their 

        10        names and I discussed with them.

        11   Q.   And what was the substance of the discussion that you 

        12        had with your neighbours that morning at 7 a.m.?

        13   A.   Our country, Rwanda, was at war against the RPF, and it 

        14        had just been announced that the presidential plane had 

        15        been shot down.  It was those two items that we 

        16        discussed.

        17   Q.   Why did you say that your country was at war on April 

        18        7th of 1994?

        19   A.   Rwanda had been attacked by the RPF in 1990.  And I've 

        20        said that Rwanda was at war because some individuals 

        21        thought that it was the RPF who had shot down the 

        22        presidential plane.

        23   Q.   Now, Witness, did there come a time when you left your 

        24        colleagues that morning?  And if so, could you tell the 

        25        Tribunal?

        26   A.   After some 30 minutes or so, I left and I went back to 

        27        my house in order to wash.

        28   Q.   And what happen after that?

        29   A.   After that, while I was still in my house, I heard 

        30        explosions and detonations.

         1   Q.   And can you tell -- were you able to tell around what 

         2        time you began to heard detonations and explosions?

         3   A.   That morning I wasn't able to look at the watch, for any 

         4        time or other.  But if I were to take a guess, I would 

         5        say it was around 8:00 in the morning.

         6   Q.   Do you know what direction these explosions and 

         7        detonations, as you called it, were coming from?

         8   A.   Because I was hearing these explosions and detonations, 

         9        the noise seem to me to be coming from Byangabo.

        10   Q.   Now --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: I decided not to ask that question.

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Witness, after hearing this noise, what, if anything, 

        14        did you do?

        15   A.   When I heard the explosions, I was once again afraid, 

        16        but later on, I had the reflex of going out of my house 

        17        in order to try and find out where the explosions were 

        18        coming from.

        19   Q.   And where did you go when you left your house?

        20   A.   When I left my house, I was checking whether the 

        21        teachers were still where I had left them.  I found 

        22        them; I joined them where they were, and they told me 

        23        that the explosions were coming from the Byangabo area 

        24        or its neighbourhood.

        25   Q.   Now, having learned that information, what, if anything, 

        26        did you do?

        27   A.   After joining those individuals, and after a short 

        28        while, we saw people running behind the compound or the 

        29        institution's compound.  These people seems to be 

        30        fleeing.  Later on, we heard noises from -- coming from

         1        the convent and the dispensary.

         2   Q.   Now, could you tell how many people you saw that morning 

         3        that you say you thought were fleeing?

         4   A.   I was unable to count the people, but if I were to make 

         5        an estimate, I would say that these people were more 

         6        than -- that they were at least 30.

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know in which direction these 

         8        people were travelling?

         9   A.   Yes, we saw them run and they were going towards the 

        10        parish.

        11   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness is specifying that 

        12        it wasn't only to the parish, but on the side where the 

        13        parish was.

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Now, could you describe, base upon your observation, the 

        16        sex, age of these individuals?

        17   A.   These people were mixed; there was a large number of 

        18        women and children wearing ordinary clothes.

        19   Q.   Now, how did you determine that they were fleeing?  What 

        20        gave you that impression?

        21   A.   These people were running and they seem to be in a 

        22        panic, and since they were coming from the area from 

        23        which we had heard the explosion, we said to ourselves 

        24        that these people must have been fleeing from something 

        25        that had happened in that location.

        26   Q.   Now, could you identify any of these people who you saw 

        27        running passed you?

        28   A.   No, I was unable to recognise any of those people.

        29   Q.   Now, how long did you remain with your colleagues, who 

        30        you were talking with, after you made this observation

         1        of seeing the people running?

         2   A.   We didn't remain on the spot, because after we saw these 

         3        people running, and having heard the noise, our reflex 

         4        was to get out of the compound in which we were.

         5   Q.   What noise did you hear after you saw the people 

         6        running?  What noise?

         7   A.   After these people passed by running, we heard noises.  

         8        That noise was coming from something, which I could 

         9        compare to spectators watching a football match, and who 

        10        make a noise or shout after a goal has been scored.

        11   Q.   Now, did you know where that sound was coming from?  In 

        12        which direction?

        13   A.   Yes, we were able to determine the direction, and I have 

        14        told you that the noise came from the side where the 

        15        convent and a dispensary were.  When we came out of the 

        16        compound, we were able to see many people on that 

        17        side -- in that direction.

        18   Q.   And, what, if anything, did you do?

        19   A.   We left, and when we got close by the convent, we 

        20        realised that there were many spectators.  They were all 

        21        around the convent parameter wall, and after a moment, 

        22        we heard shooting.

        23   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: The witness is saying that there 

        24        is something that I said that he did not say, and that 

        25        he wants to repeat his answer.  The witness said that he 

        26        didn't say anything about the enclosure, but that there 

        27        were many people there.  But, subsequently, he said that 

        28        there were people who wanted to jump over the enclosure 

        29        in order to enter the compound.

         1   Q.   Witness, I would like you to listen to my question, 

         2        answer that question; then I will put another question 

         3        to you so that we can proceed in that fashion.  Do you 

         4        understand that?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: So, what's the answer?  "There was no 

         6        enclosure" and then, "People getting over the 

         7        enclosure".  Which is which?  Can you clarify?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, I'm going to try to take 

         9        him through this so that we have clarity.


        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Witness, listen to the question very carefully and just 

        12        answer the question I ask you, and then we put the next 

        13        question, do you understand that?  

        14        

        15        Witness, after you heard the noise you say -- and you 

        16        described it, what did you do?

        17   A.   I would like to know what noise you are referring to?  

        18        Because I said that we heard the noise coming from 

        19        people and explosions, and I said that when we heard the 

        20        noise made by people, we came out to find out what was 

        21        happening.

        22   Q.   That is precisely the question.  Now, when you came out 

        23        to find out what was happening, where did you go and 

        24        what did you see, if anything?

        25   A.   We came out and we went in that direction.  And when we 

        26        got close to the convent, we saw people who wanted to 

        27        jump over the enclosure, the fence.

        28   Q.   Now, Witness, when you say "we", how many individuals 

        29        were with you?

        30   A.   When we came out of the compound, we were four; three

         1        teachers and myself, but when we got to that place, 

         2        there were people scattered all over the place.

         3   Q.   Now, what distance did you have to travel to arrive at 

         4        the place that you are describing?

         5   A.   I wasn't able to measure the distance.  I am going to 

         6        give you an estimate, and I think that, from the 

         7        institute where we came from, to that location, there 

         8        would be at least 50 metres.

         9   Q.   Now, Witness, I would like to show you what has been 

        10        previously marked as Prosecutor's Exhibit 7, and I'd 

        11        like you to turn to Photographs 51, 52, 53 and 54.  Do 

        12        you recognise Photograph 51?

        13   A.   Yes, I can recognise it.

        14   Q.   What is photograph 51?

        15   A.   I can see that it is the Busogo Catholic Church; in 

        16        other words, the parish.

        17   Q.   Did that church and the surroundings look like as it is 

        18        depicted in Photograph 51 in 1994 -- April of 1994?

        19   A.   In April 1994, in the courtyard, there were many 

        20        make-shifts shelters where the war displaced were 

        21        living, and I think that this particular structure was 

        22        not there in 1994.

        23   Q.   Where particularly were the displaced people living?  

        24        And can you describe that area in photograph 51?

        25   A.   You can see the area where the grass is growing, that is 

        26        where the displaced people were.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Now, with the aid of the registry, can 

        28        Photograph 51 projected on the screen -- overhead 

        29        projector?  And so, the witness can go to the projector 

        30        and show the places that he has been discussing in his

         1        evidence.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: And Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel, we'll be 

         3        stopping at one for the lunch break.  So, you can 

         4        organise your work accordingly, then we will come back 

         5        around the same time which we normally do.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour. 

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Witness, the registry would assist you.  You have to get 

         9        up and go over to the overhead projector.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: And wait first, the curtains would be drawn.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Now, Witness, could you point out the area that you say 

        13        displaced people were living in, on Photograph 51?  Use 


        14        a pointer and point to the area on the photograph.

        15   A.   The displaced persons were scattered in this courtyard 

        16        you can see here. 

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: For the record, Your Honour, the witness has 

        18        shown an area of vegetation, which is in the foreground 

        19        of the photograph.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: As being the area where the --

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: The displaced people were -- set up their 

        22        residence.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: He called them make-shift structures; is that 

        24        correct?

        25   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honour, that is the witness' 

        26        testimony.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, let the record so reflect.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Maybe I could just complete the 

        29        identification of the other three within this time 

        30        period.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can we put up 52 and 53 next to each other?

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Okay, Witness, do you recognise Photographs 52 and 53?

         5   A.   Yes.

         6   Q.   And what are those photographs, what do they depict?

         7   A.   These photographs remind me of the convent.

         8   Q.   Well, are they the convent, or are they not the convent?

         9   A.   Yes, this is a convent.

        10   Q.   And --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Could we show him 54?  Good.

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Witness, looking at Photograph 54, could you tell the 

        14        Tribunal whether or not that -- whether or not you 

        15        recognise that structure?

        16   A.   Yes, I recognised this place.  This is the internal 

        17        courtyard of the convent.

        18   Q.   Now, Witness, what do you see?  Could you describe the 

        19        structures that you see there?

        20   A.   You can see there is the internal courtyard of the 

        21        convent and then there is the building which you can see 

        22        there.  Right by the building, there is a wall which 

        23        serves as an enclosure.


        24   Q.   Now, Witness, that wall -- does the wall enclose the 

        25        complete structure of the nuns's convent?

        26   A.   No, this wall does not surround the convent; it closes 

        27        off part of the convent to that side.

        28   Q.   Witness, could someone who is on the outside of the 

        29        convent, could they see the courtyard?

        30   A.   No, someone outside would not be able to see the

         1        internal courtyard.

         2   Q.   Why not?

         3   A.   The reason is that the convent is surrounded by other 

         4        buildings as well as this wall which you can see here.

         5   Q.   And could someone on the outside get into the courtyard 

         6        without either going over the wall, or through a door?

         7   A.   Yes, unless the person breaks the window from which time 

         8        they can enter.

         9   Q.   Witness, I'm not sure you understood the question.  The 

        10        question that I've asked you is, whether someone could 

        11        get into the courtyard except climbing over the wall, or 

        12        going through a door?  Do you understand the question?

        13   A.   Yes, that is what I mean, there was no entrance other 

        14        than going through the wall -- I mean, through the door 

        15        or going over the wall.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay, Your Honour, that is the last question 

        17        on this matter.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We'll stop here and resume our work at 

        19        twenty-five to three.  Twenty-five to three, and 

        20        continue with the evidence of this witness.  Until then, 

        21        these proceedings stand adjourned.  And, Interpreter, 

        22        could you, please, advise the witness accordingly.

         5        And we continue with the evidence of the witness in 

         6        examination-in-chief by Learned Counsel for the Defence, 

         7        Professor Hinds.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  May I proceed?

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please.

        10   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        11   Q.   Yes, Witness --

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  And maybe before that, just remind the 

        13        witness that we are in open session.  Interpreter, he 

        14        should be careful.

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Witness, could you describe the people you saw at the 

        17        nuns' convent?

        18   A.   The persons that I saw at the nuns' convent were many.

        19   Q.   Could you describe how these individuals were dressed -- 

        20        what they were wearing?  Whether or not they had any 

        21        weapons?  Just give us the description of what you saw.

        22   A.   These people were very many, as I said earlier, and 

        23        among them, there were some who were wearing military  

        24        uniforms and carrying weapons.  Others were wearing 

        25        civilian clothes, and some of them were wearing clothes 

        26        that were clearly dirty and old.

        27   Q.   Now, Witness, what did you see -- first of all, how far 

        28        were you from these individuals when you were making 

        29        these observations?

        30   A.   I was not far from these people that I am describing.

         1        These people had surrounded the convent such that I was 

         2        close to them, since they had encircled the whole 

         3        convent.

         4   Q.   Now, were all of the people who were there -- withdrawn.  

         5        Can you tell the Tribunal what you saw individuals who 

         6        were there doing, at that time?

         7   A.   At one point in time, there were gunshots.  And it 

         8        appear to me that those who were there were shooting at 

         9        the convent and throwing grenades.  There were some 

        10        other people who were bystanders and were observing what 

        11        was going on.  And when the gunshots started, the 

        12        onlookers will run back and then come forward again.  It 

        13        appear there was total confusion in the place.

        14   Q.   Now, did you remain with the three individuals whom you 

        15        have travelled to that location with?

        16   A.   Since there was disorder at the place, everybody was 

        17        afraid.  I was also afraid.  I panic and nobody remained 

        18        with those he came with.  Everybody ran in another 

        19        direction -- in a different direction, sorry.

        20   Q.   Now, Witness, which direction were you approaching the 

        21        convent from?  Was it the back or the front when you 

        22        were making your initial observations?

        23   A.   I got to the convent through the back.  Since the 

        24        institution that we came from, is behind the convent, 

        25        we, therefore, came through the back.


        26   Q.   Now, Witness, you -- Witness, you identified Picture 54 

        27        just before the lunch break, I would like you to look at 

        28        that picture again.  Do you see, Witness, the wall that 

        29        you said people were attempting to climb over, in that 

        30        picture?

         1   A.   Yes, I can see the wall.  And on the photography see it 

         2        to the left-hand side.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, do we need the witness to go to 

         4        the overhead projector?  Because I think it's all clear 

         5        to everyone.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, it might be helpful.  But the only thing 

         7        is that, Counsel, in his evidence before the lunch 

         8        break, he talked about people trying to go over the 

         9        enclosure.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: He said a wall.   I thought that -- 

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Or a wall either.  But there was no specific 

        12        pointing out of that particular wall.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's what I'm doing now.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Because in your question, that is what 

        15        was implied, the standing question. 

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, the standing -- and so, he is pointing 

        17        out that wall.  The question was: "Do you see the wall 

        18        in Photograph 54?"

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: That's correct. 

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: That you testified that you saw individuals 

        21        attempting to climb over.  

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: That's what we are saying, there was no such 

        23        evidence so far led whether this was the wall.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's what I'm trying to get the witness to 

        25        identify if that was the wall that he talked about.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, but the question seem to imply this is 

        27        the wall.  You see what I mean?  

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know how I'm going to --

        29   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        30   Q.   Witness, you testified that you saw individuals

         1        attempting to climb over a wall; is that correct?

         2   A.   Yes.  In my testimony, I said that I saw people 

         3        attempting to climb over a wall, a wall which was part 

         4        of the enclosure of the building.

         5   Q.   Okay.  Witness, I'm now referring you to Photograph 54, 

         6        and I'm asking you whether you can identify whether any 

         7        part of that picture reflects the wall that you 

         8        testified about?

         9   A.   Yes, there is a portion of this wall and that is the 

        10        portion of the wall that I pointed to; that is, to the 

        11        left of the photograph.

        12   Q.   All right.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, do we need it projected?

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: No, I think it is obvious from Exhibit 54.

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: I agree, one hundred percent.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   Now, Witness, did you see anyone actually getting over 

        20        the wall from where you -- your location was?

        21   A.   I stated that when we were coming towards this building, 

        22        we saw people climbing over the wall, and that the 

        23        people we saw were carrying weapons.

        24   Q.   Now, what type of weapons were these people carrying; 

        25        that is, those people who were climbing over the wall?

        26   A.   These persons who were climbing over the wall were 

        27        carrying machetes, spears, clubs.  I even saw a soldier 

        28        who was carrying a rifle.

        29   Q.   Now, Witness, did there come a time when you got to the 

        30        front of the building?

         1   A.   We went on our way, and at one point in time, we came to 

         2        a place where we could see the front side of the 

         3        building.

         4   Q.   Now, is the front of the building depicted in any of the 

         5        photographs that you were shown?  And if so, which 

         6        photograph shows the front of the building?

         7   A.   Yes, there is a photograph I saw on which we could see 

         8        the front of the building, but it is not this photograph 

         9        that I have before me.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Registry, could we show the witness 

        11        Photograph 52 and 53 of Prosecutor's Exhibit 6?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, registry, can you do that?  Fifty-three 

        13        and 50?

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Fifty-two -- yes, 53 and 52. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Fifty-two and 53?

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Right. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Or fifty-three and 52?

        18   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, it is Prosecution Exhibit 7, not 

        19        six.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Oh, I'm sorry, seven.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        22   MR. KIYEYEU: We are going to do so.

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Witness, do you have those photographs in front of you?  

        25        These are photographs at the bottom right should be -- 

        26        number one should say 52, and one should say 53.  Do you 

        27        have those in front of you?

        28   A.   Yes, I have those photographs before me, and I can see 

        29        52 and 53 on the photographs, even though they are 

        30        hardly visible.

         1        1500H     

         2   Q.   Now, do those photographs show the front of the building 

         3        that you were describing in your testimony?

         4   A.   Yes.

         5   Q.   And while you were able to see the front of the 

         6        building, did you see anyone doing anything in 

         7        connection with the building, what did you see?

         8   A.   Yes, at the time, we got close to the front of the 

         9        building, that was when we saw these people throwing 

        10        grenades through the windows of the building and then 

        11        started shooting.

        12   Q.   Well, did you hear any sounds coming from within the 

        13        building or the compound other than -- other than noise 

        14        of explosions?

        15   A.   Yes, we heard cries from people, people who were asking 

        16        for -- crying for help.  We heard a lot of noise from 

        17        within the building.

        18   Q.   What did you do at that time when you were making these 

        19        observations that is of the shooting and cries that you 

        20        were hearing?

        21   A.   It was a horrible scene and you will understand that it 

        22        is a situation in which people were being killed.  And 

        23        when there are explosions people will normally scatter 

        24        in all directions.  I went back a little to the lower 

        25        side of the road.

        26   Q.   Now, were you able to identify anyone who was among the 

        27        attackers?

        28   A.   Yes, there are people that I was able to identify.

        29   Q.   And you can mention names, can you mention names -- tell 

        30        the Tribunal who you were able to identify and why you

         1        were able to identify those people?

         2   A.   Among those people who are present at the convent at 

         3        that time, I was able to identify three that I knew and, 

         4        if you so wish, I can give you their names.

         5   Q.   Yes, could you give the Tribunal the names of these 

         6        people and how you knew them?  And witness in describing 

         7        how you knew them, do not say anything that you think 

         8        would reveal your identity?

         9   A.   Among those that I recognised, there was a soldier 

        10        called Rachel.  I knew him because he used to visit my 

        11        neighbours.  There was another one called Noel, another 

        12        person called Noel.  I knew him because *************

        13        ****************.  And then there was another 

        14        person called Bagabo.  I knew Bagabo because at one 

        15        point in time I entrusted, ******************

        16        *************************:  It was a 

        17        temporary job.

        18   Q.   And what, if anything, did you see these individuals 

        19        doing at that time?

        20   A.   Regarding Rachel, I saw him firing through the windows  

        21        with a gun.  The others were carrying machetes, and I 

        22        saw them moving around the convent and finally enter the 

        23        convent.

        24   Q.   Witness, how long did the attack last?

        25   A.   This was a very extensive and terrible attack.  Even if 

        26        we did not follow -- to be able to time the duration of 

        27        this attack, I can estimate it to be about 45 minutes. 

        28   Q.   Witness, did you see the attackers leave this location?

        29   A.   Yes, I saw the attackers leave the place and at that 

        30        stage there were no gunshots anymore.  So I was able to

         1        see the attackers when they were leaving the place.

         2   Q.   Did you see Juvénal Kajelijeli among the attackers who 

         3        were there or when they left?

         4   A.   I did not see him.

         5   Q.   In April of 1994, did you know what type of vehicle 

         6        Kajelijeli drove?

         7   A.   Yes, I know the vehicle he drove at that time very well.  

         8        It was Toyota Hilux, a red colour.

         9   Q.   And were there any markings on that vehicle?

        10   A.   On one side of this vehicle, there was an inscription, 

        11        STB Busogo.

        12   Q.   Did you see that vehicle at that location any time that 

        13        morning?

        14   A.   No, I didn't see it.

        15   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know what the inscription is of the 

        16        commune vehicle, that is, in April of 1994?

        17   A.   Yes, I know that vehicle.  It was also a Toyota Hilux 

        18        and also of a red colour.  Apart from the fact that the 

        19        communal vehicle was newer than that Kajelijeli used to 

        20        drive.

        21   Q.   Were there any markings of the communal vehicle that you 

        22        know of?

        23   A.   Yes, on this vehicle there was the inscription; Mukingo 

        24        Commune.

        25   Q.   Witness, you said on one side of the vehicle belonging 

        26        to ESTB were the letters ESTB, was it on one side or on 

        27        both sides?

        28   A.   The inscription was on only one side.

        29   Q.   Now, Witness, what if anything did you do after you say 

        30        you saw the attackers leave?

         1   A.   After the attackers left, I looked curious so I got 

         2        close to the convent and I saw through the window, one 

         3        of the windows of the nuns' convent, and inside the 

         4        convent I could see dead bodies.

         5   Q.   What did you do next?

         6   A.   After that, I became afraid and I was shocked by what I 

         7        had just seen and I went straight home.

         8   Q.   What impact if any, did you see -- did you witness, what 

         9        effect did that have on you?

        10   A.   I was afraid following what I had seen.  It was very 

        11        sad, it was a very sad incident and even up to today, I 

        12        cannot forget what I saw that day.

        13   Q.   What time did you get home that day?

        14   A.   It was about 10:00.

        15   Q.   Now, Witness, what if anything did you do the rest of 

        16        that day, that is, April 7?

        17   A.   For the rest of the day since I was traumatised by what 

        18        I saw, I swallowed some tablets that I had with me and I 

        19        slept.

        20   Q.   Did you sleep throughout that day or you got up any 

        21        time?

        22   A.   In the evening, someone came to see me and I had to wake 

        23        up and go to the sitting room.

        24   Q.   And as a result of your meeting with that individual, 

        25        what, if anything, did you do?

        26   A.   Those days when we discussed -- we normally discussed 

        27        the issues, the incident that occurred during the day.  

        28        And it was this person who told me that at one stage, 

        29        the bourgmestre came to this place whilst there were 

        30        dead bodies.

         1   Q.   Did you do anything that evening?

         2   A.   At one stage, there were other neighbours who came to 

         3        see me and they told me that following the events that 

         4        occurred in the locality we needed to find a way of 

         5        leaving the institution that night.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness is shaking his head.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT:  Any problem, Witness.

         8   THE WITNESS: What I was saying was that we should not leave 

         9        that institution, but we should hold vigil the whole 

        10        night within the institution.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel?

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        13   Q.   Witness, are you saying that there was a decision to 

        14        hold a vigil all night within the institution?  What 

        15        does that mean?

        16   A.   By that, I meant that in that evening a decision was 

        17        taken, a decision to the effect that we needed to keep 

        18        watch to ensure our safety following the events that 

        19        occurred in that locality.

        20   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know whether or not there were any 

        21        burial services for the victims?

        22   A.   Yes, I know that took place, somebody told me about it.

        23   Q.   Did you participate?

        24   MS. OJEMENI: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness said that 

        25        somebody told him about it.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT:  Or rather answered.

        27   MS. OJEMENI: The question has been answered.

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Why didn't you participate in the burial services?

        30   A.   The burial ceremony took place the following day, that

         1        is on the 8th.  On that day, someone came to see me and  

         2        told me that a child was a sick and I had to go to that 

         3        person's house.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel?

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness on the 7th when you were witness to the events 

         7        unfolding, did you consider going for help?

         8   A.   No, I was not in a position to do it.  I couldn't think 

         9        about it.  There were so many gunshots around, so many 

        10        explosions of grenades.  So given the prevailing 

        11        situation, I could not go, I could not go to assist 

        12        against the people who were shooting.

        13   Q.   Witness, how are you sure that Juvénal Kajelijeli was 

        14        not present there that morning of April the 7th when you 

        15        were there?

        16   A.   When I was there and as I saw these people carrying out 

        17        the attack, I didn't see them among the attackers.  

        18        Furthermore, I didn't see his vehicle in the location.

        19   Q.   Witness, the translation that came through:  I didn't 

        20        see them.  Is that what you are saying, you didn't see 

        21        them?  The question I asked:  Did you see Juvénal, how 

        22        do you confirm that you did not see Kajelijeli?  And the 

        23        translation came back -- I didn't see them?

        24   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honour, well I listened to English and the 

        25        witness was very clear on Kajelijeli.  My colleague was 

        26        also listening to French, and the witness was very clear 

        27        as far as the translation came on as the witness 

        28        referring to Kajelijeli.  So I don't know where my 

        29        learned friend got this "them" that he is referring to.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: I heard them, I mean, maybe I am mistaken.

         1        I heard them.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Do you have -- you have the answer of the 

         3        witness, Interpreter?  You can read it out.

         4   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: When I was on the spot, I could see 

         5        the people who were leading the attacks but I was unable 

         6        to see Kajelijeli amongst those who were carrying out 

         7        the attack.  Furthermore, I didn't see his vehicle at 

         8        that location either.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that is the end of our direct.  But 

        10        let me just check with Mr. Kajelijeli.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay, Counsel.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is the end of the direct, Your Honours.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Any 

        14        cross-examination?

        15   MS. OJEMENI: Yes, Your Honour.

        16                         CROSS-EXAMINATION

        17   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        18   Q.   Witness, you referred to one Semahane in your evidence, 

        19        as the person who replaced Juvénal Kajelijeli in 1993,  

        20        when Kajelijeli was removed and also when Harera died in 

        21        April 1994.  This same Semahane also acted as 

        22        bourgmestre; is that your evidence?

        23   A.   No, maybe my answer wasn't well understood.  I said that 

        24        Semahane was acting in 1994.

        25   Q.   Witness, I draw your attention to the response you gave 

        26        when the Defence was leading you in your evidence 

        27        earlier on in the day, in the morning.  You were asked 

        28        who was the bourgmestre -- who acted as bourgmestre when 

        29        Juvénal Kajelijeli was removed in 1993 and you said it 

        30        was Semahane who replaced him.  Then again you were 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        62


                                                           5 DECEMBER 2002
          KAJELIJELI



         1        asked:  Are you sure?  You then introduced the fact that 

         2        Ndisetse was acting bourgmestre?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Is that a question, Your Honour or is it 

         4        Prosecutor just testifying?  Did she put a question to 

         5        witness?

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, I think he is drawing the attention of 

         7        the witness to what is his testimony according to what 

         8        is -- before she asks her question.

         9   THE WITNESS: At the time, I had a very time-consuming job and 

        10        you can see that this was ten years ago.  Maybe I won't 

        11        be able to remember that very easily, but I mentioned 

        12        Semahane and I then later on made a correction.  I once 

        13        again continued to speak about the background to the 

        14        replacement.  Kajelijeli was dismissed in February 1993.  

        15        Immediately, he was temporarily replaced by Conseiller 

        16        Ndisetse.  Since it was temporary replacement, 

        17        Harerimana was appointed bourgmestre.  Harerimana died 

        18        on the -- on the 8th of April 1994 and he was replaced 

        19        by Semahane, once again temporarily before Kajelijeli 

        20        was appointed bourgmestre.

        21   Q.   Are you telling the Court that Semahane did not act as 

        22        bourgmestre when Kajelijeli as removed in 1993?  Is that 

        23        what you are telling the Court now? 

        24   A.   I am talking about what I know.  I said that Semahane 

        25        was a replacement of the bourgmestre in 1994.

        26   Q.   I draw your attention to your response this morning when 

        27        you were asked:  Are you sure of this?  This is 

        28        referring to the fact that you had said that Semahane 

        29        was the acting bourgmestre when Kajelijeli was removed 

        30        from office in 1993.  Your answer was this -- sorry,

         1        please I will draw his attention to his last response.  

         2        Let him not respond now.  Let him just listen to what 

         3        you are reading to him now.  You responded by saying 

         4        that Semahane replaced Juvénal Kajelijeli after 

         5        Conseiller Ndisetse.  Are you then saying that Semahane 

         6        did not at any point in time before the appointment of 

         7        Harerimana act as bourgmestre in 1993?

         8   A.   No, that is not what I stated.  Maybe you misunderstood 

         9        what I testified to.

        10   Q.   I didn't misunderstand what you testified.  I am just 

        11        stating what you said.  Are you changing your -- 

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Objection, Your Honour.  There is no need 

        13        argue with the witness.  The witness has answered --

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: And it is on record anyway.

        15   MS. OJEMENI:  Yes, it is on record, Your Honour.  I am just 

        16        drawing his attention that he is changing his story.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. I think you have repeated this story 

        18        twice and the witness has answered this twice. 

        19   MS. OJEMENI: Very well, Your Honour. 

        20   BY MS. OJEMENI:

        21   Q.   Witness, who was Semahane in 1993 during the term of 

        22        office of Juvénal Kajelijeli? 

        23   A.   I am not a native from that area, I didn't have to know 

        24        Semahane, and when he became bourgmestre, I had nothing 

        25        to seek from him at the commune office.

        26   Q.   Witness, Semahane was assistant bourgmestre under 

        27        Juvénal Kajelijeli in 1993; wasn't he? 

        28   A.   I don't know about that because I wouldn't go to the 

        29        bureau communal and even to know who was the acting 

        30        bourgmestre I learnt that from other people.

          KAJELIJELI



         1   Q.   But you knew about Ndisetse acting as bourgmestre in 

         2        replacement of Juvénal Kajelijeli in 1993? 

         3   A.   Yes, I know that Ndisetse is aware of that too.

         4   Q.   You had something to do with Ndisetse while he was in 

         5        office as acting bourgmestre, didn't you?

         6   A.   Before he was appointed acting bourgmestre I knew him 

         7        because he was conseiller in the secteur in which I 

         8        lived.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, there is a problem, I think if 

        10        the Prosecutor is going to proceed in this area without 

        11        cautioning the witness, we may end up with him just 

        12        answering in ways which may be prejudicial to him.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we take note of what your observations,  

        14        Counsel, and we understand.  Can we come back to that or 

        15        maybe, we can go, we don't see any people around.  We 

        16        can go to a very short closed session to deal with that 

        17        answer that has been given and sort it out if you want 

        18        to follow it and then come back to open session.
