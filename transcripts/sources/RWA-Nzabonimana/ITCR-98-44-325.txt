MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the session, please? 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 9th of April 2008, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:  
	Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  Your cross-examination will proceed.  And I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began.  

Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning.  I commend you for your punctuality.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we are 15 minutes late.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I always thought that the parties were supposed to be assembled at 8:45, and I was pleased to see you here at 9 o'clock.  



WITNESS BDW,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	In any event, Witness BDW.  Mwaramutse, amakuru ki? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I'm very well, thank you.  
Q.	Now, I want to go over with you -- the last part of my cross-examination is going to deal with the document that you produced for us yesterday, so I'm going to go over that with you.  Do you have the document with you today? 
A.	I know I've already given you a copy of this document, and so I haven't brought it back with me this morning.
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  If the witness could be shown a copy of the document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, first of all, can you tell us how it was that you were able to obtain the document yesterday during the course of the day?  I noticed that when you first discussed the document you said that you thought you might have it in Arusha, and then you produced the document for us after the afternoon break.  I was wondering, how did you manage to get ahold of the document yesterday?  
A.	As I stated in my testimony, this document had remained in my file.  And when we took our midafternoon adjournment I asked for those in charge of witness security to go and find this document in my bag in the safe house.  Once I had got hold of my bag again, I could then recuperate the document.  I was the person, therefore, who requested of the security officers that they go and get my bag so that I may lay my hands on the document and give it to you.  
Q.	Okay, and thank you very much for doing that.  That was very helpful.  Now, can you tell us what other documents you have with you in Arusha?  
A.	I do not know whether there are any relevant documents that you might like to have access to.  If you tell me which documents you would like to see, then I shall go and check and see whether I can find them amongst the documents that I have in my possession.  And if you asked -- well, you asked me to give you this very document because you said that I had testified against your client when I reached Ruhengeri prison, and I wanted to prove to you that this had commenced well before that date.  I also wanted to show thereby that this testimony was destined to other individuals apart from those within the Tribunal because I was providing this testimony before a Gacaca jurisdiction. 
Q.	Yes.  No, I agree with you that this document is very important, and we're going to discuss it.  But during the course of your testimony you consistently said that I had not produced complete documents.  And I'm wondering if you have any of the documents in a complete form that you saw yesterday.  
A.	Which document would you like to gain access to, Counsel?  Please be more specific because I know that all the documents that I have made reference to during my testimony are well known to you.  And I say this because I know that these documents exist in my file and that you have, therefore, had access to them whilst you were conducting your investigations on my file before the Gacaca courts.  
Now, you might like to specify which documents you would like to have access to, and I shall then go and check and see whether those documents exist.  And if they do, I shall hand them over to you. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's start with your July 2002 confession.  I have never seen that.  Do you have that with you? 
A.	This document is to be found in my file.  And in my trial in Kibuye I explained this fact.  And I gave a copy of my confession, as the judges said that the text of my confession did not exist in my file.  However, I am not entirely certain that I do have this document with me.  I shall check, and if I do I shall hand it over to you. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  And then when we looked at the letter of the 7th of March 2003, you told me that that was not -- there were three pages there.  First was a document that had 2005 when you were transmitting your letter to Gacaca.  And then there were two pages, the second of which was signed by you and dated the 7th of March 2003.  And I am referring to document 5 in my packet.  So do you have the complete document from March of 2003 that you submitted?  
A.	I wonder why you do not have the document in its entirety.  I did give the full document, which comprised four pages, and it is a confession.  On the last page there was information in my possession that was not part of my confession.  And I noted myself that the document that you produced was incomplete because it was only my confession as such.  However, this was incomplete because the text referring to the dates is not part of the text that you adduced into evidence.  However, if you go back to the source of this document, I believe that you will be able to have access to the document in its entirety. 
Q.	And my question to you is do you have that document here so you could produce it for us? 
A.	I did not expect such a request, Counsel.  I would need to check to see whether I have the full text with me.  However, you could request this document from the Rwandan judicial authorities whence you obtain the other documents.  I shall make an effort, and I shall see whether I do have the full document with me.  If I do not find it, however, I believe that you have better means than I do to contact the Rwandan tribunals who will then be able to give you -- or the Rwandan courts, who will then be able to give you a full document.  The Gacaca court should have this document.  So were you to contact the Gacaca court of my neighbourhood, you would be able to have access to this document. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, still on the subject of what documents you could produce for us, do you have any other documents in which you mention Mr. Karemera? 
A.	You have seen all the documents I mentioned.  There is the document notably that I produced into evidence yesterday.  There is also the other document that you showed to me yesterday.  I did not need to bring with me documents in which I did not mention him and acts which he had committed and which I might have taken part in.  But in view of the fact that I am here before you, you can ask me questions on other events and I might be able to provide you with the necessary explanations. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would ask at this time that you direct WVSS to retrieve his bag from the safe house so that we can have this available.  I expect his testimony is going to be concluded today, so it would be useful to have the information before he leaves.  So may you make that order, and we can have that process underway while I continue my cross-examination?  
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Robinson makes his application to Your Honours.  The Prosecution have no position on that other than to say it is interesting what is being revealed as a result of fishing around for further documents.  It may be that this exercise is not helpful to Mr. Karemera at all.  But if Mr. Robinson makes the application, it's a matter for Your Honours as to how to deal with it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We do not think that we should make an order for the private property of the witness to be brought to the court.  

Just as a comment on your aside, Mr. Robinson, yesterday afternoon at the -- just before the tea break, you thought you had 30 minutes more at that time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct, and I kept to that.  I finished within 301 minutes, and then we produced this document.  And now, believe me, I have a lot of questions about this document, and I think it will be very interesting to the Trial Chamber.  

So, however, with respect to obtaining these documents that the witness says he may have, what I would ask you to do, not to order they be produced to the parties but that the bag be brought to the witness and he can decide once he has that.  But if we don't do that now, I think we're going to be in a position later on where we are waiting for those documents.  When they are available to us now to be used, it seems prudent to at least take the steps to bring the bag to the witness.  Then we can see from there if it's necessary or what the situation is concerning producing other documents.  

First he has to see if he has them with him.  If he does, we can ask him if he is willing to produce them.  But I think that it would be best to use this time to have them at least take the first step of bringing his property to him.  I'm not asking you to do any more than that.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you just have reiterated the same request that we denied.  This is not a new point.  You mentioned this yesterday afternoon.  And we don't think that we should make an order addressing his private property at your request.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDW, did you want to say something? 
A.	I wanted to answer your request, Counsel.  

If I produced the document that I handed over to you yesterday, I wanted to prove to you that you were not right in saying that I had started to testify against your client when I arrived at Ruhengeri prison and after an alleged agreement that I had come to with other co-detainees.  And I wanted to prove to you that I had not even made such a testimony even when I was in Kibuye prison.  So this was with a view to contradicting the position you had adopted as to when I had begun testifying against your client.  So this is what I wanted to say to you, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  We're going to look at this document, and if indeed the document is as you have represented, I will owe you an apology because indeed the document does refer to Mr. Karemera and Mr. Nzirorera and was written while you were at Kibuye prison.  So we will go through the document, and if at the end it seems that the document is what it appears, I will owe you an apology.  If it seems that the document is otherwise, then perhaps there will be consequences for you.  But we will go over that very carefully.  

But, in any event, what I would ask of you, so that we can make your testimony finish today, is that you -- do you have any problem again to have the witness protection services go back and retrieve your bag so that when we take a break you could look through it and decide for us whether or not you have any of the documents that you accused me of producing that were incomplete? 
A.	Well, Counsel, when I brought to you the document that I handed over to you yesterday, this was on my own initiative.  You did not have to ask me beforehand.  I believe that this is a time-wasting manoeuvre.  It is not necessary for me to go and look for other documents in my bag because until now you have not got any specific questions on the subject of the alleged documents which might be in my possession that then might give rise to a response.  So these documents are not, to my mind, relevant.  And the document which I handed over to you was given to you on my own initiative.  You did not have to request for that document beforehand. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, why don't we deal with that document and we will see how we end up.  So you have the document in front of you now, correct? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I do have a copy before me. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, the document you had yesterday that we made a copy of, was that an original or was that a photocopy? 
A.	Counsel, I was the person who drafted this very document and I wrote it with my own hand.  If you have any questions to put on this document, you may go ahead, because I am here before you and I am the author of this document. 
Q.	And my question to you is whether the document that you had in your possession yesterday was an original or a photocopy.
A.	As I said, I am the author of this document.  And I would specify that some of the pages that I used were lined.  I drafted this document in 2002 when I was at Kibuye prison. 
Q.	But my question to you is yesterday when you produced the document, was that a photocopy of the document that had been filed, or was that an original? 
A.	I do not quite -- I do not quite know how to answer your question because I have systematically repeated that I penned this document.  I went on to specify that the first page is not lined, that the second page is lined, and -- and the third page, and that I was the person who wrote this document at the time when I was in Kibuye prison.
MR. MORLEY:
It may assist if I mention a matter -- if the witness takes his headphones off, please -- Your Honours may be aware, and Mr. Robinson, I anticipate,  is aware, that very often what happens with documents in the prisons is they are copied.  That is to say, there is an original and then there are handwritten copies, and that photocopying facilities are not at all prevalent in the prisons over in Rwanda.  And it may be that my learned friend's question might assist the witness in the form of, "Is the document that you produced yesterday a handwritten copy of another document which was filed with the Kibuye prison?"  I don't know.  I'm simply trying to assist.  I think the witness is confused about the nature of photocopying. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I agree with Mr. Morley.  I'm going to try and clarify that.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDW, what I'm trying to understand is this:  You wrote the document and you handed it --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
His headphones are not on his ears.  

You may resume.
MR. ROBINSON:
	Okay, thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDW, what I'm trying to understand is this:  You wrote this document while you were in Kibuye prison, and you turned it in to the director of the prison so that it would be forwarded to whom you had addressed it.  How did you obtain the document that you have in court?
A.	That is an interesting question, Counsel.  In Rwandan prisons -- I should explain to you how Rwandan prisons work.  Nobody is authorised to produce a sole copy of a document that he will then have signed by the director of the prison.  You have to give as many copies as recipients of the document.  Therefore, you have to make as many copies by hand, that is, without using carbon paper and without making photocopies.  So I do not understand why you have continued to say that this is a photocopy.  It is an original.  That is to say that I produced as many originals as there were recipients of the document.  So this is not a photocopy, Counsel. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  You were very clear about that and I think we all understand.  Now, the three pages that are contained in this document, is it your testimony that those are the same three pages that were submitted together on the 20th of December 2002 to the authority at Kibuye prison? 
A.	I do not know how to explain this to you.  I have told you that the document I handed over to you yesterday is the same document that was submitted to the director of the prison, and it is those same three pages that were given to the director of the prison.  You can cross-check that in the archives of Kibuye prison.  And you, yourself, will realise that it is one and the same document.  You can even find this document at the public prosecutor's office.  I am giving you the opportunity to go there and ask to consult that document.  

In fact, I do not know why you did not do this during your visits to Rwanda.  I even think that you have the same document with you.  I believe that this document was one of those documents that were given to me, including a summary of my testimony.  I produced this document in order to refute your statement, according to which I started giving my testimony when I arrived Ruhengeri prison after an agreement with other co-detainees.  But I wanted to point out that I gave that statement before I arrived Ruhengeri, and that I had already made a confession prior to my arrival at Ruhengeri prison. 
Q.	Witness BDW, I put it to you:  It's our position, after studying these documents, that what you have produced in court is a montage; that the first page was what you submitted to the prison authorities on the 20th of December 2002, but that the second and third page is something that has been produced much more recently than that, in fact, probably after you gave your testimony.  I want to put that to you.  That's my position.  That's what I am asking you to comment on.  So do you have any comment on that?
A.	You are mistaken, Counsel.  In prison there is no special paper on which you have to draft your confession or testimony.  I wrote down my text on the sheets of paper that I could have access to.  And so you can realise that it is the same paper, the same type of paper, that I used for the other documents in my case file.  It is not the prison that gives us paper.  We try to acquire paper ourselves.  And that paper is not usually of good quality.

So I wrote this text, whether it is the first, second or third pages.  Do you think that I would have had access to better quality paper and I chose to write down the second and third pages on poor quality paper?  No.  In prison everyone who wishes to write down something must acquire their paper themselves.  It is not the prison that makes paper available to the detainees.  I do not think that you can go as far as claiming that I wrote this down when I was at Sefara, because the security officers would have seen me.  

I'm fortunate because I brought this document along with me and it makes it possible for me to refute your statements in this court, because you claimed that I started giving evidence against your client only after I went to Ruhengeri prison.  So I am pointing out that the prisoners have to buy their paper themselves, and that is why it can be low quality paper. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm briefly on my feet to express concern about the manner in which the last question was put.  

Perhaps if the witness might take his headphones off.  

From the manner in which it was expressed, Mr. Robinson is saying to the witness that on instructions it is his case that this witness has attempted to pervert the course of justice by putting together, as he put it, a montage.  Certainly he can enquire of the witness whether there is a montage.  But what concerns me is the putting that the position is the witness is attempting to pervert the course of justice.  

Ordinarily, when one puts an allegation of that nature, there needs to be foundation for it.  It's not enough to make it up off the top of your head simply because what the witness has been saying is inconsistent with the way the Defence would like the evidence to come out.  And it's my respectful submission that if Mr. Robinson has foundation for suggesting that those three pieces of paper are a montage, he should say so to Your Honours with the witness not having his headphones on.  But if he doesn't have foundation, in other words, it's simply "have a go," that ought to be cleared, Your Honours.  

Ordinarily where I come from I would not be permitted to put a question in that way.  It may be that the practice is different before Your Honours.  I would not be permitted to put a question in that way unless I had foundation for it.  I hope the point is of assistance.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I think we have encountered this issue before as to whether or not I am allowed to put a proposition to a witness when the proposition I am putting is not within the personal knowledge of my client.  Mr. Morley seems to be of the position that I can only put something to a witness when I have instructions from my client as to a different version of events that he knows.  Obviously, my client has never seen this document before, and so I have no instructions from my client on this issue.  However, I do have many elements which indicate that the document is a montage, and I'm going to go through those elements step by step with the witness. 
 
So if I have done something improper, I apologise.  But I don't believe that -- I think that when we discussed this matter the last time you said that I wasn't required to have information directly from my client.  I could have information from investigations or from other sources that is the basis upon which I put a proposition to the witness.  And it's on that, based on your prior ruling on that, that I proceeded, and I think I did so correctly.  But if I'm in error, you can let me know and I will behave accordingly in the future.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It may very well be that the problem has to do with the use of language.  Where I come from the practice is exactly as Mr. Morley has described it, because it would not be proper for counsel to indicate to the witness that his case is something that it is not.  On the other hand, it would be permissible for counsel to make a suggestion to a witness.  And the phrase that Mr. Robinson used, put a proposition, the problem had to do with his choice of words.  He said -- you said, "I put it to you it is our position," which could in fact create the impression that you are saying that is what your case is.  And one should not do that unless there was material to support it.  

But I think if clarified, and I think the witness will be told that, what you were mainly doing was making a suggestion, to which he has responded.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, this is my case.  It is my case that the document is a montage.  My client doesn't know that, but I have it from other information, from other observations of the document.  That is my case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then Mr. Morley's position is correct.  Then if, at the end, you don't produce evidence to support it, then we will consider that to be improper behaviour of counsel.  If that is your case and you put it to the witness, put him through this situation of -- and then you don't produce the material later on, that would not be proper behaviour for counsel.  So that is why Mr. Morley's indicating what is the material on which you're going to substantiate that this is your case? 
MR. ROBINSON:
By a review of the text of the document itself as well as-- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then make a deduction.  That's a suggestion.  That's quite different.  You can enquire into his veracity, and you can make suggestions to him.  But to say, "It is my case," implies that you have evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Understood.  If the witness could put his headphones back on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, when your headphones were off it was clarified that what Mr. Robinson was doing was actually trying to test whether you were telling the truth.  So he was actually suggesting to you that it was a montage and trying to determine, through his questioning, whether he could persuade the Court whether it was a montage or not.  So that is where we are, and he will continue his questioning of you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, I want us to take a look at the text of this document so that we can determine its authenticity.  And, first of all, we're going to solely focus on the first page of the document.  

Now, we had this translated yesterday, and I have an English version of this, and I'm going to read the text in the first page so we all understand exactly what was contained in there.  First of all, at the very top it's dated Kibuye, the 20th of December 2002.  It has your name and your cellule and your personal information.  And it indicates it's to be sent through the Kibuye prison chief warden or director.  And the subject is, "Testimony regarding the events of April 1994 relating to the genocide and massacres which occurred as from 1993."  

And then the first paragraph says, "After confessing and pleading guilty and seeking forgiveness from God and from the government of Rwanda, as well as all the people of Rwanda, and families of survivors of the genocide, if that is the case, I will testify to what I have seen, and my testimony will assist Rwandans to resolve problems raised before Gacaca courts.  And this testimony will assist in ascertainment of the truth."  

Then the next line says, "April 1994:  On the 13th of April 1994, the first incidents occurred in Rugabano cellule.  Those incidents were caused by one Muhayimana and Alphonse Mudatinda.  Muhayimana was a gendarme.  He was the son of Munyakazi.  The killings spread everywhere.  On the 14th of April 1994, attackers attacked Munyashuri's house, but Munyashuri was able to get away.  They took one car from that house.  The group of assailants was made up of the following persons:  Ragaba, Byisi, Sande, Mwalimu, Kabera, Nyacyabukura, Kamegeli, Rwanga, Karoli, Nyaramba, Gasirikari, Uzabakiriho.  This group of attackers continued committing acts of atrocities in Rugabano at the trading centre."  

And parenthetically I note I'm not spelling these names because they are contained in yesterday's translation session.

"In April, on a day which I do not remember (April 1994), Ezira's son, who was a soldier, arrived in the company of attackers who had come from Kibuye cellule, as well as from the Kirabwa cellule, Rusengheri secteur, Bwakira commune.  The assailants attacked my neighbour's house, and my neighbour was Matabaro.  Matabaro lived in Rugabano cellule.  There they killed two children and took two goats with them.  Among the attackers, I was able to recognise Musonera, Mananga, Hakizimana and Kizihahira." 

	Then it goes on to say, on the first page -- this is now what appears to be the last paragraph of the text -- "On the 21st of April 1994, at around 9 o'clock, a lorry arrived from Birambo.  In that lorry there were people who had been killed at the Rugabano roadblock.  One of the people who was supposed to be killed was able to get away.  The roadblock had been set up by two conseillers:  The Rusengheri conseiller, whose name was Nkurikiyinika, and Mugunda's conseiller, whose name was Nyiramirano.  

"The roadblock was at the border of those two secteurs.  The roadblock was manned by Muhayimana, who was a gendarme and the son of Munyarimiro, who was carrying a firearm.  He worked with Mudatinda, Bikishope, Ruremesha's son, as well as Byisikagoba, Rwanga, Munyamdashoboka, Uzabakiriho, nicknamed Mujomyi, and other young thugs who lived in Rugabano.  Augustin Kabera Munyamdezi was head of Karehe II cellule and had a business in the Rugabano cellule."

And that goes on to say, "The items unloaded -- offloaded from that lorry were shared among the attackers there and then, and the dead people were buried in Nzabakihiro's plot, or property."  He was someone's son.  It doesn't say the name.  

"The roadblock was supervised permanently by an agronomist known as Mutatinda and someone called Nyiramirimo, who lived at that place at Rugabano cellule.  And we had a business there.  I personally witnessed those events, but I did not take part in them."

And then on the bottom of that first page is your name written out and your signature.

Now, you will agree, would you not, that the text of this first page deals entirely with the events of 1994? 
A.	I believe that you read the subject of that letter.  It is written that I would speak about events of 1993 and 1994.  I can see that there are contradictions between what I said and what you read.  You said the 17th.  I believe I said the 13th.  And the information that I provided was information at my disposal regarding what I witnessed in 1994.  I provided that information during the Gacaca proceedings in order to enlighten the judges because they did not have that information at their disposal. 
Q.	So the text of what's on page 1 deals entirely with 1994 events.  But on the subject line, if you look at where the word "Impamvu" is, it's about six lines from the top, and there is a colon, and then it starts with the word "Gutanga" -- that's on the first line.  Then there is a second line.   It starts with the word "muli" and then "4/1994."  Then there's a third line, which seems to have the word "mitsemba."  

And then, if you look at it, squeezed in between the text and the third line there is three words written, and it involves 1993.  And I put it to you that you added that line with those three words of 1993 when you created this montage because you realised that in the subject of this letter there had been no reference to 1993, yet the subject that you wanted to discuss in the last two pages, which you added, dealt with 1993.  

And I suggest to you that after this document had been submitted, while you were creating this montage, you tried to squeeze in those three words so that the subject would appear to include 1993.  Do you have any comment on that? 
A.	Counsel, I have a question to put to you.  You have always stated that this is a montage.  I do not understand how you can claim that I am the one who drafted this document.  No one told me to do it.  It was not an examination that I was writing.  No one could have asked me the question as to why I did not include this or that.  

I know that I am not at your level, but I was the one who prepared this document, who drafted this document.  And the subject of the document is what happened in 1994 during the genocide and in 1993 prior to the genocide.  I do not know why you are claiming that I simply inserted the words "1993."  I do not know whether your work consists in slandering people.  I did not invent anything.  I did not add anything new.  I included everything when I drafted this document.  I do not understand how you can dare to claim that this is a montage.  I believe you are just probably trying to disorient me.  But whatever you say cannot make me change what I have already said.  I drafted that document.  

No one dictated what I had to write down.  You were not present when I prepared the document.  And I will rather appeal to you to go and consult with the various sources that I have mentioned to you.  And if you can ascertain that the documents you find are not consistent with this one, then you can confront me on that.  But for the time being you are not correct in saying what you are saying because the document I have here is -- or, rather, corresponds to the other documents that I have in my case file. 
Q.	Well, I'm going to point out to you a number of elements that lead me to believe that you have created the second and third pages after the fact.  One of them I have just pointed out to you is the placement of the phrase at the subject line.  Now I'm going to point out to you some others.  But, first of all, we can agree, can we not, that Édouard Karemera is not mentioned on the first page of this document? 
A.	Yes.  If you look at the contents of the document and specifically on the first page, you will realise that Karemera's name does not appear.  I could not have said that Karemera was a member of the group that went to steal a cow in Munyashuri's compound, whereas he was not present.  I talked about the vehicle that came to Rugabano and carried the people to go and carry out killings.  Karemera was not there, so I cannot claim that he was there.  I, therefore, do not know whether you wanted me to mention Karemera in each paragraph.  On the first page I gave the names of the people who perpetrated those specific crimes.  But Karemera's name appears on the other pages in which I disclosed the crimes in which he was involved. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, that is your signature on the bottom of the first page, is it not? 
A.	Every time I drafted a document I had to sign on each page, and the same applies to the documents that you produced yesterday.  Each page bears my signature.  Every time I prepared a document I made a point of signing on each page so that any document that I was not involved in preparing could not be attributed to me. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's look at some of those documents, then, and see if you are correct.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness can be shown document Exhibit 441B.  This is document 6A in my packet of materials from yesterday.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness BDW, directing your attention to the document that's been placed in front of you, it's your letter that you wrote on the 2nd of April 2003.  It consists of two pages.  I only see your signature at the end of the document on the second page.  Did you sign the bottom of the first page of that letter like you did on the document in question? 
A.	Every time I put my name, I would sign.  If you consult the first page of the document, my name does not appear, so I could not sign that first page in view of the fact that my name did not appear on that page.  So we are going nowhere.  The first page does not bear my name.  Therefore, I could not be in a position to sign it.  Every time that you find my name on a document, you will also find my signature appended. 
Q.	Really, Witness BDW, I don't know what you're talking about.  Your name is at the top of this document that is right in front of you on the first page, right at the very top.  There is your name, then your cellule, your secteur, your district, your préfecture.  So your name's right at the top, just as it is in the document that you brought for us yesterday.  
A.	Counsel, the first page of the document you can see that my name is not at the bottom of the page.  I know that common practice is that when one gets to the bottom of the page one writes one's name and then one appends one's signature.  Maybe I do not understand things in the same way as you do.  However, every time I draft a document, at the end of each page I will write my name and then I would make sure that I appended my signature.  Now, as to telling me that I was to sign under that part where my address figures, well, I'm not used to that practice. 
Q.	Well, look, Witness BDW, in the document that you submitted on the 2nd of April 2003.  You neither wrote your name on the bottom nor signed it on the first page, correct? 
A.	What was your question, Counsel?
Q.	On the document that is in front of you, you neither wrote your name on the bottom of the first page nor did you sign it, correct? 
A.	Yes, you are saying that I did not put my name at the bottom of the document, which means that I didn't need to sign it.  What I do know is that there were two pages connected, and that I then signed the end of the document.  I'm not contesting the contents of the document.  In order to append my signature to a document, I beforehand verify the contents of the document and what I said therein.  

So when my identity was mentioned and once I had read the contents of the document and I had verified that this was the contents of my testimony, I then signed it.  The name was just put on the document in order to show that I was the person who had provided this testimony.  However, if you separate these three pages, then the document is no longer a whole.  

Therefore, if one signs a document, it is to say that the contents of the document is in fact the testimony of the person who has signed the document.  I might not be an expert as to the drafting of documents, but I would like to say that this is a document that I drafted, and I'm saying that today and I will continue to claim that. 
Q.	Well, Witness BDW, you are talking in circles.  The point is that on this document that is in front of you -- 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, that's unfair on the witness.  "You're talking in circles," that's unfair.  If the witness might take his headphones off.  

Your Honours will observe he's being, perhaps properly, put through the mill on the origin of documents.  The document put in front of him, as I understand it, is not connected.  That is to say, it's not stapled together.  So he has one page photocopied, which doesn't have a signature on it, and another page photocopied which does have a signature on it.  And he's been trying to express, it appears to me -- a matter for Your Honours -- that the two pages originate from him, albeit the first page doesn't have his signature on the bottom of it, which would be his usual practice.  

And it may be that he is troubled by the repeated detailed questioning of the manner in which he creates documents and his practice with regard to signatures.  And it may be that, being unfamiliar with the courtroom, he is having difficulty expressing himself in what might be thought in his mind to be lawyerly terms as he's dealing with a lawyer's series of questions.  It's unfair to say to this man, whose background is known to be a farmer, that he is talking in circles.   
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, maybe I haven't made my point very clear, since Mr. Morley doesn't seem to understand it.  But in the document that the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley was talking about courtesy to the witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I agree with him.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON.
Q.	Witness BDW, I want to make sure we both understand -- Witness BDW, I want to make sure we both understand the same thing.  In the document that you produced yesterday, at the end of the first page you signed it and wrote your name.  And it's my position that that was the complete document that you submitted, and that is why you signed it and wrote your name because it was the end of the document.  Now, you say that that was only the first page of a three-page document and that it was your practice whenever you submitted documents to write your name and sign it at the bottom of each page.  

What we've done is looked at another document that you submitted, the one that is in front of you.  It's a two-page document, and it bears your name and your signature only at the end of the document on the second page.  Now, do you understand the point that I've made? 
A.	We are not understanding here.  You're saying that I signed the second and third pages.  But I would like to say the following:  The document comprises three pages, and each page covers a different subject from the subjects covered on the other pages.  And I signed the bottom of each page of this document.  However, I was the person who penned the entire document.  It was with a view to making sure that if those pages were separated or became separated, the testimony of every page could be attributed to the specific witness.  That's why I signed each page in order -- before handing this over to the Gacaca courts.  It is so that the recipients are able to identify the author of the document, even if the document covers crimes that were committed at separate locations.  

Now, Counsel, you have noted yourself that the first document you produced was signed.  I do not, therefore, understand what your problem is.  Every time I write a document I append my signature in order to prove that I am the author of that document.  

With respect to the document comprising three pages, you will note that the first page covers events of 1994 and the two following pages cover events which occurred in 1993.  This is why I signed the first page, which covers events in 1994, and this is also why I signed the second and third pages, because these pages cover events which occurred in 1993 in different locations.  So I never changed my version of events.  This is what I have always claimed, and I continue to claim this today before this very Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Well, Witness BDW, I will simply point out to you that in the document that is before you, Exhibit 441B, there is the same break exactly between items 1 and 2 -- well, between item 2, which finishes the first page, and item 3, which begins the second page.  That very same break is observed in the document that you signed at the bottom of each page.  So your explanation is not consistent between the two documents.  

	But, in any event, let me move on to show you document D. NZ440B, which is -- 
A.	Counsel, please give me the time to provide you with my position on the matter.  If you look at the document which you just mentioned, you will note that the point which appears at the beginning of the first page continues on to the second page.  I couldn't sign at the bottom of the first page because the subject continued on to the second page.  I believe, therefore, that you did not expect me to be in a position to produce this document.  And you are surprised because this entirely demolishes your case, according to which I came to an agreement with co-detainees in Ruhengeri prison. 
Q.	But again, Witness BDW, you are in error because, looking at the document that is before you, 441B, you will see that on the first page you discuss point 1 and point 2, and point 2 comes to an end, and then on the second page you begin with point 3.  

Now, looking at the document that you have produced for us yesterday, on the second page you have point 1 and point 2, and it comes to an end.  And then you begin the third page with point 3.  But in the document that you produced yesterday you signed your name at the bottom of page 2 in between points 2 and 3.  And in the document that is genuine that you are looking at in front of you, you did not sign your name between points 2 and 3.  So the point that you have made here today is not valid and it's not borne out by the two documents.  Do you have any comment on that?  
A.	Counsel, I am repeating myself.  I believe that this is a time-wasting activity and that you are not seeking the truth on the matter.  

I said that in the first document I signed at the bottom of each page because they were -- it marked the end of the specific fact I was covering.  However, in my letter of the 2nd of April 2003 I could not sign because I was continuing to provide information on another point.  So the document which was sent to the Kibuye prosecutor's office was handed over at the same time as other documents.  And that is why I signed every page of the document I drafted, because I was frightened that one of the pages would go amiss in the document that was being handed over.  
However, you are still asking why I did not sign the bottom of the first page of my letter dated the 2nd of April 2003, whereas I had not yet come to the end of the subject matter embarked upon on the first page.  Now, in the document dated the 2nd of April 2003 there was no risk that this page go amiss, whereas this was not the case for the document dated the 20th of December 2002.  

So I did this in my own way, and I do not believe you can hold anything against me for this.  I was asked to write a statement providing my personal testimony, and I wanted to sign the bottom of every page in order to prove that I was the author of that document.  I believe that what I'm saying goes without saying, and I do not understand why you do not want to comprehend the explanations I am providing you with.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness BDW.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very briefly --
	
	Headphones off, please.
	
	This may assist.  It may assist the witness for Mr. Robinson to make it plain to him, as he said in his question a moment ago, that he accepts that D. NZ441 is genuine, that is to say, both pages were written by this witness.  

I have the impression -- I know not what is in Your Honours' minds -- that the witness is trying to explain that the first page of 441, unsigned by him, is nevertheless his document.  As we know, 441 was obtained by Mr. Robinson from the prosecutor's files in Rwanda.  So therefore, and as he said a moment ago in his questioning, although it was lost in the length of the questioning, it appears that Mr. Robinson accepts that 441 is genuinely in the hand of this witness.  It may assist him to know that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think Mr. Morley is in error.  The document came from the Prosecution, not from my getting it in the files.  He can see the K number on the document.  I also think the witness understood exactly the point and was making his own point.  So I'm not going to go into this because I think it will confuse the witness.  And I think Mr. Morley isn't maybe following exactly, but from what I understand the witness to be saying, he's responding exactly to what I was putting to him.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  If the document has come from the Prosecution, having been obtained from the prosecution files in Rwanda, is it Mr. Robinson's case that it's not a genuine document?  Because in his question to the witness, as part of the way he phrased the question, my ears perked up at Mr. Robinson referring to 441 as genuine.  
It would help this witness to know, and certainly me to know, whether it's Mr. Robinson's case that the first page of 441 is in some way a forgery or a fraudulent piece of paper because it is unsigned by the witness.  That is what the witness is labouring under the apprehension about, that because it's not signed by him on the first page, that first page is in some way not genuine.  And the way Mr. Robinson asked the question, he suggested in that long question 441 is genuine, whereas the document produced yesterday is a montage.  

And, Mr. Robinson, please make it plain.  Does he accept that 441, first page, is in the hand of this witness as part of the two-page document signed on the second page? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  For Mr. Morley's edification, yes, I do accept that.  I don't think it's necessary to do this with the witness because only it's Mr. Morley who misunderstands the thrust of the question.  But, anyway, for his benefit I accept that 441 is in the hand of the witness.  

Now, to move on --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, fix the witness with his headphones.
MR. MORLEY:
It's not for Mr. Morley's edification.  It's for the witness's.  Can Mr. Robinson please make it plain to him, now that he has explained to Your Honours that he does accept 441 as genuine?  I suspect that will lead to less confusion in the way in which the questions and answers are emerging.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm not going to do that.  I'm going to move on to something else, unless you would like me to go back.  And if you want me to do it, I'll do it, but I don't think it's necessary.  I think the witness understood my point.  I understood his point.  And it's only Mr. Morley that is hung up on something that is not really part of my question.  But if you feel it would be useful to go back to this document to explain that to the witness and have his explanation again, I'll do it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it's necessary.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time do you have?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I would say probably until the break, maybe one and a half more hours.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness --
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think in order to save time I would actually like to direct the Trial Chamber's attention to Exhibit 440B, which is document 5A in my bundle of exhibits.  This is a document that was admitted yesterday.  It's three pages in length, and it bears the signature of the witness only at the end of the entire document on the third page.  I think that, since that is self-evident, it's not necessary for me to question the witness about that, but I simply point it out to the Trial Chamber.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, do you speak French? 
A.	Counsel, you're asking me whether I speak French.  Have you heard me speak French since the beginning of my testimony?
(Pages 1 to 19 by Claudette Ask)



























1025H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	No.  
A.	So what would you like to know?  Have you found any documents that I might have drafted in French which you would like me to explain?  
Q.	I would just like you to tell me whether you speak French.  It seems like you can answer that question, yes or no.  
A.	This is not the first time that I am answering or making a comment on such a proposition or question asking me to provide a closed answer.  I wouldn't be available to provide you a yes-or-no answer to that.  

Since the outset of my testimony, I have always spoken in Kinyarwanda because it is the only language that I master.  
Q.	Do you know what the word "suite" means in French?  That's S-U-I-T-E. 
A.	I can see this word, as you can see it.  And I know that it means that this is a text which runs on, or is a continuation from a previous part of a text.  
Q.	And turning to the top of page two of your document, you wrote that French word at the very beginning of page two; correct? 
A.	Yes, you're right.  
Q.	And what it was translated to us as meaning was, in English, "testimony" -- or, "continuation of testimony, Kibuye, 20 December 2002."  And on the page three, again, is the word "suite" and number three.  

So, in this document that you presented to us yesterday, on the second and third page at the top, you took the trouble to note that it was a continuation of your testimony, and you put the place and the date; correct?  
A.	Yes, you are right.  That is true.  
Q.	And I suggest -- 
A.	It was the continuation of my testimony.  And this appears clearly on page two, and also on page three.  And as you can see for yourself, the testimony on page one covers different events and persons, whereas pages two -- pages three and page two refer to other persons from those referred to on page one. 
Q.	Indeed, can we agree that there's no connection between the text of pages two and three on the one hand, and page one on the other?  
A.	Counsel, there is a connection because these are events which commenced in the year 1993.  And these events led to the genocide of 1994, and they resulted in the fact that members of the population took part in the genocide of 1994.  So, there is a relation between the two series of events and facts. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take the morning recess?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  I think it's a good time. 

We'll take the mid-morning recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1102H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDW, we had just talked about how at the top of the second page, you had written "continuation of my testimony, Kibuye," and the date, "20/12/02".  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'll point out, for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, that on Exhibits 440 and 441, which is documents 5-B and 6-B of my packet of material, there is no such continuation noted on the top of the second and third pages as there is in this document.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness BDW, I'll give you a chance to explain why it is that on the document that I contend was created with pages two and three written sometime later, and the other documents that you submitted to the Court, there is a difference in that you have not written "continuation of my testimony" or "continuation of my statement" on any of the other documents.  
A.	I would first and foremost like to ask you, Counsel, whether you have another version of my document, dated the 20th of December 2002, based on which you are saying to me that there is a difference between the version you have in your possession and the one I gave to you.  I also suggested that you contact the Rwandan courts and the national prosecutor's office where you will be able to find the same document, as well as in the files of the Gacaca courts.  

I have already explained to you the reasons why I added the second and third pages, which I signed respectively, and I said that I was making a difference between the issues covered on the different pages comprising the document.  As I said, I wanted to sign the bottom of each page in order to avoid further -- avoid there being any additions made.  I took this decision on a unilateral basis, and I didn't consult anybody when making this decision.  

You have your own style, Counsel, as a lawyer, and I also have the right to have my own style.  When I decided to write the word "suite" at the top of pages two and three, I wanted to show that this 
was a -- the continuation of a preceding text.  When you read the word "suite" or "continuation" in English, you will realise that this is a continuation of a text.  You might have your own way of showing that a text runs on and that it is a continuation, however, Counsel, I chose to use the word "suite", or "continuation".  
Q.	Well, Witness BDW, my point is that you used that word on the document of the 20th of December because you were trying to show that pages two and three were a continuation of page one, when, in fact, they were not.  And on the other documents that you submitted, you didn't use any word "suite" or any other indication that one continued from the other, because it was self-evident.  Now, that was my point I was putting to you. 

Do you have any comments on that before we move on?  
A.	But, Counsel, what are you basing this on, when you claim that there is no connection or link between page two and page one?  It is my right to use the word "suite" or "continuation" to show that page two is, in fact, a continuation of page one or that page three is a continuation of page two.  This is my own style.  

So, what is your problem with the use of this word "suite" or "continuation"?  Does this change anything in my testimony?  To me, it was an important thing because I wanted to indicate that the contents of page two run on, or are a continuation of page one, and page three was a continuation of what was said on page two.  

The Gacaca courts, to which this document was transmitted, were able to analyse the document; they were able to ascertain who the author was; they were able to identify the various points or issues covered in this testimony, because even if this is one testimony in itself, it does cover a number of issues.  

To my mind, the most important thing is that I am the author of this document and that this document cannot be attributed to anybody else.  I do not understand what you are basing yourself on when you say that I drafted this document in two separate efforts.  
Q.	Well, let's look at the document on the very top right-hand side of the first page, you have written the word "Kibuye" in upper case letters.  At the top of the second page, you have written the word "Kibuye" in script.  And I suggest to you that that's because this document was prepared at two different times, the first page in 2002, the second and third pages, before you came here.  

Can you tell us why you have -- if you were writing one document at one time, you wrote the word "Kibuye" in upper case on page one, and in script on page two?  
A.	Well, Counsel, what is surprising about that?  Did I only use capitals on the first page?  I believe you would have been more convincing had you said that the spelling was not the same, or that the handwriting was not the same.  And even on that point, I would say that my writing can change according to the time of day.  And it might be a weakness on my part, but my writing can change.  My writing in the morning is not the same as it might be in the evening.  

So, I suggest that you carry on your investigations and you go and consult the archives of the Gacaca courts to which this document was transmitted, and then you might have more elements with which to contradict me or to fail to admit what I am saying to you.  And even if we put this document to one side, I am here before you and I can answer your questions orally.  
Q.	Looking at the bottom of the first page where you wrote your name -- or, you printed your name, you printed your name in lower case letters.  Looking at the bottom of pages two and three, you printed your name in upper case letters.  

Again, it's my contention that pages two and three were prepared at the same time, but at a different time than page one.  It's your contention that they were all prepared at the same time.  

Can you explain to us why on page one you printed your name using lower case letters, and on pages two and three you printed your name using upper case letters?  
A.	Counsel, I have the right to write my name in upper or lower case letters.  At an earlier stage, you asked me why I wrote "Kibuye" in upper case letters on the first page and why I did so in lower case letters on the second page.  Well, that is my right.  

If you look on the first page -- well, why don't you ask me why the heading of the letter is in upper case and the actual body of the text of the letter is in lower case?  These are the same words, Counsel.  It is "Kibuye" whether it be upper or lower case.  It is still my name whether it be in upper or lower case.  And if you look at the other documents I have produced, you will note that halfway through the text there are sections written in capital letters, whereas the body of the text is written in lower case letters.  

Now, on the second page, Counsel, is not what is written similar to what is written on the third page?  
Q.	Yes, that's exactly my point.

Now, turning to your signature next to your name, looking at the signature on the second and third pages, it appears to be identical, but looking at the signature on the first page, there appear to be some differences between that with the second and third page, notably, the loop at the end of your signature.  I contend that that's because the first page was prepared at a significantly earlier time than the second and third page.  

Would you like to explain that?  
A.	I believe that I can refute what you are saying basing myself on this point as regards the signature.  Well, when you look at the signatures themselves, can you not see that they are identical?  Despite the fact that they're not entirely identical, I can say that they are my signature.  I'm not a machine and I cannot reproduce my signature in the smallest detail on each occasion.  

If you look closely at the three signatures, you say that they are similar -- however, there are small differences -- you can, therefore, not base yourself upon this in order to say that this is not my signature.  And likewise, the three pages of the document were drafted by myself.  

You have the document before you; you can examine the signatures.  And despite the fact that they might differ slightly one from the other, you can still recognise the fact that these are my signatures.  
Q.	Now, we will agree, can't we, that the second and third pages are on lined paper, and the first page is on unlined paper; correct?  
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?  I didn't quite grasp it.  I did not quite grasp your question.  
Q.	Can we agree that the second and third pages are written on lined paper and the first page is written on unlined paper?  
A.	At the beginning of this line of questioning, I stated that I had written the first page, and I said that I could -- did not have access to similar paper in order to continue writing my text.  And I said that I had, therefore, to use lined paper.  However, this is not the case for the "other copies" because there are some copies where the entire text is drafted upon long-lined paper.  However, as regards the copy I produced to this Trial Chamber, I do recognise the fact that the last two pages are, indeed, drafted on lined paper.  
Q.	With respect to the first page, did you use a pen or a pencil?  
A.	Well, Counsel, why would I have used a pencil in this document?  All that I know is that when a pen runs out of ink, then, of course, I have to use another pen in order to carry on writing.
Q.	And did you use a different pen on the second and third pages than the one you had used on the first page?  
A.	I no longer remember whether I needed to change pens or not during the drafting.  All I do remember is that I wrote this text and that in other documents, it might have been that I did change pens, even if I do not know whether I changed pens whilst writing this very document.  And to be honest, I cannot remember all the pens I used.  All I can say is that I never drafted a document using a pencil.  I always did this using a biro.  
Q.	Witness BDW, it looks to me like the font -- or, the ink from the pen that was used on pages two and three are different than the font -- or, the ink of the pen on page one.  Does it seem that way to you from looking at the document? 
A.	That might be the impression that you are under, Counsel; however, I repeat that I am the person to have written this document of my own hand.  And were you to ask me to write it, once again, I can reassure you by saying that my writing might change halfway through or whilst writing the document.  Everything depends on my state of mind.  Sometimes I might write in upper case, and other times I might write in lower case.  
Q.	Well, just looking at the ink that was used and the font that appears on the document, it appears to me that the font or ink is different from pages two and three than that from page one, with one small exception, and that being in the subject on page one; after the period, the word Bwoko, B-W-O-K-O, then there's a period.  And then there's two words written on that line, which appear to me to be in the same font or ink as pages two and three:  Navabere (phonetic).  And then on the second page -- I mean, on the next line, Kuvamuli (phonetic), 1993.  

And I put it to you -- or, I suggest to you that at the same time that you created pages two and three, you went back to page one and added in that same ink, those words that refer to 1993.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I did not add anything to the first page, Counsel.  I told you from the outset that I am the author of this text.  If your strategy involves the claim that this document might have been drafted by somebody else, well, then, you might need to provide evidence thereof.  However, I retain that I am the person who drafted this document of my very own hand.  And as I said, my handwriting can change during the drafting process.  

You will recall that I did not write only one copy, I wrote a number of copies.  And I have already indicated to you the means whereby you would be able to get hold of the evidence that will corroborate the fact that I am, indeed, the author thereof, because it was transmitted to a number of recipients.  You continue to maintain that I produced documents while I was in Ruhengeri whereas this document was already in existence well before that date.  And this is what I wanted to prove to you on producing the document yesterday.  

Now, you have been leading your investigation.  Has nobody talked to you of the existence of these documents?  Counsel, the situation - or, your situation, is an unfortunate one.  I have proof and evidence, and I am testifying on events that I was an eyewitness to.  And I'm noting that you're just trying to make my life complicated.  I have already said to you that this document exists in the archives of Kibuye prison and also in the archives of the courts to which it was sent.  And you can, yourself, go and consult these very archives with a view to ascertain that it exists in its three-page form as it is before you.  

Now, when you noted that you were not able to maintain your strategy, then you claimed that I drafted this document whilst in Ruhengeri prison.  And I am proving quite the contrary to you.  
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, the subject on the first page is listed as testimony regarding the events of 
	April 1994, relating to the genocide and massacres.  And then what is added after the -- stop after the word massacres, is the phrase "which occurred as from 1993".  And so, you had already, on page one, indicated what the subject was of your letter.  

Now, turning to page two at the very beginning of the text, you, once again, list a subject.  And I'm going to translate the first paragraph as it's been translated to us by the interpreters. 

It says:  "Testimony regarding events that occurred in various areas in Kibuye province, and which were caused by Édouard Karemera.  The purpose of the testimony is to assist Gacaca court to better stand -- to better understand what happened."

Now, can you tell us what was the necessity of creating another subject heading when you had already, at the beginning of the document, indicated what the subject of the document was?  
A.	I first covered the events of 1994, and this differs from what occurred in 1993 because, in the year 1993, this was a case of meetings.  The testimony with reference to what occurred in 1994 is different to that with reference to what occurred in 1993.  And the coordinator of the Gacaca courts was not in a position to transfer such testimony to courts who were not concerned with the matter -- which were not concerned with the matter.  And when one examines events or facts, one goes back to the beginning, to the origins of such facts or events.  

Let me point out to you that the document was intended for the Gacaca courts concerned, that is the Gacaca courts in the localities in which the events took place.  
Q.	And can we agree that the beginning of page two is not a continuation of what has been said on page one?  You know when you're writing a letter or a text, often when you run out of room, then you continue on the next page; you continue the thought, or you continue the same subject.  

But, can we agree that, in this document, what begins on page two is completely separate from the topics that are discussed on page one?  
A.	The reason is obvious.  It is testimony pertaining to a different event, but it is still part of the same testimony.  So, the reason is that even though we have one, two, and three pages, the testimony is the same.  It concerns testimony about events that happened in Kibuye préfecture and crimes perpetrated by various individuals.  The only difference is that on page two and on page three, I also discussed events that happened in 1993, though at the time no one could have made a connection between what was happening in 1993 and what was to happen in 1994.  Some of those events took place in secret, whereas others took place in public.  
So, this is a way of providing information to the judges so that they can have an idea on what happened.  My document was addressed to the people responsible for gathering information, because there are crimes about which they did not have any information.  And even today, there are certain crimes that were committed and which are still not documented.  
Q.	Witness BDW, if one were writing a unified text beginning on page one, one wouldn't expect to see the number one on the second page on the fourth line.  You made a number of points on page one about different events and didn't number those.  And then for the first time on page two on line four, after your introduction, you begin with point one.  

Can you explain to us why you did that if, in fact, you created this document all at the same time?  
A.	Counsel, that is an interesting question.  Yesterday you produced a document which was my testimony, and there were no numbers on that.  And I do not see why you are asking questions regarding numbers.  I put in numbers when I thought it was necessary.  So, you can look at the document that you produced yesterday.  There were no numbers on that.  

So, I have the right to either include numbers or not.  I can put a number on page one or include numbers in the middle of the text itself, or on page two.  There is nothing strange about that.  The essential thing is for the information to be provided, and that the author of the document should be known, as well as the time at which the document was prepared.  
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, you noticed that in your document you speak of the events of April 1994 first on page one, and then you go back on page two to speak of the events of 1993 in points one, two, and three.  And then on page four, you go back to speak of the events of May 1994 -- excuse me, on page three, point four, you go back to speak of the events of May 1994.  

Now, if you had been preparing this document at the same time, it seems likely you would have addressed the events in 1993, and then gone on to address the events in 1994.
Can you tell us why you didn't do that?  
A.	Initially -- that is, on page one -- I discussed the events that happened in my area, and the events in which I am supposed to have been involved.  And when I came to the events concerning your client, I started with 1993 before proceeding to 1994.  I, therefore, started with the date of the 13th because I was following a certain chronology.  This is how come I started with the events of 1994 on page one, and on page two I discoursed 1993 before moving back to 1994.  I, therefore, could not have talked about the events of 1993 on page one, given that I was talking about people who perpetrated crimes in 1994.  

So, if you look at the document, you'll see that I followed a certain chronology, and that is why on page three -- which concerns your client -- I started with the events of 1993 before concluding with 1994.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness BDW.  

Now, I would like to have us compare the text of the second and third pages of this document with Exhibit D. NZ 441, which is the document you submitted while in Ruhengeri prison on the 
2nd of April 2003.  And if you don't already have Exhibit 441 before you, I would ask the registrar to give that to you.  That is the document dated the 2nd of April 2003.  

Now, can we agree that that document is very similar to the second and third pages of the document you produced for us yesterday?  
A.	But, Counsel, I believe that those two documents are different.  I drafted a testimony that was intended for the public prosecutor's office, whereas the other document was addressed to the Gacaca courts.  One of the documents is made up of five points, whereas the other one includes four points.  One document talks about the former leaders, including the leader of Bwakira, whereas the other document does not contain that name.  So these were documents addressed to different recipients.  
Q.	Okay.  Let me read to you the first paragraph -- point number one on your document you submitted yesterday.  And while I'm doing that, perhaps you and the Trial Chamber can look at point number one on the document D. NZ 441, which is number 6-B in English in my packet. 

Your point one on Exhibit 444, the document you produced yesterday, says that, "In July in 1993 
when I was at Pierre Célestin's house with my brother-in-law in Birambo, Édouard Karemera was a minister; Sebitabi was a member of parliament.  Conseiller Silas Sebashi, businessman, or 
traders called Mishayi and Munyankuzi held a meeting and decided that they should establish, 
or they should set up, a group of young people, Interahamwes, who would fight for the 
MRND.

"You will recall that all these things were done because members of the MRND party had been attacked; so, members of other parties attacking members of MRND and taking their properties from them.  So, those young people were trained, subsequently, in the use of firearms.  Firearms were distributed by Karemera.  During the 1994 genocide, those young people killed people who were at the ENP in the sub-préfecture.  They also set up roadblocks in various areas in Birambo, that is, at the Birambo trading centre.  These people were killed near the mass grave, which was known as either CDP or CND, which was located between EDA."  

So that was your point number one on the letter that you gave us yesterday.  And would you agree that you were speaking about the same exact meeting in your point number one on the letter written in Ruhengeri prison on the 2nd of April 2003?  
A.	But there is nothing surprising about that.  I am the one who drafted those two documents, and I prepared one before the other.  So, there is nothing strange about it.  I had a document which inspired me, that is why I took some information for me to put in the other document.  If you look at the second document, you will realise that there are four points in it.  Point four deals with the killings that took place at Rugabano, our locality.  And there, I did not mention Karemera's name.  The document was addressed to the public prosecutor.  

This information is not included in the same document, whereas you claim the two documents are the same.  These documents were addressed to two different recipients.  And when I produced this document here, it was simply to prove to you that I had already prepared that document prior to my transfer to Ruhengeri.  

The document that you brought yesterday is only a follow-up to another document that I had already prepared, because I wanted to explain everything.  It was necessary for me to explain everything to the public prosecutor.  

Point four discusses the killings that had taken place in Rugabano, but this point is not included in the other document.  It is, instead, included in the document that you brought yesterday.  And the addressees of this document understood what I wanted to tell them, and they were satisfied about it.  
Q.	Did you have the document that you had prepared in Kibuye prison with you when you prepared this document in Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	I have already told you that the first document was drafted in Kibuye.  And when I was transferred to Ruhengeri, I carried my document along with me.  No one prevented me from sourcing information from that first document.  And in Ruhengeri, I had to provide information to the public prosecutor, who needed it.  That is what I have been telling you from the outset.  

I told you that the first document was prepared in Kibuye, while the second was produced in Ruhengeri.  I was asked to provide that information in Ruhengeri because they had realised that that same information was in my case file while I had been in Kibuye. 
Q.	And, again, this is a very important point -- difference between us, because I contend that the 
	document -- that pages two and three, that is, dated from Kibuye was actually written after the document that was in Ruhengeri.  

And to show you a little bit about that, I want to -- first of all, looking at point two, without taking the time to translate the document that you've given us yesterday, can we agree that it covers the same meeting in October of 1993 in the communal office in Bwakira, and that the paragraphs are almost identical?  And I'm speaking of paragraph two from the letter you gave us yesterday, and paragraph two from the letter I produced, dated in Ruhengeri prison.  

Those two paragraph twos (sic) are almost identical and deal with the same subject; correct?  
A.	But, Counsel, why do you think there should be a difference?  These are two documents that were written by the same person.  I was the one giving that information.  I do not see why you think that the two documents should discourse different things.  The right thing may not be the same, but that is because the two documents were not written on the same day.  But the fact that the substance of the two documents should be similar is not surprising at all, but you will realise that there are minor differences.  You have mentioned point two, but in the second document, I do not believe that it is point two.  

One of the documents is composed of four points, whereas the other is made up of five points.  I do not see how you can think that because I'm the one who prepared the document, and you do not want to believe me.  Maybe other people can convince you, Counsel.  What I am telling you is that the document that I produced yesterday was drafted in Kibuye, while the other one was prepared in Ruhengeri.  And it was the public prosecutor who asked me to prepare this document while I was in Ruhengeri.  

I see that you do not want to believe me, and I cannot do anything about that.  I proposed to produce that document yesterday because you alleged that my co-detainees and myself agreed to provide false testimony against detained persons here.  And that is why I wanted to prove to you that I prepared that document while I was at Kibuye.  I am very sure that that document actually existed before, but I can see that you don't want to believe me.  
Q.	Let's look at point three together, because this is important.  While you're looking at point three in the document of April 2003, let me read to you from point three in the document that you say was prepared before.  

Point number three:  "Meeting with the aim of identifying the enemy.  This meeting was held at Gatwaro stadium in June 1993.  And in attendance" -- maybe there was a translation mistake.  I'll say it again.  

"This meeting was held at Gatwaro stadium in June 1993, and in attendance were the members of the MRND party.  At the beginning of the meeting there was Prefét Kayishema, who said the country was besieged by Tutsi enemies who were hiding within the PL and PSD parties and were, therefore, collaborating with the RPF.  He said that these were the enemies who had attacked us.  And Karemera confirmed what the prefét had just said.  And Karemera even went on to promise that he would send equipment, firearms and uniforms, to the communes.  

"During this meeting the person in charge of protocol was Aloys Munyakazi.  However, there was also Munyampundu who was in attendance at the meeting.  He was one of the leaders of the party.  There was also Joseph Nzirorera."  

And you go on to say, "There was Donatelle Niyitegeba; they were two tradesmen who had come from Kigali and were supporters of the MRND party.  What is more, during this meeting, there were musicians in attendance, and those musicians sang songs inciting heinous activities."  

Now, if you had written this in December of 2002, and included the name of Joseph Nzirorera at that time, why was his name not included in the document you wrote in April 2003 while in the very home préfecture of Ruhengeri where he was well known and resided?  
A.	Did you want me to talk about Nzirorera in relation to events that took place in locations where he was not present?  So I could not have mentioned Nzirorera's name in talking about what happened in places where he was not present.  Only people who were in his own region can talk about him.  So you can consult people from his own region and they will be able to give you more information.  

I could only talk about him in relation to events that happened in Kibuye while he was present.  I could not speak about what happened in Ruhengeri, given that I was not there.  Only people from Ruhengeri can talk to you about that.  If I mentioned his name in connection with what happened in Kibuye, it is because he was present there.  And if you dispute this fact, I will ask you to provide evidence to support your contention.  

What he said actually happened, because Interahamwes came from that region to assist us.  So I could, therefore, not talk about him while preparing the document in Ruhengeri, given that I had no idea about what he is supposed to have done in Ruhengeri.  I mentioned his name in connection with what happened in Kibuye because I knew about that.  And his activities in Kibuye did not last for long.  But I made a point of mentioning that he was present on that particular occasion, and that he took the floor.  
Q.	Well, what you have done, Witness BDW, according to you, is you've mentioned Joseph Nzirorera's presence at the meeting in Kibuye in June of 1993 when you addressed your letter to the Gacaca people in Kibuye.  And then when you addressed your letter in April 2003 to the prosecutor of the 
	court of appeals in Ruhengeri and asked them to -- that you wanted to help justice at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and you discussed that same meeting in point three, you made no mention whatsoever of Joseph Nzirorera.  

Now, I suggest to you that the reason for that is that the letter you prepared, pages two and three that you've given us yesterday, was written long after 2002, and only -- even to rebut the very thing that I put to you when you were here in November, that you had created these documents only after you had arrived in Ruhengeri prison.  

And I suggest to you that if you, indeed, had evidence of Mr. Nzirorera's presence at this meeting back in April of 2003, you would have included that in your letter to the prosecutor general of Ruhengeri and the letter which refers to helping justice at the ICTR.  

Now, would you like to comment on that?  
A.	Counsel, I realise that you are contradicting yourself.  You have the document in your possession.  I'm wondering whether you have read it.  It is a summary of testimony that I gave in a court.  I did not mention the names of everyone who attended that meeting.  I mentioned Nzirorera's name because he was present, and not in order to contradict you.  And when I mentioned that name, I was in Kibuye for the first time, and I said the same thing when I came to testify before this Court.  

He was present, and I am not lying about that.  He said what I have told you that he said.  And I even pointed out that his speech was not long.  I stand by my statement because I have made up my mind to tell the truth regarding everything that I know.  So, I'm not the only one who is saying this same thing.  There are many witnesses which -- that you do not want to mention because you are very well -- you are aware that they will contradict you.  But, as you know, truth will always out.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Just briefly on my feet.  If the witness might take his headphones off for a moment.  It's a small point. 

I've been looking through the transcript of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination of the 29th of November -- and it may be my computer skills are not as good as his, but I haven't seen, in what I've looked through, a reference to the witness being questioned about a suggestion that he was part of a Ruhengeri conspiracy.  

If Your Honours remember, the cross-examination of Mr. Robinson was interrupted because of the disclosure which arose from investigative (unintelligible), and then there were other documents which came in from Kigali about this witness's judicial records.  

In the last question, Mr. Robinson suggested to the witness that the reason the witness has concocted the montage is because he's aware that Mr. Robinson is going to suggest to him that there is a Ruhengeri conspiracy because of the way he was cross-examined back in November.  

Now, I'm very sorry if I've made a mistake, but so far, I haven't seen that Mr. Robinson got to that point in his cross-examination, so that it may be that -- in fairness to the witness -- he would not have been aware that he was about to be cross-examined about a Ruhengeri conspiracy.  If I'm wrong, I apologise.  But as I say, I can't find any reference in the cross-examination in November.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I don't have that material immediately in front of me.  It may be that Mr. Morley is correct and I didn't reach that point; or, it may be that there is something, because my recollection was I suggested to the witness at the time that it was only after he got to Ruhengeri prison that the first documents were created.  But in any event, I could look back at that and we could -- I could get back to you on that.  

At this time, Mr. President, I would like to make an application, and that is that I'm making a motion that the Court obtain the original that's in the possession of this witness of this letter so that it can be examined forensically.  The witness has already testified that what he has in his possession is not a photocopy, but, essentially, a duplicate original of the document that he handed in to the Kibuye prison.  

And given the questions about the ink and the writing differences between pages two and three, and the insertion on the subject line on page one, I think that these are matters that can really be pursued in a definitive way by having the original examined by an expert -- or, even having us look at the original, which would give us a better idea of some of these discrepancies.  So I'm asking the Trial Chamber to order that the witness/victim section obtain the original and produce it for further use by the Trial Chamber and by the parties.  

Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I would like to address the Court in order to support the request that has just been made to you.  Mr. President, I believe that you can now ascertain that this is a montage, this document.  Whatever the case may be as the best form of evidence or proof, he should bring to us the original that he claims he has in his possession that he showed us yesterday, and that on the basis of which, copies were made that we now have before us.  

I am convinced, Mr. President, that you are aware that we cannot do without such an exercise, and I hope that you will order immediately that this document -- which I do not understand why it is not 
here -- that you order that this document be brought back to this Trial Chamber so that all the parties can examine this document, and then we will not have to resort to the services of a graphologist in order for us to ascertain how grossly this montage has been made before this very Trial Chamber.  

But, as the opposite side often claims in this Trial Chamber, in the bar associations we often work with, it would not have been possible for us to work in such a manner.  This document would have been the object of an immediate expert report, and even if manipulation itself is visible to the naked eye. 

Now, the first stage, Mr. President, would be to order today for this document to be presented to all the parties present before we continue.  And I say this and support what I am saying with great vehemence.  And I am not losing sight of the fact that this is a Prosecution witness against Édouard Karemera, and that the conditions contribute to and aggravate the charges brought against him before this Trial Chamber. 

So, at this very point, I would request, Mr. President, that we do not do away with justice and that we order for this document to be produced, and that we all take the time to see quite how dangerous this witness is.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would also like to support the request that has just been made.  And as Mr. Morley has been continuously saying, in some jurisdictions we would not necessarily be going about the exercise in the manner we are doing here.  And in our jurisdictions, there would have been a prior investigation conducted by an investigating magistrate.  And a witness who would then have appeared to testify three months after his cross-examination began, well, he has had all the time necessary to adjust what he said in view of the time elapsed since the beginning of his cross-examination.  

So, under our jurisdiction, the investigating magistrate would order an expert report in order to ascertain the documents, because this witness has just thrown it out of his pocket whilst being cross-examined by my learned colleague.  This would not have been able to happen in my jurisdiction, or in our jurisdictions, without it having been submitted to an expert eye and an expert report having been conducted as to the ink used.  And there would have been an investigation in order to verify or ascertain the authenticity of this document.  

I would also like to make an observation as to something that particularly struck me with reference to what the witness has been saying.  These documents, whatever they are, and whenever they were drawn up, have been drafted in order to be sent to the Prosecutor's office.  And it is quite amazing that such a witness can bring such allegations in front of a Trial Chamber on their request.  And I believe that you will be able to ascertain this and deliberate accordingly, Mr. President. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I also wanted to make mention of practice in terms of international jurisdictions with reference to the authenticity of the document.  

Now, there is an international regulated practice according to which -- well, first and foremost with the international court of justice, which in its Article 43 and also Article 50 of its rules, there's also mention made in the international courts of the law of the sea with reference to Article 63, paragraph one of the rules of this very court, that the required -- the original of the document, or the certified copy of such a document in order to verify its authenticity.  

Now, when one tries to ascertain the authenticity of a document, of course, the original or a certified copy thereof must be produced.  And I thank you -- and this problem will arise.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully agree with the proposition that at this stage it might be of assistance to actually have a look at the original pieces of paper.  I am not at all sure about the potential need for a forensic analysis, but it might be right to say that if this document is genuine in the sense that pages two and three were submitted with page one on the 20th of December of 2002, if that is found as a fact, it may go a long way to supporting the credibility of this witness and to substantially damaging Karemera, and possibly, to some extent, Nzirorera.  

I would imagine that a juror would be interested in having a look at the original at this stage.  So I do support the application, only insofar as it concerns having a look at the three pieces of paper.  I'm not supporting at this point a forensic analysis. 

What I would invite for Your Honours' consideration is that perhaps Your Honours rise now -- it's a quarter past 12:00 -- and direct that the witness is taken by WVSS back to the safe house to pick up the original piece of paper, and then have his lunch and then be brought back here, and we will have it for 
2 o'clock.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, there are many -- I suppose one can consider what is an original in different ways.  In the way in which this testimony has been evolving, it would be of more value if we got the document that was in the archives in the prison.  

Is it possible to access that quickly?  
MR. MORLEY: 
I don't know about quickly, but may I say that that has crossed my mind.  We will make an inquiry about whether there is, from 2002 at the Kibuye prison, an archived document.  Having said that, may I mention that WVSS's helpful representative to my left has indicated that the witness has a bag in the witness waiting room, and it may be that the original copy -- I can use that expression -- is here, rather than at the safe house. 

I don't know how quickly an answer could be received from Kibuye prison; it would take a number of days.  From experience -- and, indeed, Mr. Robinson and I have been on the jittery four-wheel drive out to Kibuye prison -- it will take a visit to the prison to look into the archive.  There are no scanning facilities; there are no computer facilities; and it would take somebody to actually go there and rummage about the filing cabinet with the assistance of prison staff.  

So if Your Honours want an answer to that question, I will have to say that it will take several days.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President.  Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, obliged.  

Now, the last comments of Mr. Morley give rise to another reflection.  I think we need to remind ourselves that this is a Prosecution witness and that the documents we are discussing here are documents which it is difficult to understand that the Prosecutor was not in possession of, and that he did not disclose to us beforehand.  It is difficult to understand that at no moment was -- or, were these documents the object of an exchange between the witness and the Prosecutor when they were actually preparing the testimony.  

And, I must say that I am somewhat surprised to note that these documents have come up more than four months after the examination-in-chief of the witness, which brings me to wonder why the witness suddenly discovered the opportunity he had to talk about them when he began to testify yesterday afternoon.  This, once again, raises the question of disclosure, which the Prosecution makes before the examination-in-chief, and the diligence with which he goes about giving us these documents.  And when he says that it will take a few days to get hold of the original -- of this document, I do not understand why he did not get hold of it before the case reopened, as the rules stipulate.  But, of course, we know that this rule has been quite easily transgressed by the Prosecutor.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, Mr. Weyl, we do have a view at this stage.  And we -- in view of the disclosure that you made, it will not be necessary for us to make an order, because with the assistance of the registry, the witness would be able to distribute any original documents he may have in his bag at the meeting room here.  So we are going to take the suggestion of rising now to facilitate that. 

But we also want to draw your attention to something that was said during his testimony this morning, in which he said that he believed that this document was one of those documents that had been given to him, including a summary of his testimony.  Now, that statement may suggest that there may be a more speedy response to a telephone call.  And we would appreciate it if the Prosecutor would make enquiries as to the availability and access to these documents. 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I make it plain?  We haven't had any knowledge at any stage -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, I don't -- I'm not saying you did.  I'm just saying that he made that comment during his testimony today, and that, in our opinion, will justify making a telephone call which may produce some response.  That's all I said.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Forgive my not entirely following Your Honour's thinking.  To whom is Your Honour thinking that the telephone call should be made?  To Kigali?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No. If it is true that when the witness was coming here to testify, the prison authorities also gave him that document together with other documents, then the documents should be easily accessible.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I follow the point now.  Forgive me for not being quicker.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  That's all.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'll wait until -- I just wanted to make one more point to follow up on what Mr. Morley had asked concerning whether the issue was raised about his creating these documents after he arrived in Ruhengeri prison.  And I just refer the parties to pages 30 and 31 of the questioning on the 
29th of November, and that issue was raised by me.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

We think we could rise now.  

Let the witness put on his headset.  

Mr. Witness, we are going to break for lunch now.  You will have an opportunity, if you wish to take advantage of it, to review the documents that you brought with you, and to give the registry any original documents related to your testimony this morning so that the registrar will have an opportunity to circulate them to the Bench and to the lawyers involved. 

You are aware of what's at stake.  We are not making, at this stage, an order, but we are rising early so you will have an opportunity to deal with that matter as you think best.  

We'll take the adjournment now. 
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 20 to 38 by Lisa Smith)




























(Court resumed at 1421H) 
MR. MORLEY: 
Before the witness puts his headphones on, four matters.  

First, as Your Honours will be aware, the original copy has been recovered by Mr. Shollo of WVSS of this witness.  Prosecution and the Defence have had sight of it.  I know not whether Your Honours have had sight of it.  But it is now in court in the custody of the registry.  

Secondly, Mr. Robinson, in the course of his questioning, was suggesting that, to his eye, there were various observations that could be made about the document.  Now that we have the original, I mention now, so that there's no misunderstanding about it later, although not an expert, it does appear that pages 2 and 3 are a lot older than made within the last four months.  

The third matter is that I have, pursuant to Your Honours' enquiry before lunch, sent an email to our investigator, Mr. Upendra Baghel, who is presently in Kigali, to make contact with Kibuye prison straight away, and if necessary to go to Kibuye prison to see what is in the archives.  

Fourthly, just before lunch Mr. Robinson indicated to Your Honours that in cross-examination on the 29th of November, he had made mention, as he had asserted in cross-examination today.  What was not clear, it needs to be addressed very briefly now, is what he actually made mention of on the 29th of November to this witness.  

At the bottom of page 30 on the English transcript for the 29th of November of last year, Mr. Robinson asked the witness whether he had made any statements about Karemera prior to going to Ruhengeri.  And, to paraphrase the answer, the witness said, yes, he had, but he no longer had those documents to hand when he had arrived at Ruhengeri.  That is not the same as putting to the witness, on the 29th of November, that the witness was part of a conspiracy in Ruhengeri.  That allegation had not been put during that cross-examination, as I had thought from my analysis of the transcripts.  So that Your Honours are informed that the witness was not directly on notice from November, through Mr. Robinson's cross-examination, that he is alleged to be the subject of a Ruhengeri conspiracy.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I'm ready to continue my questioning of the witness in light of the production of the original document.  

May I do that?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  

Mr. President, I would ask that the original document be circulated to you and to the parties, and then put before the witness.  And as you're looking at that original document, I would like you to pay attention to the numbers on the left-hand side of the first page, and compare that with the copy that was made yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we think that, in light of the statements made by the witness relating to checking with the prison authorities in Kibuye and the contact that you have already made with your investigators in -- in Rwanda, we think it would assist us in our evaluation of this testimony if we were able to have access to the response documents before he left the witness box.  So, what we are wondering, whether it would be a sensible way to proceed to just stand him down until Monday morning, and then we proceed with AXA this afternoon.  And if he is finished, we can have PTH tomorrow morning.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I had anticipated Your Honours' mind might have worked in this way.  We've got AXA here, and we respectfully agree.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I would like to continue my cross-examination, and have him stand down at the time when that's completed, and then before the rest of it we can -- but I want to ask him some questions about this document before he has a little more time to think about it.  So I think that I could take a little while longer, and complete essentially my cross-examination on this document.  But I think it's necessary -- it's better to do that.  Because especially I have one line of questioning based on what I just called to your attention that I think I want the answers to before the weekend.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Well, we can allow that.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  

So if the document can be further circulated, then, among the parties. 

Mr. President, because there is a difference between the original that's been produced today and the document that was produced yesterday, I'm going to ask that this document -- the original be admitted as D. NZ445, so that the difference between the two documents can be explored and we can have -- keep track of the differences by them having different numbers.  And it should be under seal.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I respectfully agree.  But could the witness be informed that the original is being removed from him; it is being kept in this Court.  And he can be assured that he will be given a copy of the document that he has given us so that he has his records.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, did you hear that assertion, and you understand?  
THE WITNESS: 
I do not have any objection to that, Mr. President.  I'm even prepared to provide you with other documents next week when we are going to resume.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We admit the document in evidence, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ445 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  And perhaps -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I just wanted to make one remark to the witness.  

Mr. Witness, your cross-examination has already gone on much longer than I anticipated it would.  So I am not hoping that you will have very much longer under examination.  What we have just agreed, though, is that Mr. Robinson will be permitted to ask you a few questions on the document you've just introduced, and when his question in -- that line of questioning is completed, we will take the adjournment and resume, hopefully, on Monday morning.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I've understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  What I would ask the registrar to do is to place Exhibits D. NZ444 and D. NZ445 before the witness.  That's the letter from yesterday and the letter from today.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BDW, first of all, thank you for producing the original of your letter of the 20th of February -- of December 2002.  But I noticed a difference between what you produced yesterday and what you produced today.  And that difference is that on the first page, in the left-hand column, there are the numbers 1, 2, and 3.  And those numbers do not appear on the document of yesterday.  So, can you tell us who placed those numbers on the document, when, and why?  
A.	I do not think that there is any difference between the two documents.  I was the one who prepared the documents and they are not different.  
Q.	Well, directing your attention to the first page, on the original that you brought today, do you see that there, in the left-hand -- the very left-hand part of the page, there's number 1, number 2, and number 3.  Do you see that?  
A.	Counsel, I can see that there is another inscription that I did not include in that document.  It is not only those numbers.  However, there is no difference with regard to the substance of the document.  
Q.	Well, the difference that I'm calling your attention to is the fact that when you produced that document today, it had three numbers on it that this didn't have yesterday.  And I'm asking you to explain that.  
A.	I can see that it is one and the same document.  There is no difference at all between the two documents.  The document that I produced yesterday had those numbers because it is a way of organising my ideas.  
Q.	If you look at the document -- the photocopy that you have of the document that was produced yesterday, do you see those numbers on that photocopy?  
A.	There is no photocopy in front of me. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the registrar could please put -- that was the idea from the beginning, to put that document in front of him.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'm sorry about that, Witness.  Now -- obviously you can't compare the two documents if you only had one in front of you.  So let's start this exercise over.  

Look at the document that's in front of you that's the original.  You see the numbers 1, 2, and 3 along the left-hand side.  Now, look at the copy, and you don't see those numbers there.  Correct?  
A.	These are documents that I prepared.  I believe these are my documents.  There is no difference between those documents except in the way that they are structured on the paper.  
Q.	If you look at the original document that you handed in today, do you see the numbers 1, 2, and 3 along the left-hand side of the first page?  
A.	Yes, I can see those inscriptions on the document, but I do not know how they came to be there.  I do not recall having written these figures on document, but the document was prepared by myself.  I can see numbers 1, 2, and 3.  But I do not know how those figures were put there.  I believe that those numbers were not on the document that I produced.  
Q.	And we agree that those numbers are not on the document that was produced yesterday, the photocopy of which is in front of you, correct?  
A.	Yes.  But a short while ago I told you that I am not the one who wrote those figures on the document.  This is not the way I write figure "3".  But setting aside those numbers, the contents of the two documents are the same.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that Mr. Hometowu advise the Trial Chamber whether or not the registry has placed any of those numbers on the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, Mr. Hometowu, don't respond -- as yet.  Please wait one moment.  
THE WITNESS: 
I believe you can even refer -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphones overlapping)... had an opportunity to comment.  

Mr. Robinson, we don't think that the -- that the purpose that we think you are seeking could be properly achieved by asking Mr. Hometowu to make statement, because the next thing you're going to ask the WVSS representative to make a statement, and then, and then, and then.  So we think that if perhaps you did wish to conduct an investigation into this matter, this is not the appropriate place to do it.  And if at some stage you want to call a witness, you may do that.  But we didn't think we should permit this type of enquiry into court.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, so you want me to add Mr. Hometowu to my witness list?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, I'm not saying that at all.  We doubt -- we also doubt, as we said first -- as I said at first, we doubted that the object you're seeking to achieve is achievable in this way.  We doubt that.  So we didn't think that -- well, we can't tell you how to do your case.  But we -- that's the feeling that we have at the moment.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, the document passed this morning from the witness to WVSS, I -- and to someone in the registry.  And I think it's very simple to determine whether or not any of those people added these numbers, which would be highly, highly unusual.  Now, if we leave it to some date in 2009 to start calling witnesses on this subject, I think that we would be spending an awful lot of time on a matter that cannot be -- that can be resolved very quickly here in this courtroom, the results of which can then be presented to this witness for his comment.  

Because this is a very clear situation where the witness has said he did not put those numbers on there, we know they were put on there between yesterday and today, so there's only two other possibilities:  The registry, WVSS.  Let them say that they didn't put the numbers on, let me confront the witness with that, and we will finish with the matter.  But to require me to conduct an investigation, to take statements from those people, anybody who had contact with this witness, and then bring them as witnesses during my case, and perhaps recall this witness, it seems a much more cumbersome procedure.  

So I would simply ask Mr. Hometowu -- he can enquire among his colleagues, as well as the WVSS representative, and if any of them put these numbers on the document, let them speak up and tell us.  And if nobody speaks up, let's raise -- let's accept the point that the documents have not been altered by WVSS and the registry, which I think we all find very likely, and I can put that to the witness while he's still here.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I assist.  It may be that what we can do is informally make this enquiry, it can be reported to myself and Mr. Robinson what the answer is, and it may be that Mr. Robinson and I can agree that the position seems to be X.  There is some force in what Mr. Robinson says about taking witness statements and calling people in 2009.  Ordinarily I would have leapt to my feet when Mr. Robinson made the enquiry a few moments ago, but I can see that, as a matter of expediency, and how unusual it would have been for the document to have been marked, the circumstances may have met with Your Honours' approval.  But do I see the force in not having in the courtroom a series of statements, as it were, before the Court and on the record.  So perhaps if we deal with it informally in that way.  We could either rise now for five minutes or we could deal with it at the break, which would be in half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We prefer to address -- Mr. Robinson, how much more time do you plan to examine on this issue, on the letter?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm finished on that issue.  I want to ask the witness one other area about other documents, and then I will be finished -- I will be finished with this portion of my direct -- my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  How much time is it going to take?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Maybe five or ten minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Then we can address that and maybe rise at that stage.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness?  

Can the witness put on his headset, please.  

Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You were trying to say something to me a little while ago and I stopped you.  Now is the opportunity to address me, if you wish.  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, what I wanted to tell you concerned those numbers.  I believe anyone can refer to these various documents that I prepared and be able to distinguish between the figures that I myself wrote -- wrote in my documents and these other figures that appear on the document.  I do not know how those figures came to be marked there.  I am not the one who did it.  And, as you are well aware, when I produced that document yesterday, those numbers were not there, so I'm not the one who marked the document.  And everyone can see that.  I do not know how the figures came to be there.  All I know is that the document changed hands between the various people who were in this courtroom.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, there you have it.  Shall we proceed as planned?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No -- yeah, we will rise in a few minutes, first.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Just so I understand, Mr. President, I should now ask him my other line of enquiry, correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BDW, you have mentioned that you have other documents with you, and I want to direct your attention particularly to letters that you have written to authorities since you've been arrested.  You're going to come back on Monday, but it would be a lot easier if you were willing to produce those documents, if you could produce them today, so that everyone can familiarise themselves with those documents.  And by the time you came back on Monday, we could be in a position to ask you questions about them.  Otherwise, if you produce them on Monday, then we may have some delay.  

So I want to ask you whether or not you're willing to produce any other documents which you submitted to the authorities in Rwanda since your arrest?  
A.	I do not have any documents on me.  The documents that I wanted to produce were intended to prove to you that the information that I am giving you today is the same information that I provided in the past.  I did not bring along the letters that you are referring to.  I was not aware that you were going to ask me these questions.  I have documents relating to my appeal and to my testimony in the Gacaca courts.  Now, those documents are not with me here.  I do not know whether I have documents concerning my guilty plea and confession.  I do not know whether I have any letters that I wrote to the authorities with me here.  

However, I would have wanted to show you those documents to prove to you that sometimes I used different pens and different shades of paper.  I wanted to show you documents that are similar to the ones that we are examining, and I did not bring with me the letters that I had written to the authorities.  I did, indeed, write to them, but I do not have the documents with me here in Arusha.  All I have is my appeals file.  
Q.	Well, it is important for us to see documents that you've written with different pens and documents that you've submitted in your appeal, so we would like to see those.  And if you want to show those, I think we'd be grateful if you could do that.  So, if you have any documents you'd like to show us, can you please give them to the registrar?  
A.	Yes, I have some documents with me here, and some of those documents include the same information that we discussed yesterday.  I have them with me here, and those are documents that are used during my trial.  I can give you those documents simply to show you that I used different writing instruments, or pens.  But the information in the various documents is identical.  

It took me a lot of time to prepare those documents.  I would write it down and then copy it again.  And this will make it possible for you to understand the reason why I used different pens.  It took me a lot of time.  I did not prepare all the documents at once.  And that is why I made a point of bringing along these documents, because they would be useful when it comes to examining those letters that seemed to constitute a problem to you.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, so if you could -- 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, if I could just finish with the witness.  
MR. MORLEY: 
No, I'd like to make an observation, if I may, before we go further with this.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could take off his headphones, then.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour is invited to consider whether Mr. Robinson might be more specific in what sort of documents he seeks.  I don't imagine anyone in the courtroom is going to argue that documents written at different times, over a number of years, are going to have been written with different pens.  That isn't really the point of obtaining access to this witness's private material.  The point might, in fact, simply be a fishing expedition.  And it may be that Mr. Robinson can articulate more clearly for the witness what sorts of documents he's looking for, rather than have, as I anticipate is going to happen if we are not careful, a deluge of irrelevant material which will all have to be translated, none of which will assist us.  

So it may be that Mr. Robinson can say that he's not really interested in appeal material relating to this man's appeal -- I don't know what he will say about it.  What he's primarily interested in is material which relates to Karemera, and the witness might be properly asked, "Among the documents you have, can you root out any documents which mention Karemera?"  That might be a more focused way of dealing with matters.  Otherwise we are going to be engaged in translation exercises endlessly for no obvious benefit.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, all I could say is, really, shame on Mr. Morley.  We're here to try to get to the truth.  We're here to try to have what we would like to see as transparency, full disclosure.  What's the harm if I look at some document that's irrelevant?  It's really not appropriate for an officer of the court to attempt to block a witness who's willing to give information from -- to have him from doing so.  Now, the witness is willing to give me documents, or have us see documents.  If it's translation we're worried about, I'll have my client and my team look at them, and before -- we'll decide if they're relevant before we ask the Court to spend any of its energy.  

But, really, this is a shameful exercise by the Prosecutor to try to stop the witness from giving documents which he's ready to give.  And that shouldn't be allowed.  So I would ask that I be allowed to ask the witness again to produce the documents to the registrar and we collect these things, instead of trying to sweep them under the rug.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I just say -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Let me intervene at this stage, because we've been spending a lot more time than I thought we would have spent.  I have said before that in our decision-making process, personal attacks on each other is not relevant or helpful.  And we do not like it.  We think you all are adult professionals and we have not intervened all of the time, but I would like to make that comment now.  And, Mr. Morley, having made that comment, I don't think I will allow you to reply.  

Yes, we have decided that the witness should have the opportunity to produce the documents through the assistance of the registry.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could be asked to put his headphones on.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we will allow you the opportunity to provide the documents through the assistance of the registry.  
THE WITNESS: 
(Microphone not activated).  These are the documents which I used and I submitted my conclusions before the Court.  I would like to point out that I used different pens.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, we think that in view of what's happening, it's better for you to inventory the documents.  Just make a list of the documents he's given you.  
MR. MJUI:  
Your Honour, the registrar's received four different documents.  One is four pages, handwritten, and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Does it have a title?  
MR. MJUI:  
The title is in Kinyarwanda.  It's the date 26th October 2002.  It's a document with four pages.  

The other one doesn't have a title.  The second document doesn't have a title, even the date.  

The third document also, it doesn't have the title or a date.  

Also even the fourth one, it doesn't have a title or the date.  

All the documents are handwritten ones.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
May I suggest, actually, therefore that you put a note marking them.  How are you going to identify them?  By numbers?  
MR. MJUI: 
Yes, by numbers.  Yes, we will mark the documents by numbers.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, okay.  
MR. MORLEY: 
And might Your Honours suggest that the documents be photocopied, and then the photocopies handed to my learned friends opposite and the Prosecution.  The one thing not to do for the moment is for anyone to take away the originals.  We've already seen there's a query about one original about somebody numbering it.  But I anticipate we all now are going to have to have a look at this material.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. Morley.  It is so ordered.  

Now, Mr. Robinson, do you have further questions?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, thank you, Mr. President.  I think I will review the material over the weekend and then on Monday I will put any questions I might have about them to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I hope that does not mean that your cross-examination will be considerably expanded again.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I hope not, but it would depend on the content.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Mr. Morley -- or, Mr. -- I don't know if it's you or Mr. Webster I should ask.  If AXA is going to start his testimony now, would it be appropriate just for us to rise for a few minutes, and then we can call him immediately after our tea break?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours, yes, if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
If we could start early?  
MR. MORLEY: 
If Your Honours would be minded to have the break now, AXA could start in 15 minutes, 3:25. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Make it 3:30.  
MR. MORLEY: 
He could start at 3:30.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You also promised to have a joint enquiry of the registry.  Perhaps that could take place during the break as well, and we can give an extra 15 minutes for that.  And we would resume at around the normal 3:45.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We rise now.  
(Court recessed at 1511H)
(Pages 39 to 49 by Kirstin McLean)

(Court resumed at 1550H)
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
-- that an enquiry has been conducted.  It is my understanding that the document was gathered by Mr. Sholo (phonetic) from WVSS.  I was shown the document briefly and he took it to Joyce at the registry, and it was in her custody until it was brought back into court.  Sholo and Joyce didn't mark the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I am satisfied with that, Mr. President, and I will scratch Mr. Hometowu from my witness list.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, is the concept of a stipulated fact applicable in this Tribunal?  I know there is -- the rules prevail for agreed statements of fact; would this be one?  
MR. MORLEY:
It would fall into that category.  It is on the record.  The way it has been expressed, there is going to be no argument about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have to welcome you back to Arusha to give some further evidence.  You might be aware that the Prosecution had provided some additional information to the Defence and they have a -- they ought to have an opportunity to put questions to you in relation to those materials.  And so you are being recalled to provide an opportunity for that to take place.  So I am going to ask the registrar to administer the oath to you and, thereafter, your examination will proceed.  
(Declaration made by Witness AXA in Kinyarwanda)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY:
Although the witness is recalled and, technically, I might have an application to examine him, I don't make one, and he's tendered for cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Is there an agreed order for this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I am on my feet to indicate that everything was not ready to cross-examine this witness because we were following up developments with the previous witness until that testimony was interrupted today, and the Trial Chamber decided, in order to save time, that this witness should be called.  So I am going to comply with that decision, but I must inform you that I had planned to carry out a cross-examination of Witness BDW after Mr. Robinson.  This was in answer to your first question.  

I would also like to say that we can continue with this witness, AXA, but I needed to point out that our team had not prepared for this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You pause to make a comment?  You see, my view on these matters is obviously quite different.  I think that counsel has to be ready at all times for all events.  I am not accustomed to the time and latitude that I understand is the practice of the ICTR.  Now, we have given notice quite sometime ago that these were the witnesses who were going to be called this week, and I would have expected that before our trial session started on Monday, that you would have been ready to cross-examine all of them.  So I expect that everybody is ready and that we can proceed in the order that the Court orders.  

	Even if you were to cross-examine after BDW, when we looked at the planned schedule, the examination of AXA was scheduled to start today, in any event.  So the interruption of BDW should not have any impact on your availability to cross-examine this witness. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Much obliged, Mr. President, but I must say that I do not share your opinion.  I am not talking about our attitude regarding the cross-examination of the witness.  I am simply talking about material organisation because we are following a certain logical order and my files here that I have prepared concern BDW.  I am not disputing the decision of the Trial Chamber, but I am simply talking about our way of seeing things.  And when we do not agree with the President, we would like to point that out in the most courteous manner.  So this is simply a matter of material organisation, but I am prepared for us to move on to the cross-examination of Witness AXA as decided by yourself, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I believe that this is how things have to be done since we are going to talk about Witness AXA in very private and personal -- in a very private and personal nature, I would like us to go into closed session from the very outset. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we understand and we think that that's an appropriate decision.  For the benefit of the public, this witness has had the -- has had a protection order made to protect his security, and one of the elements of that protection order is that information concerning his identity, or which may reveal his identity, has to be kept private.  The questions that he is about to undergo now may reveal his identity and we are going into a closed session for that purpose, and you have to leave the public area to facilitate that process.

MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness AXA, do you recall telling us when you were here last that you had written some letters -- provided some information to the Rwandan judicial authorities in your own case concerning Mr. Karemera while you were still at Kibuye prison?  
A.	Yes, I remember that.  
Q.	And do you recall that you also told us that those letters had been directed to the Ruhengeri court of appeal, which were seized of your case at that time?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So, since that time, I went to the Ruhengeri court of appeal and I found your -- your file, and I went through with a Kinyarwanda speaker all of the documents in that file.  And, frankly, I didn't find anything concerning where you had spoken about Mr. Karemera.  Now, I did find four documents in that file and I intend to review those with you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Unfortunately, Mr. President, I haven't had those documents printed out yet.  They were disclosed to the parties through the registry sometime in -- immediately after I received them.  I don't have them myself here in court and I don't expect, really, that the registry does either.  So I would ask that we recess at this time; I'll have hard copies printed tomorrow and when we resume tomorrow morning, we can go over those documents with the witness.  

Mr. President, I have another alternative, if you want to keep going.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, actually, I was just looking for my flash disc, but -- but what was your alternative?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, there's one other subject that was also the -- I could ask, I can enquire on without needing paper.  If you want I can start -- I could change the topic and come back to this topic tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm -- I'm only just getting concerned about time, and we -- we -- we -- I don't want to start off this session on a bad footing, and I -- and I want to have a proper management of my case.  Now, 
it's -- it's apparent that we may have to lose some time because of problems with the preparations for the Defence, and reluctantly we are going to have to do that.  But what we're doing now, I still want us to function as efficiently as we can while we're functioning.  

MR. ROBINSON:
And what -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have decided to sit until quarter to six this afternoon.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, I will try to use the remaining time as usefully as possible.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness AXA, I'm going to change the subject because I don't have your judicial records with me in the courtroom right now, and we're going to talk about the time when you were first interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor from the ICTR, and that was in November of 2004.  

Now, you remember that the last time you were here we talked about that interview, but we didn't have any report.  But in the meantime we've obtained some information about that interview and I want to ask you some questions about it.  

First of all, do you recall where it was that that interview took place?  This is the first meeting you had with the ICTR investigators? 
A.	Thank you.  That question is very simple; I think it's already been put to me.  I believe that I've already answered it.  I think that you already have the answer to that question.  
Q.	That may be, but I would like to answer it again; it's very simple.  
A.	But you're asking me questions which have already been put to me.  I told you that in order for one to meet ICTR investigators, one has to be summoned by the public prosecutor's office.  After that, we -- we go and meet them.  
Q.	Yes, that's actually why I was asking you that question, because are you telling us that you went and met them at the public prosecutor's office? 
A.	Yes, that is what I'm telling you.  We were summoned to the public prosecutor's office and that is where we met the ICTR investigators.  
Q.	Now, the investigators' note indicates that you met at the Ruhengeri prison.  Is that wrong? 
A.	As far as I'm concerned that is not true because we did not meet there.  I was detained at the Ruhengeri prison, but I met them at the Ruhengeri public prosecutor's office.  
Q.	And how many of you went over there from the prison to the public prosecutor's office to meet ICTR investigators? 
A.	Thank you.  I was alone when I went to see them.  Many people are summoned to the 
public prosecutor's office for different reasons, so I cannot know the number of people who are summoned to the PPO's office -- the PP's office on that day.  
Q.	And was it the first thing in the morning when you were brought over there? 
A.	No, it was not very early in the morning; it was in the day when I went to the 
public prosecutor's office.  
Q.	And were you ever told that another inmate had recommended that the ICTR investigators speak with you about Mr. Karemera? 
A.	I did not ask that question.  
Q.	We have in evidence a report from that investigator who met with another inmate the same morning, and it's reported that that inmate told him that -- told the investigator that they should contact you.  And that inmate's name is Evariste Rucamumihigo -- that's R-U-C-A-M-U-M-I-H-I-G-O.  Did you know anything about that? 
A.	I don't know if that's -- I mean, if he's the one who told you that, then he's the one who told you.  
Q.	Well, the report of the investigator for the 4th of November says that at 8:10 in the morning they met this Evariste Rucamumihigo, and he told them that they should talk to you about Karemera's activities during 1994.  Were you ever aware of that? 
A.	No, I was not aware of that.  
Q.	Now, this person Evariste Rucamumihigo has the nickname of Rukara.  Now, do you know an inmate called Rukara? 
A.	There are many people who have nicknames.  
Q.	But do you know a person -- an inmate -- a person who was with you in Ruhengeri prison in November 2004 who had the nickname of Rukara? 
A.	Thank you.  In prison there are many prisoners whose nickname is Rukara, so there's not -- there's not only one Rukara.
Q.	Was there any Rukara you knew from Bwakira commune or Birambo commune?
A.	No.  
Q.	What cell block were you in when you lived in Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	I was in block number eight.  
Q.	Well, we have evidence that also in block number eight was a gentleman by the name of 
Evariste Rucamumihigo, also known as Rukara, who hailed from the same region as you did.  Did you know that person? 
A.	Thank you.  One cannot know all prisoners who are in a given block.  Sometimes in one block you have more than 500 prisoners.  When I was in prison, I had work, so I would leave the prison at around six in the morning and return at 6 p.m., so I did not spend a lot of time with other prisoners for me to be able to know them well.  
Q.	And you worked in the prison garage, correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	How many people worked in that garage? 
A.	In 2003, when I started working there, there were eight of us; however, some of them were released, and by 2000 -- 2006 there were very few of us there.  
Q.	And was Evariste Rucamumihigo, also known as Rukara, one of the people who worked at the prison garage in Ruhengeri during 2003 to 2006? 
A.	Thank you.  I do not know him.  Maybe he worked at the garage after I had left there.  I know the people who were working at the garage, and he was not one of them.  
Q.	Do you know an inmate named Sabine Hategekimana? 
A.	I do not know that person.  
Q.	Now, coming back to your meeting with the ICTR investigator on the 4th of November 2004, it's reported that you said that in -- as Karemera came from his neighbouring commune, you knew him since 1992.  Did you tell the investigator that, that you knew Karemera since 1992? 
A.	Thank you.  I did not tell the investigators that I had known him since 1992.  I had known him well before that -- since well before that time.  That's what I told them.  
Q.	Okay.  Next it said that in 1993 and before -- and before April 1994 Karemera visited on several occasions your secteur -- I won't repeat the name -- where he gathered MRND youth.  Did you tell that to the investigator? 
A.	Thank you.  I did not tell them that he had come to our secteur.  
Q.	Okay.  Next is -- I'm reading the next sentence:  "He was often with Ruhigira and Munyampundu."  I assume you were referring to Enoch Ruhigira and Cyprien Munyampundu.  Did you tell the investigator that Karemera was often with Ruhigira and Munyampundu?  
A.	Thank you.  You are saying that he often came with them; however, in my statement, I clearly explained the occasions on which he was with one or some of those people.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need some assistance with the spellings of those names. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Ruhigira is R-U-H-I-G-R-A (sic), and Munyampundu is M-U-N-Y-A-M-P-U-N-D-U.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, let's break that down.  Did you tell the investigator in November of 2004 that Karemera often came with Ruhigira? 
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I said so, because when he came to Kibuye they were together.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, can you tell us, approximately, what was the first occasion when you saw Karemera and Ruhigira together? 
A.	Thank you.  I saw them together in 1993 in Kibuye.  
Q.	Where in Kibuye? 
A.	I saw them at the stadium.  
Q.	In what part of the year 1993? 
A.	It was towards the end of the year.  Maybe it was in October or in November.  
Q.	And what was the occasion at the stadium? 
A.	On that occasion, we had gathered there because we had been selected to undergo training in the use of firearms.  
Q.	And when was the next time that you saw Ruhigira and Karemera together? 
A.	I no longer remember having seen them together on another occasion.  
Q.	But did you tell the investigator that Karemera was often with Ruhigira? 
A.	But, Counsel, I have problems with that term "often".  When you say "often", do you mean every minute or every hour?  I do not understand what you mean by that term "often".  
Q.	I understand that term to mean more than once, several times, frequently.  So did you tell the -- I'm reading the word "often" as what is written by the investigator, so it's not something that I'm using, but did you tell the investigator that you had seen Karemera and Ruhigira together on several occasions? 
A.	Thank you.  I did not tell him that I had seen them together several times.  I simply told him that I had seen them together on one occasion.  
Q.	Now, what about Munyampundu, did you tell the investigator that Karemera was often with Munyampundu? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And approximately how many times did you see Karemera and Munyampundu together? 
A.	Twice.  
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when the first time was and where that was? 
A.	The very first time I saw them together was in Kibuye.  
Q.	Where in Kibuye? 
A.	At the stadium.  And on the second occasion I saw them together at the communal office.  
Q.	The first occasion at the stadium, was that the same time that you claim to have seen Ruhigira? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	The second time at the commune office, approximately what month and year did that take place? 
A.	It was in April 1994.  
Q.	Now, the investigator's report goes on to say that you told them that on the 10th of April Karemera came to the business centre in your secteur.  Did he come there on the 10th of April? 
A.	No, it was not at the trading centre.  It is true that we have a trading centre there, but when I saw him, it was at the communal office.  
Q.	And the communal office of the -- the office of the commune Bwakira is not in your secteur, correct? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, was it the 10th of April that you saw Karemera? 
A.	I no longer remember the date, but I believe it was one week after the death of Habyarimana.  
Q.	Well, we know Habyarimana died on the 6th of April, but, according to the investigator, you told him that on 10 April Karemera came to the business centre in your secteur.  Now, did you tell the investigator -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Just pausing there for a moment.  

Headphones off, please.  

Mr. Robinson knows that what we have on the document is: "Mid-April (witness states 10 April)" reference then to Karemera.  So, on the face of the document, it does look as if there was some uncertainty expressed about the date as the note was being made, but it's only fair to put to the witness that both mid-April and 10 April are being referred to. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I can do that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness AXA, let me just read to you what -- can you put your headphones on?  

Witness AXA, let me read to you what -- exactly what's in the notes of the investigator.  It says:  "Mid-April 1994, (the witness stated 10 April) Karemera came in a red Toyota pickup to the business centre in" -- and then it gives the name of your secteur.  So my question to you -- my question to you is whether or not you told the investigator that on 10 April Karemera came to your area.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I believe that I have already explained this at length.  I told you when Karemera came to that locality.  You are insisting on having exact dates.  I have already told you that I have problems with dates, and I no longer remember the specific date.  
Q.	No, I understand that, and that's no problem because we're in 2008 right now.  But in 2004, this investigator is reporting that you told them that that took place on the 10th of April.  Maybe you remembered the date back then, so I'm wondering if that was what you told the investigator, or did he make a mistake? 
A.	No, I told him that that incident happened one week after the death of President Habyarimana.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, did you tell them that Karemera came in a red Toyota pickup? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you tell him that Karemera wore a military jacket? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you tell him that you had seen Karemera in the passenger seat of that vehicle? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you tell him that there were soldiers guarding that pickup? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  
Q.	And did you tell him that the pickup was loaded with weapons such as Kalashnikovs, R4s, grenades and axes? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were there axes in the pickup? 
A.	Yes, there were axes which were intended for the Interahamwes.  
Q.	And the investigator indicates that you had said that you saw this from only a few metres away; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that you told them that you were part of the MRND youth who was receiving Karemera.  Did you tell him that? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And the investigator has recorded that you said that Karemera handed over the load of weapons to the bourgmestre.  Did you tell him that? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And also handed over the load of weapons to the president of the Interahamwe called Amani.  Did you tell him that? 
A.	He handed over the weapons to the bourgmestre, but Amani was present at the time the weapons were handed over to the bourgmestre.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Amani is spelt A-M-A-N-I.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	But isn't it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you come to a convenient point.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'm trying to make it through this statement.  I think I can do that in five or ten minutes, if that's okay with you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, isn't it true that Amani was not the head of the Interahamwe but was head of the CDR youth, the Impuzamugambi? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  
(Pages 69 to 75 by Jean Baigent) 




1755H
THE WITNESS:
There was no difference between the CDR youth wing and the MRND youth wing.  They worked together.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what party was Amani a member of, the CDR or the MRND? 
A.	He was both a member of the MRND and the CDR.  He was the leader of the youth wings of those two parties.
Q.	So were the youth wings of those two parties combined in your commune? 
A.	Thank you.  In our area the predominant youth wing was the youth wing of the MRND.  It was not easy to meet any members of the CDR youth wing.
Q.	We've had evidence in this trial from a witness called BDW, who was one of the people training the youth in your commune, that Amani was the head of the CDR youth wing.  Is that wrong? 
A.	I do not know anything about the existence of that CDR youth wing that you are referring to.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  

Now, when Karemera arrived a week after the death of President Habyarimana, did you hear him make any reference to the ESI hospital? 
A.	If he mentioned the ESI hospital, it would have been because certain people sought refuge there, but others had taken refuge in friendly families, and when he mentioned the ESI hospital, he said that the people who had taken refuge there had to be flushed out and killed.
Q.	So he did mention the ESI hospital and you heard that? 
A.	Thank you.  He did not speak about the ESI.  People were simply telling him about the locations at which people had taken refuge.
Q.	In the report of the investigator, he claims that you said this, and I'm reading from the last paragraph of that report now:  "Karemera said that there were many Tutsis hiding at ESI hospital and Kirinda school, Kabuye, and that we should take use of these weapons and kill them all."  Is that what you told the investigator on the 4th of November 2004? 
A.	This is what I told him.  The bourgmestre and Amani told him that people had sought refuge at EGA, at the ESI hospital and another place.  That is when he said that the weapons he had brought should be used to kill those people.
Q.	And when were those weapons distributed? 
A.	Those weapons were distributed on that same day.
Q.	The investigator says that you told him the following day the weapons were distributed.  Did you tell him that? 
A.	In any case, as far as I'm concerned, the weapon which was given to me was given to me that very day.  I do not know whether that operation continued the following day.
Q.	Did you tell the investigator that the following day the weapons were distributed or did you tell him they had been distributed on the same day?   
A.	I told him that a certain number of weapons were distributed that very day and that the operation continued the following day.
Q.	Now, the investigator has reported that you told him that, "One or two days later, we, the MRND youth, attacked and killed the Tutsis hiding at the hospital and school in Kirinda."  And was that true? 
A.	No, it was immediately that we started that operation.  So it was not the following day or two days later; it was the same day.  And we continued on the following day hunting down people and killing them.
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness AXA.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer the witness statement of the 4th of November 2004 as Exhibit D. NZ446, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ446 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think we've come to a convenient breaking point.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Witness, we take our adjournment now.  You will have to return tomorrow morning for the continuation of your testimony.  I remind you that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment.  
(Court adjourned at 1803H)
