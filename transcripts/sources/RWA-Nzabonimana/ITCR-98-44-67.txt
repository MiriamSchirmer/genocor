MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order, could the registry please introduce the matter coming before us.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 17th of April 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case when the Prosecution Counsel Ms. Ojemeni, will continue with the cross-examination of the Accused Juvenal Kajelijeli, in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Juvenal Kajelijeli, Case 
No. CTR -98-44A-T.

Thank you Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the Prosecution for the record, please.
MS. OJEMENI:
May it please, Your Honours, Ifeoma Ojemeni, Trial Attorney.  I appear with Dorothée Marotine, case manager for the Prosecution.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have the appearance of the Defence, for the record.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Good morning, Your Honours. Lennox Hinds, representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka, Juliette Chinaud, assistant research, and Emilien Dusabe, Interpreter.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you Learned Counsel.  

Yes, Accused, the Trial Chamber reminds you of the solemn declaration you made on Monday and that you will continue with your testimony today on that same solemn declaration.  Okay, yes. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
It's all right, Mr. President.  With your authorisation I would like to ask.  I have two points concerning my health which I would like to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you speaking French?  Okay, I see.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I have two issues to discuss with my Counsel.  The first one has to do with my state of health, and the other one has to do with the procedure.  And if Your Honours so wish the representative of the Registry could be present.  It wouldn't take more than two minutes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Hinds, Professor Hinds.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, if my client -- I have not spoken to my client in close than a week.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
So if he has urgent problems I didn't know about it until now.  I certainly want to know what it is about before we proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the question of health I think can be addressed by a doctor.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Well, I don't know what he wants to tell me and I don't --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And --
PROFESSOR HINDS:
May I, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes, I don't know what he wants to tell me concerning his health.  And I don't -- it has nothing to do with the doctor, I don't know what he wants to tell me about.  And so, therefore, he obviously has a right to talk to his lawyer about his health situation.  I don't know what else he wants to talk about but he can't be denied the right to consult with his lawyer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but at least case law, even from other jurisdictions, once a witness has made a solemn declaration, accused testifying on his own behalf, I think there are certain limitations that have to be followed.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Absolutely, he cannot discuss the case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So these are -- and particularly at the stage where we are, I mean there are a number of authorities which we need to touch on that.  So I don't know --
PROFESSOR HINDS:
He cannot discuss the case, Your Honour, that's clear, but there's no authority that suggest that in an urgent situation he cannot talk to his lawyer about anything other than the case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, may I be heard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS OJEMENI:
The Accused has started his problems.   There are two issues. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
One health, and then the procedure; which I don't know what procedure he is referring to, I guess it must -- I mean concerns the case, and he can even tell the Court as well.  But as regards health we have  --  there's a procedure for that.  It doesn't concern the Counsel.  The medical director is there, and there's a procedure.  The Accused is testifying, and like Your Honours have rightly observed, there's professional -- there's - - the ethnics of our profession does not allow the Counsel to talk -- I mean discuss with the Accused while he is testifying.  Particularly in his cross-examination -- during his cross-examination.  So in terms of health I think the medical director should be consulted, he doesn't need his Counsel.  That's the submission of the Prosecution, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, there maybe a way for us to move forward.  First, I mean, if it is not an urgent matter; if it is something that is not urgent, that he feels is not urgent, then we can proceed until the Court makes a decision.  But if it is urgent, and, I don't know, then we have to deal with it now, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, if the matter of health -- a mater that is of health and is urgent that one can be dealt with, that's what we would like to know from him.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, if it is a matter of procedure concerning the case, that is a trick issue.  I think, you as an officer of the Court would appreciate that.

PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, I think that one is a matter that cannot be gone into, really.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if there's an urgent medical problem that he would like to confide with you that is a different thing.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you understand.  If there's an urgent -- it's a matter that normally should be addressed by a doctor but if you think you want to talk to your Counsel about a health matter, health matter, that is -- that one can  -- and you think it is urgent you will tell us, but matters of procedure, then that one is for -- it will have to wait -- if it is a matter of a general nature it will have to wait the conclusion of your evidence and your cross-examination, going by the procedure that obtain in matters of this kind.  Right?  

So if it is not urgent then you can tell us also so that we can proceed with these proceedings. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I agree with what the Prosecutor proposed because if you accept that -- if you admit that I can tell you now, and it wouldn't be necessary to talk to my Defence Counsel because I thought after telling my Counsel he can communicate this to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you slow down. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
This is how I saw it because he is my Defence Counsel.  What I wanted to tell him was not for him to keep as a secret but it was to communicate to you because he is defending my rights.  I can therefore, tell you, but I think he is the one who could have communicated this better, but if I don't say this, it will be difficult for me to continue with my evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't understand you.  What are you saying?  Did you follow?
PROFESSOR HINDS:
He said that if he does not  -- if he is not able to ventilate what he wants to communicate to the Tribunal, he doesn't feel he will be able to continue with his evidence, so he wants to communicate directly to you what is on his mind.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please go ahead.  Very briefly.  Raise the issues so that we can appreciate it.  And then go straight to it and then very briefly so that we may not lose time.  Okay go on.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  When my Defence arrived here he found my health was not okay, and I told him the medicine that had been prescribed for me in Nairobi, that medicine has now been changed.  The prescription has been changed and lack of this medicine is what is causing me high blood pressure, and I believed that if my Counsel knows this he could ask the Chamber to find a way of obtaining these drugs because my interests have to be protected along with my health.  This is one issue that I wanted my counsel to raise here, but he did not know that I was undergoing this crisis of high blood pressure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That is one issue, Mr. President.  The second one.  When I started giving evidence here on Monday, I kept giving evidence in Kinyarwanda until yesterday evening.  What I heard on the radio last evening is very different from what I said here.  My testimony, my evidence has been changed, and I do not trust that  -- I don't think it was changed by the interpreter.  Many points concerning my evidence.  There are -- there are some -- someone said that he was married to a Tutsi women and during the war of 1994, I chased away the wife and our children, and they were killed at the wife's brother's home, and I am concerned about their death.  After the massacre of Mukingo -- massacres in Mukingo, the reward I was given was -- the reward was to make me a bourgmestre.  This was never said in this Chamber and I am now scared, I am now worried that this could have been said by spokesmen of this Chamber.  It was on Radio Rwanda and everyone is commenting about it.  There were lots of other comments about the bourgmestre of Nkuli - - came to contact me, to tell me about the massacre, and, you know, lots of bad news about me, and this is making me - - making it difficult for me to continue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, are you through?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I would like Mr. President, to tell you that I have a family in Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you conclude.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
My family came here, family members came here to give evidence, to show my innocence.  There are some Tutsis, Tutsi men and women who came to give evidence here showing my innocence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we shouldn't go into that --

THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I am about to finish, Mr. President.  Those people are protected.  It was not necessary for my family members to run away because they know that I did nothing wrong.  This Chamber -- this Tribunal is working for the reconciliation of Rwandese and also for -- I would -- people who have heard this news - -
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you conclude I have heard the gist of what you are saying.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
My family -- the family members are worried about those announcements and you have got -- you are Africans, many of you, you can understand my concerns about that announcement, about that information.  If what happened in -- if one knows -- is concerned about what happened in Rwanda, and I would like to -- I would like you to examine this issue so that my family's security and my own security can be ensured.  I would like you to find out whether it is a representative of this court who gave this information.  Some people said he was a Nigerian.  I don't know whether there are distortions about my evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
May I, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I have listened carefully to what concerns are of my client, and without waiving any of his lawyer/client confidentiality, if he had communicated what he has said to you - - to me, either in private or in the presence of the registry as he had suggested, I would have said the following to him, what I am saying to him now.  

One, that to the best of my knowledge in an open proceeding, the press is open to characterise whatever they hear in anyway they want to.  It could be the whole truth, it could be half-truth, or it could be completely false, but they have the freedom to, in fact, report as they see fit.  It may have been errors that have been -- that they have gotten information in -- erroneously or it may have been conscious and malicious.  The remedy that Mr. Kajelijeli has, and that's what I would have said to him is that he could decide to testify in closed session.  The press would not then know what he says, and he has a balance of the issue as he sees fit, whether for his family security or other concerns that he has.  If he feels that there are issues of security and so on and so forth, he could make an application to the court and so, therefore, that issue he certainly has a right to a public hearing and the public has a right to hear and so on and so forth, but the balance of hearing whatever he is saying I would have said to him, he has -- if he thinks that there is this problem, continuing problem, he is concerned about his family, he is concerned about what is being said and so on and so forth, to make the application - -but the Tribunal cannot policy the press.  The press is in a free -- in a democratic society.  The redirect is that the press can, in fact, report whatever they want to report.  There maybe remedies to suit the press, but that is a heavy wood, and I would advise him accordingly, and so that we can move forward.  And that is my advice, Mr. Kajelijeli, in terms of what the options are in terms of proceeding.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you learned Counsel.

Do have you -- does the Prosecution have any comment on this matter, no?
MS. OJEMENI:
Certainly not, Your Honour.  I am in you hands, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, perhaps first of all we start off by thanking the Accused who is testifying on his own behalf for raising these issues that he had just ventilated to the Trial Chamber.  And the Trial Chamber would like to observe the following:  As Learned Counsel for the Defence said; well, the press have their own freedom.  They can report the proceedings, as they understand them.  They are free, that is the most we can say.  But we can only say that when reporting on proceedings, I hope they always bear the responsibility that goes by the responsibility that is attached to this kind of proceedings, that is one.  

Now two; for the Accused, if any assurance is required at all, we would like to state the following:  This Trial Chamber like any other court of law, dealing with administration of justice, which is the core of our business here, will deal with this case in accordance with evidence that is being -- that has been adduced here and will be -- is being adduced here and will be adduced here.

It will not look outside this courtroom.  So whatever is reported elsewhere is of little -- of no significance here at all.  It is the record being preserved  -- being made here and preserved here that the Trial Chamber will go to when deliberating on this issue at the end, at least as far as this case is concerned and indeed any other case would be concerned.  

So if there was any assurance that was required, in that regard, will state the principle that I think is known to anybody who has an association with the administration of justice.  That is number two.  

Number three; if there are any problems that are going to be attached or maybe attached to any protected witnesses that have testified for the Defence, indeed like for the Prosecution, there's a mechanism to get in touch with the witness protection to be able to see what it can do.  So those are the openings that are available and can be pursued.  
I think what happens elsewhere maybe of concern but it should not be a concern as far as the 
co-administration of justice in this case and indeed in any other case would be concerned. 

The fourth and last aspect; with regard to medicine.  If there's any problem the registry has heard of that one, of that issue.  It can be followed up.  Not only as you testify but even as a person who is here in detention under the subject of the Tribunal.  If there's any matter you would like to raise to the Tribunal, to the Trial Chamber's attention at any time, you are free to do so and the Trial Chamber will always find ways and means of having these matters followed to see what kind of assistance can be given.  

So those are the observations we would make with regard to the issues raised.   Right.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Just for the record, My Lord, the registry has taken note with regard to the matter dealing with the registry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Okay, we will proceed.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I am very much comforted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, could you go on, Counsel.  

We remind you of your oath.
CROSS-EXAMINATION(continued)
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, before we adjourned yesterday, I asked you a question regarding whether or not you knew the members of the Technical Commission, you responded that you don't make the -- you don't appoint -- you didn't appoint them, rather, you made proposals to the préfet of Ruhengeri who in turn submitted your proposal for the appointment of the members to the Minister of Interior, is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Before you arrived at your proposal you must have known these individuals that you proposed, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	You also knew the ethnicity of these individuals, didn't you?
A.	It is not true.
Q.	You had testified that there was a register in the communal office where all the particulars of the residents of Mukingo commune were kept.  And the particulars included their ethnicity, am I correct?
A.	It is not correct.
Q.	That was what you said yesterday in response to a question I put to you in respect of ethnicity.  Do you recall that?
A.	I recall what I said but what I said is contrary to what you are saying.
Q.	I will put the question and the response to you.  I asked you a question and the question is this;
Q. Witness, you had also in your commune what is called communal service, and under this service as census service, and I said that an individual in the commune had a form containing series of identities, including the identity of everyone that was under the commune.  You said that was not correct.  And I said I am referring to census service that existed under Mukingo commune and you said; "The way your question is formulated is not clear.  That the ordinary citizens didn't have a register of all people.  On the contrary the office of the commune had a register where all those particulars were -- I mean would be kept.  And my question was including ethnicity of every citizen in the commune, isn't that correct?  A. Yes that went with what was written on the identity card, that is correct.  Isn't this your testimony?
A.	That's how I said it but it's not the same as what you just said about the technical commission which was given to the préfet, the proposals given to the préfet and then to the Minister of Internal affairs.  You remember I explained that it was possible to have the technical people from the commune ,they could even be some foreigners and Europeans.  The list did not include their race or ethnic belonging.  It depended on their expertise.  This is why this business of ethnicity in the submissions for members of the technical committee is not correct.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But at least you knew the ethnicity of the members you proposed, who resided in Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	I gave -- my proposals included people like Europeans.  If a European is a Walloon or a Dutch or a Frenchman, it was  -- I would just mention the person's name and the specialisation.  I don't know why you are continuing to push on this point of ethnicity or race.
Q.	You knew the members of the Rwandan citizens that you proposed.  You knew the ethnicity of the citizens of Rwanda who were residing in your commune, didn't you?
A.	There were three ethnic groups; that's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Your Honour, have you forgotten that I have to pause --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh sorry, all right.

MS. OJEMENI:
- - for the translators.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q	I will take you then Witness, it is fair to say that you knew the ethnicity  -- sorry, that you knew the prominent Tutsi heads of families that resided in Mukingo commune between 1988 and 1993; isn't that correct?
A.	It is not correct.
Q.	If you didn't know, your conseillers knew them because they lived in the secteurs where they were controlling; isn't that correct?
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  How could it  -- I mean it is an improper question.  She is asking him what his conseillers knew.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
May I continue, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can the Witness answer my question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is that question -- which question now?
MS. OJEMENI:
I put a question that if he didn't know that his conseillers who where controlling the secteurs where they lived, knew where they lived, I mean knew where -- knew where the Tutsi -- knew all the Tutsi -- prominent Tutsi families.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the Witness is capable to answer that.  Can you answer that?
MS. OJEMENI:
Let me put a proper question.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
(No translation).
MR. PRESIDENT:
He is speaking French?  There's no translation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel or the Witness?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour, the problem is, the technology we have here is inadequate to handle the switching from one language to the other, because we have to change a whole lot of things before we can take the witness in French, when he decides to speak in French.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well -- now, Accused Kajelijeli, please stick -- try as much as possible to stick to Kinyarwanda because when you change then the whole system has got to change.  We are told you had spoken in French.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Let me put the question again.  Witness, you said you didn't know where the prominent Tutsi  -- heads of Tutsi families that lived in your -- sorry, Witness I withdraw that.  You have testified that you didn't know where the prominent heads of Tutsi families lived within Mukingo commune, is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that has been answered, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am just asking him.  

Okay, now if you didn't know.  My question is that your conseillers who were your representatives at the sectoral level knew where they lived within the secteurs that they controlled, isn't that correct?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your question is mixed up.  I don't understand what you mean by prominent  --  prominent, are you talking about people with a big post.  People who had big families.  Tutsis co-existed with Hutus.  They could even be leaders along with the Hutus.  I want to know what kind of prominence you are talking about.
Q.	Okay, let's drop prominence and go to important, intellectuals.  Tutsi intellectuals.  Does that help the matter?  If I used Tutsi intellectuals, where they lived within Mukingo, does that help you?
A.	What I know is, I knew where they worked and with whom they worked but knowing where they lived in Mukingo, knowing where everyone  --  everyone lived, that's why there was a census.  This was on record in the  -- this was under the general indicators that showed where people lived.  There were services in the commune that showed that, you know, people who worked there were known.  There were Tutsi as well as Hutu Intellectuals.  People who were, you know both categories mixed up.
Q.	So Witness it is your evidence that you knew the Tutsi intellectuals living in Mukingo commune. Yes or no?
A.	I knew all the staff members in general.  What you are saying  -- it wasn't only the Tutsis.  There were Tutsis who worked abroad who came from Mukingo, there were Tutsis who worked in other provinces, in other préfectures who came from Mukingo.  It is not correct to say that I knew them all.  I knew some and I didn't know others.  There are even today some who are working abroad.
Q.	Witness, you had just testified that they were well known, that you knew them?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we go on with specific questions.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I asked specific questions.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I mean, it's just argumentative.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We should avoid arguments I mean, we go with precisions, so that we can move forward.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can the Witness answer my question,. because he hasn't answered my question.  I asked a specific question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he has.  The last answer he said he knew some and he didn't know some.
MS. OJEMENI:
But he said previously that he knew them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, can you go on, please.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I said no, it's not correct.  I said it wasn't correct.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	We move on to - - still on the Conseiller Commission.  You held regular meetings with the councillors in Mukingo commune when you were the bourgmestre of that commune between 1988 and 1993; isn't that correct?
A.	But the answer I give should be taken as it is that; that I did not know those Tutsis.  You shouldn't say that I accepted that.  Concerning the meetings with the conseiller.  In the commune there were meetings held in accordance with the set procedures and those meetings existed, yes, took place.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I will crave your indulgence to request that the Witness answer my questions and stop addressing me in the manner he is doing.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I object to the Prosecutor  attempting to admonish the Witness.  The Witness answers the questions in the way that he answers them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The Witness has just said there were meetings which were held according to procedure with regard to conseillers.
MS. OJEMENI:
Prior to that he said something and that's what I am addressing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes, that one is true.  Actually the Witness had already answered that question before he made that additional information.  

Kajelijeli as a witness, please listen to Counsel's question and answer them precisely and the answers are addressed to the Trial Chamber not to any Counsel.  Okay.  I think we dealt with that yesterday.  All right we want to move forward and come to the end of this testimony as soon as it  --  you know, possible.  So precise answers and precise questions will help us.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, at such meetings with the conseiller each conseiller presented a report of the affairs of his secteur and based on this report you knew what was happening in the various secteurs within Mukingo commune, isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	At such meetings Witness, you briefed them on the policies and affairs of the MRND government that was in place within that period and you gave the necessary directives for the implementation of the policies, isn't that correct?
A.	I am not going to answer that question because that question is confusing because you talked of the Rwandan government and the MRND party aside.  So we were not working for the party.  You have to distinguish the two because there was the time of multiparty era and the time of single party, so you can see.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You don't understand the question?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I understand the question but the question is compound.  It is like she is laying traps.  She is trying to ambush me.
MS. OJEMENI:
Let me simplify it.  Now --
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I am raising an objection with respect to the question and that is what the witness is saying.  The question is between 1988 and 1993.  He has testified that after 1991 there was a bifurcation between the party and the government.  She is asking a question between 1988 to 1993 and presuming that according to whatever presumptions are, and he is -- that is what he is raising that there was a period when there was -- it was not the party and the government.  There were separate functions.  I think that is during multiparty from one time period.  So if she breaks it up into periods, I think the Witness could answer it.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I object to what my learned friend is doing.  The Accused is educated enough, is enlightened enough to know when he cannot answer any question.  And if he says so, I would have rephrased it.  He doesn't have to get up to defend him.  I do realise that he has a right to defend his client but in this particular circumstance, my learned friend, what he is doing is wrong and I strongly object to that.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I am simply objecting as to form.  It's a compound question and the Witness has indicated his inability to answer it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your objection can be raised as to form of a question but I think one should not go further and stand -- you know, as if one is testifying and clarifying things.  The person who has the authority and the mandate to do so is the Witness.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, but if my learned friend or anybody wants to raise an objection as to form you do that not after the answer has been given.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  You go on.  You can rephrase your question and we go along, please.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Kajelijeli, if you do not understand the question just say so and the question will be repeated or reformulated.  No further comments unless they are really necessary in order to raise your failure to understand.  Okay. 
ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I understand, Your Honour.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Sorry.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, at such meetings I am referring to the meetings you held with the conseillers that were under your authority in Mukingo commune between 1988 and 1993.  At such meetings you briefed the conseillers on the affairs and policies of the government in place which you were representing  --  you were representing at the communal level.  Isn't that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You also gave necessary directives to them for the implementation of such policies, isn't that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And as one of those  -- one of such meetings you directed the conseiller to compile the list of the Tutsi intellectuals living within Mukingo commune in furtherance to the policy of the government; isn't that correct?
A.	What you have said is not correct.  It's not even recorded anywhere and it never happened.
Q.	Why should people accuse you then of such acts if it didn't take place?
A.	You could mention the people who accused me of such acts.  But I have also given proof, evidence that this never happened and even the communal conseiller one of them came here and gave evidence to the fact that this never took place.  Another thing that I would like to facilitate about the question you have is that all communal meeting had -- were reported, were recorded.  Nothing -- all meeting reports would be given to -- submitted to the préfet and nothing could be done without the préfet's decision on this and after his decision he would come out within 15 or 30 days after, that's when it would be - - such decision would be implemented because it would be like a law.  So what you are saying now, if you have any minutes of the communal meetings and I could read it and all of us were signing, this would be -- what you are saying would have a basis but as your witnesses came what they said and I brought my own witness to disprove them and reasons for this so you have no basis for saying that this happened, so it is not true.
Q.	Witness I just suggest to you that it happened.  You gave such instructions to the conseillers?
A.	I have said  -- I have said, no, and you have no single proof for this.  Even the Witness you requested to say this for you was disapproved and evidence is there, and if necessary bring more evidence to prove this.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kajelijeli, answer yes and no.  Issues of arguments will be addressed by other people at a later stage.  Answer the question as it is being asked precisely, if it is yes or no.  If you have explanations to give it should be very brief.  As to evidence who said this and there we will have some other people who will do that.  Your are  --
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I must raise to object.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
The Prosecutor is making an accusation. This court has ruled that within these proceedings it is proper to do so.  My jurisdiction, questions are asked, but if - - that is so minimally, minimally.  This individual has a right to respond, because his lack of response maybe taken as whatever.  So if he is accused he has a right to respond.  Now, if you limit him to say; yes or no, and she, of course, is in an argumentative way.  She makes a statement, he denies it.  Then she comes back and wants to have the last word and says; I in fact put to you.  So what is he going to say?  And the reason why I am raising is because if we are having this process where an accusation can be made, and then, rather a question being put to him, he then responds.  Then we say to him; you can only answer yes or no.  It is just unfair where this kind of accusation goes to the heart of an indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, the Trial Chamber has not asked him to say; answer, "No", in questions that are appropriate.  Where information is  -- more information is required it can be provided.  What the Trial Chamber is saying that he shouldn't go further and argue and mentioning for example issues of witnesses, he can put his story and other issues be addressed by the Defence or by the Prosecutor at an appropriate time, that's all that we are saying.  We are not going to debate on that Counsel.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
No, no, I am not debating, Your Honour, but I think for the record she asked him what proof do you have?  Why would people come here -- I mean, it is the type of question that is --
MS. OJEMENI:
No, no, my learned friend is becoming unprofessional. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
It is the type of questions that are asked.
MS. OJEMENI:
He is becoming unprofessional, Your Honour. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I have the floor.  And I just want to -- because I think this is very important why I am pressing it.  It's the type of questions that are being put.  If she asked the Witness, why would people accuse you.  Now that question begs the kind of answer that he gives.  It begs it.  Why would people accuse you?  So therefore, he then has to lay out all of this.   I am frustrated.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Counsel, is entitled.  I think it's a Trial Chamber, which will see what is an appropriate question or not.  

Go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we now move on to MRND, and please could you answer yes or no so that we can move forward.

The multiparty system - - before the multiparty system, MRND controlled the policy of the government of Rwanda, isn't that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's your question, Counsel? 
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	I asked, before the multiparty system, the MRND controlled the policy of the government of Rwanda, isn't that correct?
A.	Could you repeat the question, Counsel.
Q.	I am asking you that before the multiparty system in 1991, MRND controlled the policy of the government of Rwanda, isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You testified that upon your appointment as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune you automatically became MRND leader, is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You also automatically became responsible for the implementation of the policy of MRND in Mukingo commune?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And the préfet in Ruhengeri during this period also was responsible for the implementation of the policy of MRND, isn't that correct?
A.	You could explain this  -- you could also explain what the policy was, peace, development -- peace, development and unity for the country.
Q.	Yes, we are all saying the same thing. I am talking of the policies of the government.  Is that correct, yes or no?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Let's talk about the organs of MRND, both at national and local level.  At the national level the MRND controlled was centralised at the top.  Those at the national level, up to the bottom that's the local level, is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	The national organs included the chairmanship, the general-secretary, the national congress, and the central committee, correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You testified that Joseph Nzirorera was a member of the central committee in 1981, didn't you?
A.	Which year, Counsel.
Q.	In 1981?
A.	He was a member of the central committee after becoming minister, one has to check to be sure.
Q.	And he was a member of the central committee at some point, isn't that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Was this before he became the national general -- secretary-general of MRND?
A.	There was a time when he was not a member of the central committee and he was just a simple member that's what I know.  That's what I know.  He did not continue being a member of the central committee up to this time he was not?  At the time he was not a minister, he was not --  there's a time he was not a minister and there's a time he was not a member of the central committee.
Q.	But he was the national secretary-general of MRND at some point.  I am referring to Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	Yes, at one time he was.  What you are saying is correct.
Q.	He was also a member of parliament when he was a secretary-general of MRND; is that correct?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	He was a minister and a secretary, and at the same time the general secretary -- secretary-general of MRND, isn't that correct?
A.	No, that's not correct.
Q.	Witness, I will refer you to your testimony.  I will come back to that.  We move on.  

The central committee of MRND was made up of the chairman, other members appointed by chairman, the national secretary-general and the speaker of parliament, and the bodies called; conseillers nationale de development, isn't that correct?
A.	Your question is compound because there were members of parliament.  There were the members of MRND, central committee, so - - and then you also -- there were also ministers who could be at the same time members of parliament.  So you can see  -- if you got this information from somewhere there's a good way of separating these or may be give me -- allow me to explain but you are -- you told me I should say yes or no but I know what is taking your time and yet I could explain this.  I have been limited, I am  sorry.  That's why when you give a compound question I say it's not correct and yet I could give explanations.
Q.	Thank you Witness for the lecture.  Then let's take it one by one.  We are talking of the members of the central committee of MRND, do you understand that?
A.	Yes, I understand.
Q.	The central committee had a chairman and general-secretary, is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And the speaker of parliament was a member of the central committee, is that correct?
A.	If you allow me, there was a time when members of the central committee did not carry out any other -- did not hold any other function, functions.  That time passed, and then time came when members of the MRND central committee could hold other positions but in a way that they could not be members of parliament.  So like I said this is a compound question, and there's confusion.  If you can explain this question further I would provide a clear answer showing the state of affairs then.
Q.	Witness, we are talking of when you were a bourgmestre of Mukingo commune and my question is very very clear.  I merely asked you if the speaker of parliament was a member of the central committee, yes or no?
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Objection as to form, time frame.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Not many, not often.  He could be the speaker of parliament and not be a member of the MRND central committee because having -- holding several positions, was also a question that was raised many times.  Sometimes it was the case, sometimes it was --  and then afterwards it was changed.  So if you could break down this into periods then we can tell how - - where the difference was.  You could give me a given period, maybe 1987/1988 and then you bring it and refer it to 1980/1981.  So as time passed, as periods changed these organs tried to separate powers.  That's why I am confused.  I cannot find an appropriate answer for your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And indeed his time as bourgmestre did run through 1988 to - -.
MS. OJEMENI:
1993 - -.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes 1993.  And of course there was this kind of -- we have now in evidence both in the testimony of this witness, the accused is testifying on his own behalf as well as other witnesses.  At some stage in his term as bourgmestre multipartism did start.  So maybe these things could be specified to be able to -- in the light of what he has intimated as well.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, at some point within a period, 1988 and 1993, it was possible for a minister to also be a member of parliament, is that correct?
A.	It was possible and sometimes a minister may not be a member of parliament.
Q.	It was also possible for a member of parliament to be in the central committee as well, is that correct?
A.	As far as, I know, I never heard of this.  He could be a member of parliament or a minister and member of parliament or at the same time member of the central committee but being a member of parliament and a member of the central committee it was not often.  It never happened often and I do not know of such a case.
Q.	When Joseph Nzirorera was secretary of -- secretary-general of MRND, he was also a minister, wasn't he?
A.	That's not true.
Q.	So can you then explain when it was not possible for a member of parliament to be a member of central committee of MRND?
A.	He could be member of parliament only and not be a member of the MRND of the central committee.
Q.	I am talking of the period, can you now explain, you have testified that it was not possible for -- at some point within the period that you were bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, it was not possible for a member of central committee of MRND to be a minister or a member of parliament, sorry.  So can you explain the period?
A.	That is when you have been elected by  the population as a member of parliament and you have not been chosen or selected to a member of the central committee.  Then you would only be a member of parliament and you would not be a member of the MRND central committee.
Q.	But you can also be elected to be a member of central committee when you are even a member of parliament; is that correct?
A.	I do not know of this.
Q.	So you are saying -- is your testimony that the speaker of parliament was never a member of the central committee of MRND within the period that you were a bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, is that correct?
A.	Rather, he could be that even before I was a bourgmestre.
Q.	Witness, my question is within the period you were bourgmestre.  Let's leave when you were not a bourgmestre.  So could you answer my question, within that framework --  period?
A.	I am not aware of this.
Q.	The MRND organs were also in place in the préfecture, secteur, commune and cellule; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	You testified that Joseph Nzirorera was a member of préfectural committee and also Vice President of that préfectural committee; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Some members of the préfectural committee were elected, weren't they?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And you were a member of that préfectural committee by virtue of your position of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	But at some point in time you were a member of the préfecture -- of Ruhengeri préfectural committee of MRND weren't you?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	You were a member of the communal committee of MRND, weren't you?
A.	I do not know.  There are times you have to give to differentiate periods.  There was MRND single party period, and the period, and the era of multipartism.  So I do not know which period you are talking about.
Q.	Let's talk about the period before the multiparty system?
A.	Right.
Q.	You were a member of the préfectural committee by virtue of your position as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune; weren't you?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	You were then a member of the communal committee of MRND in Mukingo commune?
A.	At one time I answered your question saying that I was automatically the president, the chairman of MRND of Mukingo commune during the single party era.  I believe this is clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you were chairman, president of Mukingo commune but counsel is asking you about membership of these committees.  You have -- during the single party era.  She had asked you about the préfectural committee, you said you were not -- your answer was that you were never a member of that, is that correct?  
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That's correct, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would this apply even when you served as president or chairman of MRND at communal level during the single party?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I was the chairman of MRND in Mukingo commune.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As a bourgmestre?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Yes, as a bourgmestre.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are saying also you were not a member of the --  what do you call it?  Of this --
MS. OJEMENI:
Central committee.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Central committee of the -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
No préfectural committee.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he has said he was not a member even at that stage.  And you are also saying you were not a member of the communal --  no, communal committee.  Is it communal?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Communal -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of MRND.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
No, he didn't say he was not a member.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he did.
MS. OJEMENI:
Oh my God.  Please, the Witness can answer this.  He can answer this. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
The Court is asking.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, he can answer it.  These transcripts are there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did you say you were not a member as well, of that Communal committee of the MRND at the time of single party.  Were you or were you not a member?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That's correct.  Yes, I was.  That's correct, at the communal level.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, are you saying that as the chairman of MRND in Mukingo commune that you were not a member of the préfectural committee? 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Asked and answered.
MS. OJEMENI:
I haven't asked. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That is not correct.  I said no.  I could even give  --  I could even have given you the answer you wish to have, but you confused the question.  In order to be a member of the central committee at the préfectural level there was another procedure to follow.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Okay.  You just wait.  I am conducting, you just wait.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You go on Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, could you tell the Court the procedure for the constitution of the members of the central committee at the communal level of MRND?
A.	Those people would be elected by the MRND congress at communal level but I am talking about the single party era.
Q.	Okay.  After the single party era what procedure was adopted at the communal level, we are still talking about communal level?
A.	At what time do you mean?
Q.	After the multiparty system?
A.	I did not follow this closely because I was no longer a member of the party.  I was now involved in communal administration which was not related to political party activities.
Q.	Witness, you were under ministry of Internal Affairs and communal service as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, weren't you?  That's after the multiparty system?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And that ministry was reserved for the MRND, isn't that correct?
A.	That's correct but during the multiparty era it was no longer under MRND.  It was the government.  It was under the government.
Q.	Yes, but parties had ministries allocated to them and this one was one of the ministries allocated to MRND?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And you have been telling this court that you were not interested in what your ministry was doing at the time regarding the MRND policies, is that what you are saying?
A.	Concerning that question you could have brought even the instructions, orders given by this ministry.  This ministry was supposed to be neutral and to listen to all party --  all parties issues.  It was -- the fact that it was -- it had been allocated by --  to the ministry --  I mean to MRND did not mean that it was working for MRND.  That's far from that.
Q.	Apart from that you were the bourgmestre of a commune and by virtue of your position you were aware of what was being adopted like procedures for membership of key positions in the various parties, particularly MRND; am I correct?
A.	That's not true because there were other -- there are members of other parties who could be appointed, elected as bourgmestres and they would be under that Ministry of Internal Affairs and yet they had not been proposed by MRND party.  So not only me, all bourgmestres in the country had been proposed by MRND.  So the bourgmestre did not follow any party -- any particular party after the multipartism era began.
Q.	Witness, I take it a step further even when you left as the bourgmestre, an election was -- of bourgmestres was conducted in Mukingo commune in 1993.  Is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And the person who worn the election of the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune was an MRND member; is that correct?
A.	The minutes - - the records we have show that he was not a member of MRND.  If you can show me where you got the information to the contrary you can, but I cannot argue about it.  But what I know is that records show that he was not a member of MRND, but I am not arguing about this.
Q.	Can you now tell the Court the record you are referring to that you saw, and how you saw the record?
A.	I saw this in the accusation that he was charged with, that he was a member of MDR, and I did not follow this closely because I was now self-employed.  I did not even take part in these elections but I know that these elections took place.
Q.	Yes, but you saw the record, but stopped to find out the position of what happened; is that correct?  
I am referring to the findings, the final findings you stopped at that point?
A.	You who go often to Rwanda, you can look for these records, documents.  They must be there, maybe the MDR party -- because they said it was his party, he might have those records.  Me I cannot have access to them.  That should be proof but I do not know and I did not follow this closely.  You who often go to Rwanda you should try and check which party he belonged to.

	1030H
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we take it.  Let's talk about the prefectural commune now.  Before the multiparty system, how were members -- what procedure was adopted for the election of members into the prefectural committee?
A.	Thank you.  In order to be elected the préfectural or congress would have to meet as provided for by the party statutes.  During this prefectural congress it would elect members of the prefectural central committee.
Q.	Who were these members?  Did the communal office play any role, or the chairman of the MRND party in the various communes, play any role in electing these members?
A.	It is clear that members among the members of the prefectural congress, the chairman of MRND at communal level, played a role.  And this, I would say this was true for the period when there was single party rule.
Q.	So which role did you play as the chairman of MRND party in Mukingo commune during such prefectural congress?
A.	You are asking the question and providing the answer.  Of course, I was automatically a member of the congress.  That means I took part in the elections.  You will understand that yourself.
Q.	Could you also explain the procedure adopted after the multiparty system for the préfectural congress?
A.	Aren't you really laying a trap now, laying an ambush, when you say "after the multiparty era," that is a trap.  That is an ambush.  I was not involved, I was not there.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Excuse me, Mr. Kajelijeli.  There is no question of a trap.  These are questions -- if they are questions that are not relevant the Trial Chamber will say.  It is not a question of a trap.  There are no traps being laid here.  They are questions in the search for the truth and justice.  So if it is an improper question the Trial Chamber will say so, or counsel will say so.  The issue of traps or whatever does not arise.  And we would like you to address the questions being asked by counsel in that way.  And we should like to get your full answers as you understand the question and as you wish to testify.  It is your answers, like the answers of any other witnesses, that are going to contribute to the determination of this case.  So it is not a game.  It is serious business.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Your Honour.

I took part in the election.  I voted during that single party era, but during the multiparty era I was not there, and I don't know even how the procedure -- the process that was being followed.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Why were you not there after the multiparty system?  How could you say, as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune that you were not there in Ruhengeri to elect members of the prefectural committee?
A.	I said yesterday, I told you -- I told the Court -- I must have said this, during the multiparty era the bourgmestre did not represent any party and that is the reason why he could not be a member of the congress because the party had its own chairman and therefore it was the chairman of the party who would represent the party at the prefectural level from the communal level.  So the bourgmestre who represented the commune administration did not belong to any party.  So he could not take part in the congress at the prefectural level and vote in members of the prefectural central committee.  Those are the reasons.
Q.	Witness, this directive for the bourgmestres not to be members of any political party, did it apply only to Mr. Kajelijeli of Mukingo commune after the multiparty system?
A.	I am telling you what I know.  There are others who chose out of their own will and who would even stand.  Maybe they were conducting themselves in a certain given way.  But those instructions existed, and during the multiparty era I was not a member of the prefectural congress -- party congress.  So what took place -- I don't know what took place in the congress, especially because I was not present, but if you wish you can have instructions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communal Development.
Q.	Witness, you are aware that Ruhengeri in particular, and Gisenyi, were the strongholds of MRND party even after the multiparty system, aren't you?
A.	Even other parties were active there.  I know them, I would especially talk about  Mukingo commune when I was still bourgmestre.  MRND was there, but other parties were active in the commune as well and it had representatives who were known and were holding meetings.  These other parties were holding meetings.  These meetings, took place, for instance, in Mukingo.  I am talking about other parties like MDR and others, and their names are known.  If you went to Kigali you would find them there.  So i wouldn't say that it was MRND that had it's stronghold alone in Gisenyi -- In Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the question, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
A I asked him if he was aware that Ruhengeri in particular and Gisenyi were the stronghold of MRND after the multiparty system.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What do you say?  What is your answer to that question?
A.	I do not agree with that proposition because no election had been conducted in order to see -- in order to assess this by the results of the elections in order to know which party had majority members there.  So you had no proof to say that MRND had its stronghold in that region.  That is how I know the situation.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you are aware that an election was conducted in March 1993 to fill up the vacant positions created by people like you that were removed and that out of forty posts that were available --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you repeat the number, Counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Forty posts that were available, 16 of them were MRND members that were elected, and they were mostly from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.  Are you aware of this?  It was common knowledge.
A.	Could you help me and repeat the question, I didn't understand it well.
Q.	An election was held in March 1993 to fill up vacant positions created by people like you that were removed within this period, and all parties had participated at these elections.  MRND won 16 posts out of forty positions that were available, and virtually all the bourgmestres that were elected under the MRND canopy came from Ruhengeri and Gisenyi; isn't that correct?
A.	I would say that this is new information to me.  I did not follow this, I did not monitor this.  But what I knew was that I could have to be employed in Kigali to get a job in Kigali, but I refused to do this voluntarily -- out of my will.  The fact that I did not go to Kigali, this was not in MRND framework.  So I did not follow this, so I am not aware of this.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, again with an advent of the multiparty system -- I am sorry.  Could you also tell the Court the procedure adopted for the election of members of the central committee of the MRND before the multiparty system?
MR. PRESIDENT:
At what level?
MS. OJEMENI:
Central -- I am talking about the national level.  We finished the préfectural level, Your Honour.
THE WITNESS:
Those elections of the central committee at national level I had left, I remember they took place in 1993, and that is the time I can recall.  So I could not follow the elections.  I have no idea because I wasn't residing in the commune, I was  working on my own, and the job I was doing wouldn't allow me to be available whenever anybody wanted me.
Q.	Witness, let's then talk of before the elections of central committee at national level, before the one that took -- that took place after you left office.  What was the procedure that was adopted?
A.	I could not follow any other things after living the office.  I did not do anything else.  I had to do my own business.  I put aside any political activities.  So when I left office there was no way I could follow the politics.  I was working on my own.
Q.	I am referring to the period before you left office, the last election of members of central committee at the national level before you left office?
A.	What I would like to tell the Chamber is that there was a time that members of the central committee were nominated by the president the central committee and the fact that they would be elected I am not aware of it.  The only thing I know is that there were appointed by president of MRND and the president of the central committee.
Q.	Witness, I put the same question to you previously and you said it was compound.  So could you then tell the Court why you said so initially because it was exactly what I said.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
PROFESSOR HINDS:
The witness has answered the question that has been put to him.  Now we are into an argument about a previous question, it is improper.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take note of that.  These are -- the records are going to speak for themselves.
MS. OJEMENI:
That is correct, Your Honour.  Don't I have the right to challenge the witness with his previous testimony --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be an argument --
MS. OJEMENI:
-- Your Honour, advise me --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be an argument.  Some of these things can be followed up.  The Trial Chamber is following up all the evidence that is being adduced here.  The answers, the previous answers, the present answers and the future answers are on record.

Can you go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you then tell the Court who the members of the central committee of MRND were while you were still in office, the constitution of that committee?
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the question, Counsel, sorry.
MS. OJEMENI:
I asked for the members, if he could mention who the members of the central committee of the MRND at national level were.
MR. PRESIDENT:
At what time period?
MS. OJEMENI:
Before he left office.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before he left office.  Okay.
THE WITNESS:
At the time there were so many changes because there was a time of the multiparty system.  Among the people I can recall as you wish to know, I know that among those I can recall, there was Matayo Ngirumpatse, first name Matayo, Ngirumpatse is the surname.  I spell the Ngirumpatse. 
N-G-I-R-U-M-P-A-T-S-E, Ngirumpatse.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I did not ask for names.  I could have said names, but I said the constitution -- or because he said they were appointed.  So, Witness, can you then say -- tell the Court, you have the chairman, secretary, you know, the positions they represent, the members of the central committee?
A.	There were those that were elected at various levels and elected by the national congress, and those would be the members of the central committee.  That was done in Kigali and telling you who they were is not easy.  They were elected at various levels, I would only remember some of them.  You said I shouldn't mention names, but those were elected at various levels, I could remember.
Q.	Let's talk about when they were appointed, what was the criteria for appointing them?
A.	The criteria followed were that you would be a member and that you are willing to serve the party.
Q.	And the committee is made up of who and who on the constitution?
A.	I think that question is difficult.  This was at a higher level and I couldn't really determine the function.  It couldn't be easy for me to know.
Q.	Now, with the advent of multiparty system, MRND adopted a new constitution in 1991; is that correct?
A.	It is not correct.
Q.	Can you then -- did MRND at some point after the multiparty system change its Constitution?
A.	But personally I think it was the government, it was not the MRND per se, because there were various parties.  At that time parties had been created and there was a new constitution.  Therefore, I feel that that constitution was established at the government level, not at the MRND party.  In that constitution, it was action accepted that multiparty system should be established and there were personalities that were preparing political parties and that is true, this constitution was not prepared by the MRND according to the political atmosphere prevailing at the time, and there were various levels and before this could be accepted, the various levels of the political parties had to make their own contributions.
Q.	Can you recall when this new constitution was made?
A.	That constitution if I can recall very well, it was in 1991, that is when many parties were accepted to work in the country, to function in the country.
Q.	The name of MRND was also changed; isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	What was the new name, and the old name as well?
A.	The new name -- the old name it was said it was the Revolutionary Movement for Development, and the new one was the Republican Movement for Democracy and Development.  You could verify, but that is how they appeared.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did the initials also change?
MS. OJEMENI:
No, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did the initials also change, MRND, did it change?
A.	They didn't change.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	During this period they amended the statute but retained the structure of the organ; isn't that correct?
A.	Could you tell me the period concerned?
Q.	When the new constitution was adopted.  We are talking about the period 1991, after the multiparty system and I am asking you, or I am saying that MRND amended its statutes but kept the structure of its organ.  Is that correct?
A.	I think that might be correct, but I did not follow very well, I did not follow closely the development.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, would that be a convenient time to stop for a break?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will stop here and take a break.  Are you about through with the physical structures.  Are you still on MRND?
MS. OJEMENI:
I still have a few more questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will take a break here for fifteen minutes and resume our work at a quarter past eleven.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1100H to 1125H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes the proceedings are resumed.  Could you proceed with cross-examination, learned counsel for the Prosecution, please.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you testified yesterday that members of the MRND were not issued with identity cards, do you recall that?
A.	I did not state that.
Q.	Witness, I asked you even yesterday whether you were a member of MRND before you assumed office as bourgmestre there was no contest that you gave that evidence.  Do you recall that?
A.	You talked about a party card -- party identity card, that is what I said.  You talked about the MRND party identification cards, not identity cards. 
Q.	Okay.  Witness, can you now tell the Court if you had MRND identity card before you assumed office as bourgmestre?
A.	I never had such a card.
Q.	Was such a card in existence before you assumed office as bourgmestre?
A.	I never saw any cards like that.
Q.	After the advent of multiparty system, were MRND members issued party cards?
A.	I think they -- I heard that they had them.
Q.	Are you telling this Court that all through the period you were bourgmestre and even after, that you did hot obtain any card from MRND party, is that correct?
A.	That is what I said.
Q.	When you were the chairman of MRND party, did you obtain any card from MRND?
A.	I never had any such card?
Q.	Now, Witness, as chairman of MRND party, you had meetings with members of MRND in your commune, didn't you?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You knew the members of the MRND party within that period you were the chairman of MRND?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Witness, you continued to be a member of MRND even after the multiparty system and after leaving office as bourgmestre, didn't you?
A.	I left the party immediately I ceased to be the bourgmestre.
Q.	Interahamwe was a youth wing of the MRND party, is that correct?
A.	They were Interahamwe that were in Kigali, those were the ones that were known as youth wingers of the MRND.  I wouldn't say anything else.
Q.	There were youth wings of MRND and also youth wings of other political parties all over Rwanda in l994, isn't that correct?
A.	That one is correct.
Q.	Now, we are talking about MRND now, Interahamwe which was youth wing of MRND was launched in Kigali in 1991; isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	It now spreads to the other parts of Rwanda, including Mukingo commune, isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	The objective of this youth wing was to sensitise the youth to politics, and mobilise the youth as well for defending the party; is that correct?
A.	That one I do not know.
Q.	What was the objective of creating Interahamwe for the party, MRND party?
A.	I do not know the motive.
Q.	You have testified that 1992 you attended a meeting where the president of the country Habyarimana addressed the gathering at Ruhengere stadium; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I attended that one.
Q.	And you testified that you heard the word Interahamwe for the first time at that meeting?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You have acknowledged that it was indeed launched in 1991 I mean, the Interahamwe was launched in Kigali in 1991?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	at the meetings, Witness, the Interahamwes danced for the president; isn't that correct?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could Counsel repeat the question, please?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	At meetings the Interahamwe danced for the president; isn't that correct?
A.	It was not only the Interahamwe.  There were other citizens who came in large numbers and danced for him.  It was not exclusively Interahamwe that did that dance.  Those were communal ballets that performed dances.
Q.	And usually when you have such august body of MRND leaders, government officials come to the commune or maybe the préfet -- the préfecture Interahamwe usually entertained them by dancing; is that correct?
A.	I never saw it in the commune where I was administrator.
Q.	So it was only at the préfecture level where the Interahamwe entertained at meetings -- at gatherings?
A.	What I say is what I saw taken that dated when the President of the republic came to Ruhengeri, but I didn't see anything like that elsewhere at any other time.
Q.	These Interahamwes came from various communes in Ruhengeri préfecture; is that correct?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	Where did they come from?
A.	No, on that day they came from Kigali, those I saw.
Q.	At what point was the Interahamwe set up in Ruhengeri Préfecture, including the commune under Ruhengeri, like Mukingo commune?
A.	I don't know the time.
Q.	If I say it was set up in 1992, does that help your memory?
A.	That is what you are saying and that is not my own.
Q.	Now, Witness, you were an important personality in Mukingo commune, you should be able to know when such a body was created in your commune?
A.	It wouldn't be a mistake if I say I don't know because I could not know everything, but I could know my own personal affairs  rather than what concerns the others, especially at the time when I left administration because I couldn't follow things in which I didn't have any particular interes.
Q.	So, it is when you were the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, is that correct?
A.	I said no, there was no such Interahamwe organisation in my commune.
Q.	When you were the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune you had an organisation called Umuganda, is that correct?
A.	That is not correct.  Instead, if you could allow me, Mr. President, I would explain this word.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Yes.  What do you say to counsel's question?
THE WITNESS:
He is telling me -- she is suggesting that I had a party called Umuganda, that is what I wanted to explain, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT.
Can you explain to the Accused who is testifying on his own behalf?
BY MS OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Umuganda meant communal labour; isn't it the meaning of Umuganda, voluntary communal labour?
A.	Work and association of party, we want to distinguish.  I want to explain the difference between the two, what is meant by Umuganda.  It was communal work for the whole country, and it wasn't based on an individual and be called like that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question Counsel has asked is not associated with any party, it is a simple question about Umuganda.
THE WITNESS:
She said an organisation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
In your commune your commune, you kept a register of people who volunteered to do this communal work, isn't it?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	But there was Umuganda your commune, is that correct?
A.	But Umuganda was applicable to the whole country.
Q.	But you have the divisions in the communes which were part of the communal services, did you not?
A.	That was communal work for every citizen.  Every secteur had its own attribution.  There was no special appellation for that word Umuganda, and even now according to what I hear on the radio that communal work is still being done.
Q.	Yes.  Witness, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, you had communal -- you had Umuganda in the commune at that time,  communal Umuganda activities in your commune at that time, did you?
THE WITNESS:
That is correct.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And there was a register of the people who do -- the young people who do this work, the voluntary work for the commune?
A.	It was not the Umuganda for the youth, but for every citizen in the country.  It was not specifically for the youth.
Q.	But the people who did this voluntary work, like maintenance of roads, cleaning the commune, you had a register for the people who carried out such work?
A.	Those who cleaned the commune were those who were paid for it.  That wasn't done by that Umuganda activity.
Q.	Witness, we are still on the meeting that you attended in Ruhengeri préfecture in 1992.  At that meeting the president of the country mobilised -- addressed the audience on issues of elections -- communal -- in March in 1993 and other elections -- subsequent election for the MRND, is that correct?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	But the issue of election was discussed?
A.	Yes, this was discussed, but the time frame is not correct.
Q.	I withdraw the time frame.  This was the period when there was in-fighting between parties struggling for supremacy or control of the population in Rwanda; is that not correct?
A.	Besides -- outside that word struggle, I would say there was competition for membership in the whole country.
Q.	And the issue of Interahamwe being made militia as to the fighting of the other parties was discussed?  Isn't that correct?
A.	That is not correct.

1145H
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what is the meaning of Kubohoza? 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Could we have the spellings of these words.  
MS. OJEMENI:
We will have the spellings, but let the witness say he doesn't know the meaning.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I thought the procedure we had was that the words would be spelled, whether or not the witness is in the record.  We need to know what is being -- how we spell the words if we don't know them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It will be spelled in the normal way.  If the witness understands the question he can answer it.  After that, it would be spelled.  Yes; can you answer the question  if you understand it?  
THE WITNESS:
Kubohoza means freeing people who have been detained; that is, setting people free.  That is the way I understand the word to mean. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What is the general term of Kubohoza in the context of political parties? 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, are we having the spelling -- I just need to know what the procedure is .
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kubohoza is normally -- it is not a new word, anyway, if you still recall the evidence which has been gone through this Trial Chamber.  Can you spell out, Interpreter, that word .
THE INTERPRETER:
Kubohoza, K-U-B-O-H-O-Z-A, Kubohoza. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's the word.  Counsel?  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question.  What is the meaning of the term Kubohoza in the context of political parties? 
A.	I would say it in the sense I understand it, and those people who said it in the context of political party, but I cannot explain them in their place.  But if we say that in the context of political parties there was that word Kubohoza it is possible, because a person could take something that belongs to the property of another party, and you make it yours, or somebody who belongs to another party you convert him to your own party, and it becomes your party member.  That is the way I understand it. 
Q.	In effect, Kubohoza was the fighting amongst parties for control.  Is that correct? 
A.	Even now, the word Kubohoza exists, people who appropriated other people's property, then the person returns will come and liberate his or her property from the government.  So the word is still being used in the new context. 
Q.	Now, Witness, that was when Kubohoza amongst the parties were intense.  I'm talking of 1994 -- 1992, I'm sorry.  And it became necessary that MRND intensifies its own tools to fight the other parties.  Is that not correct? 
A.	That is not correct, as far as MRND is concerned.  As far as I know, especially as they had a membership, there was no need for it to go and get them elsewhere. 
Q.	Witness, in 1992, '93, there were situations where MRND parties used Interahamwes to remove flags of other parties, the fighting also, or to fight members of other parties.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	There was so much hatred between parties, members of parties.  Is that correct? 
A.	I will talk about the area where I was living.  That never happened; at least in the commune where I was living it never happened. 
Q.	Witness, there were situations where you witnessed, instructed the Interahamwes in your commune to go and destroy flags of other parties.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct, and among the witnesses there is one who actually contradicts that statement and who said that in Mukingo commune there were flags of other parties.  I could even give you the reference to that. 
Q.	But there were actually flags of other parties, is that what you are saying, in Mukingo commune? 
A.	That is what I am saying.  This disproves what you have just said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, Kubohoza amongst the parties even resulted to physical fighting.  Is that correct? 
A.	It never happened in the commune of Mukingo.  That is what I can confirm. 
Q.	Do you agree with me that this Kubohoza was so intense before April 1994 that people were even killed, members of other parties, of which even extended to ethnicity? 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour: I think that rulings of this Trial Chamber with respect to temporal jurisdiction is quite clear.  Issues dealing with killings prior to 1994 have no place at this Tribunal.  There are no facts that could be considered by this Tribunal as being competent beyond that temporal jurisdiction.  The Tribunal has ruled with respect to conspiracy.  I don't see where killings come in, or could be construed in any way .
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you remember the rulings as far as they relate or allege specifically to the accused person?  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Yes, but what we are having here is, Accused Person is being asked questions with respect to a period prior to 1994, and prior to 1994 he was bourgmestre.  And so I think we have to be very -- I'm raising the objection on the record in terms of where this questioning is going .
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I will ask questions prior to April 1994.  That was my last question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That question can be answered by the witness, for the reasons you have given.  We are aware of the ruling of this Tribunal on the issue of jurisdiction of this Trial Chamber, indeed of the Appeals Chamber as well.  We know the scope how it was ventilated, and issues of a general nature, it has been premised in the question, can be answered by the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
If you let her ask the question again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you put back the question to the witness .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, prior to April 1994 Kubohoza was so intense that it resulted in killings of members of MRND; for instance, killing members of other parties, and vice versa?  
A.	The information I have on that question is that those who are killing, that those were the infiltrators of RPF who used to kill people, you know when Bucyana, Gapyisi were killed, and Gatabazi, it became clear that such killings were carried out by RPF.  There were even books that were published and said that.  But those things never happened in my commune, and there were meetings of MDR which was one of the main parties. 
Q.	Witness -- 
THE INTERPRETER:
I spell the names, please, of those people mentioned.  Bucyana, B-U-C-Y-A-N-A, Bucyana.  Gapyisi G-A-P-F-Y-I-S-I, Gapyisi, and Gatabazi, G-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I, Gatabazi.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Interpreter.  Can you go on, Counsel.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, at the meeting 1992, the president of the country insensitized the youth and addressed the audience on the new level of intimidation to be adopted by MRND in fighting this Kubohoza.  Isn't that correct?
A.	That is a lie.  
Q.	Interahamwe were now transformed into militia, real militiamen, to engage in violence with the other parties.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	That one I do not know. 
Q.	We now move to the RPF attack.  In October 1990 when the RPF attacked Ruhengeri, the Tutsis population in Ruhengeri in Rwanda and Ruhengeri in particular became insecured.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	It is not correct, because it never -- in 1990 it did not attack Ruhengeri in 1990. 
Q.	I withdraw that statement.  I think I said "1990".  I am thinking of January 1991.  It is actually January 1991.  I am referring to the attack by RPF of January 1991 in Ruhengeri préfecture.  
A.	As to the insecurity, I do not agree with, but the attack took place on the night of the 22nd, 23rd January 1991.  But as to the issue of insecurity among Tutsis, that one I don't agree with. 
Q.	After this attack, Witness, Tutsi intellectuals in Mukingo commune were arrested and detained; isn't that correct? 
A.	It is not correct to say that it was Tutsis intellectuals who were detained.  It is not correct. 
Q.	Tutsi heads of Tutsi families were arrested and detained in Mukingo commune.  Isn't that correct? 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, objection.  
THE WITNESS:
If you can give me names, maybe I can verify whether it is true or not.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Mr. Kajelijeli, there is an objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel?  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I am again putting on the record we are dealing with a time period that Mr. Kajelijeli was bourgmestre.  I don't know what purpose this would serve with respect to arresting of Tutsis.  What valid purpose could this serve by asking that question before this Tribunal?  

It is beyond the temporal jurisdiction.  The question is about arresting Tutsi intellectuals in 1991 in the commune in which Mr. Kajelijeli was bourgmestre.  What is the purpose of this question?  I am objecting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What do you say to that, Counsel?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this is already an issue before this Court, ample evidence on that, and the ruling of this Court on this issue is very clear, and it goes to credibility, background information.  The credibility of this witness is in question, and I am going towards that.  It is an issue of credit and it is also for background information. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, may I just put on the record.  Credibility is not the talisman for bringing up issues such as this one where we are dealing with the Accused.  This is not just any witness.  This man is accused of certain crimes within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.  There are areas of credibility where his credibility could be tested, but not on an issue where the Prosecution is alleging that crimes were committed by him.  That is not a test of credibility.  That is, in fact, trying to get in evidence that is otherwise prohibited under a ruse of credibility.  It is improper and inadmissible .
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this witness had also tried to impeach the Prosecution witnesses.  His credit is in issue.  Secondly, the issue goes to the credit, and issue of admissibility is certainly a different matter.  It could be probative, but it is not for my learned friend to decide that, it is for the Court.  But it is simply on the issue of credibility of this witness, and the issue in question is already before this Court and has been ventilated by naming witnesses.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  We are aware of this matter has been ventilated, not once or twice, and at many occasions before this Trial Chamber it is a subject of decisions by the Trial Chamber, and indeed by the appeal Chamber with regard to the question of jurisdiction or its background information. 

The Trial Chamber is of the view that yes, issues of credit cannot go beyond what the temporal jurisdiction says.  Background information is permissible, but information that goes or tends to accuse, or to demonstrate criminal responsibility of an accused person  before the Tribunal, which is beyond the temporal jurisdiction may be prejudicial, because it is the prejudicial effect that must be considered, even when dealing with that kind of evidence,  the prejudicial effect or possible prejudicial effect of such evidence must be considered.  So I think Counsel, we would sustain the objection raised by the Defence on this line .
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I also said I was relying on background information.  I am not going to his involvement .
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it is very close to saying that.  We are dealing with issues of justice here and we must balance the interest of justice all across board.  Anyway, we have ruled on this, Counsel .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in 1993 Tutsi families were moving in Mukingo commune, were moving, were insecured and were moving from church to school to Tutsi family homes that were notable.  Is that correct? 
A.	In 1993 RPF attacked Ruhengeri préfecture.  More than 40,000 people were killed and 5,000 in Ruhengeri, including 440 civil servants.  That caused problems in the préfecture.  There were members of Mukingo commune as well.  That caused some reprisals.  Personally, I was in a dilemma, in a serious dilemma.  Apart frompeople having their own interest to pursue, there were many Tutsis who are very close to me, including my godfather in the church.  I did everything possible.  When I saw that there was insecurity, I asked the préfet to give every assistance because it was too much for me to send gendarme to ensure security for those Tutsis.  Those Tutsis had neighbours who had lost relatives in their church.  It was to become necessary to give them safety, to give them safety in the institute of agriculture at Busogo.  That is what happened. 

Another thing on the issue of temporal jurisdiction, and there must be a reason to -- there was also a way, one of the motives was to protect RPF, because otherwise we have to make investigations on both sides, including the RPF.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have heard what you have said, Witness.  Now what do you say, what answer do you give to Counsel's question in short?  
THE WITNESS:
There was little security for Tutsis, Mr. President. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	It is fair then to say, Witness, that Tutsis were prosecuted in Ruhengeri, including Mukingo commune, right after the RPF attack in '93.  Is that correct? 
A.	The word "prosecution" is not appropriate.  That is why we tried to ensure their security.  I would say that that is not correct, because that prosecution would mean that you go attacking the person wherever he was.  There was Tutsis in Ruhengeri and there were Tutsis who had killed people in Ruhengeri.  We should draw a distinction here. 
Q.	Witness, is it fair for me to say that Tutsis were harassed and pursued as they were moving from one house to the other right after the RPF attack in 1993? 
A.	Concerning prosecution, I really struggle against that.  I don't know why you are bringing up this issue.  That is what I am trying to stop. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel has used different words, if you listen carefully.  You can react to them as you deem appropriate and as you understand.  Yes, Counsel .
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, he hasn`t answered my question.  I am waiting for his answer.  Do I repeat the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, repeat the question to the witness .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Is it fair to say that Tutsis were harassed and pursued in Ruhengeri préfecture, including Mukingo commune, right after the RPF attack in 1993? 
A.	I said that 40,000 people were killed.  So you should include the killings of Hutus.  Don't just talk about harassment.  These issues should be looked at together.  Why did you remove the other issue?  We tried to protect these people who had been arrested, but you should include also the killings that took place.  There are publications on that, and the names have been published.  It looks like you are biased.  I can call that biased.  It is not true, it is not right. MR. PRESIDENT:
Kajelijeli, Accused, please make no accusation.  These questions are being asked on behalf of the Trial Chamber.  If a question is not valid as we have told you, we will tell you so, or your Counsel will say so.  We have heard what you have said, and can you now again answer the question.  Is it "yes" or "no"?  We have seen part of your answer, but we would like to get your information on these questions because that is what we are going to deal with.  So what do you say to that?  
THE WITNESS:
The answer is "yes", Mr. President. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And these Tutsis were being pursued and arrested by the Hutus in Ruhengeri préfecture.  Is that correct? 
A.	It is not correct. 
Q.	What is your answer to that, then, if it is not correct? 
A.	When you speak about Hutus, you are involving all Hutus, and yet we who are protecting the Tutsis you are including me.  You are putting them in the same group.  That is not correct. 
Q.	So, Mr. Kajelijeli, who was then pursuing and harassing these Tutsis? 
A.	There were victims of the attacks, there were Tutsis who lost -- Hutus who lost their relatives and they wanted to carry out revenge.  We fought against that, and even put some people in detention. 
Q.	During this period, that is right after the RPF attack, both in 1991, 1990, Tutsis were characterised as the enemy of Rwanda state.  Is that correct? 
A.	I can say that those who were called enemies of the country were the attackers.  There were people who were attacking Rwanda.  Not the Tutsis inside the country who had Hutu neighbours.  That is not correct.  
Q.	Tutsis were known as Inyenzis, weren't they? 
A.	That is not correct.  Those who attacked the country are the ones who were given that name. 
Q.	Now, Witness, we move on to when and how you left office as bourgmestre.  You testified that you left office in February 1993.  Is that correct? 
A.	It was in late February, the last month of February 1993, the last week of February.  
Q.	You were removed from office, weren't you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And what was the reason given for your removal? 
A.	I have already stated this in the previous evidence, but I can repeat this if you allow. 
Q.	Go ahead.  
A.	I explained that I was removed from office because RPF had been carrying out negotiations with the government, and the RPF was to get the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communal Development, and it gave proposals of lists of people to be removed from different positions, and there were proposals for new appointments.  The opposition parties also wanted that the bourgmestres appointed by President Habyarimana should be replaced.  I was, therefore, removed because of that.  And among the witnesses that appeared, you can find in the transcripts in page 60 to 61 your Witness JBE talked about the proposals of the RPF and the decisions of the opposition parties.  It was also supported later even by (inaudible), 17th of March 1991, stating the list given the list of bourgmestres that he does not want.  He was writing to the Minister of Foreign affairs following a meeting in Dar es Salaam on 5th of March 1992.  We should not lose time on this.  We have proof, evidence on this. 

I continue to say that Kanyarengwe wanted me to become a member of RPF and all -- you know, there were all these problems that got mixed up in spite of the fact that I had done a very god job as a bourgmestre.  I think you have got all these explanations.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, are you trying to say something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you already testified that Alex Kanyarengwe left Rwanda in 1980.  Isn't it? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	Now, Witness, your removal was right after the RPF attack, wasn't it, in Ruhengeri? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	Some bourgmestres and government officials were suspended during the same period, isn't it? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	And some reason -- there were reasons, various reasons for suspending them or removing these officials, including yourself, isn't it? 
A.	I have not understood the question. 
Q.	There were various reasons for removing either the bourgmestres or the other officials during this period of negotiation, if I may use that word, that you were also removed?  
A.	I have already given the reasons given in what concerns me as Kajelijeli.  You can verify this, and among the witnesses you have brought here have made a reference.  I have given you a reference.  I don't know why you should ignore this. 
Q.	One of the reasons advanced for removing people like you and others during this -- immediately after the RPF attack in 1993.  Is that correct? 
A.	Apart from the reasons I have explained to you, I am not aware of any other reasons. 
Q.	I put it to you, Witness, that the president of the country made a speech on the 23rd of March 1993, in which he stated the reason for removing some bourgmestres, and this was right before the election in 1993.  And one of which was the involvement of some of the bourgmestres in what happened to the Tutsis during that period, and also for incompetence of some bourgmestres.  Where do you fall in, in your own case? 
A.	I am not in either of those categories.  I was even offered a job in Kigali and I turned it down. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I crave your indulgence to rely on a report that we had disclosed to the Defence in October 2000? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I don't know what the Prosecutor is talking about.  I have no idea what the Prosecutor is talking about in terms of a report that was presented -- and even there was a report that was presented -- well, first of all, I would like her to tender whatever it is and so that I can --
MS. OJEMENI:
The speech is in that report, the speech that I just referred to, a copy of the speech, and I have the real copy, which is in our evidence unit, of this particular speech in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you show it to Counsel .
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Without even looking at it, I am objecting to any hearsay document being admitted into evidence, I don't know what it is, unless it is a speech written by Mr. Kajelijeli, or whether or not it is any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule of evidence.  So I don't know what we are talking about here .
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am referring to a speech of common knowledge, something -- a document of common knowledge, a speech of the president of Rwanda in March 1993 .
PROFESSOR HINDS:
That is not a basis for the admissibility of a hearsay document .
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we maybe -- Professor Hinds, we are not making a ruling on this matter, but we can only draw your attention on the application of Rule 89 with regard to hearsay evidence.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I was about to advance in my reason for this on relevance.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
89(C) is the general with respect to whether or not this is the discretion of this particular Tribunal to admit evidence that has some probative value.  But I am not dealing with examining whatever is being proffered.  There must be a basis by which the Tribunal has a handle on this. 

What is being purported is a speech, what purports to be a speech, but what is the foundation?  How do we know whether or not it is that?  I mean, there has to be within some four corners of parameters some handle that we can deal with within the Rules of Evidence.  She purports -- there is a document that purports to be a speech.  I am just raising just the objection, but maybe we could see how it comes in.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
These are issues of law that don't concern you, legal issues that do not concern you.  And perhaps if you were not an ordinary witness in some of these issues we would have asked you to leave, you see, to allow counsel to ventilate the issues before the Trial Chamber.  But because being you, you have a very complex situation, you are a witness as well as an accused person, and in terms of Article 20 you have to be present during the proceedings, and you cannot be tried in absentia, but you have your role as a witness.  Let your counsel deal with these issues. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can lay the foundation, but I think in order to help the Trial Chamber, Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel for the Defence, you need to see what the documents are about first before you can even attempt to make a stop or to object, because we would expect that we will get all the assistance from both of you.  So you cannot just come up and take a position without knowing exactly what it is.  

So if there is any problem, Counsel, you have to lay the background, depending, of course, after your colleagues have seen, and then the Trial Chamber.  If there are any objections, we can make a determination of issue.  So we can proceed in the following manner.   

I don't know whether we are together.  Either you pass on the document to your colleague, and make a stand of this issue, come back to it and then -- so that we save time.  Your colleague will have to see it, and see what it is.  So in order to save time, perhaps you may wish to stand off this particular aspect and come back to it so that we deal with the other aspect of cross-examining.  We don't have to stay at a standstill at this stage .
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, that was just my trend of thought.  The thing is, I am only using this to state there were other reasons why bourgmestres were removed.  But it is just -- I mean, it is not too long for my learned friend to look at it, or look at the document and give -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it in French?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, it is in French.  Like I said, we had disclosed a report and it is a book, actually.  I can make reference to the book, he can also check.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long is it?  Because -- can you read French?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Disclosure was made in English, Your Honour, and like I said it was since October -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you pass over the document to Professor Hinds, to the Defence and see how --
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, I have no recollection of this being disclosed to me so I have to have some context -- I mean, it is some pages out of a document that she says she disclosed to us.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Let me put it on record .
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Please.  
MS. OJEMENI:
We disclosed two binders of the Guichaoua report, but what I am giving you is a copy of the speech, which is in our evidence unit.  But this particular speech is also in the two reports which we disclosed to you.  The  title is Political Background to the Rwandan Crisis, Document II, and the second document is The Local Government in Rwanda and the disclosure was made on the 25th of October 2000.  

I was just being corrected.  It was made on the 30th of October 2000.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
It was disclose when?  30th of the October when?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Two thousand, by the registry .
PROFESSOR HINDS:
By the registry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What do you want to say?  Not on the report.  
THE WITNESS:
It is about the report, but my Defence Counsel -- after the Defence Counsel has said something. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, first of all, I have no recollection of receiving this.  I am not saying that we didn't receive it.  If the Prosecutor makes us a proffer, I am prepared to accept if she says this is contained within some other volume, but I have no recollection of receiving it. 

But the problem is this: It has now taken about two or three minutes for our interpreter to read for me one page.  It looks as if it is about a ten-page document.  I don't want to waste the Court's time going through it, but from what I can see, the document purports to be a speech by the Rwandese president, Juvénal Habyarimana, on March 23 of 1993.  That is what it purports to be. 

I don't see any -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Just a point of correction.  I gave you all the documents I have.  It is just two pages relate to a speech.  I just gave you the rest .
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Is the speech just the two pages?  The first two pages?  It is a ten-page document, and the heading of it -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Is the speech.  She gave you everything.  I gave you everything that is -- I didn't remove the speech itself. 

I am being corrected.  It is the speech .
PROFESSOR HINDS:
It is ten pages of the speech.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, I'm sorry.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Your Honour, in terms of saving time, there is no way that we would be able to go through the document.  It is twenty minutes to one.  Get the content of it, and then be in a position to make the kind of decision whether or not we accept the document or not. 

And, I mean, I could think of some ways to get the document in, but I am not obligated to help in terms of my client's interest at this point. 

In short, Your Honour, I think that we need to take some time to look at this document, to try to figure out what is said in it without getting to the merits of whether or not it is a proper document that could be admitted .
MS. OJEMENI:
Just to clarify the issue, the relevant part is the second page, and it is just the last paragraph I think, and it is not even going to the involvement of your client, if you can just look at it.  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I think that to move forward, I think the Prosecutor can ask the witness whether or not he is aware of such a speech, and then depending upon how he answers it -- you see I am not quite sure what we are doing with this speech.  That is my problem.  It may be a non-issue based upon the predicate questions that are asked.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I thought my learned friend was just going to look at it, make whatever comment he wants to make, then I ask the witness, because I have already asked, I told the witness that -- I mean, I have referred the witness to this particular speech, and my reason for using the speech is to show that there were reasons why bourgmestres and other officials like him were removed.  That is all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, do you want to put a question to the witness?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour .
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can put the question to the witness, and then we will see, and we move from there .
MS. OJEMENI:
Could I have back the document.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you have testified that as far as you were concerned, you were only -- you only knew about the reason of your removal, you are not aware of other reasons for the removal of the others.  Is that a fair summary? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That one has been asked and answer.  You said, apart from the reason you have given, in substance, there were no any other reasons.  "I am not in any category, I was even offered a job in Kigali." 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, it was at that point that I asked you, or I referred you to the president's speech where the actual reasons were, people like you were removed from office, were stated.  Are you aware of this president's speech of 23rd of March 1993?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I had wanted to comment on this.  I was removed towards the end of February 1993.  That speech was made afterwards.  I think it concerned other matters.  I have my Defence Counsel.  I think they have heard about writings by Guichaoua.  We find a lot of evidence.  We have two books that contradict what was written by Guichaoua.  One of those books is called, It's not that in Kigali.  

If it is necessary, we can also give these documents in evidence, but, concerning the speech of the president, I would like to ask the Chamber to show me the writing, the publication, so that I can see what was written in that publication, so that I can give evidence with that knowledge.  I don't know whether this has got the signature of the president, or where reference is made to Kajelijeli, otherwise it would be a baseless piece of evidence.  I think the law protects everybody.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question put to you was, whether you were aware.   You needed an answer.  If you are not aware, say so; if you are aware, say so.  The other comments, and we, the Trial Chamber, are going to be very strict.  Issues that deal -- concern your counsel should be left to your counsel.  You should take note of that and answer the question -- you have -- on other issues you can instruct your counsel.  You are not dealing with legal issues here.  
THE WITNESS:
But, I have some information which my Defence Counsel does not have, which I cannot keep quiet about. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We will stop here now.  

What do you say to that now, Professor Hinds?  You want to look at that document?  
PROFESSOR HINDS:
I would like to look at the document, but I would like to find out from my client, I want the question properly put to him whether or not he has heard this speech.  I don't think I heard the answer, because that is going to determine what my position is .
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he said he didn't. 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Hesaid he hasn't?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you put the question to him .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, are you aware of the speech of President Habyarimana on the 23rd of March 1993 stating reasons why some bourgmestres were removed from office in February 1993? 
A.	I don't remember that speech, and I have told you that I was offered a job but I purposely refused to take it up.  I don't recall that speech. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, that ends the matter then.  There is no point my colleague looking into the document, since he says he is not aware of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay .
MS. OJEMENI:
It ends the matter.  Do I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but we will take our break at the usual time .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Interahamwe had their office at Insimbe in Biyangabo centre in Mukingo commune.  Is that correct? 
A.	It is not correct.  If you allow me, I would like to remind you of the reference on what your witness stated. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  Kajelijeli, we know the evidence what the witnesses have said.  We will go back to it, including the evidence that you are giving.  Can you simply answer the questions .
THE WITNESS:
It is not correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your role is not to review anybody's evidence here.   That review will be done somewhere else.   
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	When was Interahamwe set up in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	You are aware that members of Umuganda automatically became members of Interahamwe when it was set up in Mukingo commune.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	That is a lie.  It is not true. 
Q.	Interahamwes had uniforms, didn't they? 
A.	It is a lie, it is not true. 
Q.	Witness, Interahamwe was set up after you left office as bourgmestre in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  What happened after I left, I do not know. 
Q.	Witness, you were actually the president of Interahamwe when it was set up, you organised Interahamwe of the boys and girls, you trained them.  You were actually their leader.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	It is not correct, it is a lie.  
Q.	Your brother was a member of that Interahamwe, wasn't he? 
A.	I have many brothers, if you mentioned the name I can tell you whether it is true or not, but none of my brothers was a member of Interahamwe, to the best of my knowledge. 
Q.	Witness, you have a brother that is in Ruhengeri prison.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	It is not surprising that I am detained here.  He was harassed.  He was arrested in 1999 when coming from Kigali, because -- and his offence was that his brother is detained here from '96.  He was there.  What took so long for him to be detained?  He was detained innocently.  He is still innocent. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you have a brother who is in prison?  Could you be more specific?  
THE WITNESS:
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was he arrested?  
THE WITNESS:
He returned from exile in 1996 and was arrested in 1999. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What is his name, Witness? 
A.	His name is Ntamugabumwe, Joseph.  I spell "Ntamugabumwe" N-T-A-M-U-G-A-B-O -- sorry.  B-U-M-W-E, Ntamugabumwe. 
Q.	His alias, what is he known as in Rwanda? 
A.	His alias is Bikete.  It is known how he acquired that alias.  It has nothing do with what was explained last time. 
Q.	What is the meaning of Bikete in Rwanda? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it Bikete or ...
MS. OJEMENI:
Bikete.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it Bikete, or what .
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you spell it, Witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Interpreter, can you spell it out, please.  
THE INTERPRETER:
B-I-K-E-T-E, Bikete. 
THE WITNESS:
A farmer, it is a name of a god of the French -- a French farmer.  It was published in a French book that was meant for Primary IV.  The name came from that book.  It is not what was stated here that it means a killer.  The books exist.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	It is a Rwandan name, isn't it? 
A.	I have never heard of such a name in Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	Now, Witness, Karorero assisted you in training these Interahamwes, isn't that correct? 
A.	It is a lie, it is not true.  There was even such a training as far as I can know, as far as I know. 
Q.	"Karorero" is spelled ... 
THE INTERPRETER:
K-A-R-E-R-O -- I beg your pardon.  K-A-R-E-R-E-R-O.  Karorero.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Karorero was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
K-A ... 
THE INTERPRETER:
K-A-R-O-R-E-R-O, Karorero. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That is different from "Karerero." 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Karorero was the owner of the canteen within the Nkuli commune, wasn't he? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	On the 6th of April 1994, at night, Karorero was one of the people you met with in that canteen within Nkuli commune.  Isn't that correct? 
A.	It is a lie.  It is not true. 
Q.	You testified that you knew him because he used to pass by the commune to greet you.  Isn't that correct?  Wasn't that your testimony? 
A.	You might remind me, but I don't remember giving such evidence. 
Q.	How did you know Karorero? 
A.	I knew him normally when I was a man and he was a grown-up.  His father had been a teacher.  That is how I came to know him, even when he was a military man.  There is nothing special that I can talk about.  I came to know him also when he was demobilized from the army.  And that was the time he came to rent the canteen at Nkuli commune. 
Q.	Were you still the accountant of Nkuli commune when he rented the canteen? 
A.	It is not correct. 
Q.	"Yes" or "no", Witness, I just asked a question?  Are you saying you were not accountant of Nkuli commune? 
PROFESSOR HINDS:
Asked and answered, Your Honour.  
THE WITNESS:
I said that it is not correct.  I believe that is a clear denial. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, I refer you to your statement when you were asked about Karorero.  Your defence asked you in what capacity did you know him, referring to Karorero.  "I knew him when I was still a bourgmestre.  When he was going to the battlefield he used to pass through Ruhengeri, because at the time many people were coming."  That was the context within which you knew Karorero, isn't it? 
A.	What you said is correct, but it is different from what you said previously.  Just now you asked me about my having known him when I was still an accountant. 
Q.	Okay, Witness.  Now, Karorero was actually your friend and close associate, wasn't he? 
A.	It is not correct what you said. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, is this a convenient time to take a break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will stop here and take the lunch break and resume our work at half past two, half past two.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned.  
(Court recessed at 1300H) 
(Pages 36 to 53 by Karlene Ruddock)






























(Court resumed at 1436H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed. 

Yes, counsel. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, before we adjourned, we were talking about Karera.  Witness, is it fair to say that you shared common interests with Karera in that you had a bar at Byangabo and he had a canteen in Nkuli commune where people could come to drink and relax?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Microphone.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Microphone. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your question has two parts, so I'll answer -- I think I'll answer the first part, saying that I had common interest with Karera, that's not true.  There was no connection between us.  He was a retired soldier because of old age, and I was a self-employed civilian, so there was no connection between the two of us. 

Secondly, the fact that he was running a canteen and I had a bar, that's not true either, because my bar was being rented.  I could even spend a whole month without going there.  So those who saw him at that bar, I do not know what time when they saw him there.  So I would say that bar was in a house I had constructed -- a commercial building I had constructed, and the person who rented it carried out the activities he wanted.  I was not carrying out any activity.  People know this person.  It was a veterinarian officer who was working there with his wife.  People were drinking there, knew him.  The people in the secteur knew him, along with his wife.  They were civil servants.  They were civil servants who were renting this bar.  So I never used to go to that house, that is -- I never went to my house there at Byangabo.  And the contract -- their rental contract -- we had a rent contract, so what they told you was not true.  You should continue carrying out investigations. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May we repeat again that you just answer the question.  You are not having a dialogue with the Prosecutor or any other counsel.  The answers you give are answers to the Tribunal, so avoid any comments that are not necessary to your answer.  That is important. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, is it your testimony that you never visited the bar at Byangabo, which is your property? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if we understood him correctly, counsel, is that the house was his --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but the bar was rented out by somebody else, who was running a bar business in that house.
MS. OJEMENI:
I accept that, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we understand to be his testimony.
MS. OJEMENI:
Exactly.  While giving his testimony, he also mentioned he's never been there.  That's why I'm asking him for clarification.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  That is not his testimony.  He said that he could go a month without being there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  My -- he used the words, in English -- of course, it may not have been correct -- "My bar was being rented out.  I would spent a month without going there --"
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- "the house was mine, but it was rented out".
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, he said so, and I also heard before he finished, that he never went there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
So he can answer that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can have that verified if you want to find that out.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, I would like do that. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I used to go there only to collect rent.  I could even drink one glass of beer or -- just like any other person, would drink from there, but I never had any activities -- I never conducted any activities there. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, GAP was the brigadier in charge of your communal office between 1993 and 1994, and he was an instructor, also, for the military training conducted for the Interahamwe militia; is that correct? 
A.	That time you're talking about, I'm not aware of this, and if he really did what you are saying he did, I'm not aware of this, because I was not bourgmestre at the time, and even when he became bourgmestre -- when he became in charge of the police, communal police, I was not bourgmestre, so I do not know about this either. 
Q.	GAP was the brigadier for the communal office during the time 1988 to 199 -- 1991 up to 1994.  Part of it was during the time you were bourgmestre; is that correct? 
A.	That is not true. 
Q.	Now, witness, who is Setako?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell Setako, S-E-T-A-K-O.
MR. PRESIDENT:
S-E?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
T-A-K-O, S-E-T-A-K-O.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I know Setako.  He was a civilian member of the population in Mukingo commune, and if I remember well, at one time he was a soldier.  Then he retired from the military and became a civilian, and he came from Rukoro cellule, and he was a corporal.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell Rukoro, R-U-K-O-R-O, Rukoro. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Setako was also an instructor of the training of Interahamwe militia under your leadership; isn't that correct? 
A.	There are some things that I know you're on that I would like to tell the Court.  There are two Setako -- individuals called Setako.  There's one who was a native of Nkuli commune and another Setako who lived in the Mukingo commune, and he's the one I have been talking about.  Afterwards he must have been a supervisor in the Ministry of Public Works.  I never saw him, and I never heard about him being involved in instructing and training Interahamwe while I was there and after.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So this is the Setako who was -- you said he was a civilian, but he was also a retired soldier and he was a corporal; is that correct?  That's the one you are talking about?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
He's the one I am talking about, and he was also a -- he's the one who I'm saying became a supervisor in the Ministry of Public Works.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and are not aware whether he did any training? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I'm not aware of this, because he was fully employed; he had a permanent job, and I do not know anything about this training. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I'm addressing the period now -- I'm addressing the period between 1993 and 1994, and that's when Setako was an instructor for this Interahamwe.
A.	I said no; I said I do not -- I'm not aware of this.  The one I knew was a supervisor at that time I was employed. 
Q.	Witness, you know Dusabimana, a relation of Joseph Nzirorera, don't you? 
A.	I know of him. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell Dusabimana, D-U-S-I-B-A-M-A-N-A (sic), Dusabimana -- D-U-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  Sorry for the mistake. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	He's fondly referred to as "Dusabe", isn't it (sic)? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	He's also a retired soldier, isn't he? 
A.	He was a deserter, that is true.
Q.	Where is he now, do you know? 
A.	He is dead.  But I do not know where he was buried, but the information I have is that he is dead. 
Q.	He was also an instructor and Interahamwe himself, for -- he was an instructor for the Interahamwe training, and he was an Interahamwe himself; isn't that correct? 
A.	What I have -- I have already told you that I do not know about this training.  Another thing I know about him, if you allow me, is that at one time I arrested and detained him when he had harassed Tutsi women who were at Byangabo.  At that time I was bourgmestre, and that was in 1992.  That's all I know about him.  I do not know anything about him.  I even find (sic) him, and his parents had to bring for 4,000 to pay the fine.  All this is recorded at the commune.  He spent three nights at bourgmestre (sic) and got out after being fined 4,000 francs, because he had harassed Tutsi women. 
Q.	Witness, Dusabe was one of the people you gave instruction, on the morning of 7th April 1994, to go and kill Tutsi; isn't that correct? 
A.	That's not true, because I never left my home on the 7th of April 1994; I was in my home. 
Q.	We'll come to that in a minute. 

Now, RGM, your witness, was a member of the Interahamwe, and indeed the president of Interahamwe, wasn't he?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is that sorry?
MS. OJEMENI:
RGM.
MR. PRESIDENT:
RGM.  Okay.  Yes, counsel. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I have not understood the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you repeat the question, please?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	RGM, who was one of your witnesses, was the president of Interahamwe, isn't that correct, in April 1994? 
A.	He accepted this himself, accepted that he was president of MRND in Busogo secteur. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What's the answer, witness? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
He was the president of MRND in Busogo secteur, not Mukingo commune.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I'm hearing -- I'm hearing the witness saying "Interahamwe"; I'm hearing the translator saying "MRND".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
So I'm not quite sure what --
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is what I'm trying to find out.  The question being asked by counsel is whether or not he was president of Interahamwe, and what answer did you give, witness? 
MR. HINDS:
He's saying "Interahamwe"; the translators are saying "MRND".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we have it?  Go on.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That he was -- I gave the answer, saying that he was the president.  According to his testimony, he said he was the president of Interahamwe of Busogo secteur.  If we talked of presidents, we talked of Kajugas also, so we have to clarify where he was president.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So he was president of Interahamwe in Busogo secteur; is that your answer? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That's what he said himself, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yah, but the question being asked by -- we take note of that.  Can you ask your question again? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	RGM was the president of Interahamwe in Mukingo commune, isn't that correct, in April 1994? 
A.	That is not correct.  I said this was in Busogo secteur. 
Q.	And who was the president of Mukingo commune -- of Interahamwe in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I do not -- you have to ask that -- you have to put the question to the president of MRND in Mukingo at that time.  I am not aware of this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can say that you are not aware of that or no, or yes, just there. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	In April 1994, you knew RGM as a member of Interahamwe, didn't you? 
A.	That's true. 
Q.	Witness, the military training for the Interahamwes who became militia was conducted in Mukingo communal compound -- communal office compound, and Nsimbe compound between 1993 and 1994; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	How did you know? 
A.	No one told me about this.  I never witnessed this, that's why I'm denying it. 
Q.	How often did you go to Mukingo, or how often were you in Mukingo commune when you left office as bourgmestre? 
A.	I went there once or twice for personal reasons, when I was going to collect my salary -- I never -- I never had to go back there -- as well as the time I mentioned when I went to ask bourgmestre how I could reach my home in Rwinsovu.  So it's not many times that I went there, although I did not write the dates when I went there.  I had a job which did not allow me to have -- to travel around without any purpose.
Q.	Witness, I'm addressing the time you left office in February 1993 and up to July -- up to April 1994.  Are you saying that you went to Mukingo communal office only twice? 
A.	That's true, when I went to collect my salary.  I do not remember exactly when I went there, but I went there about twice when I went to try and get my salary paid.  In any case, I didn't go there more than four times.  I also went there when I went to attend the burial of the bourgmestre on the 9th, and on the 8th.  The circumstances -- I mentioned the circumstances under which I went there on those dates. 
Q.	Now, witness, for somebody who went to a place twice within a space of 14 months, is it correct or fair for that person to be emphatic on seeing that a certain event did not take place at this place that he visited only twice? 
A.	Those two times -- I could even have gone there more than those times I mentioned, but I do not remember when I went there, because of the kind of job -- of the kind of work I was doing.  I did not write the dates when I went there.  I could even have gone there more than those two times.  I did not know that this would come up somewhere in a case, that I would be asked about it.  But what is being said about me during that time is not true.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, actually, I think, witness, previously, before this answer, you said two times, twice, in any case it cannot be more than four times. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay --
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Excuse me, may I continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no; I'm just drawing attention to what you said.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I take you back.  I have been reminded that you said four times.  Now we are talking about four times.  Is it fair for you to say categorically that no military training took place in Mukingo commune that you visited four times within a space of one year? 
A.	I said that I could even have gone there more than those four times.  But during the time I went there -- the times I went there, I did not see any military training taking place, and I was not alone.  But even the other times I went there I was not alone.  And those other people never saw any military training being conducted there.  That was not the reason why we had gone there, but I could have gone there more than four times.  I do not remember the days, the times I went there, because I could even have passed there on my way to do my work in Ruhengeri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take note of that answer.  

The only thing that needed clarification, counsel, if you want, if you would like to know, in answer to the question that was raised previously, one of the reasons, if the English translation came out through correctly, was that he passed there to get his salary.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, he said so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the period being addressed is February, between 1993 to April 1994.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yah.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we are addressing, once more, the period February 1993, when you left office as bourgmestre, and April 1994.  That's within the time frame I'm asking my question.  Did you understand that before you gave your answer? 
A.	I do not understand the question right now.  Could you repeat it for me, please? 
Q.	My question is this: is it fair for you to say that you knew for sure that there was no training taking place?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That, counsel, is answered, eh?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, it's answered. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, it's answered.  I thought you wanted me to clarify that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  That aspect is answered. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay, I'll move on to the next issue. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court how -- sorry.  You testified that you did not know about the affairs of MRND when you left office; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Now, my question is this: the teachers who were tenants of Nsimbe, how did you know that they were MRND members? 
A.	It is because they are the ones who are residing there and it was being said they are the ones who were raising the MRND flag, especially the professor -- the teacher called Gideon.  It was common knowledge.  Even the people living around there, around Byangabo, knew about this.  I'm not the only one who knows about this, saying that I know this.  There are even people who testified to this when they were not in MRND.  So if this is common knowledge, there's no way I could not know about it, and this is close to the place where I was -- the road I was taking towards -- when I was going to carry out my work.  And the teacher was one of the teachers at Saint Joseph, and I had a role, a career role in this school.  I was one of the members who were playing a big role in this school. 
Q.	It was common knowledge that these teachers were members, but the affairs of MRND party, after you left, was not -- were not common knowledge; is that correct? 
A.	Even I did not have any knowledge about this -- excuse me.  After I stopped being a bourgmestre, I didn't know about the affairs of MRND.  I did not even need to follow its affairs. 
Q.	Except for the teachers, you followed up on their activities, isn't it -- the occupants of Nsibmi? 
A.	The fact that they were residing there, and they used to raise the MRND flag there: everyone could see this.  So I was -- I was to follow.  What does it involve?  It was at the road, in a public, open place.  I was not following it, as such, because it was not any of my duties to follow this. 
Q.	The positions the teachers occupied in MRND party, was it also common knowledge, and if yes, can you tell us the positions? 
A.	Thank you.  They were members, simple members, like any other members, any other MRND party members. 
Q.	How many flags did they have in front of their house -- how many MRND flags? 
A.	Excuse me.  It was -- they were renting a house, a house that was an annex to the main house, and in front of that house there was only one flag. 
Q.	Within this Nsimbe building there was also a bar where people could come and drink and relax.
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	You testified that the teachers were also selling soda there, or drinks were sold there; is that not correct? 
A.	It was milk and soft drinks, and it is not very often that in this area men drink milk or soft drinks, apart from women and other passers-by.  I did not follow this either, but I know that is what was being sold there, so it was not often that in that region people would be having a good time, relaxing, just drinking Fanta -- soft drinks, that is. 
Q.	Witness, did you also visit the building --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you understand the translation, Mr. Hinds, in English?  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to understand. 
MR. HINDS:
I'm not sure whether it was just ad-libbing.  I heard "Fanta".  I'm not sure that the witness said "Fanta" or "soft drinks", but I -- what I got was that it is not usual for individuals in that culture --
MS. OJEMENI:
Please, can we hear it from the witness.
MR. HINDS:
I thought the Court was asking.  Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the witness can repeat the answer, please, because the translation that came through was not very clear.  Can you, please?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I said that it is not often that people from that region would drink Fantas, soft drinks, in other words, but it's only passers-by who would buy these Fanta -- passers-by would buy them and drink, but people would not sit there.  When you talk of relaxing, we understand dancing, people sitting and talking.  But people would buy Fantas and drink them there, especially the people who were living in that annex behind the house. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, if the military training for the Interahamwes was taking place anywhere in Mukingo commune between 1993 and 1994, would you have known? 
A.	I had my job, my work I was doing.  I would not have known, but those -- most of the people who were working at the commune came here and said -- denied this. 
Q.	I'm referring to things within your knowledge, witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can you answer the question just precisely. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
There was no way it won't be known, because something public, there was no way it wouldn't be known.  So that's why I continue denying this. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I refer you to your testimony.  Question: between the time that you left office in 1993 and the time that you took office again in June of 1994 did you see any training of youth, military training in any way in the commune?  I would like your answer.  I would like to inform you that when I left office as bourgmestre I really disappeared from public eye.  I was busy with my business but among the things I saw, I can testify that there was no one training, having military training in Mukingo.  I never saw it.  I never heard of it.  The follow-up question: do you know whether -- that's the answer, My Lord. 

And my question now is that you said you never heard of it.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your answer is correct, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, Ndisetse deputised for you when you were in office between 1988 and 1993 occasionally when you had to go away from the office for official reasons or -- official or personal reasons; isn't that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	He's a trusted friend of yours, isn't it? 
A.	Apart from being a friend that could be true, and I believe that I used to trust him.  But he was elected by his colleagues, because it was not the bourgmestre to appoint him; it was his colleagues who would come together and select and choose the person who can deputise the bourgmestre if he -- in unusual circumstance or if he's gone -- the bourgmestre is on leave.  There's even another person who acted as bourgmestre.  He's not the only one who deputised the bourgmestre.  There's another person at one time who deputised, so it was not based on friendship. 
Q.	But you had an assistant bourgmestre under you.  Why could you not allow him to deputise in your absence? 
A.	That is provided for by law.  It is not the bourgmestre who dies on this.  It is provided for by the law, the law governing commune issues, which provides that if the bourgmestre is not there, or he's on leave for emergencies, he should be replaced by one of the conseiller, chosen from the conseillers there.  That's how the law provides, and you can consult it.  So it does not provide that the bourgmestre should be replaced, deputised by the assistant bourgmestre unless the préfet decides so. 
Q.	Can you cite the law, please?  What is the reference for this law? 
A.	It is the law governing on the 23rd of September 19 -- '94 or '93.  That's where you could see it.  The law governing how -- '73 -- '73 or '74, not '94, '93; '74 or 73.  This is the law governing the communes, dated 23rd September '73 or '74. 
Q.	Now, witness, when you were in office, you maintained good relations with the population of Mukingo commune; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you testified that you helped many of them, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Is it then fair for me to say that you are indeed a considerate and humane person? 
A.	Up to now. 
Q.	When did you leave Mukingo commune, after your office -- after you left office in '93, to Nkuli commune? 
A.	The war broke out on the 8th, but even before I left -- before I left the position of bourgmestre, it was not often that I would stay -- I would be seen in Munkingo commune because of insecurity.  I would go to Gisenyi for security reasons, but as far as those -- that period you mentioned is concerned, it is from -- it is from the time I handed over the Mukingo commune office after being replaced, I was not moving much, was staying much, in commune Mukingo for security -- for my own security reasons, apart from the area where I told you I had some activities I was conducting, and I could carry out my activities during the time, and I was just controlling what my workers were doing.  So from that time I did not go to commune Mukingo a lot, but I do not remember the dates, because I didn't know that I would be asked about this one time. 
Q.	Now, witness, you had a family in Mukingo commune, didn't you? 
A.	I said this.  It's correct. 
Q.	How often did you see your family in Mukingo commune when you were living in Nkuli commune?  We are now addressing 1994, before the 6th April 1994.  How often did you see your family in Mukingo? 
A.	I did not count the times that I saw or visited my family. 
Q.	So, in effect, you would go as many times as you liked in a day? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	Can you then tell me what is correct -- or tell the Court, rather, what is correct? 
A.	I could go there during the daytime, and continue with my work, because I told you I had both forests in some areas, and I had workers cutting trees there; once or twice, just passing by.  I did not write these times I went there down; I was not going there every day.  So I did not record this; I did not count the times I went there. 
Q.	Did you ever sleep in Mukingo commune between January and April 1994? 
A.	It was -- apart from March, in the month of March, in the last month of March -- the last week of March, sorry, when my wife had given birth.  Those are the days I could talk of.  It is that time that I remember. 
Q.	It was a special occasion, so you could remember that, isn't it? 
A.	That's correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is the only location he did what? 
MS. OJEMENI:
He slept in Mukingo commune. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you can explain, if you still remember my question, which is, did you ever sleep -- or how many times did you sleep in Mukingo commune between January and April 1994? 
A.	I slept there when my wife had given birth.  I do not remember the date, but I remember that occasion, that time, because I stayed there up to -- up to when the child, the baby, after the mother had regained some strength, because some work -- some work I was doing for her there.  So I do not remember the dates, but it was in the last week of March 1994. 
Q.	Can you remember how many nights you spent? 
A.	I did not count the nights I slept there, because I did not know that anyone should be interested in how many nights I would sleep there.  My only worry was security concerns.  I could even sleep there one night and change and I would go elsewhere so that people would not know my habits, what I was doing.  

And I did not have a vehicle, because people would have seen the vehicle, and they would have known that I was there, especially coming at night.  At night it was even more serious because the vehicle -- I would have to use head lamps, to put on head lamps -- headlights and people would know that it's me.
Q.	Witness, are you then telling the Court that there are times that you would sneak into your own house, is that what you're saying, between the period January and April 1994? 
A.	I told you why I was not showing myself, I did not move there freely; and the reasons are valid because many people were killed there and they were killed -- RPF, the security concerns that I had.  You should understand the security concerns that I had. 
Q.	During the period you were in Mukingo commune, the nights -- or the period you could remember that you slept there, did you go to Nkuli as well? 
A.	There was no day that I would come to Mukingo.  Every time I would come to Mukingo commune I would be coming from Nkuli or from where I was collecting activities of carrying (sic) forests in Mukingo commune.
Q.	Witness, we are now addressing the period you said you spent nights in Mukingo commune; is that clear? 
A.	I have explained this. 
Q.	That's what I'm addressing and I'm asking follow-up questions.  I just want you to understand what I'm doing, okay.
A.	I have told you that knowing the nights, I slept there -- I did not count the nights I slept there, because I didn't know that at one time I would be asked about it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I think that's not the question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	So I take it then that you couldn't remember what you did during that period that you were in Mukingo.  You couldn't remember the number of days; you couldn't remember what you did within that period that you passed nights in Mukingo before the 6th of April; is that correct? 
A.	I think that if you -- you -- if I am allowed, most people here are parents.  Once your wife has given birth, you have to assist her until she regains some strength.  So I was monitoring her situation and following her health situation.  So asking me what else I did, I think you're going too far.  I think everyone who has produced -- given birth to a child knows what involves -- what giving birth involves.  So I did not really -- this is our culture and it is well known, and even youselves (sic) where you come from, when a mother has given birth, she has to be assisted, so I couldn't leave her alone; I couldn't abandon her.  It was a risk, but I had to take it; there was no other way out. 
Q.	We now move to 1st April, witness.  Can you tell the Court what you did on the 15th April?  When did you wake up? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which year?
MS. OJEMENI:
In 1994.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Can you repeat the question, counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I'm asking the witness to tell the Court what he did on the 1st of April 1994. 
A.	On the 1st of -- I do not recall.  I did not write this down.  Unless I could see my diary, but I did not -- otherwise I cannot recall.  And there is no special event that occurred on that date that could remind me.  And, as you can see, it's now ten years that have passed by -- nearly ten years, I'm sorry, so I cannot recall. 
Q.	Witness, there was -- I mean, a special occasion in March you couldn't remember as well, which you've just testified to.
A.	That is correct.  The special event was my wife who gave birth, and I assisted her.  But concerning those dates, saying that I should have written down these dates, I did not.
Q.	We now move to the 6th of April, the night you were seen at Nkuli commune.  I'm addressing 6th of April 1994.  Witness, you were seen at Nkuli commune communal office, Karera's canteen in particular, from 10:00 in the night, or thereabout, up to early hours of the morning of the 7th; isn't that correct? 
A.	I would like to inform the Court that that is not correct, and whoever told you this told you a lie, because the statement he made -- that person made in front of the judicial authorities in Rwanda, you have those statements, so that person never mentioned that and never mentioned my name, so you yourself have no proof to show, to prove what you have just said, because the person who was helping you to do this, and even this was something that was made up.  So it was disproved by the fact that the statement he made to the Prosecutor's office did not mention this.  So the Court should take it that this is not true.  Those are lies and you have proof for this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
And he signed those statements himself.

MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered that, but you addressing the Court; you are not addressing the Prosecutor.  You should bear that in mind, witness, accused. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question, please? 
A.	Your Honour, the public does not know that the witness who came to tell her these lies, they don't know that this witness has said other things and they apologised for this.  All these people do not know anything so I cannot --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen, you are addressing the Court and not the -- witness -- the story about what happened in the course of this testimony to the rest of the world.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So please answer the questions precisely as they're asked.  You are not speaking to the gallery; you are speaking to the Court.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
(No interpretation).
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a problem of translation. 

Yes, can you put your question back?  I think that one was answered.  You can move on, counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay, Your Honour. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, witness, you told the Court that on the 7th morning your sister came to see you.  Where did your sister come from? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That sister of mine came to my house in the morning on the 7th in 1994, 7th April 1994, coming from Rubaya cellule, Gitwa secteur.  That is where she lived.  It is in Nkuli commune.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell Rubaya, R-U-B-A-Y-A, Rubaya; Gitwa, G-I-T-W-A, Gitwa; and Nkuli, N-K-U-L-I, Nkuli. 
(Pages 54 to 68 by Geraldine O'Loughlin)





	1530H
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	That Kinyababa is in Gitwa secteur, isn't it?
A.	Thank you, Kinyababa is a cellule in Gitwa secteur.  I spell Kinyababa, K-I-N-Y-A-B-A-B-A, Kinyababa.
Q.	About what time did this, your sister, come to your house on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	I don't recall the precise time, but it could be around 6:15, because she was the first person to arrive and the workers opened for her.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Six-fifteen in the morning?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, 6:15 in the morning.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	When she arrived, where did she see you to at that time, at 6:15?
A.	You asked me when she reached my house, when she found me in my house?
Q.	Whereabouts were you when she arrived to your house?
A.	I was not in the sitting room; instead they opened for her and she sat in the sitting room, together with the other people who were around.  Me, I was listening to the news and I immediately got out of bed because I heard that there was a visitor.
Q.	About what time did this, your sister, leave your house, on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	My sister left my house at around 8:35 in the morning.
Q.	About the time she left you were already aware of the insecurity in Mukingo commune and the entire Ruhengeri -- Rwanda, weren't you?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	And you allowed your sister to leave your house at that time?
A.	She had left her house and she didn't know that the president of the republic had died.  And the other thing is that between our homes, her home and mine, it was about one and a half kilometres away.  There was no reason why she shouldn't go home.
Q.	On that day there was an unusual environment in Rwanda; isn't it?
A.	What you're saying is correct.
Q.	Anybody stepping out of the house on the 7th of April 1994, particularly earlierwise of the morning, would have noticed that; isn't that correct?
A.	What you're saying is correct.
Q.	Schools had closed during this period.  On the 7th of April schools were not in session; am I correct?
A.	Some of them were closed, others were not.
Q.	And with the insecurity of the death of the president, your sister came to request for school fees; is that correct?
A.	That is correct, because she came before she heard that the president had died and we ourselves heard it at around six in the morning.  She had already left her house.
Q.	You testified you saw her off.  How far did you go with her?
A.	It was about twenty metres from my house.
Q.	So, at some point you left your house that morning of 7th April 1994, before you went to see the bourgmestre of Nkuli commune, as you've testified; isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Why would JK312 come to you for assistance on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	He asked me to come to my house and I think I explained the reasons for that, because he felt that his security could not be assured so, therefore, the reason why you are asking why, it's because he wasn't feeling secure, it was, therefore, necessary for him to find a way of getting refuge at my house.  It was not possible, but the reason behind it was that he was afraid for his own security.
Q.	He has confidence in that you will assist him in securing the life of his family and hiself; is that correct?
A.	Instead, the reasons I give, I could even have given him protection in my house, because there was another person who was a Tutsi hiding there.  You cannot seek refuge where you don't trust people.
Q.	Witness, why would Tutsis seek refuge after the president was killed in April 1994?  Why not you, a Hutu?
A.	The reason was that it was a war situation and I kept repeating it, that even that place where I was it was like a place of refuge, seeing that the president of the republic would die, and then I would also take refuge.  That is really what we ended up doing, because we also fled, though it didn't happen on the day of his death, but we fled because of his death, eventually.
Q.	Your sister was not afraid leaving your house; you even saw her off.  But the Tutsi was scared and had to come to you for assistance for evacuation and I'm asking you why.  Could you explain to the Court why not your sister, who is a Hutu, afraid of her life; why the Tutsi?
A.	That is a question I explained when I was asked before the Chamber.  I said, whenever there was an outbreak of fighting the Tutsis were frightened, especially because that war, whenever it attacked, there was a large number of Hutus who would die.  There is no reason why the Tutsis wouldn't be afraid.  Now, it became even worse when it was heard that the president of the republic had died, the Burundi president had died, the chief of staff had died, who was from Nkuli commune.  All this led to a lot of fear in this place and there's no reason why the Tutsi shouldn't have been afraid and even as the Hutu, that's what I said initially, we suffered a great deal.  It was like the case of Noah of the bible, it was like we had been flooded.  The death of the president led to a lot of calamity and many people died, others fled, others died in their place of refuge, they were brought back from their countries where they had fled and come back and continued dying.  It is so much, it is such a long story.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, be brief, Witness.  Repeat again.  Can you ask your question?  Go on, Counsel.

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, JK312 had known you for a long time before April 7, 1994.  Am I correct?
A.	I said it; that is correct.
Q.	That morning he knew what you could do, that you could assist him and his family to escape the hands of death by the Hutus; is that correct?
A.	We came to an understanding and he had soldiers that protected him.  Our decision together is known, he came to my house and he found the family of eleven people in his home, those he was to bring were him and his children and his wife, together with the soldiers that were guarding him, and that could show that he was there, especially the soldiers that would be guarding him, and I was in Nkuli commune and the population didn't know how the soldiers would come to guard me.  The population wouldn't know how the soldiers would come to guard me and it was across to the road where everybody could see.  I could, therefore, bring him to my house and bring in even the soldiers.  The consequences would be dire.  Our understandings came to help him, that is the way I could help him.  I did what I could, especially that I was an ordinary citizen and I could do nothing else.  I even served him and he came to testify here.  He's very thankful  to the present day, including his own family.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was your question, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
My question was that morning JK312, who had known you for a long time, he answered yes.  That morning JK312 said that he wanted to -- JK312 knew what you could do, that you could assist him --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the question -- again, I rise reluctantly.  The questions that are being put are not precise.  I know we have problems with the Witness, but the question that is being asked elicited this type of a story concerning the whole background of how JK312 saved his life -- or he saved, I'm sorry, JK312.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can you repeat your question, Counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, JK312 knew that you could assist him and his family to escape the hands of death by the Tutsis -- Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We know the background that you have given.  What would you say to that question in precise terms, very briefly.
THE WITNESS:
I do not know whether the answer I provided was satisfactory, but I explained it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we want a precise answer.  We know the explanation and you have had time to repeat and mention him again.  What do you say to that question, in very brief terms?
THE WITNESS:
I advised her on how he could escape death.  I did it and it was successful.  That is how he was able to be carried by people who came to collect him and take him away and it happened and it was a success.  Thank you, very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The other part of the question, that he knew you could help.  What do you say to that?
THE WITNESS:
That's what I did.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He knew you could help.  Is it yes?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, indeed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And you, indeed, assisted by requesting for military escort for him and his family; isn't that correct?
A.	Finding soldiers to escort him.  I would like to repeat that question because where he was he was being guarded by soldiers.
Q.	How did you, then, assist him?
A.	I said it because I phoned my brother-in-law, who was a soldier, who himself requested the officer in charge of those soldiers to know that person's problem, and that's what he did.  And I also told him that they should come and take him on the (unintelligible) in the morning.  This is what happened, I can certify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you had good relations with the military in April -- before April 1994 and even in April 1994; isn't that correct?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	What was the position of your brother-in-law in the military?
A.	He was a chief warrant officer.
Q.	What was his name?
A.	His name was Nzabarusha LuPaul (phonetic).  I spell Nzabarusha, N-Z-A-B-A-R-U-S-H-A, Nzabarusha LuPaul, yes.
Q.	Was he in charge of any special unit in April 1994?
A.	He was a technician.  I'm sure he was commanding part of the soldiers since he was chief warrant officer, but I knew him as a technician.
Q.	A chief warrant officer was a low officer.  Chief warrant officer, is he not a low officer?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, what do you mean, low in rank?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Yes, low in rank, below lieutenant; am I correct?
A.	I don't know their ranks, how they follow each other.  It depends what job everybody has in the army.  Those people have their own training.  All I knew was that he was a technician.
Q.	Witness, if you could arrange for soldiers to escort somebody out of Nkuli commune on the morning of 7th April, you also had powers to mobilise the soldiers to go and kill Tutsis; am I correct?
A.	That is a lie.  It cannot be correct.
Q.	Prior to the seventh, Witness, you were moving about with some soldiers in your car; isn't that correct?
A.	You don't even have any of your witnesses who said it.  I don't know where you get that one from.  That one is wrong.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have answered the question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You were also moving about with Interahamwes, not your soldiers, Interahamwes and soldiers in your red Toyota deluxe car on the 7th of April 1994; isn't that correct?
A.	My vehicle was parked in my compound on the 7th April in 1990 (sic); so what you're saying is absolutely wrong.
Q.	Witness, on the 7th of April you testified that you did not go to Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.  I even gave evidence and that evidence came from Rwanda.
Q.	Why were people saying that they saw you in Byangabo, Nkuli, Busogo and Milyen Vano's (phonetic) compound at different times on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	You told those people to say it.  It's not correct because what they said, we analysed it, you told them to say so.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kajelijeli, as a witness you answer the question to Trial Chamber, if it is not true you say so.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the question, again, being --
THE WITNESS:
Thanks, Mr. President.
MR. HINDS:
The question being put to this Witness, my client, is why would people come here and say that you were at a certain place if you were not.  He has a right to say the reason why he believes these individuals would come here and lie.  He has a right to say that because that is a question asked of him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He can say that and address the issue to the Court, that's what we are saying.  He's free to say anything that he thinks is important, the Trial Chamber is following the proceeding and we are following the evidence.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, is my learned friend aware of what the Witness is saying, as an officer of the Court?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please, Counsel, proceed with your questioning.  Yes.  No, no, no, just listen to the question.
THE WITNESS:
Yesterday she says to the Defence and told him that I shouldn't look at him.  It looks as though when she says me, she means that I also face her to show that I respect her.  I'm sorry, but I have to look her in the face because if I don't face her she would think that I'm being in contempt but my heart is with you all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now the answer that you are giving are a dialogue between -- through her to the Trial Chamber, to the Court, so they should be addressed to the Court and we would like also to see your face.  It is also important to see your face, as well.
THE WITNESS:
Thanks very much, Mr. President.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, as a responsible citizen of Rwanda, former bourgmestre of Mukingo, you heard gunshots, as you testified; you heard explosions, as you testified; you knew that those gunshots were coming, also, from Mukingo commune where you had family and you sat there in Nkuli commune and did nothing.  Is that what you're telling the Court?
A.	What you are saying, I don't know where you got it from.  This is what I said.  I said that when I heard the gunshots from Kinigi, to say that it was coming from Mukingo on that morning of the 7th of April 1994 is incorrect.  Instead, what I said, that is authentic, is that from the direction of Kinyababa, near Gitwa in a place they call Rwankeri of 7th day Adventist church, from the direction of Mukemira, is what you said.  I don't know where you got it from.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that is said with regard to the account on these particular aspects.  We'll be taking a break at four, so you can organise how you wrap up your personal matter.
MS. OJEMENI:
Perhaps that is a competent time.  My question might take it over the break.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right. Any time frames, by way of indication only?
MS. OJEMENI:
Tuesday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take note of that.  We'll adjourn the proceedings for 15 minutes and come back and resume our work at quarter past four, quarter past four.  Until then these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court adjourned 1600H to 1620H)
MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Continue your cross-examination, counsel for      the Prosecution.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, on the morning of 7th April 1994 did you have soldiers guarding your house in Nkuli?
A.	I did not have any guard in my Nkuli home.
Q.	Witness, you testified that you learnt about the killing of Tutsis in the nun house in Mukingo commune on the same 7th of April 1994.  Am I correct?
A.	Yes, you are correct.
Q.	And according to you it was one nurse, Agnes, that told you in the afternoon of 7th April 1994.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is correct.
Q.	Why did you not rush home?  And I'm talking about home to Mukingo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.  I'm told no French translation came through, is not coming through, Interpreter. 

The last question, I think, in the English translation the substance, I learnt of the killing of the nuns convent on the 7th of April, Agnes told me, something like that, but this translation did not come through in French, according to Judge Ramaroson.
MS. OJEMENI:
(Unintelligible).
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we have the last answer?
MS. OJEMENI:
Do you still remember?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember the last answer?  It didn't come out in French.
MS. OJEMENI:
(Answer defeated by Interpreter's button)
THE WITNESS:
It would help me because I would need to understand the question, indeed.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You testified before it was Agnes who told you about the killing of Tutsis at the nuns house in Mukingo commune in the afternoon of 7th April 1994?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Now, Witness, my question is this: Why did you not race home to find out the condition of your family in Mukingo commune?
A.	Thank you very much.  I explained it, it was because of the security situation, according to what was happening all over the country.  After the death of the president and his companions I didn't trust the security situation on the way.
Q.	Witness, we are referring to your family.  You've testified that you're a considerate and humane man.  Are you telling this Court that in that circumstance, I mean given the unusual circumstance in the whole of Rwanda, where the safety of your family was in jeopardy you did not consider it important to go and find out their fate?
A.	I don't know why you say I didn't think about it.  I spent the whole night thinking about it and I was affected by the whole situation.  I thought throughout the night.  I actually spent the whole night thinking about my family and all the other people who had suffered and the suffering was continuing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you find it necessary to go and see and find out the state of their community in Mukingo commune, other than thinking about it?  That's the essence of her question.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I prepared myself.  I could not rush without knowing where I would be passing.  I thought it over and I prepared it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, you testified that you provided military escort for a family.  Why did you not consider it necessary to also request for military escort to take you to Mukingo to see your family and ascertain the state of their security?
A.	I don't know how you come about that.  This never happened.  What you are saying didn't -- I didn't even try to that effect.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Listen to the question carefully.  You don't understand it.  Could you repeat the question?
THE WITNESS:
I have understood the question, Mr. President, and I have answered.  What she has said is not correct.  I didn't give anybody any military escort.  It is wrong.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, let me rephrase it then.  You testified that you arranged with somebody in Kigali to organise a military escort for JK312 and his family for their escape from Nkuli commune.  Isn't that correct?
A.	This doesn't mean that I looked for soldiers.  But I said I phoned my brother-in-law and my brother-in-law arranged with the head of the gendarme, this head of the gendarme, he was the same who had sent those who are guarding JK312.  This was a standing arrangement, they were following their own arrangements.  I didn't have the power.  I only addressed myself to my brother-in-law because he is the husband to my wife and she was working for the soldiers.  We are seeking the truth in this Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, Witness, JK312 had gendarmes guarding him, according to your testimony.  He could not make this arrangement for his escape from Nkuli, he came to you and you arranged for it.  Why could you not do the same arrangement for yourself to see the condition of your family in Mukingo?
A.	If the reasons I have given you concerning my personal security following the calamity that had befallen the community, the death of the president and his companions, I had a lot of fear and I couldn't take such a decision before knowing the kind of consequences on taking such a risk.  I thought about this and this requires time and you have to be caution (sic) before you take action after thinking.
(Pages 69 to 77 by R. Lear)

	1630H
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, but counsel would like to know, even us would like to know why couldn't you make the kind of arrangement you made for your -- for JK312 to yourself, to enable you to go to Mukingo to find out the state of your family?
THE ACCUSED: 
	Thank you very much, Mr. President for asking me this question.  This JK was a Tutsi.  She was not -- he was not in the same condition as me, he was a Tutsi.  I was concerned about my family, yes, because of the RPF attack from Kinigi to Mukingo.  You can see that's difference from the situation following the death of the president. JK312 was afraid.  It was legitimate but it was different.  Me, I was, I had apprehension about me and my family, but the weight of his problem and mine, there was a difference and it is easy to understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel's question, we take note of that answer.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, if RPF, why would they spare your family?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Sorry.  What is the question, so that something was --?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	If RPF was after his life, why would they not come after his own life, why would they spare his family?
A.	You can make it a question and find an answer for it.  What I know is that some people were killed and their -- but the families were spared.  There are some people who are given names and they were even given communes to lead.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, who is Baheza in Mukingo commune?
A.	Baheza was as trader, a businessman who acted in Mukingo commune and in Mombasa.
Q.	In April 1994 --
MR. KIYEYEU: 
	If that name can be spelt My Lord.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
	Spelling of Baheza, B-A-H-E-Z-A, Baheza.  Mombasa.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, maybe Mombasa as well.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mombasa, M-O-M-B-A-S-A.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	In April 1994, Baheza had a filling station in Byangabo centre; is that correct?
A.	He had a petrol station at Byangabo but there was no petrol because he had to go and purchase petrol in Gisenyi.
Q.	Witness, you offered and bought petrol to fill the tanks that the Interahamwes used on the 7 of April 1994, in the afternoon of that day, isn't that correct?
A.	It is not correct, Mr. President.  There is enough evidence that contradicts what, what you say and this will be my evidence.
Q.	Witness, you were seen at Nkuli commune later that day in the evening at the canteen belonging to Karorero where you entertained Interahamwes on the 7 of April, 1994; is that correct?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Counsel, sorry before you answer, you heard Mukingo? 
MS. OJEMENI:
I said Nkuli.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Judge Ramaroson said she heard Mukingo as being said, yeah.  These things could be important.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I don't hear French.  English said Nkuli.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, I mean it's not that I'm asking -- I was addressing the translation system, not you.  Can you repeat your question please?
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, you were seen at the canteen belonging to Karorero in Nkuli communal office compound in the evening of 7th April 1994, where you entertained Interahamwes after they had killed the Tutsis at Kiyababa in Nkuli commune; isn't it that correct?
A.	It is not true.  Mr. President, because among the evidence given, there is a lot of proof that contradicts what the Prosecutor is saying.  We have that evidence.
Q.	Baheza was a very close ally of yours, and on the 7th of April 1994, you both rewarded the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune for a job well done in killing the Tutsis as you had instructed; isn't that correct?
A.	Your question is actually contradicting what you asked me a few minutes ago.  If you compare, you will find that there is self contradiction.  What you are saying is not true.  It is not true.  I wanted to give her reference.  It is clear and it is written.  It is not true.

MR. PRESIDENT:
 Maybe before we go on, there maybe new stenographers or recorders, can you again spell in particular the name Karorero?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Karorero, K-A-R-O-R-E-R-O, Karorero.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
BY PROFESSOR HINDS:
Q.	Witness, how far is Nkuli commune from Mukingo commune going by car how many minutes would it take you to get to Mukingo commune from Nkuli commune?
A.	I never counted, but I could estimate that there is about eight kilometres or nine kilometres.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	You said from Mukingo?
MS. OJEMENI:
From Nkuli to Mukingo commune.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	A person on a free day and correct me if I am wrong, will not take up to twenty minutes to get to Nkuli -- Mukingo commune from Nkuli commune -- Mukingo -- from Mukingo communal office, from 
	Nkuli-Mukingo, I mean from Nkuli communal office?
A.	I never counted it.  It might be 15 minutes or 30.  It depends if you are in a hurry or not, depending on how the road is, you -- it might be more.  It could be less.
Q.	Witness, on the 8th, you left your house to the Nkuli communal office; is that correct, in the morning?
A.	Can you repeat your question?
Q.	I am now addressing the 8th of April, and I am asking; if you left your house in the morning of that day to Nkuli commune, Nkuli communal office?
A.	It is not true.  I -- my journey was between 11:45 and 12 noon to go to Nkuli communal office.
Q.	That is still in the morning of the 8th?
A.	I do not know whether that is in the morning.  It was not exactly in the early morning.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, did you find it necessary to visit Kinyababa where you heard that Tutsis were killed that day of 8th before you went to Mukingo?
A.	I was exceptionally scared on that date, you know, following the death the president and his entourage.  I was exceptionally scared to hear that the préfet of Ruhengeri Préfecture had been killed and a colonel who was a native of Mukingo who perished with his family and the president of the first instance court of Kigali, Mr. Musabyimana, now when I noticed that the bourgmestre was out his wits, he was shocked.  He was under shock because of these tragedies.  It wasn't possible for me to go to Kinyababa cellule especially considering as I said that my security wasn't assured, anywhere there could gunshots from any direction.  I can't lie to you, I was afraid of getting there.  That time during the war anybody could get the opportunity to kill you and that would be end.  I had apprehension, I was afraid and this did not allow me to go there especially that criminals who -- criminals that had killed people there and myself I was target.  So I could not -- I did not manage to go there.
Q.	In your state of mind on the 7th of April was worse than what you have described, isn't that correct?
THE ACCUSED: 
	Mr -- Your Honour, Mr. President, I would like to inform you that where was my home in Nkuli, a big part of my neighbours, were relatives of Musabyimana De Gratio who was the chief of staff, I think.  All these people were close friends and we used to visit each other.  Even I personally knew the chief of staff there.  He was a native of Nkuli, the president of the republic; I do not know how to say this. There are many examples, I can illustrate this.  The way people who were crying here in Tanzania when the late president, whom we all respected, when President Nyerere died, that is how it was in that, in Ruhengeri.  Nobody felt at ease.  Nobody felt okay.  There were continuous tragedies.  The situation wasn't good and people, these people who accused me are not aware of the problems I had.  Many of the Tutsis who were killed were my friends.  I am lucky that some of those friends have survived.  I have to tell you that I was really in serious problems and so I had my family.  There are some mothers-in-law who are Tutsi, Tutsi women; I don't how you can get me mixed up with this.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We have, we have heard that account. I think it is on record.  So please tell us or answer the question as precisely as possible.  We have been through all these events.
THE ACCUSED: 
	That is correct, Mr. President.  I gave the answer.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, Counsel. 
MS. OJEMENI:
No, Your Honour, I asked a question that solicited, yes or no.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
And I can --
MR. PRESIDENT:
What was the question?
MS. OJEMENI:
I had asked, he had described his state of mind on the 8th on April 1994.  And I simply asked whether his state of mind was worse than what he had just described on the 7th of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before, before this, yes. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
On the 7th of April
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, again I rise reluctantly.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Please, very briefly.  Go on, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
If you want me to sit, I will sit.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	No, no.  Just say what you want to say. 
MR. HINDS:
I rise reluctantly.  The questions being put, asking the witness for his state of mind elicits exactly what we are getting; his state of mind.  I mean whether or not he sees he can answer the question of saying yes or no to his state of mind, I don't know, but the question elicits him describing his state of mind which then goes to all that was there.  I too would like to get out of here as soon as possible but the questions that are being put, elicit the answers that we are getting.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question with yes or no, your state of mind that you've described of 
8th April 1994 was worse than your state of mind on the 7th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	I got worse on the 8th of April because I heard of more tragedies.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	How you were able, Witness, to note the time of the - the activities you have recounted that you did on 7th April 1994?  How did you manage to put time to each activity, giving your state of mind?
THE ACCUSED:
Your Honour, Mr. President, if what the Prosecutor accepts as I said it, she should realise that I was in  serious trouble up to this day.  Every time I mentioned time, I said I was only estimating the time.  I did not check my watch every time, and I was listening to the radio, and news came according to an ordinary timetable that's why I was able to estimate the time because at such a time there was an announcement and there was news at such other time.  This is how I happened to remember the hours, and during that period of tragedies a lot of things remained in the mind.  I may be wrong about other things but not on dates and time. 
Q.	Now, Witness, on the 8th you went to Mukingo commune according to what is your testimony and you went first to see the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	Why did you not go to your family first to ascertain the state of security before going to the Mukingo commune?
A.	This was because of the following reasons:  One, in Mukingo commune, there was fighting between the Rwanda army and the RPF.  We heard the gunshots and explosions from Nkuli.  When we were in Nkuli, there has been a lot of evidence given on how the fighting was at that time.  I couldn't continue to Rwinzovu where my home was before seeking an explanation on how the situation was and I was able to give this in evidence to this Chamber.  The reason why I went to see the bourgmestre was that I wanted to take away my family and this could have a consequence.  Many people would run away especially that there explosions of bombs being heard.  I couldn't do that without the knowledge of the bourgmestre.  Sometimes leaders, you could have, you could have accused me of causing him troubles in that commune.   It was a matter of asking him if one could reach that particular area he knew where the fighting was taking place.  He knew also the soldiers who were going and coming from the warfront, and that's why before going to see my family, I had to comply with the rule and, I couldn't, you know, do as I wanted in a commune that wasn't mine.  I had to be very careful so that nobody should accuse me of telling people to run away following the departure of my family members.  That is exactly what happened.  This is the truth.
Q.	Now, Witness, is it your evidence that you were feared in Mukingo commune and in order to exonerate yourself from whatever accusation that might be levied against you, you had to go see the bourgmestre first?
A.	To say that I was -- that people feared me, that is something you are -- you are adding on.  Usually the fear wicked people, criminals, normally people have to respect the law.  If you go to a commune, you have to see the leader.  I could not take a decision of taking away my family.  First of all, I wanted to know how the security was in general and to tell him what I was going to do.  I had no reason to hide from him and he explained to me how he saw it and what the consequences were.  Now, when you claim that I was a wicked person feared by people, it is not correct.
Q.	Is it then fair to say that you could have -- if you didn't see the bourgmestre, you would have been accused of influencing people to leave the commune, as you've testified in your -- I mean, as you testified in response to my question?
A.	If it was that what you have just said, I do not know what the consequences would have been, but the bourgmestre would not have been happy with it.  To say that this would have happened, I don't know how you can justify it.  It didn't take place, it's not good therefore to confirm that never took place and you know that it's no good to make up a story to say that you are giving a hypothetical question, but I don't know what would have happened, especially that did not take place.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, you have just testified that if you didn't see the bourgmestre he would have accused you of creating trouble in his commune, in your commune?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, that is not the testimony, he could have, perhaps.  There is difference between would and could.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, is it fair for me -- you have just testified that if you didn't see the bourgmestre you could have been accused of causing trouble in his commune?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I think there was something more than that.  It has to do with the whole -- what he said; moving out his family and that kind of thing and what possible effect it could have and you know, this kind of thing that could arise in that kind of situation in the way he put it.
MS. OJEMENI:
I'll drop that now.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Now, Witness, why did you spend 15 minutes or thereabout in your home when you visited on that 8th of April 1994?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Where?
MS. OJEMENI:
Mukingo, we are in Mukingo.
THE ACCUSED: 
	What I said wasn't rightly recorded.  I said that I spent 15 minutes with my parents.  So what you said is not correct. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you didn't spend up to an hour, you spent about thirty minutes from your testimony, that's what you testified.  Why did you not spend at least an hour with your family when you visited on the 8th of April 1994?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  I do not know whether you recorded properly the reasons I gave, but in order to explain better, I said after talking with my family, as I testified, I wished to ensure that my acquaintances should not come and find me at home which would have caused -- which would have caused some negligence, some  carelessness.  They might have come to converse with me, but when I did not want to stay for a long time, I did not want to attract attention of the neighbourhood and I wanted, you know, the people for whom I wished to have security were not there and I had talked enough with the family.  I did not find it necessary to stay long. The important thing was that there should security and the hidden people should stay where they were.  I could even have spent less time than what I spent there, what I wanted was to ensure the security of certain people. So you should take it that way.  I used the time that was required; I didn't waste any time there.
Q.	Witness, when did RPF take over Mukingo commune?
A.	It captured the Mukingo commune on the 13th July 1994.
Q.	And we are talking about the 8th of April 1994?
A.	On that day, the RPF didn't capture the Mukingo commune.
Q.	Why were you then scared that your safety in Mukingo was in jeopardy on that 8th? 
MR. HIND:
It has been answered over and over again by this witness why he was scared on that day, in terms of his personal security.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is premised from the capturing of Mukingo in July and that on the 8th, the RPF, according to the witness had not captured the -- had not captured Mukingo.  So I think that is the substance of your question.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my learned friend has already tainted the witness and it is unfortunate.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I said, asked and answered.  I did not elaborate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.
MS. OJEMENI: 
	You did.
MR. HINDS:
I said asked and answered.
MS. OJEMENI:
You said for personal reasons, for security reasons you said.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	All right, you can move on if you do not want to, otherwise you could if you so wish to follow up, if you so wish or you could move on.
MS. OJEMENI:
My learned friends understands as exactly what he is doing, Your Honour.  Can I move on?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Go on.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question, given the fact Mukingo commune was not besieged by the RPF, why did you spend a few minutes with your family and left on the 8th of April 1994?
A.	I don't understand why you put the answers I gave you.  I told you that on that day on the 8th, my security was in danger, and that I found people who were in trouble whose security was in jeopardy.  If people had known that those people were there, I would have been killed and they would have been killed.  If you have heard, you have been to Rwanda many times you've heard how many people are massacred, Tutsis as well as their Hutu friends.  I'm not going to go back a lot but there was a lot of trouble for Hutus, including myself.  They were calling me an accomplice of Tutsis.  I don't regret it.  God will reward me for it.  I want to tell you that on that day, RPF had a lot of fighting in Mukingo where there were the Rwanda Armed Forces and the RPF was in Kinigi commune, even there were bombs in Ruhengeri.  There was the shelling of Ruhengeri town.  There are cassettes concerning that day.  I know that you have them, cassettes, video cassettes, I know it.
Q.	Now, Witness, you were regarded as an accomplice of the RPF of the Hutus, sorry of the Tutsis as you have testified and you have heard that Tutsis were massacres at the nuns' convent not too far from your house and you did not visit the nuns' convent on that day, you visited Mukingo on the 8th of April 1994; isn't that correct?
A.	I think that when one, when you went to Mukingo commune, you saw, you witnessed yourself that where the convent is and parish, the Mukingo parish and the road to Rwinzovu the distance between these two, considering the situation, I was not able to visit that area but I said yesterday that I went to mass and asked the priest what had happened and that is how I noticed how the convent glass had been broken.  What you said is not true.   I really -- I was concerned by these things and I followed it up.  Thank you.
Q.	Witness, why did you wait until the day of the mass to go and pay your respect for the dead, the Tutsis that died at the convent?
A.	We prayed for them at the Church, I do not know why you said it was at the convent.  I did not say the day and the date when we conducted these prayers, I do not know where you got that information from.
Q.	It is a convent, isn't it?  I am referring to the Tutsis that were killed at the nuns' house; I said why did you wait until there was a mass in honour of the victims, Tutsi victims of the killing that took place at the nuns' house on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	I think you are mixing up issues.  I don't know where you got that information.  I didn't say that I left home on the 7th and the mass was not conducted on the 7th.  Why don't you ask me whether I prayed for the Hutus who had died here?  It's not according to the Rules of Procedure, it's not for Hutus and Tutsis.  We prayed for the dead in general.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Is that a problem of translation or what?
MS. OJEMENI:
I think so, Your Honour.  Maybe I will repeat my question, maybe that way he will understand.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, you have testified - Witness, you testified that you did not visit the nuns' house where Tutsis were killed on the 7th of April 1994 until the day mass was conducted at the Parish of Busogo in honour of the dead.  And my question is why did you not consider it important to go and inspect what happened at the nuns' house before the mass or before the day of the mass?
A.	In my evidence, I told you that, would you repeat the date I told you when mass took place?
Q.	You tell me the date, please?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	When did the mass take place?
THE ACCUSED: 
	It took place on Sunday, the Sunday after -- the Sunday after the tragedy, if I am not mistaken, it could have been on 16th of April.  We went to mass.  We prayed for Hutus and for Tutsis and I, particularly, prayed for Tutsi who were my friends.  I still have those friends in Rwanda.  What the Prosecutor is not saying is not right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Counsel's question is that why didn't you go earlier than that to visit the nuns' convent where Tutsis were killed.  That is the question that counsel is putting to you.
THE ACCUSED: 
	I did not do so because I knew that the nuns had been transported to Rwaza by the bishop along with Tutsis who had survived.  I did not do so because, in short, Your Honour, what I found was proper, there is money that is given in church for a service, for a funeral service.  It is turn -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We are dealing with the question of your -- a question with regard to you, why you did not visit the nuns' convent earlier than the day you went for the prayers, for the victims including the Tutsis as you put it and other people?
THE ACCUSED: 
	The time I found appropriate was to go to pray for them.  There was nobody at the convent.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:  
Q.	Witness, where were you in Ruhengeri on the 8th of April searching for Rachel?
A.	Thank you for putting this question to me.  It's a good question.  Your witness who said that Rachel was being sought out on the 8th told you a lie, it is not true.  We have evidence, I even mentioned them either yesterday or the day before, I told you that Rachel was in Kigali, we have evidence showing that Rachel's house was destroyed on the 7th, there are records and a file on this and there are people who are being pursued for this.  Therefore, Counsel, the 8th that you were told by your witness, he lied to you, there are records on this and some of your witnesses contradicted each other and said that Rachel died in Europe.  So you have helped me to clarify this and when Rachel left, I am one of the people assisted him by giving her travel documents to go for treatment in Kigali.   Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, if Rachel came back to Rwankeli in April 1994, before April 1994, could you have known?
A.	When I was carrying out my activities or even when I was able to go and visit my home in Rwinzovu, there is no way I could not have known because the road that I was taking passed near her home.  

Secondly, another thing the reason why what you are saying is baseless is because what I have just told you concerning Rachel's home has a case file in Rwanda.  There is a case on this in Rwanda.  So you cannot change this, you cannot find other reasons or other statements.  It couldn't be -- you can't just make it.
Q.	What is the case number, Witness, in Rwanda?
A.	I take a pen and note the file number, just get a pen and I will tell you the file number.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The number you are giving not to her but to the Trial Chamber.  There is no personal engagement here, if you know it.
THE ACCUSED: 
	Thank you, Your Honour.  Some times I have problems and forget when she is the one asking questions, I forget.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Just answer the question.  We are running out time, we don't have the time for extra words.
THE ACCUSED: 
	RMP: 39597/S4:
MR. PRESIDENT:
Colon?
THE ACCUSED: 
	PROR, then P-R-O-R.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now, whose case file is this?
A.	That is the -- what you are accusing me is included in this case file and this, this is a joint case of all of the people in the positions that were made.  Those -- if you allow us you will find statements in this case, this statement, I have to say this and you refused to give us the statements of these people and you have them and this is the truth and you are hiding it and you are an accomplice in this.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I want the question answered --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Because every case has a name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, do you have any name for this case, for this file number: IRP/39597S4: PROR?  What's the name, do you have -- these are not -- what name do you have?  One of the names of the people concerned or any other names that it has, do you know.
THE ACCUSED: 
	Your Honour, it is very easy if she allows me.  You are limiting me and yet it is a very important case where my interests, where it involves my interests because all the accusations she is charging me concerning her witnesses who came to testify against me wrongfully, it is a case file of 31 persons, this file concerns one such person, the report dated 23rd February 2001, that was prepared by an official of the ministry of justice named Rwiseganya, Vincent.  She will see this and she will give us the statement that we wish, insisting on this, from the depth of my defence, I have -- I don't have to hide the list, it is my life that is at stake and the spelling Rwiseganya, R-W-I-S-E-G-A-N-Y-A, Rwiseganya, Vincent.
Q.	It is just a report prepared, not a name of a file.
A.	It was a joint case, this is when you see this, you will see other case files and the people who are being accused and the people who are bringing these charges.  I think I am helping you in my case file, I think you have heard what my witnesses said and from what they said you fabricate what your witnesses will say.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, he mentioned that this case file is for people and maybe if he can mention the people, because I am sure that if this an officer in the ministry of justice, he must have dealt with a lot of files, if he knows.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you know any names, Witness?
THE ACCUSED: 
	It includes her witnesses, their statements.  It also includes prisoners, people who are detained in Rwanda the charges against them and the people they are accused of and then she turns this, these charges against me and what these people said is clear, this is a very serious problem, 
Your Honour.  I think you should take this opportunity to know what she hid from you, from the statements she should have given us because this case file includes the statements that we have been asking for.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Okay. Go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, we are still on the 8th.  You testified that you went home at about 3:00 and watched video; is that correct?
A.	Can you repeat the question, Counsel?
Q.	You testified that on the 8th you went home at 3:00 p.m. your home in Nkuli commune and you watched a video with the family; isn't that your testimony?
A.	Yes, that's what I said in my testimony.
Q.	You have also testified that you were scared, you were not yourself, the country was in a state of insecurity and you found it necessary or convenient to watch video with your family; is that correct?
A.	The way you are putting it, I had children who were on holidays, who were watching this video, I was following the news, the fact that I have following what they were watching does not mean that I was happy.  You should not -- the problems that I have should not affect my children.  We should try to find a way for distracting them.  The will be -- that is the way you should it, see but the way you are turning it around, I can see where you are leading.  That is not proper.  I was not happy with the situation in which I was and you know what you are saying, I lost so many people and you are putting this in this tone and turning it around.
Q.	Witness, we are talking of the state of emergency where even a child will know what is going on around him or her.  Are you telling this Court that your house did not project in any way that there was problem in Rwanda?  Is that what you are saying?
A.	We did not have a television.  That is what I should inform you.  We didn't have a television station.  We had tapes, various tapes, but we did not have a television, a TV Station in order for the children to know what is happening, to see what was happening in Rwanda apart from hearing it over the radio.
Q.	But, you have just testified that there were gunshot, explosions the previous day around Nkuli, within Nkuli, are you saying the kids, the children in the house did not hear that as well?
A.	What you are saying is not correct.  I just mentioned of gunshots gunfire in Nkuli.  I never mentioned of bombs, bombs explosions.  Another thing is that if you wish to ask them, some of them disappeared, you can ask them.  Me, I am testifying as myself because I have been accused and I can testify to what I saw and heard that day but there were no bomb explosions heard in Nkuli that day.
Q.	I take it that the bomb explosions you are right that you actually testified on gunshots.  So let's talk about gunshots now.  Are you saying the children, your children did not hear the gunshots and there is no sign of what was happening, of the situation of Rwanda on the 7th of April in your house?
A.	I do not know where you are getting this because this was what I said. I said that they were hearing and they were also listening to the radio.  So I do not know where you are getting this.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	It is the interpretation of your evidence, there was gunshot, that you said you heard and the kids could have heard.  Okay?  Now, in that prevailing situation, you said you watched video, isn't it?
THE ACCUSED: 
	The children were watching video and I also watched it as I was listening to the news on the radio, but the fact that I watched it does not mean that I was happy because I heard - I sense what you meant.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You watched video as well.  Now, counsel's question is based on that. Can you listen to it carefully and we would like to got your precise answer whichever answer you think you want to give, we would like to understand you.  Listen very carefully.  Can you put back your question?
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, giving the state of the security of the emergency, the state of emergency prevailing in Rwanda on the 7th of April 19 -- on the 8th of April 1994, are you telling this Court that you watched video with your children and that even your children did not know what was happening in Rwanda?
A.	That is not correct.  My children watched video and they also followed the news as I would do, but the fact that saying that they did not know what happening in Rwanda, the prevailing conditions in Rwanda is not true.  They were listening to the radio just like the rest of us.  So it was something unusual of course, but I expected that and we were not happy at all.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, we take note of that answer.
MS. OJEMENI:
I'll continue, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we would be stopping at half past five and you can wrap up your question.
MS. OJEMENI:
On that question, yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	You also testified, Witness, that you lost an in-law, your wife was sick, and you, Witness, as a considerate man, humane a loving husband, left alone your wife -.
MR. HINDS:
Objection.  Objection Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
I think that the Prosecutor should just simply just put here question.  Mr. Kajelijeli never said that he was loving husband.  I mean the -- all of these statements that are attributable to him, if she wants to quote him the proper thing for her to do is to quote what he said.

MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I take that back, looking at the time.
MR. HIND:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:  
Q.	Witness, you have testified that you are a considerate and humane person, how do you then explain the fact take your wife was ill on the 8th of April 1994 and wanted you to assist her by taking her to hospital and you asked her to go on her own, on foot, that you were tired?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  That was never his testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, there was a question of going on foot by the wife, you let her go on foot.
MR. HINDS:  
	But I think the Prosecutor is again, I am objecting as to form if you want to put a question, it must be accurate.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yeah, there was certain mention of going on foot.
MR. HINDS:
But that, but that is not the issue.  She cannot just simply whatever comes to her head and say, it must be accurate and what she is saying this witness never said.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Can you check, can you check what the proper formulation of that part of the evidence you want to refer to, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, if I have to read that it is too long.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just the substance of it.
MS OJEMENI: 
I am not mischaracterising this witness's testimony.  In summary -- 
MR. HINDS:
Come, Counsel, it was not the 8th.  So try to get it from there, it was not the 8th.
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay.  I take that correction then and I will check.  Your Honour, maybe I'll stop here then and I will take it up on Monday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We are addressing the question of his wife being taken to hospital.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Or his wife going to hospital.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Or I am still on the 8th and I have been corrected that it was actually what he said on the 8th. So I will check on that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can check on that.  Okay.  All right.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am sure Your Honours; I won't take all that long on Tuesday.  I am winding up.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
All right.  So we will stop here and adjourn these proceedings to Tuesday.  All right, we adjourn these proceedings to Tuesday, 22nd April 2003, Tuesday, next Tuesday.
MR. HINDS:
As there a holiday somewhere along the way?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have, tomorrow is Good Friday and then we have Easter Monday on then.  We resume our work after the Easter Monday.  Yes, yes, the Accused, of course having made the solemn declaration, you take note of that.  So we will adjourn these proceeding to Tuesday 22nd of April when we'll come and continue the testimony of this witness, the accused testifying on his own behalf in cross-examination by the Prosecutor.  So until then, Monday, I am sorry, until Tuesday at 9:00 o'clock, these proceedings stand adjourned.  
(Court adjourned at 1735)
