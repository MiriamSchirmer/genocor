P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 13th of March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Appearances are the same.  

Mr. Sow, anything to report this morning?  I notice Mr. Karemera is present in court.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  As you have noticed, Mr. Karemera is present this morning.  I'd like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that Mr. Karemera is facing the same problems as far as his leg is concerned.  He told me, Mr. President, with regard to the transcripts, he did not receive last Friday's transcript.  

As far as the physiotherapy is concerned, since Wednesday, the physiotherapist has not been, and Mr. Karemera made me aware of his undertaking to be present here at all costs.  But I'd like to tell you that perhaps in the course of the day, from time to time, he might have to go to the next room if he is unable to bear the pain.  I think at one point, since the physiotherapist did not arrive, he had to make use of the cream he was provided with to do his own physiotherapy.  

And as I had already pointed out, Mr. President, it is extremely important that, for posterity, he should be better taken care of and that it should be noted that the poor health care Mr. Karemera has received is likely to destabilise him, and as well as to harm the case of the Defence.  As you are aware, he has made a great effort to be here this morning, but you also know that he is in pain.  Against this background, it is important, Mr. President, for the Court to issue directives to ensure that its previous orders are complied with.  

Earlier on, I had made an application to the Court, requesting that Dr. Maya from Moshi should put forward a written report to the Court and for Mr. Karemera to have access to his medical file.  I believe that this would ensure, if such measures were taken, that we would no longer have to raise this issue in court, an issue that I feel is important, given what has happened at the ICTY in the case of President Milosevic.  I think it is very important that these measures should be taken.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  We note what you've said, and as I indicated on Friday, we are considering how to respond to the applications you made, and as soon as we have come to a decision, we will let you know how we proceed to approach it.  

We welcome back Mr. Karemera to the trial and hope that he will be able to sit through the remainder of this week, because I think that our trial session will not be going beyond Friday and it may very well be that it might come to an end earlier than Friday of this week.  So there's not much more to go before this trial session ends.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention, Your Honour, that we at the Prosecution end have had sight of the helpful argument filed by Steven Kay in the Milosevic case on the 2nd of April 2005 on the trial in absentia, and I know that Your Honours will have read that carefully.  I'm familiar with this material.  The only thought that the Prosecution proposes to offer now is simply that, as I think Your Honours know, the position of President Milosevic is different to the position of Mr. Karemera because he, Milosevic, insisted on representing himself and, therefore, in court did not have a lawyer of his choice to assist him, to argue his position, to listen to the evidence, to advise him.  And the position of Steven Kay and his assistant, Gillian Higgins, and Professor McCormack were -- was that, initially, they were amicus curiae, with Kay and Higgins later being deemed assigned counsel, but the Trial Chamber always recognised that the position that they were in was they were not formally representing the defendant.  They were assisting the Court, to ensure that the defendant's rights were not overlooked, but they were not in receipt of instructions and they were not in communication with the defendant, discussing with him what was taking place in court.  That, of course, made a significant difference in the mind of the Tribunal at the ICTY with regard to trial in absentia.  Basically, he was representing himself, and if he wasn't present, in those circumstances, the proceedings could not continue.  

We don't propose to say any more.  It's a helpful summary of the trial in absentia position, but it is distinguishable from the Milosevic case because Mr. Karemera has a lawyer of his own choice to represent his interests.  I hope that's of assistance.  We're not looking for a ruling, we're just offering the thought. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not in a position to give a ruling right now because we recognise that it is necessary to consider this issue carefully, to give a ruling which may have long-term effect on the future conduct of the trial.  So we will not rush into giving a ruling immediately.  But we will -- we are considering it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm not going to respond substantively at this point.  I know it wouldn't be useful to you.  But I would like to think that maybe if there was some time at the end of this week for us to have a status conference, that we could maybe discuss the long-term prospects for a trial.  

I also just want to let you know that Mr. Nzirorera also has physical problems, and in light of what happened with Milosevic over the weekend, I think it's the Trial Chambers' duty, you have to take care of these people that are in custody, and a long trial such as this may not be the best way to do that.  So I would like to have a chance maybe to discuss that with you sometime, if we have time this week.  Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I did not understand Mr. Morley's intervention, given that the Chamber had promised that it would set up a debate on the issue before it could take a decision.  It would allow us to exchange.  Therefore, that intervention seems to me inappropriate, as we are required to wait for the Chamber to invite us to present our submissions on the matter.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I, too, would like to say how much Mr. Morley's intervention seems inappropriate to me.  One of the main differences between our trial and Mr. Milosevic's is that Mr. Milosevic is no longer there to defend himself in this regard.  I'd like to draw the Court's attention to the fact that already -- more than four years ago we drew the Court's attention to the fact that if ever the Accused were to face health problems in their cells, they are in no position to call for help in their cells.  There is no alarm system, which is a source of concern for us, and most legitimate.  I'd just like to remind the Court of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We had not, in fact, intended to hear oral arguments on this matter.  Mr. Robinson had presented a written argument, written material for us, and I had asked the Prosecutor if they wished to have an opportunity to respond to it.  Now, in view of what you have said, Mr. Sow and Mr. Weyl, did you also want an opportunity to put forward any written submissions on this matter, or written material for us to consider?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, if that is the procedure agreed to by the Chamber, I can present a motion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Not a motion; it's not a formal motion.  Mr. Robinson presented some reference material, jurisprudence, case law.  It wasn't actually a case, but it was the legal brief, as far as I can gather, that was used in presenting the argument, so it was a judicial reference for our consideration.  
The Prosecutor has made a very brief response to that, saying that there's a distinguishable point, and if you wanted to submit material for our consideration -- it's not really a formal motion we are looking for, but if you had material that you wanted to submit for our consideration, to assist in the final decision that we take, we'd have given you some time to do it.  I wasn't really inviting a formal motion or anything of that nature.  But you don't have to respond now because, as I mentioned, we will not be ruling immediately.  So you have some time to think about what you'd like to do.  
MR. SOW:
Understood, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we have also understood, and we will inform you of our observations in the next few days.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, are you ready?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President, I am ready.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony will now continue and you'll have to respond to Ms. Hounkpatin, the lawyer representing Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

Ms. Hounkpatin, you may proceed.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS UB,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	Good morning, Witness UB.  I am Chantal Hounkpatin.  I am Mr. Ngirumpatse's counsel.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	So we will continue cross-examination with questions that I would like you to clarify, following the questions and answers you have already provided in cross-examination by Mr. Nzirorera's counsel, my friend Robinson.  I would, in my cross-examination, like to reprise issues that you did not clearly clarify in the answers you gave.  So I would like to start by, first of all, putting questions to you about your activities as a conseiller.  I would therefore like to know the year in which you began to hold office as a conseiller.  
A.	I took up the post of conseiller in********. 
Q.	Very well.  In*******, how did one become a conseiller?  
A.	To become a conseiller, one had to be elected by the population.  After that, one had to be sworn in, and automatically became conseiller in the secteur in which he had been elected. 
Q.	Can you remind me of the secteur in which you were elected? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I think that would need to be in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Ms. Hounkpatin, we have just -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Very well, I will not go beyond this point, although the question has been put out already.  So I will ask another question to avoid engaging in a public debate.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	So I'd like you to tell me -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, do you have any -- if you have any part of your cross-examination which must be in closed session, we would prefer if you could combine all of your closed session issues to prevent going in and out of closed session, and you can do it now or later on, at the end of your cross-examination.  But we would prefer if you could group your closed session questions together.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, I quite understand, Mr. President.  And, in fact, I was trying to ask questions that would ensure that we would not keep coming in and out of closed session, and this question was an oversight.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So, Witness UB, I'd like you to tell me what exactly your functions were.  
A.	The functions of a conseiller de secteur include coordination of all activities of the population and reporting to higher authorities, that is, the committee, the communal assembly, which assembly considers the report and forwards it to the bourgmestre.  Some decisions are taken, if necessary, at the secteur level.  He has to act as an intermediary, a go-between, between the communal council and the population.  By coordination of activities, I mean development activities.  He is also to report on those activities to higher authorities, the decision-making bodies.  
Q.	Can you tell me -- or, rather, give me a concrete example of an activity that you coordinated? 
A.	We would try to inventory all activities taken or carried out in the secteur and make a report to the bourgmestre or préfet.  We could speak of building of schools or other development projects in concrete terms.  And all of this falls within the ambit of conseiller's activities. 

If threats are posed in the secteur as a conseiller, one has to react.  Security reports mentioned the security situation in the secteur.  When I spoke of building of schools, there are various social activities involved at secteur level, and the conseiller regularly reported to the bourgmestre and other higher authorities.  So security would be one of the main issues, development of the population, as well as social welfare of that population. 
Q.	Very well.  Can you give us an estimate, on a weekly basis, how many hours did you devote to that activity? 
A.	According to the rules in force, the conseiller is to coordinate his activities at least twice a week at the secteur office.  However, in practice, the conseiller was to manage the daily situation of the secteur.  As a matter of fact, the conseiller is not entitled to holidays.  Whether he is at home or at the office, the population can appeal to the conseiller, can come to see him.  And if he does not find a solution to their problems, he can refer them to the higher authorities.  Therefore, when one is conseiller, one is always responsible for whatever happens at any point in time, whenever an event occurs.  One is constantly working. 
Q.	Therefore, you mean you had a full-time job and it was permanent? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would counsel please observe a pause between question and answer, or answer and question?  
THE WITNESS:
Every time there was a need or a need arose and one had to take action, one did so.  When something was not right, one had to work.  As conseiller, one is vigilant over the secteur in the same way one watches over one's own household.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Could one say that you were very well acquainted with the secteur in which you were operating?  
A.	Indeed, given the number of years I worked in that capacity, I knew my secteur very well.  Moreover, all conseillers were perfectly acquainted with their respective secteurs. 
Q.	Are you one of the rare examples of conseillers who managed to hold their post for such a long span of -- large span of time? 
A.	Yes, I'm one of the few conseillers who held that post for a long time in ***********commune.  
Q.	Was your work remunerated?  Were you receiving a salary?  
A.	In fact, according to the regulations, we did not receive salaries, but we did receive allowances.  This was the legal provision. 
Q.	Can you tell us how the allowance system operated?  
A.	The allowance was instituted, or introduced, by a law and allowances were defined or set out, but a commune or préfecture could give an additional allowance to the conseiller on top of the one provided by law.  Every month there was an allowance, an amount that was known and which was given to every conseiller in the country.  
Q.	This leads me to ask you:  Was there a difference in the payments being given to conseiller at your level or did everyone receive the same amount across the board?  
A.	I told you there was an allowance under the law, and this was the same amount for everyone, but in the city of Kigali, they received an additional allowance that was assessed based on the conseiller's performance.  It, therefore, depended on decisions of the préfectoral committee or préfectoral council or the communal council.  So their decisions were based on the conduct of the conseiller in question, based on his performance. 
Q.	Based on this allowance you received with supplementary or additional gratuity supplemented by the Kigali préfecture, did you consider yourself as a person who was in a favourable social position? 
A.	Even when we held the post of conseiller, we could attend to other activities if we wanted to, because we were not civil servants.  You are wondering if I was satisfied in the area where I was.  Well, my answer would be yes, because I always stood and I was always re-elected by the population, and so I was satisfied with the situation.  
Q.	Earlier on, when describing your functions, you mentioned the role or the duty to maintain security.  Can you go into detail about the function of maintaining security in your secteur?  
A.	Maintaining security did not mean that the conseiller was acting as a policeman or a gendarme.  But we would give recommendations to members of the population to ensure that they lived harmoniously with their neighbours.  That is what we did to maintain security.  When a member of the population became difficult to handle, we would call on the relevant services.  That is what we did, and that was what obtained in our secteur. 
Q.	Can you tell me if, in your capacity as conseiller de secteur, you disposed of policemen or gendarmes with whom you could work on a regular basis? 
A.	No.  A conseiller did not dispose of gendarmes or policemen.  The policemen were based at the préfecture and the gendarmes were based in their brigades, therefore, the conseiller did not have policemen within the secteur.  When we appealed to the préfet, when we could not handle an individual, we would call on the policemen or gendarmes to arrest him.  Otherwise, the conseiller did not have at his disposal policemen or gendarmes to assist him in his duties. 
Q.	I have difficulty understanding how your activity involving maintenance linked with the préfecture.  When you noticed an offence had been committed in practice, what actually happened?  
A.	There were policemen at the préfecture office and other departments of the prosecutor's office.  As a matter of fact, it was different from the situation in rural communes or areas.  When an offence was committed, we could call on any security authority, the nearest one.  It could be a gendarmerie brigade or policemen.  In fact, when we say "maintenance of security", the conseiller was required to monitor the situation in his secteur closely and call on security organs responsible for security. 
Q.	Was there a police station in the secteur where you were conseiller?  
A.	The policemen did not have a camp, exactly.  They lived or resided in various secteurs, but when they were in their cellules or secteurs, they were not responsible for guarding the population.  They worked -- or they lived in various secteurs but were based at the préfecture office. 
Q.	Can you specify -- or, rather, explain if the function of conseiller, which you have just described and which you had been holding since 1982, is unchanged -- or, rather, whether it remained unchanged with the advent of the multiparty system?  
A.	When the single-party system prevailed, the conseiller was at the same time president of the MRND in the secteur.  The same went for bourgmestre and préfet at their levels.  Now, with the advent of the multiparty system, the conseiller merely worked on administrative issues relating to the locality he was in charge of.  He no longer had any dealings with his party. 
Q.	So there was a clear distinction, separation, between the administrative function, on the one hand, and political activities of the conseiller, on the other hand?  
A.	Yes, there was a separation because each party had a president or chairman in its secteur.  Therefore, the conseiller's functions with the coming of the multiparty system were no longer held jointly with any other party responsibilities. 
Q.	With the advent of the multiparty system, was the conseiller now holding the status of a civil servant? 
A.	From the start he was never considered a party official at the request of the party, the single party.  I don't know how to put it.  It was a party state.  I don't know if you could say that.  So the conseiller was not commissioned to hold other posts.  I would not say he was controlled by a party.  But when the multiparty system came into being, he was considered an administrative official who, however, had nothing to do or had no dealings with any party. 
Q.	It is important for me to understand the concept of civil servant, fonctionnaire.  So I'd like to insist on this question.  It is obvious that with the coming of the party -- multiparty system, you became an administrative official.  
A.	Yes.  With the coming of multi-party politics, I was a civil servant. 
Q.	And whatever your political beliefs, whatever the political party you belonged to, you were under a professional obligation, like any other administrative official? 
A.	Yes, that was the practice. 
Q.	Now, I would like to ask you how, since you explained in your examination-in-chief and also in cross-examination that you submitted reports, what was the content of those reports, first of all? 
A.	When we say security reports, that entails any activity taking place in the secteur, whether these were positive or negative actions.  We had to take stock of everything that happened in the secteur and report that to higher authorities. 
Q.	And in your capacity as a conseiller, who was the higher authority, who or what?  
A.	The higher authority was the bourgmestre.  He was in charge of the commune, and we also must add the préfet who was in charge of the préfecture.  
Q.	So, at no point in time in your capacity as conseiller -- and here I am focusing on the period running from the advent of multiparty politics.  So at no point in time were your reports forwarded to MRND party structures?  
A.	I was not supposed to report to the MRND on activities taking place in the secteur.  
Q.	Are you able to tell me what was the pace of your report submission from October 1990?  
A.	From October 1990, reports were daily.  We were supposed to submit reports to the higher authorities I mentioned. 
Q.	In 1991, did it continue with that frequency? 
A.	From October 1990, these reports were still drawn up and submitted to relevant authorities.  If even one report was missing, we were punished.  So we had to ensure that the reports were drawn up and submitted. 
Q.	So from October 1990 to the end of the period in question, July 1994, you drew up daily reports of which you kept a copy -- let me finish my question -- of which you would keep copies?  
A.	Yes, that was the case.  
Q.	Which must amount to thousands of pages?  
A.	Yes.  In fact, every day a piece of paper -- a paper had to be produced, so it must be thousands of papers.  I'm not in a position to tell you the exact number. 
Q.	We will refrain from calculating that.  But there are 365 days in a year.  If we multiply that by the number of years, we could come up with a number of pages.  And I assume you would not just do reports that were one page in length.  
A.	Except for Sundays.  We did not necessarily produce reports on those days.  But when we drew up reports for the following Monday, we would mention what happened on Sunday.  From time to time, reports were two, three pages long.  It depended.  But the most important thing was to report to one's direct superior, which is what happened in our locality.  Here I'm referring to the two hierarchical superiors I mentioned. 
Q.	Now, this daily report which you had been submitting starting October 1990, I understand this differed from the position prior to October 1990.  
A.	Yes, indeed.  Before October 1990, even though we would draw up reports, we did not accord so much attention to them.  At the end of the week we would draw up a report, submit it to the relevant authority, and every Monday we held a meeting of the communal council, where we would discuss the other activities in the secteur, and we'd use that forum for those discussions. 
Q.	Can you tell me why the report had to be made on a daily basis starting in October 1990?  
A.	When you are conducting -- or, rather, your duties, you had to report on them.  This was a measure that was initiated by the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  At the time it was -- the situation in a commune or it was a commune at first and then it became a préfecture.  And he wanted to make sure that daily reports were prepared.  You ask why this was done.  It was because there was insecurity, and therefore the relevant authorities had to be informed about the events as soon as possible, and we therefore had to report on what was happening in the secteurs we were running. 
Q.	You told me there was insecurity.  Could you be more specific?  Define it.  Because was this insecurity the same as insecurity prior to October 1990 or was there any event that increased the insecurity?  
A.	I'm not sure you understand me clearly, but since I told you that since October 1990 the Kigali préfecture -- the Kigali-ville préfecture took that decision because since October 1990, the RPF had launched a war against Rwanda.  And that is why I say there was insecurity prevailing.  Immediately after the start of the war, people were arrested.  People were imprisoned.  People were accused of being accomplices, especially Tutsis.  They were accused of complicity.  They were arrested in parts of the secteur and they were thrown into jail.  That is why I say the security situation was not good at the time.  
Q.	After the 1st of January 1994 -- between the 1st of January 1994 and the 6th of April, what was the frequency of the reports you sent?  And apart from the frequency, did you notice any increase in the number of pages because there was an increase in the number of incidents?  
A.	After January I would submit reports according to the events that occurred.  The report I sent on the 1st was not the same as the one I sent on the 2nd.  The fact is that I sent reports every day, whether it was one page or two pages.  First of all, I had to receive reports from the cellule to be able to draw up my report.  So it could be one page, two pages or three pages, depending on the events that occurred in the various cellules and according to the reports submitted by the respective cellule. 
Q.	In your secteur, in your report, did you denounce the presence of suspects? 
A.	I don't know what you mean by the word "suspects".  What is the meaning you want to ascribe exactly to that word?  When you submit a report, you report on all the activities in the secteur, whether negative activities -- for example, if there are bandits, thieves, intruders, and, in any case, those people had to be issued residents' permits.  You could perhaps send a positive report and say, "Nothing has occurred in the secteur.  Nobody complained of being robbed."  So one would have to report on all activities in the secteur.  I don't know what you mean when you speak of suspects.  Sometimes we spoke of bandits, of intruders from other secteurs, or we'd say, "We don't know for what purpose those people have come into the secteur."  We'd have to say all that so as to give an up-to-date report of the situation in the secteur. 
Q.	I'm speaking of suspects in the context where you had said there'd been several RPF suspects -- suspected accomplices arrested.  Were there any of those?  
A.	In 1990, when they arrested the accomplices, that had nothing to do with the conseiller.  It was the soldiers who arrested people, or members of the population in various neighbourhoods who'd been living there for years and years, who were arrested and thrown into prison.  But that doesn't mean that you might not arrest someone and then, when you see that person has no resident's permit, you must report it to the préfet and say that you've seen there are people who have no resident's permit.  They might be people from Ruhengeri or from Burundi or from elsewhere.  You'd include that in your report.  

So, one had to seek the reasons why those people came from Burundi or elsewhere into your secteur.  And it was other bodies entrusted with those investigations.  Our task was merely to report on the situation to our superiors. 
Q.	At -- as far as you are concerned, therefore, you did not report or include in your report any references to RPF suspects? 
A.	No.  I never used that word, or the word "accomplices" in my reports -- in my reports.  All the people in my -- I considered all the people in my secteur to be normal people.  I wouldn't call them suspects.  Those who said -- who spoke of accomplices, it didn't mean that they were people who had come in from outside our borders.  In fact, they were talking about people who supported the RPF.  And in my secteur I never reported on the presence -- reported the presence of any accomplices.  Yet, I did mention in my report that there were people in my secteur who did not have ID cards and did not come to the sectoral office to ask for one. 
Q.	What were the consequences for such people who did not have residents' permits? 
A.	Well, there were regulations.  Anyone who didn't have a resident's permit had to pay 200 francs to go and ask for such documents.  Sometimes there were general searches, crackdowns.  Those people were arrested in **************who didn't have the proper papers and they were fined a certain amount so that they would go and get those documents from the bureau de secteur. 
Q.	It was you, therefore, who fined whoever had offended, or was it afterwards that the amount was charged so as to -- so that the matter be cleared up? 
A.	I told you that we sent our reports, and whoever was caught, was fined, but the conseiller's task was not to fine those people.  His role was to be a mediator when there were problems between members of the public.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French booth is in the process of asking counsel to please mark a pause in the question and answering so that everyone can distinguish, if they're listening to the English, between what is the question and what is the answer.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  I will try and stick to that.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	In the course of your testimony you stated that your report was sent to the bourgmestre and to the préfet and to the minister of home affairs, the minister of the interior.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	You misunderstood me, Counsel.  I said that I sent a report to the bourgmestre and to the préfet, and the préfet would, in turn, report to the minister of home affairs or the minister of the interior. 
Q.	Well, in any case, there were three copies of the report? 
A.	I said that we drafted reports that we submitted to the bourgmestre and the préfet and to the nearest police station.  That is the security report.  So there were four copies.  Because the fourth copy -- there was a fourth copy that we retained at the secteur office.  That is how matters stood. 
Q.	You stated that at one point you received, in June or July, orders to destroy the reports, to burn them, destroy them by fire.  
A.	Yes, I did say that in June, when the RPF tried to take Kigali, the bourgmestre told us that the préfet had ordered all important documents to be burned, all copies of the documents that we'd filed at the sectoral office.  So those reports and other documents, we did receive that order and most of us executed it. 
Q.	On what date precisely did you receive that order? 
A.	I do not recall the precise date.  I know that we left the town at the beginning of July, perhaps about the 2nd or 3rd.  I know we left the town on the 3rd of July.  It was a day very near our departure from the town because we could see that the town was under imminent threat of being taken by the RPF. 
Q.	How was -- in what form did you receive that order?  Was it a written order?  Was it given to you orally? 
A.	I can't speak really of an order.  It was wartime.  Rather, it was an instruction.  It wasn't a law.  So you could speak to someone orally.  It is the bourgmestre who is close to the conseiller who informed us thereof.  You might even meet the bourgmestre in private.  You don't need to be in a meeting to receive such orders.  So it wasn't a decision taken in the communal committee or in the préfectoral committee.  Our authorities -- our superiors gave us those instructions.  The bourgmestre informed us thereof and we complied. 
Q.	I still don't understand.  Your bourgmestre gave you the instruction to burn those reports.  Can you tell me whether other bourgmestres gave such instructions, and under what conditions?  Because it is an important decision.  
A.	In Kigali town, there were three bourgmestres.  I don't know about the other communes, but I think the bourgmestre received their instructions from the préfet.  Now, all the bourgmestres had moved into offices at the préfecture.  
Q.	Under what circumstances did you implement that instruction? 
A.	Each one, in his own way, in his secteur.  You say that in the plural, but I can tell you personally, I complied with the instruction and I tore up most of those documents as I had been instructed to do.  So I tore up those documents and, besides, other documents with which I had fled at one point, when I got somewhere, I tore them up.  And I think that probably applies to the others who'd received similar instructions. 
Q.	Let us come back to this instruction.  Where were you when you received that instruction? 
A.	I was at the préfectoral offices of Kigali urban préfecture, which is where the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge was based, because all the bourgmestres had relocated their offices to the préfectoral offices at that time. 
Q.	At what time of day was it?  Morning?  Noon?  Afternoon?  
A.	It was in the forenoon, I think, because that's when we went to hand in our daily reports.  
Q.	So you then returned to your sectoral office? 
A.	Yes.  I arrived at the sectoral office, after having received the instruction.  I returned to my sectoral office in my home area.  
Q.	In talking about it now, the date of that instruction, has it -- have you recalled it to mind? 
A.	No, I do not remember.  I think it was to the -- at the end of June, beginning of July.  End of June, beginning of July.  This was 12 years ago.  It's not easy to know on exactly what date I'd received that instruction.  Maybe it was between the 1st and 2nd -- about the 1st or 2nd of July. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, when you come to a convenient time, it's about time for the mid-morning recess.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Well, Mr. President, I think we could take it now, if you like.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I just inform Your Honours that Mr. Webster is ill, so I'm holding the fort today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take the mid-morning recess. 
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1113H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can continue.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, we will continue discussing the instruction you received to the effect that you should destroy the reports.  Earlier on you told me that you went to the préfectoral office to hand over your daily report.  And when you received the instruction, were you alone with the person who issued the instruction or was anyone else present?  
A.	When the conseiller speaks to the bourgmestre, there is no need for a third person to be present, so that he did not need to find a witness to give me an order.  He was my direct superior.  At the time he gave me the instruction we were alone; it was just the two of us.  
Q.	In examination-in-chief you said that it was an order which you received.  Now you tell us it was an instruction.  Therefore, it is an instruction, isn't it? 
A.	When we say "order", whether it is an order or an instruction, when a préfet or bourgmestre issues it, it is something that is to be executed.  You are, in fact, ordered when you are requested to execute. 
Q.	Now, this order or instruction that you are provided, issued, one on one, that you should destroy important administrative instructions? 
A.	Maybe we are talking at cross-purposes, Counsel.  When it is an order, certain formalities are executed.  And when it is an instruction, there are other procedures that apply.  If it is a law, it is first published in the official gazette.  Now, whether it is an order or an instruction, as far as I'm concerned, there is no difference.  The fact is, I executed a directive or an instruction that I was given.  Basically, what matters is that I complied.  As for the nomenclature, there is no difference for me.  
Q.	Tell us why there was need to destroy the reports, the documents.  
A.	I do not know if I can answer the question.  In my testimony, I said people had taken all the equipment from the country and gone into exile with it.  It was clear that the country had been taken over by the invaders.  Therefore, it was clear that we would leave the country, and I think that is the reason we left the locality.  We left houses empty and went with all the equipment, which means that the person who replaced me found nothing.  The same goes for the person who took over from the bourgmestre or the préfet.  I think you understand why the documents were taken, why we removed them from the place where they were supposed to be stored.  
Q.	Indeed, I do not understand, and that is why I insist, because in examination-in-chief you mentioned an order that the reports should be burnt.  Now you tell us an instruction to destroy.  There is a difference between burning and destroying.  What is the instruction, order, that you received exactly? 
A.	You have your way of understanding things.  He said we should take away important documents.  If they were not that important, they should be burnt.  As far as I am concerned, in executing the instruction, I could either burn them or destroy them, tear them up.  As far as I was concerned, the order I received was specific as to the act.  There was need to burn.  So we would have to take away important documents, and if not, burn them.  I was asked to take the secteur's seal, which I did.  
Q.	I still do not know what you did, whether you burnt the documents, took them away, or tore them up, shredded them.  
A.	I burnt some documents; I tore up other documents.  It depended on the context.  Some documents I was able to take with me, and I tore them so that they could no longer be found in the files, which I did.  In the end, I ensured that the documents could not be found.  
Q.	Let us do this methodically.  So there were various types of documents.  Which documents did you immediately destroy?  
A.	You want to know how I went about it.  I burnt documents that I could not take.  I had been in the secteur for ten years.  There were documents that I could take, and in a certain place, I decided these documents were useless to me so I tore them up.  It was up to me to select important documents.  The bourgmestre did not give instructions as to which documents I should consider important.  

From the 2,000 or 10,000 documents, I was not told which was more important.  I made a choice and decided to burn some and take others away.  As per the request, we were requested to make these documents disappear.  
Q.	I must insist.  Your choice, it related to which documents?  Give me an example of documents that you burnt, tore up or took away.  How did you go about it at the time? 
A.	I had written those reports, so you want to know what criteria I used.  Well, it is the criteria I was given.  We were told we were to leave the secteur and that we should leave nothing behind.  Therefore, there are documents that I had to immediately remove.  You told me to choose -- that I should choose documents relating to security or marriages of members of the population.  I'm not able to answer that specifically.  There are documents I took with me and that I subsequently destroyed.  

For instance, there was the resignation letter.  At one point, I had written a resignation letter.  I destroyed that, for example.  What matters is I destroyed the document.  Now as for the method, some were burnt, others were torn up. 
Q.	In summary, the burning or shredding or removal exercise, you were alone when you received that instruction from the bourgmestre, or instruction order.  You therefore returned to your secteur alone to decide which documents to remove, take -- rather, remove, burn, or tear.  I put it to you, you never received an order to destroy any documents whatsoever.  
A.	If you had been my superior at that time, you would be in a position to say so, but at the time you were not my direct superior and, therefore, you can say nothing about it.  Or the person who gave me that order has given you another version of events.  Really, I do not know.  Maybe you would prefer that the documents not be destroyed, but I say -- I tell you, rather, I destroyed them myself.  

The bourgmestre has an office in the commune and he has keys to each office.  So, as far as I was concerned, before I left I burnt or shredded the documents, but you say I received no such order.  Well, that is not true.  I received an order, and do you think I did not receive an order?  But I was there.  I received an order.  And yet you claim I did not receive such an order.  

Maybe you think it is impossible.  You may think it is inconceivable that someone could be killed, but people were killed.  If I had not committed that error to burn up the documents and if I had known, I would have disobeyed and I would not have destroyed the documents, so today I would be in a position to show the whole world and Rwanda that such reports were drawn up.  

What I can say is that I received an order from my superiors.  Nor was I the only one to receive such an order.  The préfecture was vacated, and in my secteur I personally removed documents relating to my secteur, like everybody else did.

1130H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The Chamber and I have taken note of your explanations.  

Now, I would like to revisit the situation as regards security in your secteur -- let us say in the month -- in the months, rather, between April -- of April, May and June and July, can you describe the situation because you had drawn up reports on the same? 
A.	Yes, it is true that I wrote reports and those reports made mention of activities in my secteur in April and in May; Tutsi were killed by Interahamwe and soldiers.  And in those reports, we identified perpetrators, victims and so on.  That is the type of report we submitted to our hierarchical superiors.  So in the months of April, May and June, we drew up reports and after those three months, we summed up the quota.  We made a quarterly summary wherein we mentioned all the violent attacks against Tutsis.  I think conseillers would draw up reports on their secteurs.  Therefore, that was the content of the daily reports and reports in question. 
Q.	Yes.  Aside from what you have just told me, during that period, the city of Kigali had to deal with an increase in its population.  What was your experience? 
A.	As a matter of fact, there was no security in Kigali.  Actually, most people were leaving Kigali heading to other préfectures, in the hope that the security situation was better there.  Many people fled Kigali and went to other préfectures, hoping they would be safer.  

Now, as for our secteur, we were under the impression that security organs were not interested in making the population feel safe.  At least, that was the impression we got. 
Q.	And you, as a conseiller, who held -- even though this was not complete, therefore, you were the guarantor of security in your secteur.  What concrete measures did you take? 
A.	The measures I took were compatible with my level of authority.  I could but condemn the perpetrators of those acts, and, moreover, I called for the help of our superiors.  I told them the situation was serious and that they should come to our rescue.  Now, when I asked for help from a superior authority and they do not come to my assistance, what can I do about it?  I appealed to higher authority and no one came to the rescue and people subsequently died in my secteur.  In my capacity as conseiller, I have nothing else to tell you that I did.  I asked for assistance from the security forces -- security bodies who did not respond to my call and it wasn't -- that wasn't the situation in -- only in my side -- in my secteur alone, but several others also knew the same outcome. 
Q.	If I have understood your answer, you had no solution for the population, but in examination in-chief and cross-examination, you told us that the préfet had provided you with two policemen.  
A.	I said that he had sent two policemen to protect me and my family, but he didn't detach policemen to my command to protect the 5,000 people living in my secteur.  I spoke to him of my security and he sent me two policemen, but he didn't do it for everyone.  I think that is the answer that I gave in response to a question put to me.  Well, you must understand that two policemen could not ensure the safety of 10,000 people -- sorry, there were 10,000 people, not 5,000, and they could certainly not face up to the Interahamwe or the soldiers.  They told me that they had come to ensure my family's security and my personal safety.  That is what the policemen said to me.  That is what the préfet told me.  He sent two people to ensure my safety. 
Q.	That is, nonetheless, a paradoxical situation.  You were responsible for the security of 10,000 people, but you were only thinking of yourself. 
A.	You say that is paradoxical.  You asked me a question as to the responsibilities of a conseiller.  I have told you that I asked for assistance from the bourgmestre, the préfet, the gendarmerie.  If I appealed to the gendarmerie and they don't respond, what do you expect me to do?  I was there to observe, and being the spokesman on the part of the population, I spoke to the préfet.  He did not respond.  He had more than 200 policemen under his orders.  There were more than 100 gendarmes in Kigali urban préfecture.  What can I do if those people do nothing nor those people who came to seek refuge with me?  The people chasing them did -- they used to come to me.  I told you that someone sought refuge at my place.  I gave you his name, but no one chased him into my house because there were policemen there protecting me at my house.  I couldn't act throughout the secteur, but where my house was, I can tell you, without lying, that we didn't lose more than three people in my house, because the attackers would come, but when they came near to my cellule, they turned back because they were afraid of the two policemen.  That is what I can tell you about the cellule in which I lived.  But for the other cellule, I was powerless, I could do nothing.  
Q.	You mentioned a figure of 200 gendarmes, was that for all the secteurs in Kigali? 
A.	I said that someone had under his orders more than 200 policemen.  The police officers -- the number of policemen, 200 policemen.  Now, the commanding officer didn't do anything.  So, what do you expect me to have done as a conseiller?  I spoke - well, they knew that the préfet was the authority.  He had the police force.  He had gendarmerie and he could get them to intervene, inasmuch as in Kigali, it's where the military barracks was and the chief of staff of the gendarmerie. 
Q.	In point of fact, then, throughout this period you were preoccupied with your sole -- solely with your own security and you drafted reports that you then hastened to destroy.  
A.	You said that I was concerned solely with my own security?  Are you trying to say that I did not -- I was not concerned with public safety?  I explained to you what my responsibilities were and the measures that I took to call for assistance, for help from my superiors.  And I told you that the two people sent to me did, nonetheless -- were, nonetheless, of use in my own cellule, but those two people were not enough to ensure security in the same cellule.  You know that depends -- according -- on the individual.  I think I did what I could, but, nonetheless, people were not saved.  I tell you that the person who was in charge of security did not fulfill his task, and that person is not present here in the Court.  But as far as I am concerned, I did what I could in what I had to do. 
Q.	I have the impression that you did not seek instructions from your two superiors because, listening to you, I have the feeling either you are not explaining correctly or I am not understanding correctly, but the authorities gave orders -- gave instructions, but you did not, in fact, implement them.  
A.	You are saying that the authorities gave instructions with which I did not comply.  I see where you are heading.  I told you what a conseiller's responsibilities are, his level of responsibility.  Well, I was being attacked and the people under me were being attacked, and I asked for assistance from the competent authorities but no one came to my assistance.  And you are saying that I was given no instructions.  
`
Now, I told you I called for assistance and no one came.  Does a conseiller have more power than a bourgmestre, than préfet, than the gendarmerie?  It was up to the gendarmerie to intervene whenever a problem of security arose.  I called for help from the préfet.  The préfet did not come and did not intervene.  According to you, I did nothing.  That is what you have said, and I tell you that I called for assistance from the competent authorities, from my hierarchical superiors, and nobody came.  But me, I did, nonetheless, try to do something.  But in a cellule of ****people, only three people died, that is as concerns -- as far as my cellule is concerned.  To be succinct, I called for help and nobody came.  The rest of it is your opinion and you can think what you will.  The competent authorities will decide.  They will check and see whether a conseiller really had -- was capable of ensuring public safety when a group of perhaps more than 100 people armed with firearms attacked his administrative area. 
Q.	Thank you for your explanation.  Let me backtrack a bit with you.  This is about your membership in the MRND.  In what year did you join the MRND? 
A.	I think I have already answered that question, but perhaps you did not understand.  So, I shall repeat.  When the MRND was still the party state -- the single party, everyone was a member of the MRND.  Anybody who held any position whatsoever also was in the MRND, at the same level.  So the conseiller was responsible for the MRND at such a level, similarly, the bourgmestre and other people in authority.  It was the same even in private firms, businesses, everybody was a member -- everybody was a member of MRND, whether they wanted to or not. 
Q.	Yes.  I know we are coming back to explanations that you have already provided regarding your membership of MRND, but I wanted, in a few sentences, that you should explain to us how you were a member of that movement.  

So, in 1991, you continued being in the MRND when it was the republican party? 
A.	Quite. 
Q.	My question as to belonging to the MRND republican party is from the angle of the situation of lack of security that prevailed in Kigali after October 1990.  As a militant, MRND militant, what was the debate within your cellule? 
A.	I don't understand, what debate are you speaking of?  The MRND had party members.  There were the founding members.  After 1991 the people joined the parties they wanted to join.  Now, I think instead of the founding fathers that should have been the first signatories, but then afterwards, they joined the other parties, that they wanted to join.  So, I don't understand what debate you are speaking of. 
Q.	I should put a more specific question to you.  We have seen that there were people displaced by the war in Kigali.  Now, what was the reaction of the MRND militants in the face of that situation? 
A.	I don't know what displaced persons you are speaking of.  Some from Bugesera after the killing that had taken place there, some from Shyrongi, Tutsi who were fleeing from the killing also, and then other IDPs from the Byumba area.  So I don't know what group you are speaking of for me to be able to say anything about it. 
Q.	Let us take the first group of IDPs after the attack of October 1990. 
A.	Those IDPs came from the Byumba area and they never came to my secteur.  They never reached my secteur.  They were never housed within Kigali town, so I can't say that such a number of refuges arrived in*************.  So, I can't tell you how the population under my control reacted.  Instructions were issued by the government and those IDPs had to stay in the areas provided for them and they did not reach Kigali town. 
Q.	So, according to you, after the attacks of October 1990, the refugees stayed in Byumba and were not pushed towards Kigali? 
A.	I said those people came from Byumba, but it is true they did not get into Kigali town.  You have to distinguish between Kigali and the surrounding area.  I never said they stayed in Byumba.  I said they came to the outskirts of Kigali.  So they stayed, they were in Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	And then after the Bugesera attack at Shyorongi attack, did you again see the phenomenon of IDPs is converging on the Kigali area -- Kigali region? 
A.	After the Bugesera events, most IDPs could not flee as far as Kigali was.  As to the Shyorongi group, a minority, maybe five or ten people from the Shyorongi group came to Nyamirambo.  Isolated individuals maybe fled from Bugesera to Kigali, but the Byumba IDPs were very numerous and they all came at the same time. 
Q.	To come back to my first question then.  In local MRND meetings, you only spoke of the local situation -- as of the local situation, yes. 
A.	Each group discussed matters concerning them.  Whether it was préfectural meetings, then we discussed matters affecting the préfecture as a whole.  If it was at communal level, we discussed things that concerned the commune.  You couldn't go beyond the limits and discuss problems that didn't concern you, that concerned other places or other secteurs. 
Q.	In fact, my question is political.  You are a political militant and you see yourself a situation deteriorating and the political militants only discuss local problems? 
A.	You have just said that I was a politician.  I should like to tell you that back home politicians have to think.  National politicians -- it is the national politician's job to think, to reflect upon the problems of the nation, but local politicians in secteural and communal level the problem -- their problem is to reflect on local problems.  You are asking me what matters we could discuss that concerned us.  If we were talking about Kigali and there is a problem of IDPs from other préfectures, how does that fit in with communal and secteural matters?  I had my own personal politics and my politics is different from that of the national president or even a préfectural president.  I knew the problem was there and that solutions had to be found, that the competent politicians should find solutions to those problems, but that was not me.  It was politicians at a higher level that had to find the remedy to that problem.  So the politicians had to find a solution to the problem according to whatever their level -- the level at which they were, and I did what I had to do at my level and there were other people at other levels who had to solve the problems at their respective levels. 
Q.	You said that you had your politics.  Could we hear the definition of your politics? 
A.	My politics consisted -- were that Hutu and Tutsi should live together in harmony because they are all brothers.  I told them, there has been marriage between you, so you must live as brothers and sisters.  That was my politics in the secteur under my control. 
Q.	In what did you have these politics because the statutes of the MRND republican are not different from what you have just said? 
A.	MRND statutes were extremely well drafted, but, unfortunately, it was not translated.  They were not translated into facts.  You have asked me to give my personal opinion.  In my capacity as responsable -- as being responsible for the secteur, I reacted as an individual, not as a member of the MRND.  I was not speaking on behalf of the party.  I said -- I spoke aloud of all the problems I could perceive.  If I am talking with someone and I gave my opinion, and there is ten of us and eight people express their opinion, then I have to comply with the opinions of the majority.  But as far as my personal politics is concerned, I could see what was happening and I had to give my opinion. 
Q.	Witness, we are speaking of politics of the party or statutes you adhered, or the party that you joined and the statute of the party which you subscribed to.  Now, I have the impression that you did not do what you are saying you did.  
A.	Thank you.  You don't know.  You can't tell whether I acted or not the way I say I did.  Maybe your client has been telling you things in a special way unless you were told that the politics of the country depended on the conseiller.  The fact that I was a member of the MRND doesn't mean that I was highly educated.  You could be -- may be used -- sold charcoal and you are yet a good member of the MRND, a good patriot who loves his party.  There were peasants, of course, ordinary peasants could not be members of parliament and represent the MRND.  I tell you that there were also limits.  So you are reproaching me for not having applied party instructions.  It was the spokesman of the party who was responsible for implementing the statutes.  At my level, I couldn't reflect on behalf of the MRND.  I couldn't conceive of what the MRND had to do, the fact that -- if everyone had followed MRND statutes, I don't think either you or I would be here in this courtroom today.  In spite of the fact that there were party statutes, we obeyed and followed our own interests instead of the interests of the nation.  I am not saying that I am not responsible to a certain degree at secteural level.  Don't ask me questions as to whether the president of the republic was thinking of good things for the party or not.  We all instituted those statutes, but they had other plans that were concealed, that were hidden, and the fact is that the party statutes were not complied with. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, my colleague, Counsel Sow, has something to say.  So I will stop for a couple of minutes. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like you to ask -- to give Mr. Karemera leave, to leave now so that he can go and have his physiotherapy done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness UB, with the advent of multiparty politics, you chose to stay with the MRND.  The statutes of the MRND which became the democratic and republican movement, the idea was that the statutes provided that information would be collected from the grassroots to be sent up to the hierarchy.  Is that how it was? 
A.	I do not know whether that was the actual practice, but that is what was supposed to be done.  If the statutes had been complied with, that is what should have been done. 
Q.	Your answer causes me even more concern because as an individual who decided to stay in a party which had changed from a single party to a democratic party, your answer leads me to think that you were -- you fixed or you stayed with the practices of the MRND as a revolutionary movement and a single party, that you did not change? 
A.	Thank you.  I am going to tell you this.  That is your opinion.  You say that I maintained or continued to follow the previous practices of the MRND.  I tell you that there was a transfer of power.  I gave up the chairman of the MRND for my area.  I was never a party official at secteur level.  I never hampered the activities of any party official.  You say that I did not adapt my behaviour; well, that is true.  Even the party chairman continued acting as before; there is proof to that effect.  He never supported the democratic practices that appeared in the statutes.  Not even the bourgmestre was able to adapt to the new multiparty context.  What I know is that there was a distinction between the administration as such and the actual functioning of the parties.  If I had known that the new MRND was supposed to be different from the old MRND, I wouldn't have joined the party, because the old MRND was at least better than the new MRND.  For example, it never persecuted Tutsis.  There was always safety.  But when the new MRND came into being, there was insecurity; Tutsi were persecuted.  If I had had any idea at all that the new MRND was going to behave like that, I would never have joined it, because during the old MRND regime, nobody was persecuted.  But under the new MRND regime, people were killed.  They were killed by the very people who were supposed to be responsible for their security. 
Q.	Witness UB, from the constitution of 1991, that is, the new statutes of the MRND, you were able to resign from the movement, but you didn't do so; you never did so. 
A.	Whoever left the MRND and was allowed to go in peace -- can you give me an example?  When I tried to leave the party, it was when I gave -- handed in my resignation and my resignation was not accepted.  You tell me that one could leave the party, the MRND party, for another political party.  Well, some left the party and bore the consequences of that.  You must understand me.  You must look at what happened in the cellule and secteurs.  Everyone had to answer to his actions or levels.  And you tell me that I was -- that if I was not able to leave the party, then I am partly responsible for what happened?  Well, that is true, because otherwise, I would not be here.  I was a witness to what happened in the party and that is why I am here. 
Q.	Witness UB, I am understanding you less and less.  You were not politically active from what you explained previously, and what you're telling me implies -- indicates that you, in fact, did -- you were politically active. 
A.	I said that you have your own idea of Rwandan politics.  A person in a secteur could not be considered as a politician as such.  What I am giving here is testimony about events that I know, and you are talking about things that you know nothing about.  I am trying to help you to understand what it is all about.  Perhaps it doesn't seem realistic to you, but this is it.  I am talking about things I know, that I witnessed, and you are telling me that it is not true.  I am telling you that I was not a politician, but what I am saying is that, in view of the activities that I carried out, I could witness many things.  You asked me why I did not leave the MRND in spite of all I saw.  The consequence of not having left the MRND is obvious.  I am here now and I am here because what happened did happen.  I have been charged with many things.  You have seen this in the documentation.  And since I was a member of the MRND party, I cannot dissociate myself from the things that happened.  Similarly, a politician who was active in the MRND cannot dissociate himself from the events that occurred.  And you're telling me that you do not understand what I am saying.  Well, what do you want me to do about it? 
Q.	You told me about your resignation letter.  You sent the resignation letter -- to whom did you send the resignation letter? 
A.	I was working for the ministry of the interior and communal development and I was a subordinate of the bourgmestre and the préfet.  It is the minister who was supposed to take a final decision in this case.  So I addressed the letter to the minister whom I have mentioned, and I copied the letter to the bourgmestre and to the préfet since they were all my superiors. 
Q.	When did you tender your resignation? 
A.	It was on the 23rd of May 1993. 
Q.	Why? 
A.	I said that I was no longer able to lead the secteur and that, in addition, I had personal reasons for resigning.  In any case, I felt that I was not -- no longer able to head the secteur because I could not lead the secteur in the way that would guarantee the safety of its inhabitants.  Of course, there were other personal reasons, but I did not wish to go into detail about them.  What I wished to do was to stand aside so that others could go on leading the secteur. 
Q.	I must have overlapped with the translation.  So this resignation letter of the 23rd of May 1993 was sent to the administration, that is, the government.  It means that it was in -- it was your position as an administrative officer that you were resigning from; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  It was my right as an employee -- as a government employee to resign if I felt I needed to. 
Q.	Since it was your right, why was your resignation not accepted? 
A.	This is a question you should put to the ministry -- minister of the interior at the time because I have no answer for it.  He told me that I should complete my term of office, that is it.  Consequently, I cannot explain further to you.  I met the minister of the interior himself and he told me that given the current state of affairs, he couldn't accept my resignation and he asked me to wait for my term of office to come to an end.  My term of office was supposed to end in '93, '94. 
Q.	When was the exact date when your duties were supposed to end? 
A.	It was supposed to be the end of 1994; I think on the 25th.  I think that the elections had been organised on the 25th of some month.  So the term of office was supposed to end in December 1994. 
Q.	How long were you supposed to be in office? 
A.	Five years. 
Q.	Since we have looked, we have examined the fact that there was a resignation from your administrative position.  There was no resignation from your political activities, you stayed in the party, and there is no reason that leads me to believe that you decided to leave the MRND although you were no longer in agreement with it.  
A.	I never said that I was thinking of resigning from the MRND party.  However, it was my right; I could have done it at any time.  I stayed within the MRND till the time when we all fled.  I don't know whether you are asking me whether it ever crossed my mind that I should resign.  Well, if I had done it -- well, I would have told you. 
Q.	I must have misunderstood.  So, we agree that you stayed in the MRND after the advent of multiparty politics? 
A.	Yes, that is right.  I was still a member of the MRND. 
Q.	And that was up to July 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I can see what time it is.  It is 12:25.  I want to move on to another line of questioning.  Should I start or should we take the break now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can take the break now. 

Mr. Witness, we break for lunch now and resume this afternoon. 
(Court recessed from 1225H to 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody. 
Ms. Hounkpatin, are you ready? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, I am.  Good afternoon, Mr. President, and good afternoon, everyone here. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, good afternoon.
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	We shall talk about insecurity for a few moments.  I was recalling your statement that you made towards the end of this morning about the reports that you submitted to the bourgmestre and the préfet, who, according to your testimony, were encouraging and protecting the people who were committing atrocities, in particular, the attacks on Tutsi.  You denounced these actions and the people to whom you denounced these actions, that is, the préfet, instead of attacking you, sought to protect you.  Can you explain to me how this is possible? 
A.	If I refer to your last sentence, that is, in which you said that he gave me protection, that he sent policemen to me to ensure my security -- well, he did it, I cannot blame him for that.  In addition, you say that I denounced the acts that were perpetrated on the Tutsi.  That is what I did in the report and I also reported on other acts that had no bearing on what was being done to the Tutsi.  I had to report on all events that had occurred in the area for which I was the government official.  

You put a question to me and you say that there is a contradiction between the reports that I submitted to him and the protection that he afforded me.  You are right, but the fact is, that I told him about the state of affairs, that is the prevailing insecurity, and he provided me with protection.  He gave protection to the conseiller but he did not protect the entire secteur.  It is up to him to answer for that.  It was within his prerogative to protect the entire secteur because the Interahamwe reported to him about whether or not they had attacked such-and-such a house belonging to Tutsi.  The préfet therefore had to send people to protect these houses.  This was within his prerogative of the bourgmestre.  The fact is that we reported to him in -- about all events that occurred in our area and this is what we were supposed to do.  It was then up to him to provide protection for all members of the public, both in the secteur and in the cellule. 
Q.	The contradiction that I am trying to point out is something I will illustrate with an example.  You tell the head of the Mafia, say, that things are happening, misdeeds are being committed, and quite surprisingly, the Mafia takes it upon itself to protect you? 
A.	If I understood you correctly, you are saying, how can a person who protects killers and then you go and report acts to someone who is actually protecting the killers?  That is true, but if I speak out against such acts and I report to the préfet or someone else and this person does nothing, then it is obvious that this person is protecting the killers.  We used to report to him on matters that were within our jurisdiction and he did nothing, whereas it was within his powers to act as a consequence of our reports.  He had the authority to dismiss from his duties anyone who failed to do his work properly.  You say it is absurd that I should denounce someone who carries out such acts and that in response, the person who asks his acts to be carried out provides me with protection.  He could have protected someone perhaps -- there is remaining survivors as a result of that -- but he failed in his obligation to protect the entire general public.  I do not know why he felt like that.  If he did not want me to be killed, if he had wished that I should be killed, he would not have provided me with a bodyguard.  You say you do not understand that the fact that he provided security for me and no security for the general public is odd.  Well, I have nothing to say.  I don't have anything to say about the fact that he gave me such protection.  You are right, you cannot understand because you were not there.  If you were there, you would have understood that security was provided for some but not for others. 
Q.	Also towards the end of this morning, it was not possible for a conseiller to resign from the MRND party, implying there would have been reprisals if one had sought to do so.  But there were conseillers that resigned.  You are aware of that, are you not? 
A.	I do not know whether you know the number of conseillers who resigned from their positions.  There were 19 conseillers.  Can you tell me which one resigned and who was left in peace after he had resigned?  It depends -- it depended on who it was.  I told you that I resigned as conseiller, but I did not leave the MRND.  If I had left the MRND, it might have been thought that I was going to join another party.

Now, with regard to these conseillers who resigned in Kigali préfecture, I do not know, but I think that most of them are no longer alive.  Those who tried to leave the MRND -- well, if you give me their names, I can confirm that they are no longer alive.  They did not even leave the party officially.  If I had resigned from the MRND, I would have suffered for it greatly.  I would have suffered even more than I am suffering now.  I did not tell you that I resigned from MRND party.  In addition, you say that I spoke out or denounced the killings.  You could speak out against such acts.  You could speak out publicly, but it would not have had any effect. 
Q.	Let me give you an example then of an MRND militant who resigned, he was in the préfectoral committee, and this person is called Jacques Rusirare.  He had the courage to resign. 
A.	Well, if he was the only one who the courage to leave the MRND, that is all right, but I didn't have that courage yet.  He was a member of the steering committee of the MRND.  He knows how he went about it.  He knows what explanation he provided.  You are talking about Rusirare, who worked with Habyarimana and who worked with Mathieu.  That alone is enough for him to be spared the consequences of his resignation, but do not think that, that the resignation of a man like 
	Jacques Rusirare would be viewed in the way that the resignation of the conseiller could be viewed.  
	He could tell the minister of the interior or soldiers to protect him, and such protection could -- would be provided.  We saw instances where this occurred.  So we cannot compare the resignation of 
	Jacques Rusirare and my resignation.  I occupied a humble position in relation to the position that Jacque Rusirare held. 
Q.	You said during your cross-examination that in respect of security, both senior officials and the president of the republic Juvenal Habyarimana, failed to do anything to stop the skyrocketing insecurity.  Do you maintain that this is so? 
A.	I said that the country's government did nothing to stop the acts that were being perpetrated and I confirm this today.  The president of the republic did nothing.  He did not display any will to stop the killings.  I cannot give you evidence, tangible proof, that would indicate that they tried to do something to stop the killings.  The fact is that we saw figures of authority letting people kill other people and then five days later they started saying that the killings must stop.  So, I maintain my position.  The competent authorities failed to do anything to stop the killings.

1430H
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Now, Mr. President, I would like to request the assistance of the registry to circulate -- or rather, show the witness the message which is Exhibit 6 on my list, President Habyarimana's message to the nation on the 15th of October 1990. 

This document is in French.  I do not have the English version.  But perhaps the Office of the Prosecutor, given that this is a document bearing a K-number, can help us to find the English and Kinyarwanda version of the document, if possible.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, have you the document?  
A.	Yes, I have just received the document.  
Q.	It is in French, but before we go to the portions of text that I would like to read out, I would like to ask you if you recall the impact of the RPF attack on the population, the attack of 1990, in October?  And if you do remember, could we discuss that? 
A.	Yes, I remember the attack took place in October 1990.  I told you I am not a politician, if you want us to discuss it.  Opinions were given by President Habyarimana to his close colleagues.  You should remember I was just a conseiller of the secteur.  And if you ask me questions about                   President Habyarimana's speech, bear in mind the post that I held.  

President Habyarimana and his close associates were responsible for providing security to all Rwandans throughout Rwanda.  So, as we discuss this, remember I am not a politician, and remember the post I held. 
Q.	Yes, Witness UB, I am perfectly aware of that.  And I am asking you this question as a citizen.  Therefore, I'm asking you to recall the impact of the attack.  The impact it had on you, and possibly since -- and since you also had an administrative post.  Therefore, I would like you to broaden the picture.
A.	The Inkotanyi attack had various consequences, consequences on the members of the population as a result of negligence by the authorities.  If they had not been negligent, the attack would have had no consequence or effect on members of the population.  That is to say that the country's leaders did not act as they should have.  Rwanda's borders ought to have been protected.  And the authorities were distracted so that the country was attacked.  Therefore, the country should have been protected and that is why the top leadership, namely, the president of the republic, and his close associates were supposed to be answerable.  

So you should not ask me about the consequences.  That question you should put to the president of the republic and his associates.  They should explain how the country came to be attacked, whereas members of the public ought to have been protected. 
Q.	Am I to understand that you are saying that it is the fault of the government in place at the time that the RPF attacked? 
A.	Personally, I think the government failed in its duties.  The government knows why the RPF attacked.  I was an ordinary citizen.  The government was responsible for protecting me, just as it was responsible for protecting the life of anyone living at the border.  The country should have been protected -- defended.  And all members of the community should have been protected.  This is the responsibility of the government.  And, therefore, President Habyarimana and his close associates were charged with protecting the population.
A.	I was just an ordinary citizen; that means that it is those authorities that ought to be answerable.  
Q.	In light of what you are telling us, should the government have had prior knowledge of the RPF attack?  Was this a surprise attack or was this announced?  
A.	If you are taken by surprise, it means that you did not properly protect your household.  They should have known that they had enemies who had the intention -- or the intent to attack.  If you do not protect your country's borders and the country is attacked, it is not for a member of the population to answer; it is the leadership who should answer.  If you are the force commander in a country and you are attacked, it is not a member of the population who will be asked to account for the attack; it is the leader who will have to explain why the country was attacked. 
Q.	Given your answer, I must conclude that the 1990 RPF attack, even though you do not say so, was a surprise, came as a shock to everybody? 
A.	I don't know.  I said that you should remember when you analyse my answers that I am an ordinary citizen.  The fact that people were surprised does not preclude the fact that it was in error for the country to be attacked.  

If we are in this house -- building and somebody comes and attacks the building, well, the person in charge of our security should be answerable.  Such negligence does not mean that an error is not an error.  If the Inkotanyi attacked the country and two préfectures were captured -- were taken over, you cannot tell me that country's authorities did not err?  

If you make a mistake and have to reap the consequences, well, you have to accept the consequences because you were negligent. 
Q.	So, the population was expecting the state to be much more vigilant in its response, correct? 
A.	Yes.  Since the enemy, the RPF, attacked the country, that enemy should have been fought off.  You, as an authority, should not expect the population to come and rescue you from the enemy, telling them that you are unable to counter their attacks.  As an authority, it is one of your prerogatives to combat the RPF; it is not for members of the public.  Therefore, those authorities who -- were supposed to wage war until victory was achieved.  And if the government could not fight the enemy, then the government ought to have resigned. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We are now going to move on to read some portion of the document.  Given that it is in French, I will read it out, and the interpreters in the booth will translate it.  I refer to page 5 of the document, Exhibit 6; the head of state of Rwanda's message to the nation on the 15th of October 1990.

That is page 5.  Before we read the last two paragraphs of page 5, as well as the first two paragraphs of page 6, I would like to ask you, given this crucial period for Rwandan population, if you heard the speech at the time?  
A.	I don't remember, a long time has past since.  But I believe it is the president's speech.  I don't remember the circumstances of the speech, but I think it was his speech to all Rwandans. 
Q.	Very well.  I will, therefore, read the last two paragraphs on page 5.  It reads as follows -- or begins as follows:  "Militants, listen to me carefully.  Listen to me carefully.  The enemy overrunning our country who has brought fire and blood to it, is merely trying to pit people against each other, is just seeking to prove that 17 years of national peace are a mere facade.  And that it is easy to disturb the ethnic harmony in our country.  We must at all cost ensure that we do not fall into this infernal trap.  

"As I told you -- as I told you, nothing would be more unjust.  Nothing would be more nefarious for our country than if we began to confuse the issues and consider our brothers and sisters, regardless of their ethnicity, as responsible for the armed aggression against our country." 

Over the page, which begins: "No matter how angry we are at these few traitors who have joined the rebels, no matter how concerned we are about attempts to restore in our country a futile regime from a bygone time which wants to go back in time; which would like to merge into super regional entities, we cannot allow ourselves to compromise our gains.

"Let us prove to the world that the political maturity of the Rwandan people and its inherent humanity are the best guarantees that we will overcome this difficult ordeal; that we shall remain calm, and that we will, as soon as possible, revive cordial relations and peace that we have for so long experienced.  And that nothing and no one will be able to or will seek to imperil."  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, are you going to come to a question?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have just finished the reading and I will now ask the witness. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	If this part of the speech that I have read is a call to divide the peoples of Rwanda, or if, on the other hand, this is a call for them to unite? 
A.	The speech was made on the 15th of April, 15th of October 1990.  The RPF had just attacked a country.  After the RPF's attack, many Tutsi who were in Rwanda were considered accomplices.  Between the 10th and 15th, many Tutsi were arrested and jailed; some were even killed.  This went on all over Rwanda because of the war that broke out in Mutara.  Not only did the Tutsi in Mutara pay for this, but all Tutsi throughout the country paid for the attack; prisons were overflowing.  

And even those who worked for the government were dismissed, even some conseiller in the Kigali-ville préfecture were removed, or dismissed.  And yet they were not responsible for the war -- or were not even in Mutara.  So Habyarimana threw them in jail.  And when he wanted to, he released them.  He wanted to show them what he was made of, therefore.  And when he was satisfied, he released them; and after that made that speech.

In that speech, the one you have just read out to me, of 15 October 1990, this was a one-party state and the country was run by President Habyarimana; and it is his party that ran the country.  So he was calling on members of the population to -- he was telling members of the population that someone wanted to restore the futile regime in Rwanda.  Who was he referring to?  As I said, Rwandans speak in riddles.  Why does he not specify the person seeking to restore the futile regime?  This was a late motif, a word that kept recurring.  Something that Habyarimana wanted all Hutus to understand, that the futile regime would return, that slavery would be restored in the country.  

So after the speech, Tutsis were removed from their post.  You, of course, were not there, but I was there.  This went on even after 1990.  Nothing was done to halt the spat of arbitrary dismissals.  In 1992, Tutsis in Bugesera were publicly slaughtered, and Habyarimana could see this.  Tutsi in Bagogwe, in Gisingi and Ruhengeri were killed; women and children were killed.  

Habyarimana was in power.  He was told.  He could see what was happening and he did nothing.  I lend no credence to the speech.  He was trying to show the international community his willingness to unify the population against the war.  But because of the people surrounding him, his entourage, he was not able to save Tutsis in Bugesera.   In Shyorongi, all of these Tutsis sought refuge in Ngarambe.  Therefore, that speech was just a cover to show the international community that he wanted to do something about it.  

So he made the speech in 1990, but up to 1994, you, yourself, know what acts were perpetrated.  He did nothing to stop the perpetrators of those acts, to have them punished.  He never demonstrated to the Tutsis that he was the father of the nation, a father willing to protect them.  Therefore, I concede that it is his speech, but I lend it no credence because none of it was ever applied; nothing that he says in the speech.  
Q.	Witness, you often say that all of the speeches that are put to you were meant for the international community and not for Rwandans.  You say this to shirk the true answer -- avoid the true answer, that is the truth of what is said in the speeches.  If we read on in the speech, we will not read all 11 pages of the speech, and I think that while you go through it, you will say -- see that the president did actually respond to what had happened after the speeches -- after the attack.  

Page 6, the last paragraph of that page, he also invited the international community to come and verify, in prisons, that following that early reaction that resulted from the surprise attack that arrests were, of course, outrageous; but almost all of those who were arrested were thereafter released.  And the international community, in particular, the organisations that usually work in such cases, were invited to the country to take note of the situation.  

This is all I wanted you to take note of.  And you will agree with me that this speech was calling on all Rwandans to be united.  And whatever interpretation you ascribe to it, you must agree that this speech is calling on Rwandans to be united? 
A.	Madam Counsel, I would like to tell you that this speech, as such, did not pose a problem.  But I have asked you to put questions to me bearing in mind that I am not an expert.  I am not a legal expert on the matter.  Yes, I agree that the speech is positive.  But I would like to ask you a question:  Were the people arrested -- arrested by the RPF or by President Habyarimana?  Was it the public prosecution department, or party that decided to arrest all of these people?  He made the mistake of arresting them all and throwing them into jail.  

It is true that representatives of the international community did not come to verify their release, but I must point out that some people perished in jail.  I was in Kigali, and I tell you that some were detained in containers.  

I, personally, went into the Kigali prison.  I was supposed to go and visit the prison in Gitarama, Butare and the Kigali prison.  But why were those people arrested?  Was it not Habyarimana who had them arrested and jailed?  Yet you are telling me that I am refuting all of the speeches that I am shown; but I am merely saying this because I know the speeches.  I know that their content has nothing to do with the reality.  If such a speech was made, and in spite of it killings of the Tutsi continued, how much value do you expect me to accord to the speech, if the Tutsis went on dying between 1990 and 1994?  If you say he wanted to urge Rwandans to be united and that Rwandans did not comply with his directives, as given in the speech, then he should have resigned if Rwandans were no longer obeying him.  So I want to tell you that I think this speech has no value. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to have the document admitted, that is the speech, as an exhibit.  And, I think, if I remember the exhibit number, it should be DH. 6.  I would like it to be quoted as A, B, C, according to the various languages, given that I am entering this document in the French, I would like it to be given D. NGA -- D. NG6A, lower case A (sic). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG6A admitted)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Mr. President, a small issue has arisen with the registry.  Maybe the Prosecutor could confirm if an English translation of the document exist, or if it does not exists, then we ought to see to its translation.  And if among our documents, we have the Kinyarwanda version, I would like the Prosecution to confirm that for us, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
We are always pleased to help the Defence, we will have a look to see whether we can find this document in Kinyarwanda and in English.  Presumably, it is a document which has come from the Prosecution; am I right in thinking that?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, that is the case.  Do you want me to give you K-number?  It is marked at the top of -- rather, over the --  under the manuscript letter, it is K0220759, on page 1 of the French translation, that is. 
MR. MORLEY:
(Inaudible)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I have a second document that I would like the registrar to give to the witness.  It is Exhibit 7.  It is a message to the nation by the head of state, dated 13th November 1990. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I have the document. 
Q.	So, this is a message and address that the head of state made to the nation on the                           13th of November 1990.  This was a month or so after the first message.  These are speeches of the head of state, that he made in 1990.  It is important for me to show you documents from that period.  Did you hear this speech to the nation that the head of state made in November 1990?  
A.	I see that he was talking to the diplomatic corps, so I was not supposed to listen to all of the speeches that were broadcast at that time.  This speech must have been broadcast, but I cannot claim that I heard everything that was broadcast around that time.  I was not supposed to find out or to learn of everything that happened in cabinet meetings.  I can see the speech.  It was given to me, but I did not hear it on the radio. 
Q.	It is true that this speech was made to the members of the diplomatic corps in Kigali; but it also -- the audience also included members of parliament.  So this is a speech that must have been made to different personalities and must have been broadcast? 
A.	No, I don't deny that this speech was broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  But you mustn't think that I was supposed to listen to all of the speeches that were broadcast.  I see that he was referring, or speaking to the diplomats and the members of the Conseil national de développement or parliament.  If this speech was broadcast, then all Rwandans heard it.  I have nothing to say about it for the time being.  Perhaps I might say something about it, if you put questions to me.  

This speech must be some of your evidence and there is no reason why you mustn't put questions to me about it.  I think he made this speech to ask Rwandans to be united. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have a problem.  Are you on the defensive when you say that you didn't hear any speech? 
A.	The reason is that in my statement, I made no statement to the speech or any speech by the president of the republic.  I did not know that questions were going to be put to me about these speeches broadcast in the 90's -- in the 80's.  I am only an ordinary citizen so I couldn't possibly go and say that I heard such-and-such a thing, if I didn't hear it.  

I wonder why you are so insistent on looking at these speeches.  Why did you not give these speeches directly to the president of the Trial Chamber.  Why are you trying to get them entered into evidence through me?  Give the speech to the President of the Trial Chamber instead of asking me to say things about it.  You are asking me to comment.  And during the comments that I make, I think I have the right to say yes or no.  

So I did not have the time to listen to all the speeches that were broadcast; which is why each time you show me a speech, I say, well, the content is very rich, but the sentiments expressed in the speech were not followed by action.  You have the right to put any questions to me to -- to put questions to me as you wish.  And I have the right to answer as I see fit.  
Q.	Thank you for your explanation, Witness.  This speech is fairly long.  We shall not read it out in its entirety.  The head of state talked about several issues to which he suggested solutions.  I would like us to go to the page with the handwritten Number 4548.  That is 4548 in the document that I passed on.  And you will see that the last three paragraphs -- 
A.	You say that it is -- what is the page number, did you say?  
Q.	It is handwritten at the top of the page, 4548.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson has just pointed out to me that this page is lacking in the copy that was distributed.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth indicates that it does not have the page, and the English booth does not have it either. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
So no one has it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, perhaps we should take our mid-afternoon break now.  That will give you a chance to get organised.  Would that be helpful?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, of course, Mr. President.  During the break I should be able to provide this page which is lacking. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of interest, how are you going with your overall cross-examination?  Are you still on track to complete early tomorrow?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I am going to try; I think, of course, unless something comes up. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, when I asked Mr. Robinson what was -- the percentage of his cross-examination that was completed, he was able to answer fairly specifically.  What percentage do you think you have completed?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I might say 40 percentage (sic), perhaps. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  That is fair; thank you, very much.  We will take our afternoon recess now for about 15 or 20 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1521 to 1550H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  

Ms. Hounkpatin. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, do you now have the page that I was referring to? 
A.	Are you referring to page 4548, Counsel?  
Q.	So I was saying that the speech is long.  This is a policy speech in which President Habyarimana was announcing the proceedings of the national committee for political openness.  He also suggested solutions to the economy crisis, which was the backdrop to the situation at the time.  
So we are talking here about the proposals that he made for the refugee situation; which is why I asked you to look at page 4548.  In the middle of the page -- this is a document in French.  I am not going to dwell on all of the paragraphs.  You have a sentence that begins as follows:   "You know to what extent the refugee -- the problem of refugees living abroad has always been a concern of both the first and the second republic."  

So, we are talking about this business -- this matter of refugees that the president is talking about.  He refers to a policy speech that he made in January 1989 where Rwanda decided to find a definitive and satisfactory, to the delicate and tragic situation of the refugees; can you see it? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	So, we go, now, to page 4547.  So, we go to paragraph 3 on page 4547.  We are still talking about refugees here.  And here he mentions the confidence that he had in the outcome of the original conference that brought together the presidents of Tanzania, Burundi and Kenya and Zaire, as well as international organisations such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, HCR and the OAU, the then African -- Organisation of African unity, and friendly countries.  

I skip another paragraph, and he says, in the paragraph that I am reading: "I call once more on all refugees to take up the offer made by Rwanda for a peaceful solution, a harmonious solution to this problem, in the interests of all and through constructive dialogue."  Do you follow so far? 
A.	Yes, I can follow you, Counsel. 
Q.	So, this is a quick look at the refugee situation.  Do you then agree that President Habyarimana has called for and emphasised the need for dialogue leading to a solution to the problem of refugees, foreign refugees? 
A.	But look, this is just a speech to which I give no credence.  The speech was made on the                 13th of November 1990.  The RPF had already launched its attack.  This means that there was fighting.  That is when President Habyarimana started conducting negotiations.  I told you that there was neglect.  If he had opted for negotiations prior to that attack, it might have solved the problem.  He only thought about negotiations subsequent to being attacked.  If he hadn't been attacked, he would never have thought of negotiations.  I do not deny that the speech was broadcast, but it was broadcast after the war had been started and when he was under threat in the rebels.  

I am not here to defend either the RPF or Habyarimana.  But I think that President Habyarimana was making these speeches because he was in a difficult situation.  The war had broken out, and he was not sure that he would prevail.  There have been refugees out of -- outside of the country for a long time.  He has never either expressed the wish that they should return.  

You have put this question to me.  I am not a politician.  I do not work in the presidency, or in a ministry.  But I think that at the time this speech was useful because the speech had been launched, and rebels were occupying parts of the country.  I do not think that this speech is proof that President Habyarimana wished to find a permanent solution to the refugee question.  He only made this speech because he was attacked.

If he hadn't been attacked, he would not have made this speech.  I wonder why he called for negotiations after being attacked.  I have told you that I am just a citizen, and I, therefore, cannot analyse this speech in depth.  However, I should like to point out to you that, that the president never displayed any interest in solving the refugee question.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would like to tender this document under D. NG7A. The same problem applies to the two other versions.  And I suggest that we adopt the same solution to these problems; that is we suggest that the Prosecution should help us to find the translations.  I shall immediately give them the  K-number, which is K0220772.  So, it will be D. NG7A for French; B for English, and C for Kinyarwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG7A, D. NG7B, and D. NG7C admitted) 
MR. MORLEY:
The helpful (unintelligible) behind me tells me that we do not have translation for the documents that we are using; it is only in existence in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, we will admit the document that you have.  If you get translations, we will adjust the admission to suit. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
So, in that case, I think we should maintain the numbering as indicated D. NG7.  And if at some point in the future we obtain translations then we shall list them as A, B and C; if that is all right with the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly. 
(Pages 27 to 36 by Donna M. Lewis)










1600H 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Once again, I would like to circulate a document, Exhibit 8, the speech by the president of the republic, dated 1st January 1994, to the witness.  It is Exhibit 8 on my list.  This document is in Kinyarwanda.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I see the document.  
Q.	This is, again, a speech by the president of the republic in 1994.  It is dated 1st January 1994.  I suppose because I do not speak Kinyarwanda that this was a message to the nation.  Did you listen to this New Year message by the president of the republic on that date? 
A.	Yes.  Usually on the 31st of December, he would make a speech, the head of state's speech, in an address to all Rwandans.  I do not barely recall if I heard that particular speech, but the speech must have been broadcast over the radio.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  We are going to deal with page 4, page marked 4, of the document.  And I will ask you to read -- because this is a language at this time around that you read -- I'd like you to read the second -- let us say the second paragraph, because the first word at the top of the page is the last word of a preceding paragraph on the previous page, the word -- the sentence that begins "Panya Rwanda."  I'd like you to read, and the interpreters will provide us with a translation.  
A.	"Rwandans, we must remember our brothers who were victims of this senseless war, that God should receive them, and that the blood that was spilled should be a source of understanding or harmony between Rwandans, and that it should be the beginning of peace among -- between all Rwandans.  We must remember their families.  We should draw a major lesson from this war, and with all our hearts we must be determined -- be determined --" 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	"-- so we should, with determination, know that there shall no longer be war in our country."  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  You have read out the paragraph.  I read the two speeches, the first at the very beginning of the war.  That was the first one.  Now we are in 1994 -- we are dealing with 1994, whereby President Habyarimana continues to call for harmony and entente.  This was in four years of war.  What is your comment following this -- the reading of this paragraph? 
A.	In that paragraph, Rwandans -- he's trying to reassure Rwandans.  He says we should remember those who gave their lives during these four years of war and that the solution is remembrance.  But nowhere does he say that perpetrators of their killing should be prosecuted.  If he had at least said that, I would have no problem with the speech.  If this is Habyarimana's speech on the 1st of January 1994, I would concede that, even if it was any other speech.  

You say the speech was made on the 1st of January 1994.  Normally, I would rather deal with handwritten documents.  There is nothing to prove that this document was read out on the 1st of January 1994.  

Now, as regards the speech, I agree with its content.  I am much more concerned by the fact that these speeches had to be put into action.  I do not doubt it is the president's speech, but the problem for me is that whatever he said in his speeches, none of this was manifested in action.  These speeches were made for the international community, but no action, no measures were taken in the country.  

I told you no one -- there is no one who can find proof to show me he was willing to halt the killings.  I, too, concede that these are his remarks, but the problem is that these theories never translated into action.  If he says people disobeyed him, what did he do to punish them?  It is, therefore, your prerogative to present a speech, but I have nothing to add to it. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, thank you for your elaboration, but I'd like to make it perfectly clear, or be perfectly clear about the period when the speech was made.  I would like you, in order to remove all doubt, to remove the first paragraph -- rather, to read the first paragraph of the speech.  It begins "Muri."  
A.	On what page, Counsel?  
Q.	The very first page, under "Habyarimana, Juvénal, President of the Republic."  
A.	Yes, I see that.  It says, "On this last day of the year, 1993."  You are, therefore, correct in saying that the speech was made on the 31st of December 1993.  
Q.	So we are in agreement.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Now, I would like to tender -- 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I agree.  I agree that this speech is authentic, although its content was never actually translated into action.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to tender this document as Exhibit D. NG8.  And because this is a text in Kinyarwanda, I wonder if I can make the same suggestion.  If there is no translation, we would like to put forward D. NG8.  And if translations are found subsequently, we would label French D. NG8A, the English, B, and the Kinyarwanda, C.  

I would request Mr. Morley and his assistant, Mr. Takeh, I'd like them to help me out in this regard.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence, D. NG8.
(Exhibit No. D. NG8 admitted) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have noticed that, in respect of security, we have gone through documents relating to the head of state.  You may also have noticed that in the first case -- in the first instance these were speeches that related to the single-party state period.  Do we agree? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you. 
Q.	Now, with -- with regard to the New Year's message that we have just read, we were in the thick of the multiparty system period.  Do you agree? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, I'd like us to go back to the year 1993.  Did you take part in the congress that saw the election of Mr. Ngirumpatse to the post of MRND president? 
A.	Yes, I took part in the 1993 congress. 
Q.	And you remained throughout the congress.  Were you present at all stages of the congress? 
A.	Yes, I followed all activities of the congress, right up to its closure, except that the congress did not take long.  It was just a matter of reading -- electing the national party leaders.  I think that was one of the items on the agenda. 
Q.	So you read -- you heard the president's speech being made after his election, the president being Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I remember he made a speech following his election. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'd like to ask the registry to provide the witness with item 9, that is, Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech to the -- to the MRND Extraordinary Congress of July 1993, as well as -- 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I have the document here before me.  
Q.	I would like you to go to page 2, paragraph marked 3.  Have you seen it? 
A.	Yes, I found the paragraph.  
Q.	Once again, I will ask you to read the paragraph.  It is a text in Kinyarwanda.  
A.	"Rwanda needs leaders who discuss things.  Our opponents are not enemies.  Apart from that, those who went to join other political parties in order to show what they're made of to others, this is not -- these people do not want the multiparty system.  They want the single-party system to prevail so that they can reach -- mistreat other people.  We will endeavour to meet others and hold talks with them so that we can discuss things together, things relating to the country's interests.  We will find ways and means of reaching an understanding whilst keeping in mind our party's manifesto."  
Q.	What is your comment, hearing this speech a second time, given that you heard it at the congress, whereby there is a call for dialogue and rejection of violence?  How does this paragraph strike you? 
A.	In that speech he was addressing the participants in the congress, MRND members.  As I have always said, Ngirumpatse is a very intelligent person who knows how to choose his words.  Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between what he says and what he thinks.  He says he wants dialogue on one hand.  On the other hand, he says these are opponents, and he asks us, or tells us, that these are people who do not want multiparty politics, and it is the RPF, the MDR, the PL -- there's no way of knowing who was after the single-party system.  

So I'd like to tell you that each MRND member gave this speech his own interpretation.  I cannot answer in his place, therefore, and tell you what or who he was thinking of.  I believe we were all there at the congress.  We were together with the Interahamwe and all those who are supporters of the MRND.  Now, as for Mathieu's words, unless there was some unforeseen circumstances, he would never have allowed himself to say anything negative.  As I said, he always spoke in riddles.  I can, therefore, not analyse his speech for you.  You have access to him and can ask him to explain what he meant to say.  I agree the congress took place and that he spoke to MRND militants on that day.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness, but there is a problem in the translation, slight problem.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I apologise to the booth for submitting the document at the very last minute, but there are nuances in the translation that are not quite correct.  I happen to have a French translation of the paragraph that I will quickly read for the record.  

"Rwanda needs to be led by persons who have a sense of dialogue --" 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry.  I'm on my feet briefly.  There's always a problem when there's a disagreement between what my learned friend has and what the translators say.  Might it make some sense for the translators to see the translation that my learned friend has, to see whether they agree it's probably right?  Because, otherwise, what my learned friend is doing is just putting in her own document, when we already know the translators say something different. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I quite agree with your position, my friend.  It is wrong to proceed this way.  As a matter of fact, in my bundle of exhibits, I had a translation that had been admitted by another chamber, which I really ought to have disclosed this -- which I really ought to have disclosed at the same time as the other documents I disclosed.  

I would, therefore, like Mr. Issa to give the booth and everybody else the document, which happens to be a translation titled "Speech by MRND President, Mathieu Ngirumpatse."  

And in the right corner of the document, there is a handwritten annotation.  It has dash 99 dash 52 dash T.  It is on the left, actually.  This is not my translation; it is a translation that was done in these proceedings and which had been admitted.  

This is a document I did disclose.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I don't want to take a bad point and hold things up.  If -- if this is an official translation that was used in another case, then we'll have it.  But I understood from what my learned friend was saying, was that she had her French translation of the Kinyarwandan.  What is the position?  Is the document she's going to be reading from a document which was used and exhibited in another case?
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, this document you have, and it is a translation that was admitted by the chamber in that particular trial.  But it is not an official translation.  It was a suggested translation, which was then accepted by the chamber.  That is why, when I disclosed the exhibit, I disclosed it together with the Kinyarwanda original, the translation that comes after it, and transcripts of the session where the same translation was admitted.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  This is too small a point to take up any more time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG9A and D. NG9B admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I think it needs to be -- the document needs to be given an exhibit number.  It is NG9A for the French, B for the Kinyarwanda.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, we are now going to deal with something that is a matter of importance to me.  It is your relationship with Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
A.	Yes.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a member of the MRND, just as I was a member, especially, or in particular, in the city of Kigali.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse hailed from Kigali and fought for the interests of all members of the population in Kigali.  I was also committed to the interests of the people I was leading.  

As for the relations between us, both of us came from Kigali, and we lived in the city of Kigali.  I would not pay him visits at his house, nor would he come to my house.  But we had developed friendly relations because of the MRND party.  We were like all other MRND members; we were all committed to obtaining power through the MRND party.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse needed our help, just as we needed him in regard to party affairs.  

I should also point out that, when a senior authority or official came from a certain préfecture, all other natives of that person's préfecture would come to see that person for assistance.  And that is how we would meet Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Even though we resided in the same city, the common denominator was, most of all, the MRND party.  
Q.	What was the year of your first meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	We knew each other before.  We both lived in the city of Kigali.  We elected him to join the team, 
	Kivu Sport, and I also was a supporter of the Kivu Sport team, so that was something we had in common at the time. 

When the MRND party was founded, in particular at the time of the elections, I began to talk to Mathieu.  So we started talking, especially when the MRND, the party authorities in the préfecture, the commune, at national level, began to operate.  That is when we started seeing each other, to debate the interests of the party.  
Q.	You have not given me the date of your first meeting.  
A.	I cannot remember the date of our first meeting.  If I give you the exact date, then it means that I may have had a clear-cut objective, whereas we met through -- or, because of the MRND party.  
Q.	But you must be able to give me a range.  In your answer you mentioned Kivu Sport, so try to recollect as -- so as to give me the date.  
A.	I'm not in a position to give you an estimate of the date.  He lived in Kigali, like all members of the population.  I also had been living in Kigali since 1960.  He was living there too, so it is not easy for me to tell you exactly when I met him.  I told you that we first came into contact with each other at inception -- or, rather, at -- when the MRND party was created.  It is thanks to the party that we had regular contact, especially because I would put problems to him, which he would listen to.  When he became a member of the MRND party, especially when we were defending the MRND's interests in Kigali, that is when we had personal relations. 
Q.	Could it be the year 1991? 
A.	We were organising elections at communal level, and I also met him when we organised elections at préfectoral level.  I remember talking to him as we prepared for elections at both préfectoral and communal level.  The problem is I do not exactly recall when communal elections were held.  If I could, I would be able to give you the correct -- or, exact date, but I cannot.  
Q.	In a previous sentence, you talked about Kivu Sport.  What is that? 
A.	It was a football team in the Kigali-ville préfecture.  I would often meet him because he was a fan of the team, like me.  Besides, Mathieu is one of the founders of the Kiyovu (sic) Sport team, and we all grew up in the team as supporters of the team. 
Q.	During your first meeting, what did you say to each other? 
A.	We talked about party matters.  We talked about the MRND.  I might meet him for other matters, but at that particular time, what we talked about was the MRND party. 
Q.	At that time what position did you hold in the MRND? 
A.	We were both militants of the MRND because -- because the party organs had not yet been set up. 
Q.	So you talked.  Can you summarise your conversation for us? 
A.	We talked about a great many things.  We talked about candidates, as I was myself a candidate for that election.  So you will understand that we talked about quite a few things.  And he offered us much support when we talked.  During the first elections, I was with him.  He was with us when -- after the commune elections -- so I talked with him, and so we talked about party issues.  We talked about how elections had been organised in the commune and in the préfecture. 
Q.	So this first meeting took place because there was an election campaign; is that what you're saying? 
A.	No, you are not making a mistake.  You are right.  I remember that we talked about party matters.  From that time, we talked about the party.  
Q.	And what position did Ms. -- Mr. Ngirumpatse have at that time? 
A.	I have just told you that he was a -- an MRND -- MRND party militant for Kigali-ville -- Kigali-ville préfecture, just as I was.  After the elections, the party organs were set up, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse was elected party president, or chairman, for Kigali.  It is we who voted for him, because I was one of the party members who was supposed to vote in Kigali-ville préfecture. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we've -- during your examination-in-chief, and the first part of your cross-examination, you have mentioned the close links between you and Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Could you, then -- you do not explain the details of that -- of those links.  You only give me answers that do not enable me to determine the closeness that you enjoyed vis-à-vis Mr. Ngirumpatse, and you have at one point said Ngirumpatse is a friend.  
A.	You can be friends because you have common interests.  You might meet someone, talk with this person, and become his friend.  So I think our friend (sic) sprung from something.  It has a basis.  If we met within a political party and we both supported this party and we liked the party, well, then we'd be friends.  

What I'm saying here is each friendship has a basis.  I've told you that he came from Kigali and so did I.  So I had to meet with him to talk about party matters.  He would listen to me, and I listened to him too.  Sometimes I would make proposals to him, and he would agree with them, and vice versa.  Sometimes I would ask him for assistance and he would provide it.  So he was my friend.  Unless you wish me to give details about all the things that he did for us -- all the things that he did for me -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Interpreter corrects. 
THE WITNESS:
-- he helped me as an individual.  He helped me as a -- an MRND militant.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I'll take your answers as you give them.  And I say that you had no links of friendship with 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
A.	When you talk about links of friendship, then perhaps you are talking about the friendship between a man and a woman.  Perhaps you mean that there was a special friendship between me and Mr. Ngirumpatse, but I tell you that the links between us were as follows:  He came from Kigali and so did I.  If you come from Ruhengeri -- if a person from Ruhengeri -- that is from Ruhengeri, then everyone from Ruhengeri will visit him.  If a person is from Gisenyi, then everyone from Gisenyi will go and visit them as their god.  

We looked on Ngirumpatse as a sort of senior figure for everyone who was in Kigali.  And I tell you that, at that time, if you needed a favour, you had to go through someone.  Knowing that 
Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse had once been director-general of SONARWA, I knew that if I needed a favour I should have to go through him.  

So you say that there was no link of friendship between me and Ngirumpatse.  I think you are making a mistake.  If your client has told you that, then he's lying to you.  He cannot say that I did not used to see him.  Take your answers as -- my answers as you wish.  If I were talking with him now, I would remind him of precise occasions when I met him and what we talked about.  If you want to run for elections and you do not look for support, well, no one will vote for you.  There was jealousy between people.  There were the people of Kibuye who wanted to elect someone who came from their préfecture, so one needed a godfather to back one.  
Q.	Witness, this is the opportunity you have to talk about your friendship.  So far you have only talked to me about your political connections.  Those are not links of friendship.  
A.	When it is said that someone has someone else as a friend -- I don't know how to explain this to you -- but I am telling you that I could reach Mathieu at any -- any time.  You asked me when I met him, and I told you that I met him at the communal congress and the préfectoral congress, where we elected him to the position of secretary-general.  And we went on electing him till he became chairman of the MRND.  

Perhaps you saw on the statement that I met with him when we talked about the problems of people who came from the city of Kigali or about the Muslims of the city of Kigali, who did not have any positions of authority in the higher echelons of the party.  These are examples I'm giving you.  I know that he knows what I'm talking about. 

When we gave Bizimana the position of bourgmestre, this is someone who came from Kigali.  And he knows the circumstances under which we made sure Bizimana got the position. 
Q.	When we talked about this matter, your relationship with Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Witness, you said to me -- you said to us, "I never went to his home.  I always met him within the context of elections in -- within the MRND."  

And I'm saying now that any militant of the MRND would have with Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse the sort of relationship that you are now describing.  So these -- these are not links of friendship that you describe to me.  
A.	All right.  You're seeing (sic) that these are not links of friendship.  All right.  You have the right to think of them as such.  If you tell me that all the 200,000 militants of the MRND in Kigali went to his friends -- went to his home, well, okay.  So they were his friends.  You can say what you like.  If I were not his friend, I would not be in this witness box talking about Mathieu.  You can take it any way you want, but I know Mathieu, and he knows me.  If he now denies me, well, that's up to him.  It is his right.  

You are saying well, he's talking nonsense.  He doesn't know Mathieu -- Mathieu.  I don't know what I should answer then, but I think I have given you some instances which should lead you to -- to understand that I know Mathieu.  I know that he denies what I say and that you, yourself, are denying what I say, but you are fully entitled to that.  However, I am telling you that I know him through the MRND.  And, thanks to this party, we became friends.  The important thing is that I used to meet him in the party, and we chatted.  I do not say that he needed to come to my home, but I know that he needed my vote in elections so that he could get elected. 
Q.	Obviously.  Every candidate in an election runs a campaign, and, of course, will meet future voters.  It does not, however, mean that a voter who is met, as such, becomes a friend.  
A.	I told you that each friend -- that a friendship starts from somewhere.  I could campaign for you, and, based on that, you become my friend.  You can display your gratitude.  I do not know whether you understand what "gratitude" means.  Somebody does you a good turn, and you become his friend.  

In any case, I understand how you wish to define the word "friendship," but the main thing to remember here is that I used to meet him and we used to see each other.  I cannot remember all the occasions on which I saw him.  If I were to describe all the occasions on which we met and what we talked about, well, I've given you examples, like when we talked about the problem of people who were born and bred in Kigali.  I know that Mathieu supported us, but he was looking for something.  He wanted something from us in exchange.  That is an example that I'm giving you.  

I have also given you the example of Bizimana, and he supported him to get -- so that we could get him to be bourgmestre of Nyarugenge.  When you saw a senior official -- when we had a senior official who came from our préfecture and who was looking for high office, we had to support him.  We used to consider this person as a god, in a way.  That is how Mathieu became one of the five figures of authority from Kigali-ville and Kigali rural, who had the ear of the public and who was someone that we asked much of. 
Q.	So Mathieu was considered as a god.  So you were God's friend, were you? 
A.	No, you didn't understand me.  People looked on him as a god.  I did not think of myself as the friend of God, but there were people who saw him like a small god, people who thought that nothing -- no one could do anything contrary to what Mathieu had said.  If he went to see President Habyarimana and he asked for something to be done, well, then Mathieu's will was done.  I have a god, but I do not see Mathieu as my god.  I cannot, because of my religious conviction, consider Mathieu to be a god, but other people thought of him as such. 
Q.	And it is because you are his friend that you're sitting here in the witness box to accuse him of things he did not do; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's what I was saying.  That is why Mathieu has denied me.  He told you that I was not his friend.  I am not accusing anyone.  I am giving testimony so that the truth will be known.  When you say that such-and-such a person is responsible for such-and-such an act and that I myself am responsible for other acts, it is to help so that the truth will come to light so that God can forgive us one day.  

One day you will see a child come and accuse his father or his mother.  I know that a friend is not as close to you as your child or your spouse, or your wife.  If a -- a child of mine had committed crimes and I said to him that these acts were evil, I do not see what there would be wrong with that.  I do not know whether I can sacrifice the truth because of this friendship.  I have chosen to tell the truth, and I am prepared to risk it that we shall no longer be friends.

1700H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I'd like to remind you of what you said to us three or four days ago, that is Wednesday -- Thursday or Friday.  You said that you do not hesitate to lie to save your skin. 
A.	Thank you.  I understand.  I understand.  You cannot say anything else.  It is your duty to say that I am lying.  I am telling you that I am not lying.  Your truth is to prove that I'm lying.  That is your job and I am telling you that I am not lying.  

We will let the arbiters decide -- we will let the Judges decide.  If my statement or my truth was not the real truth, I couldn't appeal against whatever decision was made.  So you're saying, "Witness, you are lying."  You have the right to say so, but I am not going to tell you that I am lying.  I -- I know that I'm telling the truth.  

So you must leave all of that to the Judges and they will decide.  They will know which of us is lying.  The person who will be found out or the person who will be found guilty will appeal, but I will not be appealing. 
Q.	Witness, let's be clear on this.  I am not saying that you're lying.  I am recalling for your benefit the words that you yourself spoke before the Trial Chamber.  
A.	A while ago you said that I am here to tell lies.  That is something you said.  Now you're changing what you said.  I agree with you if you say now that I am no longer a liar.  I have nothing to add to what you say.  I cannot say that I'm lying because I am not lying.  I will never grant you that; I did not come here to lie.  

So, I'm sorry because you say that you're not pointing an accusing finger at me.  I only answer the questions that you put to me.  Perhaps I -- all you want is -- is that I should say what you want.  I think that is where the problem is.  I have not answered the questions in the way that you wished.  So it will be up to the Judges to determine the matter.  I have tried to answer the questions that you have put to me.  If there are questions to which I have not answered -- to which I have not provided answers, it is because I did not know these answers. 
Q.	All right.  We shall try and move on.  I put it to you and I maintain my position that you are not a friend of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  When you use the word "friend" and "a close person," this word or this expression has no meaning whatsoever in your case? 
A.	It's very hard to explain oneself if you say that these are lies.  In Kinyarwanda when you say that somebody is a liar, it means you do not believe what he is saying or that this person is a fool.  So you say there was no friendship between myself and Mathieu, because if I were telling the truth, I would not be accusing Mathieu.  

Perhaps you think that friendship consists of coming here and trying to testify on behalf of Mathieu.  I think that the truth has come out.  Even if we were in some other venue sharing something, I would still not be prevented from denouncing him.  

For the time being, I must ask you to believe me when I say I considered him a friend.  However, the suggestion I make you are entitled to refute.  I'd like to point out, once again, that whenever I needed him, I had easy access to him.  And maybe because I'm testifying against him, you think that if Mathieu received me and had -- had received me and had spoken to -- to me that now I would not be here accusing him. 
Q.	Witness, you told us in examination-in-chief and cross-examination that Mathieu always welcomed you.  Now, if I am to understand the real nature of your reports, this was based -- or this should be based on your assertions.  
A.	Yes, I am telling you that Mathieu was a person I had easy access to, even though you continue to deny this.  Whenever I needed him, I could meet him.  You say that I made that declaration unilaterally, and I think you said this in defence of your position, and therefore, do not want to accept that what I'm telling you is the truth.  

I think you could simply tell me I'm not telling the truth and this is the truth of the matter; that you are recounting things that never happened in your country.  I will not insist that he was my friend, but at least you recognise that whenever I wanted to meet him, I could do it.  He was an official and I was also a leader, although I was at a lower level.  He would regularly receive me and he was a member of the national development council, elected by whom?  By us.  He was our spokesperson.  

In the Kigali-ville préfecture we elected him to be our spokesperson and he, therefore, had to agree to receive us whenever we needed to see him.  So perhaps, although you deny that there was friendship, I cannot make you agree that he was my friend. 

Mr. President, I think that is the answer I can give to the question that was put to me. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, I will deal with your telephone call on the 11th of April 1994, a telephone call you placed to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, which you say took place on the 11th of April 1994 to the Diplomat hotel.  In this context, it was important to verify your friendly relations.  Do you still maintain that you had a telephone conversation with Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 11th of April 1994? 
A.	I have already answered that question.  Maybe you did not quite understand me, but I still confirm that I called him by telephone.  Is there a problem or was there any difficulty in calling someone on the phone?  Here we are in the court and if someone wanted to call you, they could call you.  Therefore, I confirm that I called Mathieu Ngirumpatse and that we talked.  I know you do not want to believe me, that you insist he was not my friend.  So I called him on the phone.  He answered the phone.  And if you have proof I did not call him, go ahead and produce it.  I definitely called him.  
Q.	When -- at what time of the day did you get through to him on the telephone? 
A.	I explained -- I called him on the 11th.  So I said it was on the 11th, but I cannot recall the time we spoke.  We did not have to write each other.  It could have been 9, 11 or 4 p.m., but you can look at the record or the transcript.  I've already answered this question.  I may easily forget the answer I gave to the same question the first time the question was put to me.  However, when I was first questioned I did not think we would revisit this question.  However, I think I did cite the time that I telephoned him. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I know you have already answered the question, but your answers were not clear.  And that is why I am coming back to this -- coming back to the time you made the phone call on the 11th of April 1994.  
A.	When I was about to phone, I did not have to first look at my wristwatch.  I had not set a time to telephone him because I did not know I would be asked questions about the telephone call.  So I cannot tell you that it was at such and such a time.  I know just that it was on the 11th of April.  

You yourself say that it -- there's no progress to be made.  The Defence has maintained that I am a liar, and you are rehashing your learned friend's remarks.  It was fortunate that I remembered the date, but I cannot recall the time.  This was, after all, ten years ago.  I think the person who could know if there was no result and effect from the telephone call -- Counsel, perhaps you think I'm a very meticulous person and I am, therefore, wasting your time.  When you ask me questions about events that took place ten years ago, it's very difficult for me.  Of course there are dates I could never forget that marked me greatly; however, there are other events that I can no longer recall.  There are dates that are emblazoned in my memory.  These are events that took place in our country. 
Q.	It seems to me that we are, in fact, dealing with these important dates in relation to events in your country, and that is why I have taken the liberty to insist.  

Now, with regards the telephone call, can you tell me what you did the morning of the 11th of April 1994?  
A.	Many things.  I did many things that morning, and I cannot list them all down.  So I did not just telephone Mathieu.  I could have telephoned Mathieu and other people.  So I do not know if the fact or -- of calling Mathieu should constitute a memorable event.  But now with reference to unforgettable events, a single telephone call cannot establish Mathieu's guilt.  Therefore, I tell you I cannot remember the time because I had to draw up security reports.  I had to attend to the security situation in my secteur.  And I think what matters is -- what should be retained is the fact that I spoke to Mathieu, and I told you the content of our conversation.  There was no need for me to dwell on it further, because the answer he gave me was not satisfactory.  I cannot (sic) forget other dates like the 10th, the 12th, but this date I cannot forget.  It is something I can even tell my grandchildren.  

So it is very difficult for me to answer your question as to the activities -- my activities on the 11th in the morning, because I was not noting everything down in a diary.  There was no security.  People were dying.  Bodies were strewn all over Kigali on the 11th, the 12th, and so on.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am surprised that you clearly remember making the telephone call, but you have denied in just a few seconds -- a few minutes ago you said that this telephone call made the day memorable, and yet you're unable to tell us what time it took place.  
A.	You did not quite understand me.  Perhaps I did not express myself well.  I told you that there are two dates that I can never forget.  I did not say I could never forget the date I called Mathieu, because I only called Mathieu once.  I merely said that there are two dates I could never forget in relation to events in our country.  I said that there are two dates I could never forget, and you did not delve further into those two dates.  I said the two dates -- or events that occurred on those two dates I can even recount to my grandchildren.  Why forget or remember the 11th, the day I called Mathieu.  Nothing special happened on that date.  I did not even go into detail about the two dates I am referring to. 
Q.	I took notes about that, and I'd like to check them to be certain of what you said.  You said, "I cannot forget those dates.  I could forget the 10th or the 11th but not that one.  I will tell my grandchildren about it."  And that is why I asked the question.  
A.	I'm here to answer questions as put to me.  I am not here to dwell on a single issue.  I reiterated my answer.  I said that there are dates I cannot forget.  You say you took notes and that I said I could never forget the date of the 10th.  Now, if we talk about the 11th, if that is the date you noted, maybe that is to your client's advantage.  There is -- you know nothing about the two dates I mentioned.  I said that there are dates I will never forget, but the 10th, the 11th, and the 12th I could easily forget -- rather, I could easily forget the dates that occurred, the 16th, the 20th.  I may forget that.  I know that the killings lasted 80 -- 90 days, and therefore it is possible to forget what occurred on a daily basis.  Given the circumstances at the time, there is no one who would be in a position to do that unless that person who is a journalist, someone who took notes of events as they occurred.  And so that is the answer I gave, and you have your opinion of it. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let us make progress on the telephone call.  So you telephoned on the 11th.  You cannot remember the time, but you did telephone.  And were you put through directly to Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I answered that question.  I think I was asked this question.  Maybe each Defence counsel has his way of asking questions, but I thought the questions that were put to me by the preceding counsel had been noted by you and that you had understood the answers I gave.  If you were not satisfied, well, all right.  

I was -- I telephoned the Diplomat hotel.  The telephone operator came on the line.  So I did not phone straight to the room where Mathieu was.  The telephone operator connected me to Mathieu.  I did not know where he was.  I had no way of knowing where Mathieu was exactly. 
Q.	How long did your telephone conversation last? 
A.	I do not think it lasted more than five minutes because I explained the problem to him and he -- he said, "This should be left to relevant authorities."  I did not decide -- I decided not to stay on any longer.  I was told that they were very busy -- or, rather, we were very busy, and there was no way I could indulge in a 30-minute-long conversation on the telephone. 
Q.	What was the point of calling Mr. Ngirumpatse, president of the MRND, when you could have called the bourgmestre? 
A.	You are asking me what was the point of calling Mathieu Ngirumpatse rather than the bourgmestre.  The Interahamwe from the MRND party were killing people, so I put this problem to him.  I said that the Interahamwes posed a threat to security.  Perhaps you do not know how strong the Interahamwe were.  Even on that day, when I telephoned him, he said, "Leave this matter to the Interahamwe."  I was calling him in my capacity as an MRND party member.  I put the problem to him.  Instead of responding, he said, "Leave the Interahamwe to whatever they're doing."  You are referring to the Interahamwe, but the JDL members were also there.  The JDL, the Abakombozi were also busy killing people.  
Q.	In this last sentence, therefore, you are stating that people who killed were not members of the MRND -- I beg your pardon.  They did not just belong to the MRND, Interahamwe; you also mentioned the JDL and other youths.  
A.	Most of the killers in my secteur were Interahamwes.  So if the Interahamwes had not participated in the massacres, the massacres would not have taken place.  Interahamwe were working hand in hand with the authorities.  So if I am concentrating on the Interahamwe, it is not just because it was only the Interahamwe, it is because most of the killers in my secteur were Interahamwe.  However, there were also JDL and other youth group members.  However, if the Interahamwe had not taken part in the massacres, those massacres would not have taken place.  

So a time came when the leaders said that Hutus should not attack other Hutus, that they should only attack Hutus.  I have, therefore, always maintained that it was the Interahamwe killing people.  However, I know that in certain préfectures there were no Interahamwe, yet people were killed in those préfectures.  
Q.	In that conversation, that lasted barely five minutes.  I have lost the thread vis-à-vis the booth.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Counsel" -- says Kinyarwanda booth -- "you have not put a question yet.  You said, 'In those five minutes of conversation.'"  

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
There was an overlapping question.  That is why I was interrupted. 

But I see the time, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can find a convenient spot, it's just about time.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Let me put one last question, and we will stop there.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, therefore, in those five minutes of conversation, you told Mr. Ngirumpatse that the Interahamwe youths from other youth groups were killing.  
A.	No, I did not mention youth groups of other political parties.  I simply said that the Interahamwe were killing people, because I had seen a responsable de secteur -- or, rather, an Interahamwe leader in the secteur shoot someone dead.  So I wasn't going to tell him about the JDL.  Had I mentioned the JDL, the person to talk to would have been Karemera.  Therefore, I telephoned because I had just seen the Interahamwe leader in my secteur shoot someone dead.  And instead of giving me an answer, he said, "Leave this matter to the Interahamwe."  You say it lasted barely five minutes.  It did not last five minutes.  At any rate, once I put the problem to him, and after he gave me an answer, I stopped there.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, we can stop the session here for today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  

Mr. Witness, we come to the end of evidence today.  We take the adjournment now, and we resume tomorrow morning under the usual conditions of no discussion.  
MR. MORLEY: 
May I make an enquiry of my learned friends?  Between those representing Mr. Ngirumpatse and finally Mr. Karemera, is there any danger I'll be starting my redirect tomorrow afternoon?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, my dear friend, there is certainly such a danger.  I'd just like him to understand that I'm not yet finished so that he cannot start yet.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm grateful to my learned friend representing Ngirumpatse, but what about the position with Karemera?  All I'm asking is whether or not, in combination, my two learned friends are going to take up all of tomorrow.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, do you have any indication of how long you may be?  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, as you know, my cross-examination will depend on Ms. Chantal's cross-examination, but based on my estimate, I think I will take two, three or four hours at the most. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I would like to take the floor again to make it perfectly clear to the Prosecutor, I have just understood what you meant by his question; therefore, there is no risk that he will have to start his redirect tomorrow.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We take the adjournment now, and we resume tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
