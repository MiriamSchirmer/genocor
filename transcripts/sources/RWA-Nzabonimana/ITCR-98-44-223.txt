MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 23rd of January 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before we begin, I would like the witness to remove his headset, if you please.  

This is just a matter that I would like to clarify, and I would like to ask whether it is well to raise the point now or whether I should wait for the witness to finish giving his testimony.  This is in regard to passages that were supposed to be redacted.  I have just asked the Trial Chamber coordinator about this, and I would like to talk about this point with the Trial Chamber to clearly indicate what the Prosecution's position was in regard to what was said during the last session on Friday.  I do not know whether we should discuss this now or whether we should wait for the witness to finish giving his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't think that the point will be affected whether we discuss it now or a bit later, and perhaps it might be better to complete his testimony and then we can make arrangements at the end.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think the last time when we -- the witness gave evidence, a request was made that some parts of the witness testimony be redacted.  I think the Prosecutor had objected.  The Trial Chamber had decided that this part would not be completely redacted, and that all that needed to be done was to place them under seal and so both parties would have access to them, because the aim of the redaction was to keep the witness's identity from public record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, you obviously misunderstood what I was suggesting.  I was suggesting that we should have this discussion after the witness has completed his testimony.  I'm aware of the issue that you have raised, because when it was discussed with the trial coordinator, I asked her to make certain the parties were notified about it.  So we will come to it during the course of -- a little later.  
MS. FALL:
No problem, Mr. President.  We'll do this later.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, kindly put back on your headset.  Yes, good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began last week.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
WITNESS 2/18
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  We're in open session, I remind you.  

	Now, last Friday we dealt with, if I can put it like this, general matters about who you were and your -- and some other general matters you might recall.  And we'd left your evidence at the point where I was coming to ask you to tell the Judges about what you had seen and witnessed yourself in your secteur, following the murder of President Habyarimana, and to explain to the Judges how it was that the genocide, the killing of Tutsis, came to start, what caused it, what kicked it off, why did it happen there.  And I want you to take it, if you will, from the day after President Habyarimana's been murdered, so we're talking the 7th of April 1994.  The day after his death, did you notice any change or any difficulties in the atmosphere and the -- in what was going on where you were living?  
A.	Yes, I observed changes after the death of President Habyarimana.  First, we heard on the radio instructions being given to the effect that we should stay in our homes.  Afterwards, we began to hear explosions in the city of Kigali and in Kanombe, but we did not hear these explosions in our immediate vicinity until the 12th, when we began to hear gunfire in our area.  
Q.	Now, you were at that time a member of MDR.  Did you have any particular -- 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you have any -- 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the MDR. 
Q.	Did you have any particular concerns at all about your position in the circumstances of the president's death, or not?  
A.	Yes, as a member of the MDR, I had concerns because each time members of -- each time members of the MDR (sic) were displeased, we would suffer the consequences of this displeasure. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness, says the Kinyarwanda interpreter, spoke too quickly and we were not able to get all the information that he gave.  Could he please be requested to slow down?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me, Mr. Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
So I was saying that I had concerns about -- after the death of the president. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is the Judge addressing you.  Can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreter has requested that you speak a bit more slowly because they're having difficulty in translating everything that you are saying.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You were saying that you had some apprehensions after the death of the president because of the way in which MRND people viewed the MDR people.  And was anything at all said to you by the local people at the time that reflected that concern that you had?  
A.	On the morning of the 7th I met a lady called -- a lady called Immaculée Annunciata Mukakamanzi, and she asked me to buy her a drink because we had obtained our objective.  So I deduced that, as a member of the MDR, I had problems and that this would happen to the other members of the MDR as well because the MDR had said that there would be shouts of joy when the president would no longer be in power.  So I decided to take my children and put them in a safe place.  
Q.	And where was that safe place? 
A.	I took them to *********** cellule in the home of someone called ********.  
Q.	And from what we've heard and from what you, in fact, told us last week, Kibobo itself is down by Lake Muhazi or by a stream that goes by Lake Muhazi down on the valley floor, on the Muhazi side of where you live.  Can you confirm that that's correct?  
A.	No, that is not it.  I live on ********************************, and Kibobo is near this river that flows into Lake Muhazi.  So Kibobo is not close to my home.  This means that I couldn't see what was going on in Kibobo. 
Q.	Yes.  I think then there had been a bit of loss in translation there, but I don't take the matter further.  So you took the children to ********* for safety on the 7th.  Did you stay there yourself or not?  
A.	I returned to my home, but I monitored the situation closely.  Since the sorghum was almost ready for harvest, I tried to hide in sorghum farms, but from time to time I would come out to see whether the assailants had got to our home.  But I observed that assailants had not yet reached our area, but refugees from other areas were coming to our locality. 
Q.	Were these refugees Tutsis or Hutus or a mixture?  What was the position? 
A.	These were refugees of various ethnic origins.  
Q.	Now, did a time come when those refugees, or some of those refugees, were murdered?  And if so, can you tell us what you saw? 
A.	Yes.  Around -- on the 12th of April, some of the refugees were killed.  This is how they died.  On the 12th of April, a Daihatsu vehicle coming from Rutunga secteur and carrying soldiers from the former army, driven by someone called Munyambibi, came to the centre where I lived.  And the people in the vehicle said that they had seen many refugees with their livestock, and they asked us why we had not taken the livestock and eaten it.  Then they asked us to set up a roadblock at that place.  

Since I was frightened, I went forward to get a piece of wood so that we could set up that roadblock.  Since I was frightened, I wanted to show those people that I sympathised with their pain, the pain they felt on the death of the president.  When I went to get this piece of wood, I was in the company of ************ who was a refugee who had come to take shelter on our hill.  *********** told me that he did not have an identity card.  I suggested that he and I should go to the secteur office so that we could ask the conseiller for an identity card, so that he could feel at ease around the roadblock.  

When we got to the secteur office, we did not find the conseiller.  So the refugees who were in the secteur had been transferred to the Protestant primary school, and other refugees had scattered all over in Kayanga and other locations.  So we left the secteur -- 
Q.	Can you pause there a moment?  Just pause there a moment -- 
A.	-- and we went towards the primary school. 
Q.	It's just that some people may be trying to keep a note of what you're saying, writing something down, and it's difficult if we don't have a short pause.  Just wait a moment.  

So, some of the refugees who hadn't fled elsewhere were at the Gikomero Protestant parish, and I remind you again, Mr. Witness, this is a place that we know and the Judges have visited recently, if that helps you in your account.  Just pause a moment.  So what happened then?  Did you go to the parish or -- what happened?  Take it up from where I interrupted you, if you can.  You were telling us that -- 
A.	So I was getting to the point where we left the secteur, that is ********************* and I, and we went to the primary -- Protestant primary school.  We hoped to find the conseiller there.  We thought that he would be with the refugees because it is he who had authorised their transfer from the secteur office to the Protestant primary school.  

When we got to the school I asked people to tell me where the conseiller was.  I learnt that the conseiller was not around and that he apparently had gone to Gasagara, to the small trading centre known as Muninya, so we abandoned our quest.  And so I began to talk with the refugees who were at that place because some of these refugees lived where my grandfather, my maternal grandfather, had his home, or lived near there.  So we spent about an hour and a half at that place, talking with these refugees.  

After that time we returned to the place where we had set up a roadblock, but on our way we met Interahamwe coming from Ndera, in the former Rubungo commune.  There was a large crowd of people walking behind the Interahamwe.  Some of them were carrying traditional weapons.  I asked them why they were running behind these vehicles.  They informed me that the Interahamwe had ordered them to follow them, the Interahamwe.  Also, they said that anyone who did not follow the Interahamwe would be considered as an accomplice and would pay the price for it.  So I told these people that this was a pack of lies.  Since I was considered as an accomplice myself, I was forced to follow them.  

So we got to the small trading centre of Rupangu, and that is where I saw a policeman from the former Gikomero commune, a man called Ngarambe, shoot a Tutsi whose name was Pascal Turatsinze.  So he shot him and he killed him immediately.  
Q.	Can you just pause there a moment, please? 
MR. HOOPER:
Turatsinze is spelt T-U-R-A-T-S-I-N-Z-E.  Ndera is spelled N-D-E-R-A, and Muninya is spelt M-U-N-I-N-Y-A. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you described the group of people following Interahamwe.  Were these Interahamwe in vehicles or not, and did you recognise any of them or not? 
A.	Amongst the Interahamwe I was able to identify policemen of the Rubungo commune.  These Interahamwe were on board four vehicles.  Those who were on foot were those who were gathering the population so that the -- it would follow the vehicles.  Obviously, some members of this group were going of their own volition, but others were being forced to follow these killers.  
Q.	So, in the trading centre, you see the murder of that person.  Were any other people killed while you were there?  
A.	Yes.  A second person called Leonard Muramba was killed.  After that murder, I saw another body.  After that, we left that place to head for the Gikomero Protestant primary school.  But before we got to the school, a man called Edouard Gashikazi, who had been shot by a communal policeman called Nduweyezu, was also killed.  When the refugees heard the gunshot, the refugees who were in the primary school fled, or at least some of them, I meant.  Since the refugees had much livestock, the Interahamwe were unable to shoot at the running refugees.  The Interahamwe preferred to shoot at the larger livestock that was at the primary school.  So these cows were killed outright.  The refugees that were not able to flee sought refuge inside the primary school and locked themselves in.  

After the death of the cows, the Interahamwe broke down the doors of the primary school.  They dragged the refugees out and put them in front of the door to the workshop.  This was the workshop that was used during the school reforms.  So the Interahamwe said this: "If anyone knows that he's one of us, he should separate himself or he should move apart from this group. ."  There is a lady called Mukakarangwa, Theodette Mukakarangwa, who was carrying a child on her back, and who was showing her identity card.  This was a new identity card; it was a brand new ID card.  And she came over to our side.  The Interahamwe said to this lady, "What were you waiting for to separate yourself from this group?"  And so the Interahamwe took a grenade and tossed it into this group of refugees that was bunched around this workshop.  Some of these refugees died and others were wounded 
Q. Could I just interrupt you there, please?  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just deal with some of the spelling, and please, if the booth think I've got it wrong, can they correct me?  Mukakarangwa, M-U-K-A-K-U-R-A-N-G-W-A (sic), Theodette, T-H-E-O-D-E-double T-E.  Gashikizi, I think was G-A-S-H-I-K-I-Z-I.  I wasn't too clear of the man who murdered him, Nduweyezu, N-A-Y -- 
THE WITNESS:
Nduweyezu. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Perhaps you can spell it for me, Nduweyezu, N-A-Y-A-W-E-Z-A -- ZU. 
A.	Nduweyezu is spelled as follows: N-D-U-W-E-Y-E-Z-U.
MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Thank you very much for that.  So there's been a separation of the refugees and you've told us what happened to Theodette -- well, you've told us that she had separated herself from the group, that that group was then -- then had a hand grenade thrown into it, causing the death of some of the group.  I was unclear as to whether Theodette had escaped that fate or not.  Was she put back in the group or did she remain out of the group? 
A.	Theodette stayed in our group, and later she went down to go back home; so she returned to her residence.  And, subsequently, I learnt that when she got home, the locals where she lived took away her child -- came to take away her child, and subsequently asked her to kill it herself, but she refused. and to one of the people who asked her to kill her child herself, she offered some money, and that person accepted to kill the child for her.  And then she went to Ndera commune, where her brother was a policeman, and his name was Théogene, and that Théogene is, moreover, still alive.  And when Theodette got to the commune office, she didn't find her brother there, and I learned that it was there that she was killed.  
Q.	So it was the Protestant school and the attack underway, hand grenade thrown into the crowd.  And just so that we're plain, is this something you learnt about later, or was it something you saw yourself?  
A.	It isn't information that was given to me.  I told you that at the beginning of the attack, I met the attackers and joined that group, so I was part of the group of attackers wherever they went.  Whether it was Rupungu or the Protestant school, I was with that group. 
Q.	And how did the events progress at the Protestant school after that? 
A.	After the attackers had thrown the grenade among the group of refugees, some died on the spot; others were injured, wounded.  And the Interahamwe ordered the locals who were following the events -- and I was among them -- they forebade any more grenades being thrown and told the villagers, the locals, to finish off, to dispatch the wounded.  So we threw ourselves on them, but when we got to them, the Interahamwe told us to come back and cut up the cows that had been killed and to load the meat onto the Interahamwe vehicles.  And I was among those sent to butcher the cattle, but since I didn't have a machete, I helped those who had machetes to finish the work.  And I would name among them ************** who I particularly assisted.  

So they were butchering the cattle, cutting it up in pieces, and we were loading the haunches and quarters of meat on the vehicles.  After that the Interahamwe asked the locals not to loot, not to pillage, and only two girls they'd brought with them from the roadblock at Rudakubukirwa were allowed to enter the houses where the refugees had put their belongings, and those girls took what they wanted; and as they were girls, they were interested, rather, in the clothes.  

And after, they got in the vehicles with a girl who had survived whose name was Justine Nirere, and the girls, as well as Nirere, Justine, went off with the Interahamwe.  And the locals who stayed there, we shared what was left of the cows that had been butchered, but I personally did not take any meat from that cattle -- those cattle.  I merely took a calf -- 
Q.	Can I interrupt you there -- 
A.	-- of a foreign type. 
Q.	Let me butt in there, please, and just go over some spelling.  Mr. Witness, you can help with us some of that.  *********? 
A.	***************. 
Q.	Rudakabukirwa, please.  
A.	Rudakabukirwa is not the name of a person; it's the name of a place. 
Q.	Yes.  I think it's R-U-T-A-B-A-K-A-K-A-R-E.  
A.	Rudakabukirwa, R-U-D-A-K-A-B-U-K-I-R-W-A, R-U-D-A-K-A-B-U-K-I-R-W-A.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, the attack by these people that you joined in, how long did it last at the parish, at the Protestant parish?   
A.	The attack at the Protestant school lasted from 25 to 30 minutes. 
Q.	And approximately how many people were killed, in your reckoning?  
A.	As the victims that I saw were those who were in the courtyard and I didn't see the corpses of those who were killed who fled from the courtyard, but I saw something between 10 and 30 corpses. 
Q.	Are you aware of a later exhumation of bodies from the pit in which they were placed? 
A.	Yes.  The bodies were exhumed.  I was there a few days after I was released, and I absolutely had to be at that ceremony.  So I attended, and the bodies were dug up from the mass grave and 55 bodies were exhumed at the time.  But, later, six more corpses were exhumed, so, in all, 61 bodies were exhumed at that place. 
Q.	You told us last week that -- I think it was the 13th -- by the 13th, the RPF had encircled the commune.  Can you just confirm, was that the date you gave, or is it another date that you say they'd encircled the commune by?  
A.	Gikomero commune was taken by the Inkotanyi-RPF on the 13th, but they were -- they got to my hill on the 15th of May. 
Q.	Just a final matter.  You mentioned Bernard, Lis -- I think it was Liserurande, who was the Rubungo -- 
A.	Liserurande, Bernard.  He was leading the Interahamwe who came from Ndera because he was the deputy brigadier of the communal police. 
Q.	You told us that he's still alive and living in prison in Remera; is that correct? 
A.	No, not Remera prison, because prisoners from former Rubungo commune were transferred to Rilima prison.  Bernard Liserurande is now in Rilima prison. 
Q.	Can you spell the Lima (sic) prison please?  Is it Lima?  I didn't quite catch that.  
A.	Rilima is spelt R-I-L-I-M-A, R-I-L-I-M-A. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness adds it's in Bugesera, in the Bugesera region.  Bugesera.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you referred to him last week as having also confessed to matters in Gacaca; is that correct? 
A.	I don't think I spoke of that, because when we were detained together at ********* prison, he was called several times, because my testimony and that of other people from Gikomero often mentioned that name, and on the basis of the procès-verbal, the minutes of our interviews, the authorities noted the name often occurred, and the prison director called him frequently to explain the events which he was accused, but he never pleaded guilty.  And until my departure, he was still there and still refusing to plead guilty.  But I don't know what happened to him when he got to Rilima prison. 
Q.	I apologise, I think I've confused you with an earlier witness; I'm sorry.  Those are all my questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony will now continue and you'll have to answer questions from the Prosecutor.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Agreed, Mr. President.  
MS. FALL:
May I begin, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I should like to go into closed session for a short while, maybe about ten minutes.  It shouldn't take too long.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the Chamber goes into closed session.  For the benefit of the members of the public, this is to protect the identity of the witness.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 10 to 14] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)  
(Pages 1 to 9 by Karen Holm)





















MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Ms. Fall, do you have an idea of your duration?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I wouldn't want to advance any estimate, but I will say another hour or so might do, perhaps less, depending on the witness, because I would just like to focus on the main points that are of interest to us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'd just indicate that it's unlikely that I'll have a witness for the Court tomorrow or Wednesday, because the witness that was due to come -- I'll give the information to Mr. Fry rather than go into closed session now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
I've got a witness after this one.  There is a witness after this one, waiting, I hope, just back there.  It was -- who I'd anticipated we might finish today, but it looks unlikely we will.  But I haven't got further witnesses.  That's really what I meant to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Ms. Fall, it's 10:30.  Perhaps this might be an appropriate time to take our short morning recess.  
MS. FALL:
That is what I was going to suggest, Mr. President; I wanted to suggest that perhaps we should take our break now.  
(Court recessed from 1026H to 1102H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The session can now resume.  

Mr. Witness, your cross-examination will be continued.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel appears to be having some difficulty, but even the microphone is off, so I couldn't get it all.  Sorry.  

MS. FALL:
We're all right now.  Excuse me.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, Witness, I will pursue this cross-examination by asking again if you can hear me because I seem to have lost the sound from my earphones.  

Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may continue, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, in your testimony before this Trial Chamber, you said that you took -- went somewhere to put your children in safety, and then you returned to your secteur to see what was happening there.  You also stated that on the 7th of April you heard that the president had died.  Had you before -- I will come back to this -- did you make any statement to André Rwamakuba's Defence team? 
A.	Yes, I did make statements. 
Q.	Do we agree that the first statement was on November -- in November 2002, the second was in August 2003? 
A.	Well, I don't remember the precise dates, but I know that I did meet them on those two occasions. 
Q.	Those are the dates on your statements, and were there any error, I am sure the Defence lawyers would rectify it.  So, going by your statement after the death of the president, after you heard about the death of the president, you did not stay at home on the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	No, I did not stay home.  I told you that I met one Annunciata Mukakumanzi, and when I met her, I was not at home. 
Q.	You said that you heard the announcement over the radio of the death.  Was the population not asked to remain at home, to remain indoors? 
A.	Yes, the communiqué asked everyone to stay home, but they did not post sentries to prevent us from leaving our homes. 
Q.	So there was no reason for you to stay home; there was no reason of lack of public safety? 
A.	Well, I was given to understand from the communiqué that we had to stay in our cellule, that we shouldn't leave our cellule, but we could leave our home.  I thought perhaps that leaving the secteur for another secteur might be dangerous, but to leave one's house in the near vicinity, I felt that that was normal. 
Q.	In respect of what was stated here by other witnesses, both Prosecution and Defence witnesses, it has been suggested that people were asked to stay home and not to go out and about.  
A.	Well, that's what the wording of the communiqué was, but in respect of us, the members of the MDR, that could be risky, and as a person who had his reason, his mind, I had to go out and about to see what was going on.  I've already told you, I met that lady, Annunciata, and from my conversation with her -- had I not had my conversation with her, I wouldn't have known that I was threatened and I would have been at risk.  That is why, moreover, I decided to take my children away. 
Q.	You have stated here before the Trial Chamber that you left your house because you wanted to see what was going on and what was the state of public safety, order and safety; yet that is not what you said when you were questioned on -- in August 2003.  In that statement you said that you went out because you were building a house and you went to look for some wooden supports, beams, or something like that.  Is that not what you stated? 
A.	Yes, that is quite correct.  On that day I went to look for those wooden beams or supports, and that's when I met that woman.  I went to get those wooden beams, but I didn't use them when I found out that my life could be at risk.  
Q.	So what you have stated now, that it was to go out to see what was happening, that was not correct; it was especially to get those wooden beams or supports for your building site? 
A.	But, listen, if you can understand what I'm saying, even if I were looking for wooden beams, I found out that after the death of the president, we in the opposition could be at risk.  My life and that of my children might be at risk. 
Q.	Once more, Witness, knowing that your life and that of your children was at risk, you decided to take your children to safety at the place you have described, whereas you came back.  So you personally were not in a position of insecurity that would oblige you and all of your family to stay in a place of safety.  
A.	I did not leave my secteur.  I put them in a safe place, in another cellule, but I did not leave my secteur. 
Q.	Once more, Witness, if you left that safe cellule to come back to your cellule, you were running certain risks, but it's because you knew that you would not be in a risky situation and that was in order to take part in the crimes that were being committed, as we shall demonstrate.  
A.	No.  There was no killing in my cellule on that day, nor even in subsequent days.  I told you that the killing, generalised killing, began throughout the secteur on the 12th.  I told you that we were afraid because we were members of an opposition party and did not agree with our MRND neighbours. 
Q.	I shall come back to that killing.  I would like to quickly come back to the 9th.  In your statement of 2003, you said that a car -- a vehicle arrived from Rubungo; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  On the 9th that vehicle arrived in the morning, but before that vehicle there were refugees, and the vehicle came after the refugees.  People from the Remera area came to our place, came to Gikomero, set themselves up as refugees, and the vehicle came to take them home, back home. 
Q.	So, can you tell us, who were the people in that vehicle? 
A.	I don't know who were the people in that vehicle, but I did see among them someone wearing a military uniform, but I did not know the occupants of the vehicle. 
Q.	And that vehicle that you state came from Rubungo and took some people away, went off, and can you tell us exactly where they went off to? 
A.	If I say the vehicle came from Rubungo direction, it's because the road entering our secteur comes from the Rubungo side because it's the only road that comes into our secteur.  And on the way back, the vehicle took the same route that it followed in; it went back the same way it had come. 
Q.	At one point or another, were you informed by those people from whence they had come?  
A.	You mean that soldier?  
Q.	Yes, indeed, Witness.  
A.	That soldier did not give me any information as to where they had come from, but when they came, they found us where we live and asked us how they could contact the councillor, conseiller de secteur, and we told them that he didn't live very near.  We showed him in which direction to go, and then he went over to where the refugees were, and he took a few people and put them in the vehicle and went on his way. 
Q.	If -- turning to your statement of the 8th of August 2003, I read as follows, and I quote, "He did not tell me from where they had come, except that they had come from Remera side, which is where he set off to afterwards."  Do you remember having stated that? 
A.	That is indeed what I stated, and I assert further here today that the car came from the Rubungo side when it entered Gikomero secteur, and when it left, it went back the same way it had come, in the same direction from which it had come. 
Q.	We understand each other full well.  You did say that it was from Rubungo side, but did give -- supply -- provide further information by saying that it had come from Remera.  So how did you know about Remera?  Where did that item of information come from? 
A.	The people who had come to seek refuge there told us they had come from Remera because that's where there had been acts of violence and gunshots.  So they fled from Remera to come to Gikomero, where they stayed for one or two days.  And that's when that vehicle came and picked up the old people.  The other members of the group went under their own steam -- under their own steam, but the vehicle had picked up the feebler old people, old ladies especially, and had taken them.  
Q.	Once more, Witness, this is a contradiction.  It was not the refugees.  In your statement you state that it was the soldier that provided you that information, as we have demonstrated.  

I shall now quickly pass over the ensuing days until the 12th, which is the date that concerns us.  You tell us that on the 10th other refugees came; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Are you in a position to tell us the total number of refugees who came? 
A.	No, I am not in a position to give you the number because they came in several waves:  Some came during the day, some came during the night, and there were those that I saw and those that I could not see.  But they were numerous, and that is why they were taken from the sectoral office to a larger place, because the group of refugees had become very numerous. 
Q.	You say they became very numerous.  Approximately, can you tell that there were more than 50, 100, 200?  Could you give us a fork (sic), a maximum and a minimum? 
A.	There were more than a hundred.  
Q.	Witness, we are coming to the date of the 12th, which personally interests me.  You have stated that the refugees were transferred to the Protestant parish.  Can you tell us precisely, or approximately, at what time they were transferred to the parish? 
A.	I am not in a position to give you the time because I was not present at the time of the transfer.  All I know is that they were transferred on the 12th, but I was not present during the actual transfer of those refugees. 
Q.	So, what you heard about the refugees who were transferred to the parish, contrary to what you state in August 2003, this was information that was given to you? 
A.	Yes, it was an information provided to me because when I was told about the transfer, they told me that some refugees had gone on to Kayanza and others had gone to the Protestant parish.  When the policeman Ngarambe shot in the air, fired in the air, and after he have fired into the air, the refugees decided to go to the parish, whereas others went on to Kayanza.  Otherwise they did not initially want to leave the sectoral office. 
Q.	So you confirm that, contrary to what you seem to be saying here, you were not present but it was information given to you? 
A.	Yes, it was information given to me. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us at what time the vehicle driven by one Munyambibi arrived? 
A.	The vehicle driven by Munyanbibi arrived in the morning, between 7 and 9 a.m.  I did not look at my watch, but it was in the morning time, the forenoon. 
Q.	And where were you at that time? 
A.	I was at home, because I live next to the road. 
Q.	And what would you say is the approximate distance from your house to the road, remembering that you were shown a sketch in the course of your examination-in-chief?  
A.	The enclosure is by the road, but the house is set back a bit, so it is about 15 metres from the road, but the enclosure is only 5 metres. 
Q.	If we refer to the sketch, are there or are there not buildings between you and the road? 
A.	Yes, because I live in a trading centre.  There's a road heading for the sectoral office that goes through the trading centre.  Part is on the left, part is on the right.  And another road goes to Munini, and between me and that road, there's another local inhabitant, which is the first house in the trading centre. 
MR. HOOPER:
Please be careful in respect of identification.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Counsel Hooper.  That does not slip my mind.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I should merely like to ask the witness those houses which I have not located and which he recognised, did -- was a bit of a screen between him and the road, did prevent him from having a very good view of everything happening on the road?  
A.	No, those houses did not screen the road, were not in such a position as to prevent me from seeing what was happening on the road.  And when you are at home within my enclosure, you can see the road very clearly and what is happening there.  
Q.	You say that the vehicle arrived between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., and yet in your statement you put that event at about noon.  
A.	No.  At about noon other Interahamwe arrived.  Between 12 noon and 2 p.m., other Interahamwe arrived, but as regards the vehicle with the soldiers coming from Rutunga, that one arrived between 7 and 9. 
Q.	I think that if we read the transcript and your statements, we will have a clearer idea, because in your statement of the 8th of August 2003, you do say that, about noon, the vehicle driven by Munyambibi arrived, carrying about 15 soldiers.  That is what is in your statement.  It is true that there are several contradictions, even in that statement of 2003.  But we'll come back to that.  

So what happened after?  What did the soldiers do?  
A.	When the vehicle arrived, the soldiers spoke to us and asked us whether the group of refugees with cattle had passed by us, and asked us why we had not taken the cattle.  And we said we did not take the cattle because it wasn't ours.  Whereupon the soldiers ordered us to set up a roadblock, and I told you that I and one ***************** went to cut down some wood to make a roadblock at that place.  
Q.	Can you tell us exactly where you set up that roadblock? 
A.	We set up the roadblock on the road running up to the trading centre ***********. 
Q.	Can you tell us who were the people manning that roadblock? 
A.	All the people -- all the inhabitants of the trading centre took turns at the roadblock, as well as other local - locals -- as well as other local inhabitants. 
Q.	Of course, it is understood that you were present at the roadblock and that you were, in fact, one of the leaders at the roadblock, as it were.  You did say that ************************* that brought wood to set up the roadblock, didn't you? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Were people killed at the roadblock? 
A.	No, no one was killed at the roadblock. 
Q.	So what was the purpose of the roadblock, can you tell us? 
A.	This roadblock was important for other reasons -- had no other reason.  We set it up because the soldiers wanted us to, and it did not last long.  There was killing on the 12th, but on the 13th -- on the 13th, the roadblock was still there.  However, on the 14th, it was dismantled. 
Q.	(No interpretation)  
A.	Nothing happened at the roadblock.  It was set up at the request of soldiers, but they said that this roadblock would be used to stop refugees who would go past there, and their livestock.  So, after the roadblock was set up, there were no other refugees that came past; only Interahamwe came by that way.  
Q.	So no refugee went past the roadblock.  You took no cows.  So this is what you wish the Trial Chamber to believe, is it? 
A.	The livestock that was butchered or killed in the parish was used by people to build up their meat reserves, but the reserves were only built or constituted from the livestock that had been killed at the Protestant school. 
Q.	Were the soldiers -- or did the soldiers who asked you to set up the roadblock stay with you all the time? 
A.	No.  They ordered that the roadblock should be set up, but they left and I could not find out where they went.  I never saw them again. 
Q.	So staying as a leader at the roadblock and staying with other people was not due to any constraint whatsoever; it was the result of a personal decision to do so?  
A.	I did not say that I stayed at the roadblock all the time.  Because after I set it up, I told you that I went with ********* to ask the conseiller for an attestation to replace the identity card that he had lost.  And I told you that on our return, on our way back, we met Interahamwe, followed by a crowd of civilians, and we learned that the Interahamwe had said that if anyone had -- if anyone refused to follow them, he would be considered as an accomplice.  And since I was a member of a party that was already considered as a body of accomplices, I followed the Interahamwe who were on board that vehicle, and I no longer returned to the roadblock. 
Q.	(No interpretation)  
A.	I told you that I came across the Interahamwe between midday and 2 p.m.  It is around that time that they came to our locality, and that is when I met them. 
Q.	Can you tell us how these Interahamwe came to your secteur? 
A.	Yes, I'll explain briefly.  
Q.	I'm sorry, I shall interrupt you.  Were they on board a vehicle?  That's what I meant.  
A.	Yes, they were in four vehicles. 
Q.	Can you tell us from what direction these vehicles came? 
A.	Yes, I can.  Because of the group of people that was following them and based on my knowledge of the area, which I knew well, I can deduct that they came from Bumbugo, Jurwe, Gikomero.  And I myself lived in Gikomero.  
Q.	So they came from Bumbugo, Jurwe, and they got to Gikomero; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, if I refer to your statement, you say that you did not return to the roadblock and that you met the Interahamwe on your way, but if we look at your statement once more, we observe that there is a contradiction.  You say that the Interahamwe got to the roadblock, and that is when you met with them.  That's what it says.  
A.	No, I did not meet with them at the roadblock and it is not at the roadblock that they found me.  We met at the -- in the space between the school and the roadblock, at around the home of a person known as Pierre Gashuri. 
Q.	Your statement is very clear, and we shall refer to it in due course, as all the parties have a copy of it.  You say that the Interahamwe -- and I'm referring to the statement of 2003, you say 2 p.m.  The one of 2002, you say that they arrived at 10 o'clock.  So there's contradiction, and I would like to know what the truth is.  So you are saying that the Interahamwe ordered you to follow them to the Protestant school.  And I am putting the question for the last time:  Did you say any such thing at any time?  
A.	In my statement of 2002 and 2003, there is a slight difference because, in 2002, I was still in detention.  And the other people who were with me in prison questioned the time that I gave, but when I left prison I talked with other people, and I was convinced they had come at around 2 p.m., especially as they didn't spend much time in the parish.  So I can confirm that the Interahamwe did not get there in the morning but, rather, in the afternoon.  That is why there is a difference between my statement of 2002 and my statement of 2003 in respect of the time at which the Interahamwe arrived.  In 2002 -- 
MR. HOOPER:
May I just interrupt?  In fairness to the witness, my understanding is, he said the Interahamwe arrived between -- what was it -- 12 and 2 in his evidence here.  And in his statement -- we say "a statement", but it's unsigned and in French, he says, "toward" -- well, "ver quatorze heures."  And I'm not clear where the 10 o'clock comes from.  
MS. FALL:
You give us two statements or two notes pertaining to this witness.  You have the note of 15th November 2002 --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would counsel slow down, please?  

MS. FALL:
 "In April 1994 I was in -- "
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would counsel slow down, please?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	"I was in Gatovu cellule on the 12th of April 1994.  Around 10 o'clock four vehicles full of Interahamwe came from Ndera in Rubungo commune.  They were under the leadership of Bernard Liserurande."  Is that what you said?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I've found that reference.  Thank you.  It would help if you could indicate which statement you're looking at.  And, again, I stress these statements are unsigned and in French.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Counsel.  That is what I did, I gave references about the statement.  And perhaps I might ask you to be a little bit more attentive to what I say.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you move on now?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what happened when these four vehicles came, as you mentioned, with regard to the roadblock? 
A.	What roadblock?  I do not know what happened at the roadblock.  I just know what happened -- I only know what happened in Rupangu and at the Protestant centre. 
Q.	So, can you tell us what happened in Rupangu and when it happened? 
A.	I told you that we followed these vehicles that were a short distance ahead of us, and when they arrived, Ngarambe shot down a Tutsi called Pascal Turatsinze, and I myself was an eyewitness to that event.  Leonard Muramba was also killed, and he was killed by an Interahamwe whose name I do not know.  I saw a third body in Rupangu, and when we left Rupangu, we went toward the Protestant parish.  Edouard Gashikazi was shot down by a policeman. 
Q.	Witness, I am going to have to ask you to stop. We shall put questions to you about the events, especially the events of Rupangu.  So, when did you remember these events of Rupangu?  When do you remember these events having taken place?   
A.	But I never forgot the events that occurred in Rupangu, because when these killings took place, I was present.  I was also present during the killings that were perpetrated at the Protestant centre.  So I have not forgotten the people who died or the people who killed them, because I was an eyewitness to the event. 
Q.	However, Witness, it seems surprising to me that you never forgot what happened, but in your statement of the 15th of November 2002, you make no mention of the killings that took place at the Rupangu centre.  
A.	I did not talk about killings that occurred in Rupangu in that statement because no question was put to me in that regard when I gave that statement in 2002.  If I talked about these events in a subsequent statement, it is because there was a specific question put to me in regard to the killings at Rupangu. 
Q.	So, in 2002 you were asked about events that you were a witness to, there were killings, and what you do, you limit yourself to the killings that occurred at the Protestant school and you forget this unfortunate episode, and you now claim that you never did forget the events that occurred in Rupangu?  
A.	I did not forget the incidents in Rupangu.  If I did not mention them -- if I did not mention them in my 2002 statement, please forgive me, but what I'm telling you is the truth.  
Q.	Unfortunately, it seems to me that you have several truths.  Witness, were you present at the -- during the events that occurred in Rupangu? 
A.	I was present.  The trading centre was -- came first, then the secteur office.  So I was between the secteur office and the centre.  You see, I was afraid and I did not wish to go too close to the place where the killings were being carried out. 
Q.	So you were there when these unfortunate people were being killed? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I was a witness to the killings carried out in Rupangu, even if I wasn't very close.  But for the killings that were carried out at the Protestant school --
Q.	Witness, I'm afraid I haven't yet finished with Rupangu.   So you weren't very far off.  I find that this is different from what you stated in 2003, when questions were put to you and you answered based on what you had been asked.  

So you say in that statement that you did go to Rupangu, but, to quote you, "Since these Interahamwe were in vehicles, they got there before us, and when we arrived, they had already killed the Tutsis that they had found there."  So if we understand you correctly and if we analyse what you say correctly, you were not an eyewitness of these killings.  So you do not know who killed, on what condition were the killings perpetrated, who killed, and how it was done, because by the time you got there, these acts had already been carried out? 
A.	Your version does not fit what I saw.  It is true that the vehicles went ahead of us and we came up behind them.  When I could -- I was looking at what was happening; the vehicles were already at the scene.  When these people were killed, we could see what was being done.  Ngarambe killed Turatsinze.  Leonard Muramba was killed by someone whom I couldn't identify, and I also saw a third body.  
Q.	Witness, so if you saw all that, and you tell us that you saw four vehicles full of Interahamwe ahead of you, followed by a large crowd which had been forced by the Interahamwe to take part, as they had been forced to follow the Interahamwe, it means that it couldn't have been exactly easy to see what was happening around the four vehicles.  Would you say that you were standing in the first -- in the centre of things when these killings were carried out?  Would you say that you had a good vantage point? 
A.	No, I can't say that I had a good vantage point because, as I said, when I came across this group and the Interahamwe, I asked where they were going, and when I was putting this question, people went past and so these people got there before us.  Since there wasn't a great distance to cover from the -- and the centre of Rupangu was not very far off and the vehicles were not that far ahead of us, we could see what was going on.  So, between the centre and the place where we were, it was only a distance of a few metres.  So you cannot tell me that I was not able to identify the people who were shot down and the people who shot.  
Q.	So, who were those shooting then? 
A.	I said Turatsinze was shot by a policeman called Ngarambe.  As to Leonard Muramba, he was shot by an Interahamwe who had come from Ndera and whose name I didn't know.  As to the third body which I saw, I could not say who had killed this person.  I do not know the name of the person who killed Muramba, but I knew that it was the police -- the commune policeman who killed Turatsinze. 
Q.	You say that you were present, that you witnessed the scene, and you referred to a body that you saw.  So, at least in the case of the third person, you were not present and you only saw one body? 
A.	Well, you're right. 
Q.	Which means that there is a difference between what you did claim to witness and what you actually admit, because you now say that there are only two people whose deaths you can actually say you witnessed?  
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	This is another truth; this is another version of the facts according to you.  So, Witness, what happened after that?  
A.	We left the Rupangu health centre, since the assailants were the only people we were to kill, but the people who were at Rupangu said that most of the refugees were at the Protestant primary school.  So we left Rupangu to go to the primary school.  But before we got to the primary school, Edouard Gashikazi was shot by Nduweyezu, the communal policeman.  

When we got to the primary school, the assailants were not able to shoot at the refugees because there were many cows in the way, so they decided to shoot the cows before they attacked the refugees. 
Q.	When you were going to the Protestant school, were the four vehicles full of Interahamwe still there?
A.	Some of the Interahamwe had come out of the vehicles to go on foot, but others stayed on board the vehicles.  I should say that a group of assailants followed the road that goes below the primary school, to make sure that they blocked the road in case some refugees sought to escape by that means.  So all the assailants met at the primary school. 
Q.	Now, concerning these vehicles and this impressive number of people that you say were following the vehicle, how would you say you were placed in relation to all that? 
A.	When we went to the primary school, I didn't follow the vehicles.  I and other people followed another road to go to the primary school, and everyone met at the meeting point, which was the church. 
Q.	When you say you and another group, can you tell us what that group was composed of? 
A.	Yes, I can tell you.  I can call a few names of people who were with me.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to ask you to be very careful.  If this -- if mentioning the names might reveal your identity, I shall ask you not to do so, and I shall recommend that you write them down on a piece of paper, unless, of course, you think that this will not reveal your identity.  If you feel that it will reveal your identity, then please put the names down on a piece of paper.  
A.	Will you be so kind as to pass me a piece of paper so that I can put down all the names that I remember?  
Q.	While the piece of paper is being prepared, I might ask you whether these people with whom you were and who were in a group were civilians or whether they included soldiers and Interahamwe.  
A.	I was with a group of civilians, a group of Interahamwe that had come from Ndera, policemen, and the policemen who had come from Ndera went on board these vehicles.  
Q.	Witness, I do not think it is necessary to make a very long list.  I shall be satisfied with six or seven names of people who were in the group.  

Have you finished, Witness?  
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Before I look at the list, you say that there were civilians.  Did you know these civilians personally, and if you mention their names, would you be so kind as to place an "X" against the names of the civilians that were part of the group who were known to you?  
A.	Are you referring to my group, the group that took the small foot path that we followed?  
Q.	I hope it is the names of these people that you have written down.  
A.	On that list, I indicated the names of all the civilians that I knew and who were my neighbours. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell us subsequently what happened, because it's clear that you weren't with the -- those civilians to the Protestant church.  You disassociated yourself from the group of Interahamwe.  Would it have been possible for you then to leave and not take part in the killing? 
A.	On that day I was with them.  I had no purpose of going elsewhere.  I was someone there supposedly to help them in the killing because we were told to go with them where -- to where the Tutsi were.  I was one of the group.  I was just like them.  I did not have an arm, a weapon, but I was in the same group.  I was with them, the group of killers, whether to hunt someone down or tie someone up so he could be killed.  I was there to do that; only I didn't.  When we were ready to throw ourselves on the refugees, some of us were called back to butcher the cows, and I was in the group called back to butcher the cows.  
Q.	Let us proceed by -- point by point, Witness.  At the point where you went to the parish, you told us all about that in thorough detail, but not -- you were not compelled to do so, but you were part of the criminal Interahamwe going to the Protestant school to kill the refugees.  You've told us, once more, in copious detail, that you were part of the group -- and I will come back to that -- but you did practically nothing, but you were in the position of someone heading for the Protestant school, and I employ your term, "to assist" those who were about to massacre the refugees? 
A.	Yes.  You are quite right. 
Q.	So you told us -- you have stated before the Trial Chamber that when you went there, the refugees who were there had been gathered together; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  When we arrived there, we found the refugees gathered together. 
Q.	Was the attack made against everyone of whatever age or sex who had sought refuge at the Protestant church? 
A.	No.  The attack was against all refugees on the basis of the ethnic group to which they belonged.  That is why I told you that whoever did not belong to that ethnic group -- that lady, Mukakurangwa, Theodette, to separate, and that is why she separated from the group of refugees.  
Q.	So, Witness, it was people of the Tutsi ethnic group who were the target of the killings? 
A.	Quite. 
Q.	Sticking to what you were saying, there was no distinction drawn as to the sex or to the age, whether they were men or women, adults or children; it was merely sufficient to be a part of the Tutsi ethnic group to be killed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Witness, do you want the Trial Chamber to believe -- 
MS. FALL:
I see the President is perhaps getting impatient with me, but I won't be much longer, I assure you.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you want the Trial Chamber to believe that having voluntarily left in that criminal attitude of mind, to assist the Interahamwe who were more or less encadre-ing  you, you did not commit any crime; you did not kill any Tutsi person? 
A.	No, I did not kill any Tutsi. 
Q.	Are you also telling the Trial Chamber that you did not benefit from their -- those Tutsis' property because you did not take any meat, but you only took a calf of a foreign type?  
A.	That is correct.  I only looted a calf because it was a foreign breed and, moreover, I lost that calf subsequently.  I had to leave it when the fighting with the RPF began. 
Q.	So you had no scruples as to rustling a cow -- a calf that belonged to one of the victims of those killings? 
A.	I had no scruple because the people were dead and the calf belonged to no one.  I took the calf and I saved that calf's life by taking it home with me. 
Q.	Witness, you spoke of the presence of the RPF, that according to you -- who, according to you, took Gikomero on the 13th of April 1994.  Can you tell us at what time exactly they were in Gikomero? 
A.	I don't remember the time when they arrived in Gikomero.  The only thing I know is that those who lived near the communal office fled in our direction on the 13th, and it is they who told us that the RPF had arrived at their place of residence. 
Q.	So, when you assert that on the next day, the 13th, the Inkotanyi took control of Gikomero, it wasn't something you yourself observed or noted, but it was something that was told you? 
A.	Yes, I did not myself -- I was not myself an eyewitness of the Inkotanyi's occupation of the place.  It was the people coming from those places who gave us that information. 
Q.	So, not having been present, not being an expert, not being a historian, not having anything to check against or verify, you can yet formally assert that the Inkotanyi took control of Gikomero on the 13th of April? 
A.	No, I cannot assert that as someone who would have been an eyewitness.  I have that information from people who lived in those places and fled to our place, and they informed us that they were obliged to leave their place because they were fleeing from the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	So, when you tell us also that no one could go -- come from Kigali to Gikomero at that time because the Inkotanyi had occupied the whole area, it is not a personal observation but it is perhaps from what people had told you? 
A.	I never said -- I never said that you couldn't get from Kigali to our place.  We were part of Kigali, Kigali-rural préfecture, near Muhazi -- in the Muhazi, Lake Muhazi area, not the Muchambi (phonetic) area.  So you could get to us because we took a different road. 
Q.	Witness, once more, I am drawing from what you yourself stated, more particularly, in August 2003.  You said that, after the 13th, the Inkotanyi had finished encircling the whole commune; no one could get to Gikomero from Kigali, nor go from Gikomero to Kigali, unless one was an Inkotanyi? 
A.	Yes, no one could leave Kigali to get to Gikomero because Kigali was captured before Gikomero.  Since Remera -- for example, Remera was taken before Gikomero, before our place was taken.  That is why I said no one could leave Kigali to get to Gikomero, because Remera was taken before Gikomero, as the Inkotanyi was staying at the barracks in the CND building.  That is how Remera was taken before Gikomero. 
Q.	Witness, all this detailed information -- at the time when the RPF was laying siege to Kigali, were you there to be so precise in your information?  
A.	I was not in the places taken by the RPF, but I tell you that, before, when the people were fleeing in our direction and a soldier came to take those people back home, they had fled the shooting.  When those people were taken back home and they did not come -- ever come back to us, it means that there was no safety there.  They were not able to come back to us. 
Q.	Witness, you have stated that you never heard about or saw Rwamakuba in your secteur during those events.  
A.	No, I never saw him. 
Q.	You have also stated that you never heard Rwamakuba speak on the radio during the war.  
A.	I did not hear him.  I only heard him on the radio at the swearing-in ceremony of the interim government. 
Q.	Witness, did you not state on the 8th of August 2003, and it is the end of your statement, "I never heard Rwamakuba speak over the radio during the war.  I did not even hear him at -- swearing -- at the swearing-in ceremony"?  Let me finish.  Did you or did you not state that? 
A.	Yes, I made that statement. 
Q.	But here, before the Trial Chamber you told us -- you have told us that you heard André Rwamakuba take the oath at the time of the swearing-in ceremony of the ministers.  
A.	Yes, that is what I have just said. 
Q.	So there is an enormous contradiction between what you have just stated before the Trial Chamber and what you said in your statement, and I will add that you heard André Rwamakuba mentioned only when he was subsequently arrested.  
A.	You are saying that I heard Rwamakuba spoken of, that I had information about him?  I didn't understand that very well.  
Q.	I said that you did not state the truth, speak the truth, in respect of hearing him at the time of the swearing-in ceremony, which emerges from what you have stated here and what you stated in your statement of 2003, and I said that the only time you accept having heard André Rwamakuba -- and those are in the notes of the 15th of November 2002 -- you said that you were in prison when you heard over the radio that he who had been minister of education in the interim government had been transferred to Arusha in the custody of the ICTR.  That is exactly what you stated.  
A.	Yes, that is what I stated, that I heard that he had been transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, but I wish to be quite clear, when the members of the interim government were sworn in, I followed the swearing-in ceremony over the radio. 
Q.	Well, that is not what is stated in your previous declaration and, again, I wonder, because of the different versions you give, which is the good -- the correct version.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think I have no further questions at this stage for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Mr. Hooper, will you be able to complete your re-examination now?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I can, in a couple minutes.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And aside from what you witnessed yourself, in the years since, talking to others, participating in Gacaca in the various cellules as you've described it and in the Gacaca process within prison, having heard all those things, has anything that you've heard changed your mind on these two things: One, whether it was possible to get from Kigali to Gikomero after the fall of Remera; two, whether André Rwamakuba came to participate in the genocide?  Has anything you've learned over all these years changed your opinion in respect of that?  
A.	Nothing I have heard would make me change my position.  No one could leave Kigali via Remera to get to Gikomero.  And I have also stated that I did not see Rwamakuba during the genocide in Gikomero, and that is the truth.  And nothing I have heard since then would in any way lead me to change my position.  Nothing I have heard would lead me to think that someone could have left Kigali and gotten to Gikomero via Remera, through Remera.  And nothing would lead me to change my position as to having not seen Rwamakuba at any time during the genocide in our place.
MR. HOOPER:
And can I ask that both the statements that have been referred to be exhibited in the case, the November statement and the August statement?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Defence or Prosecution exhibits?  
MR. HOOPER:
As Defence exhibits.  And they've been referred to.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think I have widely used and abused those two statements.  If the Defence want to enter it as evidence, what is interesting and useful to me is that those documents be available to all parties and that we all be able to make the necessary comparisons.  That is our concern.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  And just finally -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute.  Mr. Fry, exhibit numbers, please?  

MR. FRY:
D. 200, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do they both have the same number, or they will be numbered separately?  They are both -- D. 200 and D 201?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. 200 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 201 admitted, under seal)
MR. HOOPER:
There was an ID document, but it's not necessary in this case because I think we went through it all with him, unless my recollection is at fault.  Let me just discuss this with Mr. Issa.  I can't recall if he signed the ID document or not.  Perhaps while that's being clarified, the previous -- the matters that have been exhibited, can they be under seal, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, under seal.  The exhibits are placed under seal.  
MR. HOOPER:
I think we went through it, all his personal details orally, in which case I don't need to introduce the paper with some of those details upon it.  

The last matter, I just want to clarify with the witness -- I've said it but I need to clarify it with the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, as far as those statements are concerned, the ones that were given in November and in August that have been referred to, is it right that you didn't sign those statements; they're unsigned and they are in -- and they are in French?  And if that's right, do you speak French?  
A.	No, I don't speak French; I speak Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	Can you remember if you signed the statements or not? 
A.	The copy I have at home is signed. 
Q.	Very well.  And is that a copy in Kinyarwanda or in French that you've signed? 
A.	The copy I have signed is in Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	And is it the November or the August statement? 
A.	The signed copy I have is dated 2003, but I can't remember the month. 
Q.	And to whom was that statement given; can you remember the name of the person who took it? 
A.	Someone by the name of Martin. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Very well.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, could we ask to see the signed copy of that statement of 2003?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  When I've identified that it exists, or that it may exist, I will ask Mr. Martin, who is my investigator, about it, and try and obtain, either from him or through this witness -- and Mr. Witness, you're listening to this -- a copy of that statement.  It's not a statement that I have had.  I've only had one in French.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it should be reproduced once it exists. 
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly.  I'd like to see it before.  And, anyway, we've produced those statements to demonstrate an extensive consistency of account.  

Those are all the matters I have.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

The only other matter is Dr. Rwamakuba would like to meet this witness, if he may have permission to meet him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony has come to an end.  We thank you for coming to give evidence before the Tribunal, but now you're excused and you're free to leave.  Permission is granted for the visit to the Accused. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused) 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, as far as tomorrow is concerned, I have a witness standing by this morning who would take, I think I can estimate, much of tomorrow, but it's unlikely, subject to the Prosecution, or the Court granting me leave to at least take some of those witnesses who are new or relatively new, in-chief alone, that I would have anything to occupy the Court's time after the witness tomorrow until what we hope is a video link with Kigali on Thursday.  

It may well be that the Prosecution may be in a position to either concede that time is best used at this stage by doing something, in which case I invite them to permit me, without having to come to the Tribunal, as it were, for permission, to permit me to call witnesses that I have available, even if at this stage it's only to take them through their evidence-in-chief on the basis that they, the Prosecution, can only be advantaged by having the opportunity to hear the evidence and all the time to reflect on it that that particular procedure would lead to.  So I mention that.  
There's one final matter, and that is that Your Honour, Mr. President, hasn't invited me to say on this Monday whether -- and I see I've touched a memory there -- that whether the position of the Accused in respect of his non-attendance at court has altered in any way.  And it will come as little surprise for the Court to learn that he has not altered his view.  But I can assure the Court that he is following these proceedings with an understandably keen interest and attention.  And I saw him on Friday, and he specifically instructed me to make a request to you, Mr. President.  I think it was as a result, perhaps, of his reading the transcript of the last session, right at the end, where there was a reference to the Goldstone letter, which I know you and your brother Judges will recall.  

And Dr. Rwamakuba's point here is that when he was released in Namibia on the strength of that letter from Mr. Goldstone in January of 1996 -- in January of 1996 -- the letter, you may recall that said, "We, at this stage, do not require you, the Namibian authorities, to continue to hold in custody André Rwamakuba."  That was the letter.  Dr. Rwamakuba felt that the point hadn't been made when it was raised by me on the last occasion, on which he feels strongly about, and I see perhaps to some extent his point -- to a great extent his point -- and that is that that wasn't a letter which was a mere pre-emptory decision by Mr. Goldstone.  It had been preceded by the ICTR Prosecution, led by Mr. Goldstone, being informed, at least a month earlier, in December, by a letter from Namibia, and perhaps earlier than that even, that Rwamakuba was detained.  And Dr. Rwamakuba's point is, it wasn't a pre-emptory decision to release him, but one that must have been made after consideration and reflection and investigation, and that it was only after that that any of the statements in this case emerge.  

He's asked me to request you, Mr. President, to inspect for yourself, to ask you to inspect and have produced, the file that the ICTR have in respect of their dealings in the Rwamakuba case up to that point, i.e., up to January 1996.  Because he's asked for it.  He's never seen it.  He emphasises that when he sent me to get it in Namibia, the dossier disappeared over the weekend there, the one they had.  And he feels that there is within that dossier a clear indication that Mr. Goldstone made a careful judgement of Rwamakuba's position then, knowing, of course, that he'd been a minister in the interim government.  

So, that's the position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, what's the status of this request?  Is this a formal legal application?  Is it supported by some rules which permit this, or some legal principle which should permit this request to be granted?  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  I put it as a formal -- as an oral motion to the Chamber.  I put it in a way that means, in effect, that disclosure can be to you, the Judges, rather than to me, if that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but on what basis would we make an order for the Prosecutor to make disclosure to the Chamber?  
MR. HOOPER:
The only basis -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And on what basis would the Chamber itself undertake the task of inspecting files?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, it's in the form, I suppose, of disclosure here that we're requesting, but also in the interest of justice, so it falls under order 68 and order 54.  What it goes to is this:  There have been requests by the Defence for access to this file, and the Prosecution have never shown it, neither to the Defence, nor, when requested to do so on a much earlier occasion, to the Chamber.  And it reflects what may be a matter not without significance, and that is that the ICTR, the Prosecutor in this case himself, Mr. Goldstone, effectively ordered the release of Rwamakuba after he'd been detained to six months to the knowledge of the authorities, to the ICTR authorities, to the Prosecutor.  And he did that after a period of time, and this is the point that would be reflected in the file, of investigation.  And so André Rwamakuba effectively, through me and through this oral application/motion, is asking for access to that, and verification that that was so.  And he's been blocked, continuously blocked in that enquiry for six or seven years.  

He's attempted to go through another route, through the Namibian authorities, and as I've said on an earlier occasion, I've rehearsed the history, with affidavits and in support of it.  On the Friday, the Namibian authorities were telling me that it was locked in a safe and couldn't be accessed; would I come Monday?  On Monday, they said they were surprised and taken aback to find that the file had disappeared.  

So, if there was indeed an investigation on the part of the Prosecutor in this case before they came to release Rwamakuba in January '96 by the letter Mr. Goldstone sent to Namibia, then that is a very significant matter.  It's certainly one that Dr. Rwamakuba, and I think for all the reasons, Mr. President, you and your brother Judges can well understand, having been detained and then released, is a matter of great concern to him, and he hopes is shared in by the Tribunal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, it's now too late to hear you, even if you are ready to reply at this time.  So, if you -- we have to adjourn now.  As you know, the courtroom is going to be used for another trial for the afternoon session so we have to close our session now.  So, if you wish, you can respond to Mr. Hooper tomorrow morning when we resume.  

Now, you had raised the matter earlier today which I think we are in a position to address in a very brief manner, the issue of the redaction that occurred at the session towards the end of last week.  Now, I was aware of the matter you were raising because we had got involved as a Chamber in the matter as well.  And contrary to what I'd said, when matters of this nature are redacted, you see it is only the Chamber that gets the full transcript.  So we have been getting the transcript with the information included, but we were not aware until after I had made my comment to you that the parties did not get the unabridged version.  

Now, we have consulted and it is -- we have the option or we are entitled, in exceptional circumstances, to make an order for the concerned portion to form part of the closed session.  Now, it's a matter which is exceptional because the court reporters are required to report exactly what transpired, and the session took place in open session, and so they could not normally refer to it as a closed-session process without an order being made in exceptional circumstances.  

Well, having considered what transpired, we think that the circumstances are exceptional, that the way in which the cross-examination developed, it was only after an accumulation of information that it became apparent to us that the identity of the witness could have been revealed by the questioning.  And the length of the portion does not make it possible for the redaction process to be conducted without making the testimony completely unintelligible.  So in order to just preserve the testimony for proper use in the trial, within this sort of circumstance which would justify the order for that portion to be placed in closed session, and we make that order or confirm the order that we made last week.  

I just say as a brief comment and guide for future conduct, we would normally expect counsel in their examination to be a little bit more alert as to the possible results of the line of their questioning, to prevent this from happening again, as it does create more than a theoretical problem, an ethical problem for the court reporters who have taken an oath to transcribe exactly what has occurred during the trial session.  

So I hope that has resolved the issue and that we can look forward in the remainder of this trial for you to remember that.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  So, if I've correctly understood, and our attitude was justified in respect of what was decided on Friday, that part of the Prosecutor's cross-examination is now considered to have been done in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the position. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.  

Now, regarding Counsel Hooper's statement -- submission in respect of André Rwamakuba's request, you have stated we do not have the time now.  However, I hope I shall be afforded the opportunity tomorrow morning to bring some response to Counsel Hooper's -- to what Counsel Hooper put forward. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will schedule that for tomorrow morning at the commencement of our hearing.  We have to take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1258H)
