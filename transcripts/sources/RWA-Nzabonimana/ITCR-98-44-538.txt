MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	We are going to continue with the events after the 6th of April.  We will stay for a while on the days of 6th and 7th, and then this morning I will begin -- or, rather, before I begin my questions for this morning, I want some confirmation from you.  You told the Court that you did not go out on the night of the 
	6th to the 7th of April before you were taken to MINADEF on that morning.  But one of the 
	Defence witnesses testified before this Court that she called your house, she spoke to your wife on the phone, and that your wife allegedly told her that you were absent.  This telephone call was made on the night of the 6th to the 7th of April.  Can you throw more light on this.  
A.	Mr. President, I am convinced that this is an error and a confusion.  On the night when I did not get home is the night of the 8th, and that for -- for reasons which I will explain later on.  Otherwise, on the night of the 6th, I indicated that I received telephone calls until late -- in fact, until practically in the morning.  I did not go out.  All the calls I made and I received I did so when I was home.  So, definitely, this is a confusion of dates -- nights or dates.  I did not go out of my house on the night of the 
	6th to the 7th.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did you follow the radio, and did you hear instructions, according to which people had to remain home? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What were the terms or the words used in that announcement or communiqué, if you do remember them? 
A.	Many of the announcements talked about the disappearance -- the death of the president and his delegation.  The presence of the president of Burundi and two Burundian ministers were also mentioned as having been on the flight, the president's flight.  People were asked to remain calm and to remain home, not to leave their homes.  Yes, that is what I heard. 
Q.	Did the announcement or communiqué say that the minister of defence was calling on the people of Rwanda not to lose courage following that death and to avoid any act that may disturb public law and order?  Does that reflect the content of what you heard? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Yesterday we talked about your appointment at the ministry of defence, your meeting with Colonel Bagosora.  Can you explain to the Court why, if you know, the officials of the other 
	political parties were not invited to that meeting.  
A.	I think the content of the message delivered by Colonel Bagosora, who at the time referred to was 
	chief of cabinet or director of cabinet of the ministry of defence -- the minister of defence, since the minister was absent, the minister was on mission abroad -- I believe that the content of that message answers your question. 

I do not know whether I have already dealt with that message.  He told us to replace the 
president of the republic, and that is why probably he did not invite the other political parties.  But since the president, under the Arusha Accords, had to come from the MRND party, I believe it was for that reason that he invited only the MRND.  

And according to what he told us, that is what Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, the 
Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, had told him.  So I think Mr. Bagosora just carried out the mission as it was assigned to him. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Do you -- did you have in mind the planning of a genocide of the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  I am convinced that that was the view of Rwandans.  Their view was to stop the RPF aggression or attack, negotiate with the RPF, form a national assembly and a national government with the RPF and continue in peace.  I believe that was the concern of the population of Rwanda.  I was never involved in nor did I ever think of planning the elimination of the Tutsi. 
Q.	Were you informed of the assassinations that were being perpetrated? 
A.	Necessarily (sic), yes, all the more so as those who were assassinated or killed, the main principal -- or principal people killed, in particular, Gatabazi and Bucyana, were dignitaries whom I knew very well.  So, of course, I was aware of those assassinations. 
Q.	I am referring to the period that followed the 6th of April.  Did we understand one another through the question? 
A.	No, I don't think we understood one another.  Can you please kindly repeat your question. 
Q.	So my question was whether at that time you were informed of the assassinations that people started perpetrating.  
A.	No, not at all.  We did not know anything about those assassinations.  On that day, that is, on the 7th, we were not aware of those killings.   
Q.	Thank you.  The meeting to which you were invited by Colonel Bagosora alongside other people at the MINADEF on the morning of the 7th of April, was it part of a criminal -- a joint criminal enterprise, or was its purpose to set up a government? 
A.	No.  The purpose of that meeting is now known.  The purpose was to designate a 
	president of the republic.  In fact, it's quite the opposite of your suggestion.  It's quite the opposite.  

We -- it was the -- it was -- the representative of the United Nations would not want a situation of chaos.  They definitely wanted to preserve peace.  The purpose of the meeting was to ensure pacification and peace. 
Q.	At that time -- and I am referring to the morning of the 7th of April and, in particular, the meeting with Colonel Bagosora.  At that time could one talk of a power vacuum? 
A.	In a way, yes.  At the time referred to one could talk of a power vacuum because events that followed, the putting in place of institutions, depended on the presence of the president of the republic.  The president of the republic would be the cornerstone through whom other institutions would be put in place.  But -- well, I would say that the administration was still there.  There was a prime minister, there was a government, but the subsequent part of the Arusha Accords was another matter.  That was much more complicated. 
Q.	Was it, therefore, necessary to find a solution to that power vacuum and thus respond to Colonel Bagosora's request? 
A.	We did not respond to Colonel Bagosora's request regarding the putting in place of the institutions.  We were responding to the request of the United Nations.  I pointed out that it was a United Nations organisation through its representative that asked us to designate a president of the republic.  So we responded to the appeal made by the United Nations organisation.  So it's much deeper than you thought or you think. 
Q.	Now, according to the last Prosecution theory, you participated together with Colonel Bagosora in a conspiracy to take over power while, nevertheless, refusing to take power.  What do you say to that?  Can you explain this inconsistency or contradiction.  
A.	It is difficult for me to explain that contradiction, and that charge is -- or that allegation is false.  Perhaps I will explain the reasons that led us to make a specific choice in a legal and juridical framework.  So that -- the allegation is completely baseless.  

If the congress had been able to meet, if two candidates had been designated under the Arusha Accords -- because when the Prosecutor talks about me, I think the Prosecution is wrong.  I was not a candidate designated by anyone.  I was not designated either by congress or under the law, so that allegation is totally baseless.  Neither the law nor the party congress designated me.  

And I would like to underscore that we had to present two candidates for replacement of the 
president of the republic.  To replace the president of the republic, not only one candidate had to be designated.  The national assembly had to receive two candidates, not just one. 

Therefore, it is a poor assessment of the situation made by the Prosecution.  The Prosecution misunderstands the law regarding this matter. 
Q.	I will continue, nevertheless.  It is not denied that it was at the request of the Special Representative that Colonel Bagosora asked to meet with you.  Did you, therefore, participate in a conspiracy with the Special Representative of the United Nations organisation? 
A.	No.  No.  I do not think that Mr. Booh-Booh would have such an intention.  The success of his mission depended on the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  So my answer is a categorical no. 
Q.	Still continuing with the morning of the 7th of April.  The Prosecution put into evidence a document which he presented as notes taken during that meeting by a certain********************************.  I'm sorry.  I am not very comfortable with the pronunciation of Rwandan family names.  I will spell it.  *********************************************.  *********************************.  Do you know that person? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was he present at the meeting during -- or which you attended? 
A.	No.  I can repeat the names of the people who were present.  You had General Ndindiliyimana, Colonel Bagosora, Édouard Karemera, Joseph Nzirorera and myself.  We were five of us, and you are talking of someone else.  

In fact, no report or no minutes were taken.  We talked and left.  We talked for about 
one and a half hours because Bagosora left at 8:30 saying that he had a meeting at 9 o'clock, and we were only five people at that meeting.  There was no one else.  There was no report.  No minutes were taken at the meeting. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I will seek the assistance of the registry, the registry staff, Mr. Issa.  Please bring out document number 1 among the bundle of documents I disclosed yesterday.  That document was admitted into evidence, and it's number is P. 297.  And it is entitled "Compte rendu de réunion" in French; "Meeting Report", rough translation in English. 

While Mr. Issa looks for the document and before giving it to Mr. Ngirumpatse, I would like to continue. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	That person alleges that he was the rapporteur or the secretary of the meeting, and he purports, contrary to what you just said, that the meeting was held in the presence of many soldiers.  I will only mention one of them.  If you have the document you will see that there is a whole list of soldiers.  For example, Renzaho.  

Have you received the document, first of all, Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I have the document with me. 
Q.	Can you give me your comments on the document.  First of all, begin with page 1 and tell us whether this comes from the meeting which you attended? 
A.	Not at all.  First of all, this person puts this meeting in the meeting room.  No, that small meeting held -- or was held in Bagosora's meeting room, reception, adjoining to his office.  It was not really a 
	meeting room.  That is the first remark. 

All these officers mentioned here, Colonel Ndindiliyimana and so on and so forth, were not present in that meeting. 

Thirdly, this person puts in the meeting Mr. Kabagema, who was the second vice-chairman of the party and who was not at all at that meeting.  Mr. Kabagema did not attend any meeting.  He did not attend any party meeting from the 7th of April.  He was not in Murambi.  I did not see him in Gisenyi, although I myself travelled quite often abroad.  But he was not at that meeting.  

And even on the 8th he was not there.  On the 9th he wasn't there.  The 9th, the 10th, 12th, until we left Kigali town, Mr. Kabagema did not attend my meeting.  Therefore, this document is a fabricated document. 
Q.	Can you please go through the other pages of the document and continue with your comments on the reports made by this person.  This ***************claims that he was the rapporteur.  Anyway, he doesn't say that he was a rapporteur in the report, but that is the impression we were given, namely, that he was the rapporteur or secretary of the meeting.  Can you, therefore, please, go through the other pages and say whether this report emanates from your meeting.  Well, you had started giving your comments, but continue with your answer on the -- on whether this is -- whether it's likely that this document was the emanation -- or came from your meeting, the meeting of the 7th of April.  
A.	On reading this paragraph -- in fact, even on reading the first page -- this document was made 
	post facto for the purposes of this case.  It is not a report of our meeting, of the meeting which we held with Colonel Bagosora. 

I will give you an example.  This person talks about, for example, what the FAR high command wanted, that is, to meet the chairman of the MRND after a council -- after an advice from UNAMIR to see how damages could be reduced.  What damages?  What harm?  We didn't talk about harm or damage.  We talked about the appointment of or the designation of a president of the republic.  We did not talk about any harm or any damages caused.  We didn't talk -- say anything about that. 

Furthermore, all that he narrates in the subsequent part of the document is irrelevant.  He talks about an accord.  There was no accord.  We did not rely on any paper.  The accords did not specify anything regarding the event of the death of the president.  We did not talk about this aspect of the problem on the 7th.  We did not talk about the substance of the problem on the 7th. 

So this document was prepared post facto, after the meeting.  And, in my view, it was dictated by someone else who had an interest in narrating his own story, in telling his own story, his own perception of the events.  But this document is not a credible document.  

If you go to page -- the third sheet that is numbered page 2, this person talks about the chairman of the MRND, and that two candidates were necessary, the elections are necessary, that parties have to come together.  That means nothing.  All this was totally irrelevant on the 7th.  We never talked about elections.  We never talked about political parties having to meet. 

If I continue, this will be boring the Chamber unnecessarily.  All that this person has written did not happen.  The document is a false document, from page 1 to the last page.  The document was prepared post facto for the purposes of this case, but it contains nothing that is true.  I say from page 1 to the last page, the document is completely false.  This meeting never took place, the meeting about which this report is written. 

I did not meet any of these officers.  We did not meet all these officers.  Even after, I did not see Kayumba, right up to date.  In fact, for quite a long time I have not met Kayumba, Murasampongo, and the other people, Ndibwami.  Ndindiliyimana, yes, he was there.  Bagosora was there.  I saw them.  Those were the only soldiers there.  
Apart from that, the document is completely false, from page 1 to the last page. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I have a last question on this line of questioning.  Can it be imagined that this document was prepared post facto, as you said, for the purposes of the Prosecution case and to challenge, to rebut your evidence in Bagosora's trial? 
A.	Probably.  That is a probability. 
Q.	I will come back briefly on the document.  Page 1, just below the heading "Compte rendu de la réunion" or "Report of the Meeting", have you noticed that something is written over the heading? 
A.	Yes.  He writes 07/04/1993 or 15 -- perhaps 1990 -- 15 (sic), rather, versus the "5" year in the background which he changed into "4".  Therefore, it is likely that the author of this document, the date he initially indicated be the real date of the document, that is, the year, the real year when the document was written.  He probably wrote this document in 1995.  That is what I see here.  I do not think that I am making confusion. 

This figure in the background is a "5", a "5" that has been changed or that was subsequently changed to a "4". 
Q.	What did you just say?  Do you think that this document was prepared in 1995, that he did not know the date to assign to this document?  Can you please clarify what you said.  
A.	My explanation is as follows:  First, the author of this document wrote "1995", then realising that he is one year ahead of the date of the events, he changed the "5" into "4" so that the document should correspond to the date of the events alleged.  Unless I cannot clearly see the figure in the background, I have the impression that that figure is "5".  So this document was written in 1995. 
Q.	Did you notice a signature when you prepare the minutes of a meeting?  That is, the minutes are signed; the person who took the minutes signs them.  
A.	Yes, of course.  In general, the person who took the minutes will sign the minutes or report.  And when talking about a report like this, the secretary or rapporteur is mentioned among the participants.  I do not see the name of this rapporteur or secretary in the list of participants at the meeting, neither do I see his signature at the end of the document to give it credibility or authenticity. 

The conventional practice requires that the rapporteur be mentioned among the list of participants because he is supposed to be participating in the meeting.  But apparently the author of this document was not present during the alleged meeting because his name -- he fails to mention his name in the list of participants. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  We will continue with the day of the 7th of April.  Yesterday you testified that the meeting ended after 1 hour, 30 minutes, and that you left -- you returned.  How did you return to your house, to your residence? 
A.	When Colonel Bagosora left, we remained at the ministry of defence because our escort had been given another assignment, so we had to wait for him.  Since we had come in a vehicle of the ministry of defence with an escort team provided by the ministry of defence, we had no means of returning to our homes.  So we had to wait for the escort, who arrived at about 10 o'clock, 10 a.m., and at 10 o'clock we took the way back home and returned home. 
Q.	When you say "we" -- 
A.	Yes, we returned with Édouard Karemera. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera went to his home.  What happened?  Did you break up later on? 
A.	Yes, we broke up later on.  He went to his house whilst I also went to my house.  When we returned from the ministry of defence, we went to our respective homes.  Thank you. 
Q.	Under what circumstances were you informed of the death of the prime minister, Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	We were informed on the radio.  I heard about her death on the radio, that was during the news, something like that.  But I heard of her death on the radio. 
Q.	Whilst you were at the ministry of defence and attending a meeting, were you not informed of that death and the circumstances of the death? 
A.	She was still alive.  I believe she was still alive.  We did not hear any gunshot in the vicinity, in the neighbourhood.  She lived nearby.  So I believe she was still alive.  When we left the ministry of defence, I think she was still alive. 
Q.	In the course of that day, were you informed of the assassination of any other political figures? 
A.	No.  As far as I can recall, no.  But the day after, in the morning, yes, when we met the others, and so on and so forth.  And apart from Agathe's death, I do not recall that I was aware of -- and by the way, I did not have any other source of information except the radio, and I do not believe that Radio Rwanda made any such announcement. 
Q.	Follow-up question:  Did you order, plan or issue instructions for such assassinations to be perpetrated? 
A.	No.  No. 
Q.	You have just told the Court that you became aware of the assassination of other political figures the day after.  However, according to information available to us, in addition to Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, Mr. N-Z-A-M-U-R-A-M-B-A-H-O, Nzamurambaho, Mr. Nzamurambaho; Mr. Ndasingwa, N-D-A-S-I-N-G-W-A; Mr. Kavaruganda, K-A-V-A-R-U-G-A-N-D-A, all those figures or personalities were killed on the 7th of April.  Did you have any means by which to stop such killings?  And I would like you to further make some comments on the deaths of the persons mentioned.  
A.	First answer:  I knew those three figures of distinction.  Those personalities were important personalities, obviously, starting with the most important, Kavaruganda, Joseph, who was the 
	president of the constitutional court and who in that capacity had administered the oath of office to the president of the republic and who then had a role to play in case of a vacancy at the helm of the state and in relation to the swearing-in of ministers. 

Nzamurambaho was president of the democratic party.  He was Hutu.  Kavaruganda was Hutu.  Ndasingwa was Tutsi.  He was minister of labour and social affairs, member of the PL, Parti libéral.  

I have already mentioned to this Court that there were some problems within the Liberal Party, the PL, and Ndasingwa was one of the leaders of the party and member of the steering committee of that party.  

With the leave of the President, I may digress somewhat to say that at the time there were 
two steering committees within the Liberal Party.  One headed by Mr. Mugenzi, Justin.  It's a well-known name.  And the other by Ndasingwa.  

So this is what I can say in brief strokes about these three personalities whom I knew. 
Q.	There was another half to my question, namely, to find out from you whether it was possible for you or whether you had any resources to stop those assassinations.  
A.	The answer is no.  No, I had no means to stop or prevent those murders.  I had no authority.  I had no resources. 
Q.	Returning to the indictment.  According to the said indictment, you were informed of those assassinations in the morning of the 7th of April 1994, and these are alleged to be persons who would have been in government if they had not been assassinated or who would have necessarily participated in the setting up of the broad-based transitional government according to the Arusha Accords or pursuant to the 1991 constitution.  What are your remarks to those charges?  And what can you tell this Court as to whether the said charges are accurate. 
A.	The charges are false.  First of all, on the 7th I was not aware that those personalities had been assassinated.  I became aware of it on the 8th -- on the 8th.  But on the 7th, no. 

Now, to claim that these were personalities who would have had some influence over government, I do not know how to answer that question.  You see, the tradition or practice at that time was for the respective parties to designate their ministers.  I, therefore, cannot say whether or not these personalities were essential or indispensable to the setting up of the government.  I was not in a position to predict that given that ministers were designated by their respective political parties.  So I am not in a position to have known. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  In what circumstances did you become informed of the assassination of the Belgian Blue Berets? 
A.	I do not recall the circumstances clearly.  I do not know whether it was announced over radio.  I did not have a radio set with me.  I had left my home without a radio, and I was disconnected from information.  But people talked about it.  We talked about it. 

And on the 8th, we were not aware of it -- well, I learnt of it on the 8th.  On the 7th, no.  But on the 8th, when we returned to the ministry of defence, I became aware of it.  At 10 a.m., when I left the minister of defence to return to my home, nothing had yet happened. 
Q.	Did you issue any instructions for the Belgian Blue Berets to be eliminated? 
A.	No.  No.  The answer is no.  

However, allow me to make a comment.  Any reasonable man would say that this was not only a wicked act but one of great political nuisance or inconvenience. 

When Mr. Karemera was testifying from this very box, I was in hospital at the time, but I was able to listen to his testimony on CD.  In his testimony he said that those who had committed those murders were idiots, and I agree with him.  He was right.  The elimination of the Belgian Blue Berets was much more of a nuisance than anything else.  And I don't think any reasonable man would have done such a thing.  That is my comment.  That is the remark I wanted to add to your question. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  When you returned to your residence on the 7th of April, who was at your residence, as far as you can recall?  Yesterday you told us that on the 6th, in the evening -- the evening of the 6th to the 7th, you said that you spent your evening with your family.  Now, can you tell us those who were at your residence in the morning of the 7th when you left your residence.  
A.	My wife; my daughter; my nephew, Léonidas; Frank Adansi, a Ghanaian friend.  Adansi is spelt A-D-A-M-S-I (sic).  My sister-in-law, Monique.  Didn't I mention this yesterday?  
Q.	Well, no.  
A.	Well, my sister-in-law, Monique, was there along with her young child, a baby.  She had a baby, a young baby.  And she was at my residence because she had run into some problems with her husband, and since I was always perceived to be her father -- you see, in Rwandan tradition, when a 
	young woman has any problems with her husband, she goes to complain to her father, and then the father would call a family meeting in an attempt to solve the problem.  So that role fell on me at that time, and I had to deal with the matter.  My father-in-law was no longer alive, and I had to act as father.  And I would like to say that she was at home with her young son.  

And then in addition to these persons, other people had come to our residence.  I am not sure I can remember all of them, but let me attempt to provide a list.  There was one Gad, Gad as written in the Bible, G-A-D.  Gatora, G-A-T-O-R-A-N-O -- Gatorano, rather.  Gatorano.  He was a member of the PL, the Liberal Party. 

Well, he was -- and I need to clarify this point.  He was the father-in-law (sic) of one Silas Majyambere, M-A-Y-I-M-B-E-R-E (sic), who at the time was living in Kampala and was the financier or the 
funding financial officer of the RPF.  His brother-in-law, therefore, in that capacity. 

Then there was Ephron, E-P-H-R-O-N, whose family name I do not know.  That person I was meeting probably for the very first time.  That person used to live in Kicukiro.  I saw them go by, but that was the first time that I actually talked to him.  And he was also the brother-in-law of Majyambere, whom I have just talked about. 

Then we had Wicliff, W-Y-C-L-I-F-F (sic), or double F -- yes, two Fs -- who was Hus Mugwaneza's brother.  He was there with his wife.  And may I say that the other two were also at our residence with their wives.  Wicliff was there with his wife who is Tutsi, and Wicliff himself is Tutsi. 

I add this information in order to destroy any propaganda alleging anti-Tutsi hatred by Hutu.  And the point being that these people came to my residence with their wives, not only because I lived close to the gendarmerie but because -- but also because they were sure that I would not turn anyone back. 

Then there was also Mbonyumutwa, M-B-O-N-Y-U-M-U-T-W-A; Shingiro, S-H-I-N-G-I-R-O, and 
his family, that is, his wife and their children.  Then Minister Mugenzi's wife was at my residence along with her children.  Then obviously there was Frédéric, son of Hus Mugwaneza.  There must have been other persons at my residence at that time, but I am not able to recall all their names. 

The fact, however, simply being that there were many, many people at my residence.  Some had to sleep on the floor, on mattresses on the floor.  We made arrangements to have food for everyone, and it was not easy.  

Those are the names that I can remember of the persons who were at my residence.  And, of course, I did not find everybody there.  These are the names of those whom I can remember as having been at my residence on the 7th.  And then later on in the afternoon, there was Édouard Karemera and his family, so that we would be closer to the gendarmerie. 

You see, even if there is a guard of two persons in an isolated area as one in which he was living, that was not good enough because either infiltrators or the RPF combatants could have liquidated them.  And that is how we preferred to come together and be close to the gendarmerie to be able to enjoy sufficient power -- firepower, may I say, in those circumstances. 

So that is the list of persons I remember having been at my residence.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Now, please clarify, Mr. Ngirumpatse, when you returned to your home after the meeting of the 7th of April, were all these persons already present at your residence, or did some of them arrive at your residence during the day of the 7th? 
A.	That clarification I think I provided in my statement when I said that some of them were present at my residence when I returned, but some arrived at my residence later, even in the afternoon.  At about 
	4 p.m., I can say that all those persons were already at my residence. 
Q.	It has been your testimony -- or, rather, why were all those persons coming to seek refuge at your residence?  Was there something special about insecurity in Kicukiro?  I mean, in addition to your explanation about the presence of the gendarmerie in your neighbourhood, why is it that on the 7th people from various political leanings and ethnic backgrounds, why did those people come to your residence?  Could you explain for the benefit of the Court.  
A.	First of all, these people did not flee for ethnic reasons, primarily.  It was a matter of defence.  To the extent that whenever the RPF attacked any neighbourhood, they did not choose ethnicity.  They simply fired.  And so anyone could be a victim of the RPF bullets and victims of any other killers or unidentified attackers. 

So the reason -- the main reason for which they came to my residence was that I was close to the gendarmerie, but they also knew full well that I was not going to hand anyone over.  And I believe that that was the main reason for which they sought refuge at my residence. 

Now, when time to leave came, my wife made arrangements with the gendarmerie and UNAMIR to move all these persons to the Hôtel des Mille Collines, and that is why we are very happy that all those persons were saved. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, can you explain to the Court whether there were any soldiers, any gendarmes or any policemen in your residence.  Please clarify that point for the Court.  
A.	Not on a permanent basis.  From January, senior officials were assigned guards, both clothed bodyguards and should I say invisible bodyguards.  So for those who may not have known, there were some discreet guards unknown to the public who actually worked hand in glove with the gendarmes. 

Whenever I went to a meeting, I would see these guards come to escort me.  And whenever I held meetings that went late into the night, I saw them come and escort me home.  So I enjoyed some measure of protection from time to time in a discreet manner.  And those who did not know may not have been able to notice that I had those services. 
Q.	It has been your testimony to this Trial Chamber that it was in January 1994 that these bodyguards and discreet security services were assigned to you.  Question:  Did the UNAMIR provide protection to you as a political figure within the purview of its duties? 
A.	Well, I have already told this Trial Chamber that UNAMIR did not protect personalities of the MRND, neither ministers nor members of the steering committee of the MRND.  UNAMIR, rather, provided protection for ministers of the opposition and leaders of the opposition exclusively.  

I want to point out that Joseph Nzirorera asked for protection from General Dallaire in writing and never received any reply.  So it is common knowledge that UNAMIR did not provide protection for officials of the MRND.
Q.	(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Q.	My microphone was not switched on, so let me put the question again.  I wanted to know from you whether there were any Interahamwe at your residence.  Were there any militia or persons belonging to a group of militia at your residence at that time? 
A.	No.  No.  That is a ridiculous accusation.  I lived next to the gendarmerie, and I enjoyed some distant and discreet protection.  I knew it was there, but I did not have to announce it to anybody.  So what would I have needed the Interahamwe for?  I do not see why I would have needed to have any Interahamwe at my residence.  So that is an absolutely ridiculous charge. 
Q.	Did you spend the night of the 7th of April at your residence?  And before you answer that question, let me ask you whether you left your residence again at any point in the evening of the 7th of April.  And if that were to be the case, where did you go to?  And, thereafter, please tell the Court whether you spent the night of the 7th at your residence.  
A.	I did not leave my residence again after returning from the ministry of defence.  I did not leave my residence again thereafter.  And, yes, I spent that night at my home. 

Well, it was a very difficult night because of the number of persons at my residence and the need to provide them with food and further assistance.  It was a difficult night, but it was also enjoyable to the extent that there were many of us at home, 30 to 40 persons, sleeping on the floor with the children, and men and women all over the place.  It was indeed difficult.  But, yes, I spent that night at home. 
Q.	When you enumerated the names of persons who were at your residence, you mentioned the nephew of Wicliff, whose first name I do not immediately remember.  
A.	Frédéric.
Q.	Yes, Frédéric.  Well, my co-counsel is called Frédéric and I happened to forget the other Frédéric.  In any event, can you tell the Court the circumstances in which you found him at your residence.  Can you tell the Court what happened for that child to end up at your residence.  
A.	He was already at my home.  I have the impression that he was already there, although I do not clearly recall how it happened.  But it may be that when they went to fetch him, I was at home. 

In any event, I was aware of the circumstances in which he came to our residence, and my family knew about it and the gendarmerie as well.  His parents and his grandfather and those who were present at their residence had been killed by unidentified killers, and he was able to hide in the ceiling.  Minister Mugenzi -- or, rather, he was able to call Minister Mugenzi who in turn called my wife at our residence. 

And on the 7th, Mugenzi did not know that I was at the ministry of defence.  When he called my home, he believed that I was at home, but it was my wife who answered the phone call and who then took all necessary steps to recover that child with the assistance of the gendarmerie and the son of Shingiro, Gustave Mbonyumutwa.  

Well, I cannot afford to speak on this matter because I was not an eyewitness to the salvage operation, although witnesses who were part of that rescue operation have already testified before this Court. 

The fact remains, therefore, that I determined that the child needed to be protected.  He remained at our home.  I talked to him.  Although I was traumatised, I encouraged him.  And the night after he went with my wife, my daughter and all others, as they left Kicukiro, our neighbourhood -- and at that time they went to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  I took him along with my family to the Hôtel des Diplomates, and I handed him over to a lieutenant of the Belgian army for the purposes of the evacuation of foreigners from Kigali, because he and his wife, who was -- and his mother, rather, who was Belgian. He had Belgian nationality.  So I handed him over to Lieutenant Lemaire, who must have another rank today.  But at the time Frédéric's passport was in my possession, and I handed the passport and the young man over to an officer of the Belgian army, and he was thus evacuated to Belgium. 

That, in short, is what transpired. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you have Frédéric's family killed?  Did you give orders for that family to be eliminated?  And can you remember the relationship between Frédéric, Wicliff and Robert Kajuga? 
A.	Mr. President, it always hurts me, pains me when I hear such allegations.  I was very close to the father.  In fact, the person who was closer to me in age was Hus's father.  He was older than me, but I knew him.  He was a very pleasant man.  I knew Hus.  Hus was my neighbour.  We used to visit one another without any specific reason.  We would walk on foot and then return to Hus's house or my house.  Just like Hus, when he was walking, he would come to our home without warning.  

Hus Mugwaneza was Robert Kajuga's elder brother.  He was also the elder brother of Wicliff -- Kajuga, who was also at home, whom I mentioned in the list.  Frédéric was in the same class as my daughter.  He was a young man who came home whenever he wanted, at any time.  I knew him.  There was no reason -- well, I am always hurt when I hear such accusations because that is something which would have never crossed my mind, moreover, regarding any other person.  

It is not because we were friends.  But it is not in my nature.  It's just my way of doing things.  So my answer to the question as to whether I gave instructions to kill that family, the answer is no. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So you spent the night of the 7th to the 8th in your residence at Kicukiro.  

	Now we are going to move on to the day of the 8th of April.  Can you describe to this Court what happened on that day.  At any point in time during that day, did you go out of your house?  And if yes, for what reason? 
A.	The 8th?  Yes.  The 7th?  On the 7th, I received a telephone call -- on the 8th, in the forenoon, or perhaps in the afternoon, I received a telephone call from the ministry of defence.
Q.	(Microphone not activated)  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone.   
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Can you specify the date?  Because there is confusion regarding the dates.  Which dates do you mean? 
A.	The 7th. 
Q.	At what time on the 7th? 
A.	Perhaps early in the afternoon, something -- or somewhere thereabout. 
Q.	Very well.  Continue.  
A.	So I received a telephone call from the ministry of defence from an officer who did not identify himself.  That officer told me that the escort that accompanied us on the 7th was going to return to pick us up on the 8th, but he said, "Don't wake up too early.  The escort will be there at 9 o'clock."  That Colonel Bagosora wanted to speak to us -- to us, that is, I and my party comrades.  So I was not able to reach Joseph Nzirorera, who remained in town, on the 7th.  But I was with Édouard Karemera. 

And on the 8th at 9 a.m. that escort arrived.  It was made up of the same vehicles and military guards as was the case on the 7th in the morning.  We went to town to the ministry of defence.  We left my house at 9 a.m. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now, I need some clarification.  You left your house together with Mr. Karemera on the 8th in the morning; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct.  Yes, indeed, that's the case.  
Q.	Did he arrive in your residence on the 8th? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there is overlapping between counsel and the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters are having difficulty because there is overlapping between the question and answer.  

I think that we have got the question.  So if you could start your answer again, Mr. Ngirumpatse. 

THE WITNESS:
I am sorry, Mr. President.  I am sorry for that error.  I forgot to pause after counsel's question. 

Mr. Karemera had spent the night in my house, in my residence on the 7th in the evening.  So we were together on the 8th.  On the morning of the 8th, we left together from my residence.  That, indeed, is the case, I believe.  That is my answer to your question. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  That is the clarification I wanted. 

When you left your residence, where did you go to or where were you driven to? 
A.	We were driven to the ministry of defence, to the same office, Colonel Bagosora's office.  When we arrived there -- or by the time we arrived there, Joseph had already arrived.  He had stayed the night in town.  So he was the first to get to the ministry of defence. 
Q.	When did you meet Colonel Bagosora, and what did he tell you? 
A.	He was there when we arrived.  He told us that he had spoken with the crisis committee, because they had set up a crisis committee, and also with the high command of the army, and that soldiers expressed a wish that politicians should assume their responsibilities by setting up the institutions, institutions that will continue propelling national life.  He, therefore, told us -- or told us of the wish of the crisis committee and the high command of the army, and that that wish was that politicians should assume their responsibilities.  That is what he told us. 

Moreover, this was to fulfil the promise he had given us the day before, namely, that he was going to speak to the high command to have their views on our position regarding the convening of the 
party congress. 
Q.	At that time did Colonel Bagosora tell you who exactly was a member of that crisis committee? 
A.	No. 
Q.	He used the term "crisis committee", and what was your reaction to that request? 
A.	We said that we were only the representatives of the MRND party, but that the government was not only MRND.  And that if anyone wanted the continuation of the putting in place of the government, the situation had become more complicated, because the prime minister was no longer alive.  It was easier to designate a president of the republic, but now the whole government had to be formed, a government with a prime minister.  We, therefore, said that we were not the only ones who formed the government; that we were ready to assume our political responsibilities provided that the other 
	political parties were present. 
Q.	Did Colonel Bagosora give a favourable response to your request, that is, the request of the members of the steering committee of the MRND to -- or seeking the presence of the other political parties?  What did he do to satisfy your request?  Can you throw more light on this.  
A.	His answer was positive.  He told us that he was going to look for them.  In other words, he was going to look for the other political parties that formed the government.  And he went.  He went to give instructions or maybe he went himself.  I don't know.  Perhaps he went himself to give -- to look for them, or maybe he gave instructions to someone to go and look for the other political parties. 
Q.	Can you please remind us of the parties concerned, the parties that were not present at the time you arrived at the ministry of defence.  
A.	The government comprised the MRND, that is, our own party; the MDR; the PSD; the PL, that is, the Parti libéral; and the PDC, the Parti démocrate-chrétien, the Christian Democratic Party.  These were the five parties that formed the government.  Now, apart from us, there was no one else.  

And what he, Bagosora, did was to go and look for the other four parties so that we should consult one another, because what we were being asked, namely, to appoint or designate a 
president of the republic, but that was not -- was still valid but was no longer sufficient because the government no longer -- a head.  So we had to go further.  So the situation had become more complex. 
Q.	Whilst Colonel Bagosora was trying to satisfy that request, what did you do?  Did you discuss amongst yourselves, that is, you, representatives of the MRND, did you discuss amongst yourselves, or did you wait for the representatives of the other political parties to arrive in order to discuss together with them? 
A.	We were compelled to discuss amongst ourselves because, in those circumstances, our role was of cardinal importance.  Nothing could move forward if you did not have a president of the republic, because from a constitutional standpoint, the prime minister had to be appointed by the 
	president of the republic and ministers had to be appointed by a president of the republic.  

Now, since the president of the republic came from the MRND, we thought that the other 
political parties were going to ask us -- were going to tell us that they were ready with their ministers but that the MRND president had to come from the MRND, that they were going to ask us how we were going to come out with a candidate for the presidency.  This is the kind of reflection we carried out amongst ourselves, and we exchanged views on that matter whilst Bagosora had gone to look for representatives of the other political parties.  We remained behind reflecting on that aspect of the issue, namely, what were we going to tell the other political parties. 
Q.	For how long did you wait?  Did you make progress in your discussions or not?  And did you eventually discuss together with the representatives of the other political parties? 
A.	Well, before the conclusion of all of that, we had to find a solution.  We exchanged views on possible solutions.  The solution of convening a congress was ruled out, especially on the 8th, because fighting -- the fighting was widespread in Kigali town.  In Kigali town, fighting was going on everywhere.  The RPF had attacked everywhere in the country.  So convening a congress of the party had become impossible. 

Moreover, I would like to add that it was through divine inspiration that we did not think of convening 400 people in Kigali at that time.  If all those people were eliminated by the RPF, I think I would be in a more difficult situation today than the one in which I find myself. 

So we exchanged views on the possible solutions.  And to conclude, we agreed -- or stopped on the constitution of 1991, which, contrary to the Arusha Accords, provided for a solution in the event where the president resigned or died or was prevented from carrying out his duties.  So we decided to go and see the president or speaker of parliament who was designated by the constitution as the replacement of the president of the republic in the event the latter was not available to perform his duties. 
Q.	Thank you for having seen my gesture.  I did not want you to go further.  We are going to get to that point, and we are going to proceed stage by stage, especially as regards important stages and important decisions.  

I will seek the assistance of Mr. Issa to give you document number 7 in the bundle of documents I disclosed yesterday.  This is the constitution of the Republic of Rwanda.  I would like you to have that constitution so that you should be able to make your comments in view -- or bearing in mind that constitution. 

You were saying that the constitution provided for that scenario.  Why the constitution?  We thought that the constitution was behind us because we are already at the stage of the Arusha Accords.  Can you please go over what you said, and please guide us as regards the legal discussions you had when you consulted the legal instruments that were available to you.  
A.	The Arusha Accords did not provide for a scenario where the president died or where he wasn't able to carry out his duties before the putting in place of the transition institutions.  That is the first point.  Therefore, we had no legal instrument, no law, no legal document to support the Arusha solution. 

Secondly, contrary to the ideas spread around, the constitution had not been repealed.  The constitution and the Arusha Accords, both of them, both these two instruments, formed the basic law -- the fundamental law of the republic.  Therefore, the implementation of the constitution did not impede the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  

We will see subsequently that it is out of bad faith that this solution was not accepted by the RPF, but the constitution was still in force.  And together with the Arusha Accords, it formed the fundamental law of Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you for stopping at that point. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Once more, please, Mr. Issa, we need your assistance. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I wanted to give you, Witness, the two documents whilst you were making your presentation.   
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Mr. Issa, can you please kindly give to the witness document number 6 in my bundle of documents.  The title is in French, "Accord de paix" -- "A Peace Agreement between the Republic of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front".
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Q.	I would like you to have the two documents before you during your presentation -- during your testimony.  I would like that you, first of all, go through the Arusha Accords and confirm to us that indeed the Arusha Accords did not provide for any solution in the event the head of state was no longer able to perform his duties for any reason whatsoever, and also confirm that the Arusha Accords did not repeal the constitution of 1991; that there was continuity, according to what you just told this Court.  
A.	Unfortunately, I realise that I have received a small document on the Arusha Accords.  I have received the protocol on the sharing of power.  That is all I have been given.  But I am still looking; I am still searching. 
Q.	Perhaps I am the one who chose the wrong document.  I thought this was in the agreement for power-sharing, that this provision was in the agreement for power-sharing.  If that is not the case, can you please explain.  
A.	I believe it was article 48 of the Arusha Accords, if my memory serves me right. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	But, apparently, that document is not in this bundle given to me.  What I have here goes up to article 46 of that protocol. 
Q.	Well, you will come back to that after our mid-morning recess.  
A.	Yes, but that does not prevent me from explaining.  
Q.	That is what I was going to suggest to you.  
A.	So article 42 of the constitution provided that in the event the president of the republic is unable to perform his duties, he will be replaced by the president or speaker of parliament, the 
	president of the national assembly, but he will be so replaced in a provisional manner.  

So I read:  In the event the president of the republic is unable to perform his duties, or temporarily unable to perform his duties, the president of the republic will be or shall be provisionally replaced by the speaker of the national assembly.  In the event of resignation, death, or where the inability of the president are considered permanent and so declared by the constitutional court on the suggestion or recommendation of the government, the president of the republic shall be replaced by the 
speaker of the national assembly until the election of a new president of the republic, which election must take place within 30 days. 

That is it.  I can continue to read the whole article.  In the cases mentioned in the subparagraph above, the prime minister, ministers and secretaries of state shall be deemed to have resigned and each one of them in their share of responsibilities would carry out routine matters or discharge routine duties until the formation of a new government.  That is article 42.  And it was that article that we relied on. 

Now, as regards the Arusha Accords, the Arusha Accords provided for such a scenario after the transition institutions must have been put in place.  To summarise, it was necessary for the party of the president of the republic to propose two candidates to the national assembly and to the government for election.  One of the two candidates had to be elected.  In the event of the problems -- details of which are given by the text, any political party could propose to carry this, but that wasn't the case of complications. 

But for us to get to that situation, it was necessary for the national transition assembly and the broad-based transition government, that is, the two institutions, were necessary to receive those 
two candidates and designate a president of the republic.  So there are two institutions, the government and the national assembly, which were needed for there to be an election of a president amongst the two candidates proposed by the MRND party.  That is why we thought that the constitution was more appropriate than the Arusha Accords. 

Moreover, the assignment we gave to the government shows that we did not abandon the Arusha Accords, but it was a more legal approach to come back to those accords if our adversaries deemed it necessary. 

I thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I see what the time is.  Perhaps this is time for you to order a mid-morning recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is good time for a mid-morning recess, and we take it now.
(Court recessed at 1032H)
(Pages 1 to 20 by Joe Reynosa) 







(Court resumed at 1046H) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I'm sorry.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
And I apologise to all those in the courtroom as well for not having provided photocopies of the relevant, useful document.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Article 41 -- 48, rather, is the right reference.  And this can be found on page 33 in the protocol, which I submitted to you.  I haven't printed the document out yet, but your reference is correct.  It is only one part of the document that I photocopied, and I'm sorry for that.  But the right article, as you referred to, is article 48 in the context of our proceedings.  I wanted to make those remarks for the record, and then to proceed with you.  

You have testified that while waiting for the other political parties, you had gone on to think about a number of issues.  What conclusions and decisions did you come to following those discussions?  What decisions did you come to flowing from those discussions? 
A.	We decided to contact the person concerned, namely, the president of parliament, Dr. Théodore Sindikubwabo -- S-I-N-D-I-K-U-B-W-A-B-O for Sindikubwabo, Théodore.  Dr. Sindikubwabo, Théodore.  He was a medical doctor -- a medical doctor.  So we decided to go to see him.  
Q.	Am I to understand that you left MINADEF?  How did that happen, practically speaking?  Did you leave the ministry?  Did you call him on the phone, or how did it happen, practically?  
A.	Well, we could not call him on the phone.  He was, at least, not only our senior brother, because he was older than us, but he held a higher position and it was for us to go and meet him.  So we went to his residence on foot from the ministry of defence, all three of us.  We went to his residence on foot.  His residence was not far away.  
Q.	At about what time did you go to his residence, and how did you present the situation to him? 
A.	We left the ministry of defence at 10 a.m.  And the president of the parliament was at his residence.  He received us in the living room of his residence and we told him why we had requested to see him and pointed out to him the constitutional provisions relating to our purpose.  

He was -- he was -- I shouldn't say he was surprised, but he was, somehow, taken back and he asked us whether our stance was legal.  And we said, "Yes, according to the constitution.  Not according to our own desiderata."  And we explained to him how any -- how and why any other option was not acceptable.  
So he asked us whether he would receive support.  And we told him that, from our point of view, this was the legal standpoint, and that we did not have any reason to worry that our party or any other party would object because this was the only legal way out.  And he said, "Yes."  

So we discussed -- we talked until about 11 a.m., and then we returned to the ministry of defence relieved by that discussion, which had provided us with not only an answer for the crisis committee, but also with an answer for the United Nations, as well as an answer for the other political parties.  

So those who believed that we tried to trick anyone are mistaken.  We proceeded in a legal and an appropriate manner.  
Q.	At what time did you return to MINADEF?  And upon your arrival at MINADEF, were the representatives of the other political parties present at that time? 
A.	Yes.  Except for -- well, I think they -- they all came in, but at different times.  The parties were present; they nevertheless came, except for the PSD, Parti social-démocrate.  When we started the deliberations, they were not represented.  But when it came to the point of agreement and signing a document, we required that they show up.  And Bagosora was able to locate them.  And, at the time of finalising the document, they were present.  

But I don't think we are dealing with that yet.  We're still very much at the beginning.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, as far as you can recall, can you tell the Court who represented which 
political party at the beginning of your meeting.  Can you give us the names of those who represented their various political parties, and also tell the Court the location within the ministry of defence at which that working session held.  
A.	Let me start by the venue of the meeting.  Colonel Bagosora gave us a hall -- a meeting room, a large room -- a meeting room of the ministry of defence.  He took us to that hall for our deliberations.  

Now, as for the representatives:  The MDR was represented; the PL was represented, Parti libéral; there was also the PDC and the MRND.  And as I previously testified, the PSD came later in the day.  

So I do not know whether you are asking me to give the names of the representatives of the various political parties.  If that is your question, I may not be able to answer.  But I think for the MDR, there was Murego, then -- and Karamira, whose name does not need to be spelt because that name has already been mentioned quite extensively.  

Now, for the Parti libéral, there was Mugenzi -- M-U-G-E-N-Z-I, and Agnes Ntamabyariro -- N-T-A-M-A-B-Y-A-R-I-R-O.  Ntamabyariro, Agnes for the PL.  

For the MRND, the three representatives whom I mentioned throughout our proceedings of the day are well known.  They were present.  For the PSD, which came in later, there was Rafiki, R-A-F-I-K-I for Rafiki.  And Ndungutse, N-D-U-N-G-U-T-S-E.  Ndungutse, François.  

Now, for the PDC, there was Kabanda, K-A-B-A-N-D-A, and also Sibomana, S-I-B-O-M-A-N-A.  And Ruhumuriza, R-U-H-U-M-U-R-I-Z-A, I believe.  So that is the list of names that I remember, as far as those who were present at the meeting goes.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So, you met in that hall -- that meeting hall provided by Colonel Bagosora.  How did the meeting unfold?  Who took the floor?  How did things happen?  Can you tell the Court something about how that meeting unfolded.  
A.	Our party had a head start over the others, and so I was the one charged with presenting the situation to the other political parties.  We told them of the desiderata of Booh-Booh.  We told them how far we had come.  We told them about our contact with the president of the national assembly, and briefed them on the issues at hand.  

They did not raise any particular problems and agreed with what had already been initiated.  So we broke up into two groups -- two working groups:  One tasked with drafting a legal instrument for the setting up of the government; and the other with drafting a draft speech for the president upon his designation to the office of president.  

The room was large enough and the two groups were able to work in the same hall without any group disturbing the other because the hall was big enough.  
Q.	Could you enlighten the Chamber on the reaction of the other political parties when you informed them of the choice of Théodore Sindikubwabo as the interim president?  Did they challenge that?  Did they agree with you?  Was there any problem when you made that proposal? 
A.	There was no problem.  What we did was legal; it was constitutional.  You would have a problem when there are other possibilities -- solutions.  The other parties did not have any alternative.  

I know that, at present, there were people -- there were people who were in the meeting who are today saying that they did not agree.  But that should be considered as a post-mortem complaint.  I think it was a lie.  This is a lie.  Nobody objected to that solution which everyone felt comfortable with, and you would understand why later on.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness GOB, whom you know perfectly well now, told this Court that he was surprised to learn that it was Mr. Théodore Sindikubwabo who had to replace the president of the republic because, according to the Arusha Accords, the person who had to replace the president was clearly indicated.  That person was clearly indicated in the event where the president's office became vacant.  
And Witness GOB continues.  I quote:  

"The accords stipulated that it was the chairman of the MRND at the time, Matthieu Ngirumpatse, who had to replace the president of the republic in the event of a vacancy."  

He made -- or gave that statement on the 23rd of October 2007, and this can be found on page 5 of the transcript -- the Court transcripts of that day.  

What are your comments?  Why did you -- or why were you not designated president, as Witness GOB says?  
A.	First of all, that witness lied.  The Arusha Accords did not mention my name, neither the chairman of the MRND as a replacement for the president of the republic.  

I quoted the article of the Arusha Accords which designated -- or which spelt out the conditions under which the president of the republic was to be replaced.  It was necessary for the MRND party, that is, the president's party, to propose two candidates to the national transition assembly and to the transitional government, which then had to vote one of the two candidates.  

Apparently, GOB came to give that evidence to save his life and, perhaps, to have my own life.  I do not know.  But I pray the Chamber not to see any hatred in this, but apparently GOB had not read the Arusha Accords, because my name is not mentioned in those accords.  The title -- or the position of the chairman of the MRND is not mentioned in those accords.  Not at all. 

Well, I wouldn't say that witness lied, but he treated the matter with levity.  For a member of parliament, like himself, who is not familiar with the constitution, who does not know how to properly read or interpret the Arusha Accords, that sparks of levity.  I wouldn't say that he lied, but he demonstrated some levity in the manner in which he handled that matter.  
Q.	You, therefore, maintain that your reasoning is -- was the right reasoning, that is, the reasoning in conformity with the law and which had to be followed.  Am I correct? 
A.	My answer is yes.  Later on, in the months that followed, General Dallaire, in a bid to help the RPF, asked for consultations at the level of the United Nations, and he was told that that government was legal -- perfectly legal; that there was nothing to reproach that government for.  

Therefore, even the United Nations legal office did not find anything to criticise regarding that government.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	I would like to ask for Mr. Issa's assistance for two documents to be given to you.  Documents number 4 and 5.  These are the protocols of the government, one of 7 April 1992 and the other 8th April 1994.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
These are documents which I had given out yesterday for distribution.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	While waiting for you to receive the said documents, I will proceed.  

	Earlier on you said that you split into two groups.  In which group did you find yourself for that working session? 
A.	I found myself in the -- in the working group that dealt with the protocol -- that wrote the protocol that dealt with the legal matters.  It was in that group that I was, I believe, with Édouard Karemera, and Joseph worked in the other group, which had to prepare the speech for the president of the republic, that is, the draft speech for the president of the republic.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell the Court how you arrived at drafting this document, that is, the protocol of 1994.  What was the legal reasoning and the factual elements which enabled you to arrive at these conclusions and at the point of drafting this document?  
A.	The legal reasons, I have already stated them, but there were other factual elements which 
intervened -- which came into play.  

The first element was that I read the article of the constitution, that is, article 42 of the constitution, according to which, in the event the president disappeared or was not able to perform his duties, the prime minister and the ministers were deemed to have resigned; they carried out routine duties, each in their respective spheres.  

But there were other elements which, moreover, are found in the additional protocol which we signed on the 8th -- the 8th of April 1994.  The situation had become even more complicated.  What, moreover, we noted in the protocol, in particular, in paragraph 2, which reads:  "Considering the unexpected death of the prime minister and some members of her government."  

So we were compelled to write a protocol -- a new protocol to address this new situation and also to comply with the prevailing situation.  

These are the factual elements that led us to write this protocol.  In fact, we foresaw that the prime minister would have to change; that a new -- another prime minister would have to be appointed.  Not a change of prime minister, but, rather, the appointment of a new prime minister and the -- that the ministers who had died also had to be replaced.  So it was not easy to do otherwise.  And we were, therefore, compelled to proceed as we did.  
Q.	Was it the MRND -- since you were a member of that group -- that imposed its point of view in order to arrive at conclusions? 
A.	No.  We did not impose anything at all.  We explained the situation.  When I talk of the agreements of others, it doesn't mean that we obtained their agreement without a discussion.  No.  We discussed.  

The others asked for explanations; they made their objections.  But at the end of the discussion, they were convinced that that was the right approach, especially when we discussed the role of the government was -- what the mission of the government was, they understood us better.  

Now, when we discussed the role of the government, which is -- which is indicated in the additional protocol of 8th April 1994, we did not impose our point of view.  That is not in our nature.  We had a free discussion.  It was a matter of law.  It was not a matter of imposing.  This was a matter of law.  We discussed, we argued, but we did not impose anything whatsoever.  
Q.	And what was the philosophy underpinning these agreements?  Was the philosophy to -- to replicate the previous situation by maintaining ministerial portfolios, or did you have to make any changes?  How did things unfold subsequently?  And what decision was taken by the various parties represented in that discussion in that meeting? 
A.	Mr. President, there are -- or there were political parties that changed.  For example, you have the MDR and it was their role to designate a prime minister.  So the MDR designated a prime minister who was not present at the meeting.  Mr. Kambanda was in his house.  He was not attending the meeting, but it was his party that designated him.  

In the MRND, we did not find it necessary to change.  So we reappointed the team that was already in place, including the ministers who were on mission abroad.  I can hear mention the minister of defence, the minister of the interior and communal development who had remained in Dar es Salaam.  We did not change our team.  

The Parti libéral, the PL party, did not change either its team.  No, I think they did.  They changed one minister, but the other two ministers were re-designated.  

The PDC, the Parti démocrate-chrétien, did not change its team.  

Others changed.  The Parti social-démocrate, that is, the PSD, did change their members.  
I believe the MDR also changed a few members.  Yes.  

So for our part, we did not change.  The MRND did not change its team.  
Q.	During that meeting, during those crucial moments, what was the status given to the RPF in that process?  Was the -- could the RPF be contacted?  Can you tell the Court what the situation was at that time.  
A.	We were in a situation of war.  We were not able to contact the RPF, but that does not mean that we forgot its existence.  

Those who assert that our determination was to leave aside the RPF, to forget the RPF and to continue with the war, are mistaken.  They are speaking from an emotional point of view.  They say what they think, but they are not taking into consideration what existed.  

If you look at the protocol -- alinéa -- article 4, alinéa B of the protocol, it states that, in the tasks assigned to the government, the government would continue discussions with the Rwandan Patriotic Front for the putting in place of the broad-based transition institutions within the time limit not exceeding six weeks.  

I heard some witnesses who came before this Court and said that we called into question the Arusha Accords.  No.  That did not happen.  That is not what sub-paragraph B says as regards the assignment of the government -- continuing -- namely, to continue discussions with the RPF for the putting in place of the broad-based transition institutions within a time limit not exceeding six weeks.  

As far as we were concerned, the Arusha Accords were something that had been dealt with.  They were a truth, a reality that could not be revisited.  But what was important was the putting in place of the transition institutions as provided for in the Arusha Accords.  

And that is what we recommended to those ministers who were going to form -- be in the government; that is what we also recommended to the government, namely, to put in place the transition institutions.  We didn't tell them to continue prosecuting the war or to forget the Arusha Accords.  That was not the intention of the political parties at that time.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	You said that you were in a war situation.  Who initiated the war at that time? 
A.	Clearly, it was the RPF.  I am not the only one who has -- or who holds that view.  Even the experts of the Tribunal hold that view.  But the RPF also had sent -- that it was sending its troops to punish. 

Kaga -- 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
Kagame, who was the military leader of the RPF at the time referred to, on the 9th of April gave foreign troops -- or ordered foreign troops to leave Rwanda, failing which they would be considered as 
enemy forces.  That was his ultimatum.  He's the one who started the widespread attack which started the war.  

The RPF resumed hostilities on the 7th.  I would even say on the 6th, because the first troops that started attacking inside the country were set in motion as soon as the plane was attacked -- the president's plane was attacked.  

Now, our wish had always been that the president's assassin should be looked for and that the opinion of some experts should be taken into consideration, experts who assert that it was the RPF which started -- which resumed hostilities.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	A short while ago, you made reference to the mission assigned to the government.  Did all 
political parties attending that meeting agree on that mission?  And can you remind the Court what the mission was, that is, the mission assigned to the government.  
A.	Yes.  Let us proceed in an orderly fashion.  I will begin first with the mission, and then the attitude of the parties will be addressed later.  

That mission -- the details of that mission are given in article 4 of the additional protocol of 8th April 1994.  And the mission is as follows: 

"The parties' signatories to this additional protocol have come to an agreement to assign to the government -- or to ask the government to carry out the following mission:  

"Ensure the effective management of state affairs by laying special emphasis on the rapid, speedy restoration of law and order and security of people and property; 

"B, continue negotiations with the Rwandan Patriotic Front in order to put in place the broad-based transitional institutions within a time limit not exceeding six weeks; 

"C, attack with utmost energy -- or strength to the food problem by looking for ways and means of coming to the aid of populations affected in some préfectures and war-displaced persons."  

That was the mission assigned to the government.  

Now, let us come to the attitude of the political parties.  

There was a political party that expressed reservations, not because they were not in agreement, but because they said they were going to contact their political bureau.  But, otherwise, they agreed, and I believe they signed the protocol with some reservations.  

Yes.  You have Mr. Sibomana for the PDC, and Gaspard Ruhumuliza, as well as Célestin Kabanda.  These members of the political bureau -- these were members of the political bureau.  They had to consult their respective parties.  That was the only reservation they expressed regarding this 
document -- regarding that mission -- or regarding this document, in general, but they signed the protocol, nevertheless.  

So it did -- this did not cause any problem.  There was no problem of -- regarding accepting this mission, which was reasonable and logical in my opinion.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	How did that meeting end?  And what was the follow-up once the additional protocol was signed?  Did you break up?  Was there a follow-up?  At about what time did you complete the writing of this document?  Can you throw light on all these matters.  
A.	Yes.  We concluded our deliberations -- our work at 5 p.m. -- perhaps 5:30 p.m.  I do not remember the exact time.  But the next step was to go and inform the crisis committee as well as the 
army high command.  We had to go and inform these two bodies of the conclusions that they were waiting for from the politicians.  

That was logical, since they had expressed the wish that politicians assume their responsibilities.  It was, therefore, logical for us to go and present to them the political position that we had adopted or taken.  

So we went to the ESM, l'École supérieure militaire, where the crisis committee was meeting.  That is where we were taken, I believe, in vehicles.  We were taken there in vehicles because it was becoming late; it was becoming dark.  I believe the time was 6 p.m. -- 6:30 p.m.  

So we went to the ESM -- that is, the École supérieure militaire to inform the crisis committee -- to inform them.  
Q.	Who was present at the ESM?  Do you remember some of those who were present, apart from members of the crisis committee?  If you also have the identity of the members of the crisis committee, please can you give them to the Court.  
A.	No.  Now, we can read names everywhere, but on that day it was difficult to know who was who.  There were so many officers, so many of them that it was practically impossible to identify them.  
But there was General Ndindiliyimana; there was Colonel Bagosora; there was Colonel Rusatira, he had not yet been made general; there was Colonel Gatsinzi, he, too, had not become a general at the time referred to.  There was Dallaire.  I think Dallaire was present.  I also have the impression -- well, I do not remember whether Colonel Marchal was there.  But there you go.  I focused my attention on the high table -- on the podium, and these are the persons I can mention.  Of course, there were other people in the room, but they did not catch my attention that much.  

You know that when you are not expecting a trial -- we never expected a trial, and we never expected a trial in governing our country.  No one -- none of us imagined that this could be an offence.  And I believe up to now, it was not an offence for us to form a government and that is why we did not pay a great deal of attention.  
Q.	Was Mr. Sindikubwabo also present as well as Jean Kambanda?  If yes, at what time did they arrive?  Did you go and look for them, and, if yes, who went to look for them? 
A.	I believe that it is his party that went to get Kambanda.  As for Sindikubwabo, he lived nearby and he was fetched rather easily.  So I think he was there.  He was at home.  
Q.	Thank you.  Who took the floor before the crisis committee to outline the conclusions of your meeting? 
A.	The political parties had asked me to present the conclusions of our deliberations to the crisis committee.  So I am the one who took the floor to explain things from a legal and juridical standpoint.  So I am the one who presented the results of the deliberations of the political parties.  
Q.	Following that presentation of the conclusions, were there any challenges, any protests, or were the conclusions approved?  What was the reaction? 
A.	They applauded.  And I do not have any recollection of any protests.  Rather, the political parties were commended and congratulated for a job well done.  I do not have any recollection of any protests whatsoever.  
Q.	Were you able to note General Dallaire's behaviour or conduct, or were you not?  And I would ask that you answer as briefly as possible.  
A.	No.  I did not observe anything special.  I did not observe any facial expression of a special nature.  You see, I had been present at a number of meetings with Dallaire who, generally, was quite an emotional person, who would even pull his hair when he was not satisfied with one thing or the other.  And this did happen often at some of the meetings for the setting up of the transitional institutions.  

He's somebody who would blush and who would even pull his hair.  And I really don't want to dishevel my own hair because that's why I'm not pulling on my hair.  But Dallaire was one who would have that type of reaction when he was not satisfied with anything.  

So what I'm saying is that I did not observe any particular facial expression by way of reaction from Mr. Dallaire.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  According to the indictment, the attack of the 6th of April created a power crisis between the civilian and military persons in Rwanda.  Théoneste Bagosora, having failed to bring the situation under control, extremist forces within the army and of the MRND, as well as other political parties belonging to the Hutu Power movement, including Édouard Karemera, and Matthieu Ngirumpatse, as well as the late Joseph Nzirorera, agreed to impose a -- an interim civilian government with a view to fill the power vacuum.  

What is your reaction to that accusation?  Did you have to fill that power vacuum?  
A.	I have already answered that question.  I never considered that an independent state would be committing an offence if it sought to fill a power vacuum.  There is no law which forbids a sovereign and independent country from forming a government and filling a power vacuum were it to occur.  

Now, the question as to whether we imposed our position, I have already answered that question.  It was very important for us for the other political powers to be present.  It is our party which requested at the CND that all the other parties should be present, and we did not intervene in their decision to attend.  We did not intervene in the designation of their ministers.  The accusation is, therefore, entirely false.  

The mission assigned to the new government does not prove, substantiate or support the accusation in the indictment, and that is why I believe that the accusation is false.  
Q.	According to you, was there a more legitimate approach to filling the power vacuum, or would it have been more legitimate not to fill the power vacuum? 
A.	It would have been entirely irresponsible not to assume our responsibilities at a time when the population needed us to do, when the armed forces was asking us to do so, and when the representative of the United Nations was requesting that we proceed to fill the power vacuum.  

Let us not forget, Mr. President, Your Honours, that it was the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations who initiated the procedure for setting up the institutions.  He has appeared before this Trial Chamber.  He has testified and acknowledged that fact.  I, therefore, do not think that this would have amounted to a crime or an offence on his part.  I believe that he must have consulted New York prior to handing over that message or giving that message to Bagosora.  That is my answer.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Next question:  The interim government, was it set up on the 8th April 1994 with the intention to rely on the apparatus, the resources and the legitimacy of the state in order to conduct a génocidaire policy against the Tutsis of Rwanda, as is alleged in the indictment?  What is your answer to that?  
A.	Mr. President, this is a false accusation.  When that government started its business or its work on the 9th of May (sic), not on the 5th -- not on the 8th -- on the 9th of April, people had been dying from the 6th.  Others were fleeing; others were running away.  

It is not the government that started the massacres.  It is the assassination of the president that sparked the killings.  It is the resumption of war by the RPF that sparked the killing.  It is the RPF getting out of its barracks in the CND that started the killing.  

When the government was sworn in on the 9th, things were already, more or less, desperate.  You see, people were already killing each other.  And I say killing each other.  You see, the indictment has considered the killing only from one angle in order to protect one of the parties to the conflict.  

So my position -- the exact reality is that people were killing each other, and that was a reflection of the reality on the ground.  For these reasons, the accusation is false.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Did you agree with other persons to set up the interim government of the 8th of April with the intention to rely on the state apparatus and resources, as well as on the legitimacy of state authority, to destroy the Tutsi population of Rwanda, as alleged by the Prosecutor? 
A.	Mr. President, I am sorry that the Prosecution would have engaged in such considerations that are clearly baseless.  The missions that we assigned to the government, the messages that we issued, the calls that we made -- and the prayers that we made for the people of Rwanda when we called on them to ensure that goods and persons and property were safe, I do not believe that these are the types of things that can be woven into the type of allegations made against us.  

The mission and the tasks of the government are specific and clear.  And that is the answer I can provide to that question.  
Q.	Now, could you also answer this question:  Was it part of a joint criminal enterprise that answered 
to the -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters did not understand counsel's question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you repeat the question, please, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Let me repeat the question slowly, so you can understand all the shades of meaning in my question.  

This is the question:  Was it within the framework of a joint criminal enterprise that you reacted to the requests that were made to you?  From an entirely legalistic standpoint, did you use the law to undertake a joint criminal enterprise? 
A.	Mr. President, that is a rather difficult-to-swallow piece of fabrication.  You see, we had been invited by the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to proceed.  That, in that scenario, would have been the first party to the joint criminal enterprise.  So if we had not been called into it, then we would not have been part of it.  It is for this reason that I say that the accusation is false.  
We did not use the law to do evil.  We used the law to save the nation.  That was our intention, even though, because of the position of the RPF, it was not possible for us to achieve that goal.  

Let me state clearly what has already been stated by dissident members of the RPF.  It was possible for the killings to be stopped if the RPF and their chief, President Kagame, had shown the slightest hint of cooperation with the government.  That is the answer I can give to your question.  
Q.	Still dealing with the indictment.  Was the interim government set up in illicit and illegitimate circumstances as purported by the indictment? 
A.	Mr. President, I have already mentioned the opinion of the legal office of the United Nations.  The government was nev -- neither illicit, illegal or illegitimate.  That is my answer.  

The government was set up on the basis of existing instruments.  Its mission was clear.  And the government was neither illicit, illegitimate nor illegal.  And the United Nations agreed with us on that position.  And I believe that their opinion has not changed on that matter so far.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, please assist and place document number 3 before the witness.  That document is already in evidence as Exhibit D. NZ425.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, you have just answered my question by referring to an opinion of the United Nations on the legitimacy of the interim government.  

The document before you, is that the document which contains that opinion?  And can you start by telling the Court who is the author of that document.  
A.	On page 1, I see the following: 

"To:  Dallaire for -- for Riza, UNAMIR, Kigali.  

"From:  Annan, United Nations, New York.  

"Clarifications on the legal issues raised by the RPF."

Let me read further on.  
"...please find attached a self-explanatory memorandum from the Legal Office on the clarifications you requested regarding the status of the 'interim government' and the 'legality' of Security Council resolution 918 (1994).  

Regards."

Then, I turn to the conclusion on point 2, and I will not read the entire document.  

Paragraph "1." -- I do not know whether I have leave from the President to read everything or that I should read only the conclusions.  

Paragraph "2." --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, would the conclusions be sufficient for your purpose? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes.  Yes, indeed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ngirumpatse, you can begin at "2."
THE WITNESS:
"As far as the validity of res -- as the -- of resolution 918 is concerned, the resolution was validly adopted and there is no question as to its legality.  The practice under Article 27...is far from uniform but the recent practice tends to show that it has been -- it has been observed more in the breach than in its implementation.  Two of the more -- the more recent examples of this are the votes in the Falklands case and the hostages' case in which the UK and the US, respectively, voted.  In any event, the question was not raised in the course of the Security Council's adoption of 918 and no discussion of this point occurred."  

But let me add that, at paragraph 1 -- or, rather, the preamble raises a number of questions.

	"A.  Is the 'interim government' in Gitarama a successor government to the legitimate government of Rwanda?

"B.  Is Security Council resolution 918...valid despite the fact that an interested party participated in the vote contrary to Article 27...of the United Nations Charter?"

So in summary:

"Although the Arusha Agreement, by its terms, had come into effect upon -- upon signature, and President Habyarimana was subsequently sworn in as President, the Transitional -- the 
Transitional gov -- Assembly and the other organs of that -- the -- the Transitional Government were never established.  Therefore, the Government of Rwanda, which ceased to exist shortly after the death of the President on 6 April '94, was not the Transitional Government.  Consequently, the 
Arusha Agreement, including its succession provisions, are not applicable to the succession issue.  That question would therefore be governed by the constitutional law of Rwanda.  

"Moreover, the factual situation inside Rwanda has yet to stabilise with de facto authority apparently being exercised by several competitors for power.  The 'interim Government' seems, nevertheless, to be operating, at least in some parts of Rwanda, as the de facto authority.  As such, it can, in our opinion, legally be contacted -- legally be contacted and dealt with by the United Nations in the same manner as other potential contributors to the peace process in Rwanda."  

I believe that, although my English is poor, the document reasserts the constitutional and legal character of the government which dovetails with my reasoning.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  To conclude on that point, I would like to ask Mr. Issa to place before you D. NZ405, which is an exhibit -- a United Nations document as well.  And I invite you to read paragraph 6 of that document, which deals with Dallaire and Booh-Booh's request for the setting up of the interim government.  
(Pages 21 to 35 by Jean Baigent)

















1200H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN (continued): 
Q.	This is a cable of 7 April '94.  
A.	I have the document and I am at paragraph 6.  And you asked me to read; is that what you want me to do?  
Q.	Yes, please proceed.  
A.	"We have been in touch on the telephone with both SRSG and FRC commander de la force.  They hope to convene meeting tomorrow morning to try and establish an interim authority.  If this is successful and there are some sign of -- there are -- and there are some sign of a semblance of stability returning, then continue the presence of UNAMIR probably -- will probably -- will become an important factor in the restoring order.  If, on the other hand, the situation continues to deteriorate, there may be no option but to recommend the withdrawal of UNAMIR to the Council."  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  That is important material which describes the framework in which you intervened, which was legal and which was within the normal network of the United Nations.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Did you hold any position in that government -- at the time of drafting those accords and various instruments, did you hold any position in that government? 
A.	No.  Except from the 18th of May, I believe.  On the 18th of May I was appointed by the cabinet to the position of minister without portfolio at the presidency.  And this was particularly for reasons relating to foreign relations.  And I travelled often, and so it is not simply by claiming that one was the chairman of a political party that one had access to travel abroad.  So there was need for the president to have an adviser on foreign affairs.  And because I travelled often, I needed to be appointed to that position to facilitate my travels.  

And I was appointed to that position on the 18th of May.  I did not receive any salary for that post, and this needs to be underscored.  So from the early days of April to -- up until the 18th of May, I did not hold any -- until the 18th of May, I did not hold any position in that government.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, why were you involved in these matters?  Why did you not flee to an embassy like others did in Rwanda at that time? 
A.	It's not because I did not have anywhere to go to.  I went abroad several days, several weeks, and several times.  But, as I said the other day, it is not -- it is not because a country is in difficulties that we should choose to run away if you are somebody responsible.  I have always believed that the RPF was going to accept a ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations for the putting in place of the transition institutions.  Very few people at the time thought that the RPF wanted executive power.  

On the other hand, I was useful, in a way, because I was present.  You would tell me that was a difficult choice.  Yes, Mr. President, it was a difficult choice.  It was a choice required by the conditions of my fellow countrymen and the country.  I had responsibilities or duties to carry out, and my duties were not to kill, but rather to accompany my fellow countrymen to come out of their difficulties.  I therefore did not find it appropriate to leave.  

I had connections abroad.  It was even suggested to me that I should leave and go abroad.  But I do not think that courage amounts in fleeing, in running away, instead of coping with the events, although they may be difficult and dangerous.  So that is the answer I can give to your question.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	At the time you are giving your evidence, your testimony, do you regret having remained in the country?  
A.	I have already said that I regret only one thing in those events, and that is the death of my fellow countrymen, fellow countrywomen, all my compatriots without any distinction.  Otherwise, yes, I agree that I have been detained, I am now being tried.  But that is not the utmost suffering on earth.  Some people died gratuitously, for nothing, simply because they found themselves in the way of the killers, in the way of those who carried weapons.  Therefore, yes, I am suffering, I agree, but I do not regret that -- I do not regret that.  This is the time not to regret, but rather to think of the future.  But it should be hoped that the people of Rwanda should reconcile themselves to one another and live together.  

I -- I would like to say what I think about this reconciliation.  I think it will be necessary for the two belligerent parties to give an account of their conduct.  It is not through selective prosecution, selective trials, that we'll arrive at that reconciliation.  It will be difficult to arrive at reconciliation through these selective trials.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	I will try to conclude on the day of the 8th of April.  You have given your account.  Did you return home after the meeting at the ESM, and at what time did that meeting end?  What in fact happened?  
A.	The meeting entered -- ended quite late, at about 8:30 p.m.  Mr. Karemera and myself wanted to return, but I met General Gatsinzi at the reception at Hôtel des Diplomates.  I believe that everyone now knows the name General Gatsinzi, he was interim chief of staff at the time referred to.  He became a minister of defence in Kagage's (sic) government.  But he left that ministry, that is the ministry of defence.  But he's still a member of government.  He is in a ministry the name of which I have forgotten, but he is still in Kigali.  

He is the one who told me not to return.  He said, "You do not stand a chance of arriving home in your house."  General Gatsinzi was someone close to me, he was someone with whom I had good relations.  He told me, "The RPF is already in your neighbourhood.  You do not stand a chance of getting home.  If you have to go across the area, if you want to take that road, it is certain you will die on the way."  He told me, "You should sleep here."  And that is how both of us stayed the night, that is I and Karemera, stayed the night at Hôtel des Diplomates.  
So, on the 8th I did not return to my house.  I am insisting on this because I was very worried.  When Gatsinzi told me that, I knew that I had left my family on the other side, in my house -- or that I had -- or that I had left vulnerable people.  I do not want to mention their names; I do not want to mention their origins.  I had left vulnerable people in my house.  So I did not sleep that night.  But I stayed the night at Hôtel des Diplomates; I was able to obtain a room at that hotel and I stayed the night there.  I did not return home on the 8th.  

Furthermore, I did not return home -- well, my family was able to struggle to get out, and that was a case of other people, thanks to gendarmes and UNAMIR personnel, all these people were able to be taken to Hôtel des Mille Collines, and my family went to Eden Garden.  I was not present when my family was being taken from my house to those hotels, so I am not an eyewitness to those -- to that transfer.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	So you stayed at Hôtel des Diplomates on the evening of the 8th to the 9th of April.  Did you -- first of all, I think I should ask my question.  You just explained to the Court that you did not return to your house in Kicukiro.  But did you go out of Hôtel des Diplomates to go somewhere else in Kigali town for the purpose of participating in meetings on that evening of the 8th of April?  
A.	No.  I did not go out of the hotel for the good reason that -- well, it's very simple.  From morning we were counting on difficult things.  I was -- it was not the moment for someone in Kigali at that time to move about, to visit friends, because there was shooting from everywhere, mortars, submachine guns, rifles, guns, grenades.  Hell had broken loose; the situation was very, very bad.  
Q.	The Prosecution explained that you had control over those who were misbehaving in Kigali, who were committing offences in Kigali.  After that meeting, you had put in place a government to restore law and order and the legitimate authority.  During the same time, did you meet those people who were committing offences in order to ask them to continue committing the offences?  
A.	No.  I did not meet anyone that night.  Even the members of government perhaps were not able to meet anyone, because it was already late and the situation in town was not good.  I did not meet anyone; I did not speak to anyone.  I remained at the hotel. 
Q.	Can you explain to the Court what remained of the MRND party after the 6th of April?  Did the party machinery continue functioning?  Did you hold meetings, apart from the meeting that you just mentioned?  How did the party function at that time, that is, the party of which you were chairman?  
A.	The functioning of the party was very poor, very poor.  I know that during my trips abroad Mr. Karemera and Mr. Nzirorera came together.  They were also able to find some members of the political bureau, but not all of them.  But, in fact, the party came practically to a standstill.  People were not available, some had fled, others were held up in places from which they could not come out.  I have already stated that the second vice-chairman, that is Mr. Kabagema, we no longer saw him.  

The situation was extremely difficult.  Whenever we met, it was in fact very few of us who met.  And it was very difficult to put across our ideas, to -- the radio was still working.  Perhaps it was through the radio that we could make an announcement, that is all.  But the party was not functioning well at all.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now, the 9th of April, what did you do on that date?  What main activities did you carry out on the 9th of April, and from where, or at what place did you carry out those activities?  
A.	I remained at Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th of April.  On the 9th of April there was a swearing-in ceremony of -- for the president of the republic and the prime minister.  I attended that swearing-in ceremony on the 9th, in the morning.  Yes, that is what I did.  Otherwise, I remained at Hôtel des Diplomates, and I attended in the swearing-in ceremony of the ministers.  
Q.	Did you receive news of your family and news of other people you had left the day before?  On the 9th of April, did you have means of contacting them?  
A.	No.  There was no means for me to contact them, because on the 7th -- the 7th of April, after having answered the call of the officer who told me they were going to send a vehicle, telephone lines were disconnected, there was no telephone communication.  In fact, the RPF had destroyed the commuter or transmitter.  They had also shot at the earth satellite, and that crippled the telephone system.  Therefore I had no means of communication, and that is why I was highly worried.  Our telephone -- I had two telephone numbers at home, and the telephone was no longer working.  Therefore I had no news of my family.  

I believe I saw them again on the 10th, perhaps, somewhere around that date.  I have no recollection of the exact date when I saw them.  In fact, moreover, it was not all of them that I saw again.  
Q.	On the 9th of April, did you meet Interahamwe leaders? 
A.	It was not the 9th, it was on the 10th.  On the 9th I did not meet them.  I did not meet Interahamwe leaders.  
Q.	Did you meet Robert Kajuga on the 6th, the 7th, the 8th, and the 9th of April 1994?  
A.	It was impossible for me to meet him.  I did not meet him.  And even after those dates I did not see him.  I think I met him in Kinshasa after July, when we were refugees in Kinshasa.  Otherwise, when I left Kigali, I did not return.  So my answer is I did not meet him during the days you mentioned, for the simple fact that on the 7th I was at the ministry of defence very early in the morning, I spent the day of the 8th at the ministry of defence, on the 9th I was at Hôtel des Diplomates; he did not arrive there.  Moreover, I was busy.  On the 10th -- maybe we will continue.  But, in any case, I did not meet him during those days. 
Q.	Witness AWE purports or alleges that he saw you coming out of the residence of Georges Rutaganda in the month of April, just at the beginning of the killings.  He explained or pointed out that it was right at the beginning of the killings, that many people were being killed, that to arrive in Rutaganda's house he had to pass near corpses throughout his itinerary.  During the day of the 9th -- before you answer that important question:  During the day of the 9th, for example, did you go to Rutaganda's garage?  Where is Rutaganda's garage located?  
A.	My answer is no, I did not go to that garage.  I did not go out of the hotel on the 9th. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could the witness also answer the rest of the question?  I believe Ms. Hounkpatin also asked where the garage is located.  
THE WITNESS:
I did not hear that question.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Yes, indeed, I asked you whether you knew Rutaganda's garage.  
A.	Yes, I know where it is located.  
Q.	And where is it located? 
A.	It is located on the road that goes to Nyamirambo, on the road that goes to Kigali hospital.  It was in the heart of town.  It was near the plateau area, it was near the Belgian school.  There was the medical office of Dr. Gasasira.  It was not very far from downtown.  And that is why when he talks of corpses at that place, corpses that were seen, coming from the Hôtel des Diplomates, it is very, very unlikely.  The possibilities of seeing corpses in that location were zero, nil.  
Q.	Witness AWE, when he was cross-examined, put that scene, that is the -- the scene or event when he saw you coming out of Georges Rutaganda's garage, puts that scene, in the final analysis, at the end of the month of April.  Do you have any comments to make on that allegation made by that witness?  
A.	I regret for him, at the end of the month of April I was not in Rwanda.  From the 22nd I was not in Rwanda.  On the 22nd of April, I was not in Rwanda.  So if he talks of the end of the month of April, he is wrong.  I was not in Rwanda at the time.  And I would point out that when I left Kigali on the twenth (sic) of April, I did not return to Rwanda (sic).  In fact, I have not returned to Rwanda (sic) since then.  

Therefore, I would like to repeat so that it should be well understood:  These witnesses were trying to save their lives.  These are people who ran the risk of being sentenced to death at the time, and even though the death sentence has been abolished, some of them may be sentenced for life, some of them are imprisoned in -- alone in solitary confinement.  I was not in the month of -- I was not in Rwanda at the end of the month of April.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, what we're hearing in English is that the witness was not in Rwanda after the 12th of April.  Is that a mistranslation or is that what the witness said?  I think he means Kigali.  I don't know if it's a mistake coming from the witness or from the -- from the interpretation.  Could Ms. Hounkpatin clarify that, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm going to do that.  

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, from the 8th of April, did you remain in Rwanda, or had you fled -- or, did you flee from Rwanda?  
A.	I heard what the Prosecution said.  I'm going to clarify what I said.  I said that I left Kigali on the 12th of April 1994, and that until date I did not return to Kigali, since I left that town on the 12th of April.  I added, but I had said so before, that from the 22nd of April, I was not in Rwanda.  But from the 12th of April I did not -- I was not in Kigali.  I do not know whether this is clear enough.  I do not know whether I have addressed the Prosecution's concerns.  
Q.	I'm going to ask you a question that will enable counsel for the Prosecution to understand.  You left Rwanda on the 22nd of April.  Did you return to Rwanda or did you flee from Rwanda?  
A.	No.  I was not alone, I was in a delegation.  We were many in that delegation because we had -- we were on mission.  I left on the 21st.  I believe I left on the -- Gitarama on the 21st, I went to Gisenyi, I stayed the night in Gisenyi.  But I returned to Rwanda on the 15th of May, 15th of May, after a long trip that took me to several African countries, to France, to Switzerland.  I returned on the 15th of May -- I returned to Rwanda on the 15th of May.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I would like to know, from the 6th of April until the date where we are, when did you become aware of the killings that were being perpetrated in your country?  And can you tell the Court how far you were aware of the security situation?  
A.	First of all, from the 8th, when we met the members of the other political parties, we already had information.  They were living in various neighbourhoods.  In Kicukiro there were no killings, neither on the 7th or the 8th, when we left.  The situation was sufficiently calm.  It was only Hus's family that had been killed.  Otherwise there was nothing, there were no killings.  

But when we met the other political parties, we obtained a lot of information.  But we even had more information on the 9th.  On the 9th of April, after the swearing-in ceremony, the government held its first cabinet meeting.  And it was in that meeting that they exchanged information, that they were able to obtain information from the army, from the gendarmerie as well.  And everyone was made aware of the scope of the killings that were being perpetrated, killings which had started on the 7th during the day.  

On the 9th, a lot of damage had already been caused, a lot of damage at a time when the government was sworn in.  From the 9th we had a great deal of information.  And that is what partially explains the steps that were taken, or the steps that we tried to take -- rather, the steps that the government tried to take from the 9th.  
Q.	Can you explain to the Court whether you attended that cabinet meeting of the 9th of April, and the means by which you were informed -- the means by which you received the details of the killings that were being perpetrated in the town and elsewhere?  
A.	I did not attend the cabinet meeting, but that cabinet meeting sent Minister Mugenzi to alert leaders of political parties, asking them to make their contribution to calm down militants and the young people of the various political parties.  That was on the 9th, after the cabinet meeting.  That is when Minister Mugenzi came to look for me, to give me the government's message, which message was to calm down militants and the young people of various political parties.  So that was on the 9th.  It was on the 9th that I had the government's message regarding that point.  That was late; it was in the afternoon.  
Q.	My question was the following -- before you answered or specified that it was late in the afternoon, I first wanted to know when the swearing-in ceremony took place, the swearing-in ceremony that you mentioned earlier on.  I also would like to know whether you know the time when the cabinet meeting was held.  
A.	The cabinet meeting certainly took place after -- in the afternoon, because the swearing-in started late.  It started after 10 o'clock.  So around midday we were still at that ceremony, and the cabinet meeting took place in the afternoon.  So I received the message in the afternoon, late in the afternoon.  
Q.	Can you give a time frame; for example, between 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., 1 p.m. and 6 p.m.  
A.	I would say between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., or perhaps 4 p.m.  Somewhere thereabout.  
Q.	Thank you.  And Minister Mugenzi made that request of you.  Was he alone at the time he made the request, or was he together with other people?  And, if yes, who were those other people?  
A.	I have the impression that I was alone, but Joseph Nzirorera was not far away.  So I immediately sent to him Minister Mugenzi's message.  But I have the impression that I was alone.  Or perhaps with Nzirorera.  But what I'm sure of is that Karemera was not there.  But it is possible that Joseph was present.  But my recollection of who I was with is not precise.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, my understanding of the question was whether Mr. Mugenzi was alone when he approached Mr. Ngirumpatse.  If Ms. Hounkpatin can clarify.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
My question, indeed, was to determine whether Mr. Ngirumpatse was alone when he received information from Minister Mugenzi.  But the other question can also be put to him.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Were there any other members of government who informed you of the decision of the 
	council of ministers?  
A.	Well, that would be a different question.  When Mugenzi came he was alone.  
Q.	Thank you.  When you received that information, what did you do?  Did you decide to contact the Interahamwe again, or -- question:  Did you contact those persons on the 9th?  
A.	No.  I informed Joseph Nzirorera of the decision and asked him how we could proceed.  We discussed the matter and came to the understanding that it would be easier to transmit the message to the Interahamwe.  Because, you know, it would be difficult to pass on a message of that nature to all members, except one were to use the radio.  And we thought that it was easier to pass on that information to the youth, who would then inform not only their comrades but also all other members.  

So this information was not only for the Interahamwe, but it was also for all members of the party.  So Joseph was able to contact some of them, or identify some of them on the 9th, but nobody was able to meet them.  

In any event, I passed on the information to Joseph, who then was in charge to -- in charge of forwarding it.  And that is what happened on the 9th.  
Q.	One more question, Mr. Ngirumpatse, regarding those killings:  Did you issue any instructions or orders for the killings to take place?  
A.	No.  My answer is no.  
Q.	So you remained at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th of April.  What happened on the 10th of April?  
A.	Two main activities took place on the 10th of April, as far as I am concerned.  The first is that the Interahamwe, or some members of the Interahamwe committee came, four or five of them.  And I remember that Nkezabera -- N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A, Nkezabera, Ephrem -- Nkezabera, Ephrem, was among them.  There was also Maniragaba, M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A.  And then there was also Sebanetsi, S-E-B-A-N-T-S-I (sic).  And then there was another one, someone else whose name I do not immediately remember.  It may come to mind shortly -- yeah, well, I think it was Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-T-E-G-E-K-A (sic).  

I might not be 100 per cent sure, but this is the first event of that day, namely, the meeting with those people who had been contacted by Joseph.  So we passed on the minister -- the message from Minister Mugenzi to them.  

The second activity of that day -- 
Q.	Well, you're going too fast.  As far as you can recall, Mr. Ngirumpatse, at what time did that meeting take place?  And who organised it?  You told us already that you received the information on the 9th in the evening, discussed it with Joseph Nzirorera who was in a position to be able to, and who indeed contacted those people.  How was that meeting organised and at what time did it start?  
A.	Those persons came to the Hôtel des Diplomates, and that's all I can say.  I do not know how Joseph managed to contact them.  But they were at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 10th, the 10th, at around 11 a.m. or thereabouts.  Yes.  
Q.	What did you tell them?  You were there; how did you present the situation to them?  Or were they aware of the situation and did they provide you with some information as well?  
A.	Yes, they were aware of the situation having deteriorated from the 7th, not in the morning, the 7th in the afternoon, when things began to get worse.  They were aware of that situation.  

How did we pass on the message to them?  I simply repeated what Minister Mugenzi had told me, namely, that government was worried about the scale of the killings that were taking place, and that we had received a mission from the government to contact our party members to ask them to calm down and also inform them that this was not -- in fact, that the mission of government -- of the government was to stop the killings and to provide security for persons and property.  

So we told them to go around and do the rounds and calm down the militants, or supporters, and the youth who were at roadblocks or at any other location where they may be doing something evil.  That is what happened.  And we also went on to explain to them -- and I need to repeat this point -- that the issue was not one of ethnicity, that it was not the ethnic groups that brought down the presidential plane.  

So we asked that they ask people to remain calm as they await instructions from the government and the armed forces.  We told them that it was not timely and appropriate for any ethnic wars to take place, and that, either out of anger or suspicion, people should not engage in these types of activities.  That is the thrust of the message that we passed on to those people.  
Q.	Witness G -- by the way, thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Witness G testified before this Trial Chamber that in the morning of 10 April 1994, and at the request of Joseph Nzirorera of blessed memory, they went to the Hôtel des Diplomates -- he went to Hôtel des Diplomates, along with other members of the Interahamwe committee, and that there were other officials and yourself at the hotel, in particular the interim president of the republic.  And that Joseph Nzirorera chaired that meeting, at which he allegedly told them that the government had assigned him the duty of contacting the Interahamwe, that is, of contacting those particular Interahamwe.  

Question:  Is that the manner in which that meeting unfolded?  Did the late Joseph Nzirorera make any such statement?  What is your reaction to that narration of the facts?  
A.	Those statements are false.  In our party, and as a matter of discipline, whenever there was a meeting attended by the chairman, it was the chairman who spoke first.  So this was a sacrosanct rule that was never breached.  So Joseph never took the floor before the chairman.  And I was present at the meeting.  So what the witness has narrated does not tally with reality.  It is untrue.  
Q.	He goes on to say that, in addition to the Interahamwe committee members who were present, there were other officials in attendance, particularly the president of the republic.  Do you agree or disagree with that version of facts?  
A.	I do disagree entirely with that narration.  It was not necessary for the president of the republic to be present at such a meeting.  At that time he was busy with the prime minister and other ministers in cabinet meetings as they sought solutions to the problems at hand.  So the answer is no, the 
	president of the republic did not -- could not have attended any such meeting.  That is entirely false; that is incorrect.  
Q.	(No interpretation) 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I apologise; I may not have heard the beginning of the question.  But whose purported narration is this that is being put to the witness now?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
My Learned Colleague, I'm referring to your witness, G, and I stated that at the beginning of my question.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	In that narration about the meeting, Witness G -- and we will be looking at other aspects later on.  He claims that the late Nzirorera allegedly said that government had given him the task of contacting those -- those Interahamwe.  What is your reaction to that, to the use of possessive pronoun in relation to those specific Interahamwe?  
A.	Well, maybe he made the statement because he was a Prosecution witness.  Let me say that I know Witness G, and maybe I will have opportunity to talk about him in relation to other matters.  In any event, that was a master of intrigue and who had many problems -- who raised many problems of regionalism within the youth movement.  And I believe that I may be able to deal with that issue later on.  

In any event, Joseph never made any such statement.  I did not hear any such statement.  And, by the way, I am the one who took the floor.  I am the one who conveyed Mugenzi's message.  Joseph did not receive that message from the minister; I am the one who received the message from Minister Mugenzi.  
Q.	According to G, during that meeting Joseph Nzirorera allegedly asked the Interahamwe officials present to take charge of the mission, and to ask the Interahamwe, as well as those who were at the roadblocks, to try to stop the killings and to gather the dead bodies that were along the roadside so that by the next day, in the morning, the members of government could ask the ministry of justice and the department of public works to send tippers and prisoners to load the said dead bodies and to bury them in mass graves.  Maybe I was going too fast; I am sorry about that.  

What is your reaction to that narration of facts by Witness G?  Is it correct?  
A.	The narration is entirely false.  All those -- or, anyone who was in Kigali can tell you that the dead bodies were taken away at the behest of the Red Cross and the prime minister.  I did not hear Joseph mention this issue of dead bodies.  And, in any event, it was not part of our discussion.  It was not part of the mission we assigned to those young people.  I was present, and I can assert that this is a blatant lie.  A horribly blatant lie.  And one would wonder whether your -- that -- that witness did not have a special grudge against Joseph Nzirorera.  I did not hear any such statement.  And I am somewhat surprised that Witness G would have made any such allegations.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness G still goes on to allege that Joseph Nzirorera allegedly said as follows:  "You see very well that this has to be done, because the international community is beginning to come in.  Therefore everything must be done to evacuate all those dead bodies."  G went on to say that Joseph Nzirorera suggested that the soldiers who were guarding him should go along with them in order to provide security.  

Now, this narration of fact -- of the manner in which things unfolded, is that correct and what is your comment?  
A.	The narration is false.  The international community was not discussed.  As for the escort, it is true that at some point they asked for escort because they had difficulty moving about, but that request was not made at that particular meeting.  Maybe it was submitted the next day, not at that particular meeting.  

What happened at that meeting was that we informed them of the decision of government, we did not have any extended discussions, they agreed with us and left, and then promised to return with feedback on the next day, that is, on the 11th.  So what that witness is narrating there is entirely false.  
Q.	I am very sorry to have to again place before you Witness G's narration of what happened at that meeting.  Witness G went on to say that in the evening, that is the evening of the 10th of April, they returned to the office -- or, to the hotel and told those whom they had met in the morning that the mission had been carried out, and that there were many dead bodies along the roadside, and that the population had welcomed their mission and were asking for firearms.  

Did you attend -- or, were you part of that second meeting?  And, if yes, can you tell the Court who else was present.  
A.	Well, if you are referring to the meeting of the 11th, yes, I -- I would say so.  But I think that for the 10th there was no other meeting.  And that relates somehow to the second part of the question which you asked me when you wondered what I had done on the 10th.  

After noon on that day -- in the afternoon, we had political party meetings.  And that is how I spent the afternoon, meeting with other political parties, at the end of which a communiqué signed by all political parties was released.  On that same day I made an announcement over radio inviting supporters and youth to abstain from killing and from attacking the weaker persons, but that they should rather assist the weaker ones.  It was a very busy afternoon for me.  

And contrary to G's testimony, this did not take place.  Maybe he did not take the necessary precaution to determine that on the 10th of April in the afternoon I was attending the meeting with political parties, and that we also issued a communiqué on that very day.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	One last question, Mr. Ngirumpatse, maybe.  Witness G testified that when they mentioned that several dead bodies were present, some officials were happy about it.  Is that correct?  
A.	No, no.  No.  That is a gratuitous accusation.  No one could have expressed joy upon receiving such information, or before such a scene.  I -- we were not on the ground to see the scenes, I must say, but the information we received was such that it required a meeting of political parties, it required that I go to the radio and that government should issue a speech.  So no one could have been happy about what was happening.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I know that, like me, you do get tired.  I have one point of clarification with you, and thereafter I will ask for the break.  

Now, we are talking about the meeting of the 10th of April, and we will be dealing with that again tomorrow morning.  Now, I would like you to tell this Court your role, the role that you played on the 10th of April, and who was present.  
A.	Well, that is a good question which reminds me of something.  You and the Trial Chamber must have noticed that from some point in the day I lose my concentration and may not answer the questions fully.  It is simply because I am tired and not because of any bad faith whatsoever.  

Now, to answer your question.  On the 10th of April -- in fact, I have just talked about that day.  On the 10th of April I was busy dealing with the issue of contacting the youth to calm down the people in order to stop the killings.  On that very day I went to a meeting with political parties in order to coordinate our actions towards curbing or halting the killings.  

On that day I went to the radio, I first of all had to prepare what would be broadcast over the radio.  You know, you don't just go to the radio haphazardly when you are an official.  So I went to the radio to broadcast this message, to issue this call to calm, and to urge our members to -- to call on them, not to request them, because I didn't have the power to do so, I simply urged them to stop all the killings and to ensure safety and security for all, particularly for the weakest people.  So this is what I can say in relation to my activities of that day.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, this might be a good time for the break.  Is it?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin, it's time to take our adjournment.  

I think, just for the point of clarification, I think I should mention that we will have to sit on Friday as well this week.  

We take our luncheon adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1300H)
