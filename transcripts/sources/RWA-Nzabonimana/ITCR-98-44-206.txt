MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, would you please open proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Kam is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 24 November 2005, for the continuation on the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar.  Appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took yesterday when you commenced your testimony.  Mr. Hooper will continue his examination.  
WITNESS 6/10
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Could you be provided, please, with our sketch plan of the area.  And we recall that yesterday you had told us that on the 14th, as you recall, you had fled Gishaka, you had met up with your wife, who herself had taken refuge there separately from you, and had escaped the massacre at Gishaka, and that together that day you made your way up to the point where, as I recall, you were near Jurwe; is that correct?
A.	Yesterday I stated that we arrived in Nkuzuzu on the way to Jurwe.  At Nkuzuzu there is a road from Gikomero commune to Rubungo commune -- or separate the two communes, and on the Rubungo side there is Jurwe sector, but I wasn't yet in Jurwe, although I was going in that correction. 
Q.	I think we've got the rough idea, looking at our sketch.  And at that stage, did something in particular happen?
A.	We stayed a bit longer in Nkuzuzu.  We thought we had found refuge there, it was calm, but there was a flow of refugees and people being chased.  In fact, in Nkuzuzu we spent the night at the Rugogwe  trading centre which is in Nkuzuzu, and there was a flow of people who were fleeing, others who were being chased, others who were killing.  And towards nightfall we heard firing, and we continued fleeing.  On the way we met a vehicle carrying the communal policeman --
Q.	Just pausing there.  
A.	He was the highest-ranking person in the car, but there were other people in the car.  It wasn't he who was driving the vehicle. 
Q.	And -- I'm just pausing you there so that some people will be taking a note of what you say, Mr. Witness.  So -- now, Brigadier Nyarwaya in this vehicle, what did he do?
A.	At that time, I knew him -- in fact, we knew each other.  And he told me, "Put your wife and kids aboard, because the Inkotanyi are coming", and my wife and children got on board.  When I got on board he refused.  I thought he was taking pity on my family, but in fact he went away with my family and left me there with other people and I had to continue on my way, by foot.
Q.	We will in due course hear of what befell your wife and family, with Nyarwaya, from your wife.  But perhaps I can step over that by just summarising your understanding of the position is that Nyarwaya in fact pushed your wife and children out, effectively to be killed by Interhamwe, but they managed to escape.  ************************.  

Now, can I ask you when and where you next met up with your wife?
A.	I found my wife at Kayanga the next day, the 15th.  I found her at the Kayanga health centre.  At that time Rutaganira, the bourgmestre of whom we spoke, came to seek me out and told me that he had tried to evacuate my wife and place her with certain communal officials, unsuccessfully, however.  He therefore came to seek me out on the road and took me to Kayanga, where I found my wife and children. 
Q.	And where in Kayanga were they?
A.	When I arrived I found them in -- at Mr. Kamanzi's place, the head of the health centre.  He was told to give us a room and he put us in a room in a maternity ward and we stayed there, I and my family, until we left Kayanga. 
Q.	Just pausing there, when you say your wife and your family -- you told us of four children -- were the four children with her?
A.	Yes, the four children were there, but we picked up another child that I had left Gishaka with.  It was a child who couldn't find his mother who had gone off in another direction.  So I left Gishaka with that child, and when I arrived in Kayanga I found my four children, so we had a total of five children. 
Q.	Now, your wife, we recall her ethic group.  This fifth child, what ethnic group was that child?
A.	His mother was a Tutsi lady and his father taught at Gishaka. 
Q.	Now, while you were at Kayanga health centre, was any violence done there, and if so, can you tell us the circumstances?
A.	Yes, there were acts of violence at that place.  I was inside the building, but when I arrived at Kayanga, I found many refugees.  It was more or less a refugee camp.  There were about 300 people seeking refuge there from Gasabo, Rutunga and other secteurs because the Inkotanyi had already taken those secteurs.  I heard a lot of noise outside the buildings, but as I was in the room, I could see what was going on behind.  I saw that the refugees were being dragged out of the building and being killed outside the health centre buildings.  They were not killed inside, and I witnessed them being dragged out of the health centre buildings. 
Q.	Now, in terms of those who were dragging them out, who -- did you see who appeared to be in charge of that group dragging the people out?
A.	Yes, I saw the assailants and they were people I knew from before.  They were led by Brigadier Nyarwaya, whom we've talked of, in company of Mathias Rubanguka and Kayibanda, the communal policeman.  They were the three chiefs or leaders -- leaders of the attack. 
Q.	Nyarwaya, we're familiar with.  We've met Rubanguka, Mathias before.  There was a third name there.  I'm sorry, I can't remember the name.  What was the third name you gave -- Nyarwaya, Rubanguka and?  
A.	The communal policeman, the Brigadier Kayibanda.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
K-A-Y-I-B-A-N-D-A; that is the spelling from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And how long did you remain at the Kayanga health centre?
A.	I arrived at Kayanga health centre on the 15th of April, and I left it on the 17th of April. 
Q.	Now, by the 17th of April -- you've mentioned a large body of refugees at the centre.  By the 17th, were there still refugees or other people at the centre?
A.	On the 17th there no longer was anyone at the centre by 11 in the morning, because the RPF had advanced and were approaching Kayanga.  When the people heard the RPF was coming, they left.  Everyone left.  I stayed there with my family and the RPF soldiers found me there at about half past noon -- half past 12.  But the others who'd been there had already left when the RPF troops arrived. 
Q.	And was your wife and the five children still there?
A.	Yes, we were still all together. 
Q.	Now, in the acts of violence that you witnessed, you described people being dragged out and killed.  By the 17th, can you tell us this: were there corpses lying about the health centre, or had the place been cleared up, or what was the position?
A.	On the 17th there were no corpses at the health centre.  It would appear that the corpses had been transported to a ditch.  This was information given to me by someone else.  I was not curious enough to go and see the mass grave, but the people spoke of it and even told me where that mass grave was.  It was at Kayanga, in the centre I knew well, but I did not go to see the mass grave in order to identify.

On the 17th, when I emerged from the room where I was, I saw three corpses of people who had just been shot by the RPF troops.  In fact, I heard the shooting before I emerged from the room where I was, and when I emerged I saw the three corpses.  
Q.	Now, the RPF arrived.  Were these men in uniform, or not?
A.	Yes, in general they wore uniforms, but some among them didn't. 
Q.	Did they arrive in vehicles, or on foot?
A.	They arrived on foot. 
Q.	In what kind of numbers were they, that you saw?
A.	I saw about five soldiers in uniform, but I am not saying that there were only five soldiers on the spot.  I'm telling you the five soldiers I saw before me, but I'm sure there were others around and about. 
Q.	And what happened then?
A.	The soldiers found me there.  They were led by someone I knew, and I hadn't known that person was an RPF soldier.  Later I learned that he had joined the RPF army on the 14th of April, and he was in civilian clothes.  That person knew me. And he went to speak to another soldier.  The soldier did not do any harm to me and, rather, decided to question me, to know how the genocide had been prepared or planned.  I knew how all that had been planned, and I answered their questions, and the soldier realised I wasn't Interhamwe and told me the man who had found me, that he did not want to kill me.  And he told me, "Go follow the Interhamwe ******************************* and I will take your wife and children.  You, I do not want to see any more."  I left with my children, and we went on the road to Gikomero.

And my wife left with the soldiers.  We were separated at that point.  She went with the RPF soldiers, who took her to the Rutare displaced persons camp and, as far as I was concerned, I went on my way into exile. 
Q.	Now, your exile, as you've told us, eventually takes you to the Congo, and before you started the final journey there, did you see Brigadier Nyarwaya again?
A.	I saw Nyarwaya again the next day; that is to say, the 18th of April I met Nyarwaya.  And I've already mentioned someone who came with the Inkotanyi and was showing them the way.  That man told me to tell Nyarwaya and Rubanguka that he would do everything to find them, wherever they went.  That was the message I had to give Nyarwaya.  Among the corpses of the people killed by the Inkotanyi there was Nyarwaya's sister, so I gave the message to Nyarwaya and I also informed him that his sister was dead.

He received the message, but some moments later he turned against me and told me I was like an Inkotanyi, that I had participated in killing his sister.  He could have shot me on the spot -- shot and killed me on the spot, but thank God he didn't kill me immediately.  He handed me over to a killer, who was to take me and kill me in the sorghum field with a traditional weapon.  

That man who was due to kill me took me into the sorghum field, asked me for money.  I told him I had no money and I asked him if I could go and say farewell to the bourgmestre and other people, so I went to speak to the bourgmestre and other people, who came to beg the killer not to kill me, and also to beg with Nyarwaya.  Nyarwaya refused to reverse his decision, but he did not kill me immediately.
He took me off in his car to get me away from that place, and later he let me go, and I went to Rubungo where there was a displaced persons camp, and 30 minutes after I arrived, persons came to seek me, saying, "Where is so-and-so and his four children?"  They found me and they told me I was an accomplice of the Inkotanyi because the Inkotanyi had not killed me, let me live.

I acknowledged having met the Inkotanyi but that I was not their accomplice.  They asked me to see my identity card, which I showed them, and they asked me the circumstances of my encounter with the Inkotanyi.  They took me near to a mass grave where they were killing people, but did not kill me.

They told me, "Go.  You Gikomero people, you are full of intrigue, because it is your brother ************ who asked us to kill you."  Thereupon they let me go, and I went to Gasabo where locals put me up.  I stayed there for about a week and a half and then I went on my way.

The RPF took hold of the whole area, I went into Busanza, through Cyicukiro.  I went to Gitarama, to Gacuabenge and Rushashi, up until I crossed into Congo.  That was my itinerary.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If the interpreter got it all, excuse me.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And going from Gikomero to the Congo, did you do that in a vehicle or on foot?
A.	On foot, from Kayanga to the Congo, not by vehicle. 
Q.	And were you together with the four -- your four children and were you still with the fifth child, or not?
A.	The fifth child, when we were in Kayanga, the soldier in charge of the RPF-Inkotanyi decided to take my wife and the child that wasn't my child.  So that child -- that child and my wife left with the RPF to Rutare and I left with my four children. 
Q.	When the RPF found you and your wife at the Kayanga health centre, you said that there was someone you knew with them.  What was that person's attitude to you at that time?
A.	He was with the RPF, but since he knew me and my position, he thought I could be an Interhamwe, which is why the RPF questioned me, and I told him that his suspicions were unfounded.  In fact, he was the manager of the people's bank, and we would often meet professionally. 
Q.	Now, if I can just perhaps be allowed to lead you on one aspect and that is: is it right that the age of your children at the time -- you had two boys aged 21 and -- perhaps I shouldn't go into this in open session.  Anyway, you go with four children -- two boys, two girls, the youngest of whom is about 15, and you make your way to the Congo.  I'm not going to ask you to go into detail about what happened on that journey or what happened in the Congo.  Is it right that you found yourself in the camps that had to be quickly formed in the Congo and that you then, over the next lengthy period of time, had to survive the problems of camp dysentery and illness, and be a witness to all that, and that by the time you -- when you eventually came back into Rwanda, and back to the hill, that one of your children didn't make it, and I understand disappeared or was killed; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  At the time we left the refugee camp -- you know the refugee camps were dismantled at one point, and the refugees dispersed and went in various directions.  They did not immediately go towards Rwanda.  When I was in the refugee camp I was a watchman, a night watchman somewhere.  And there was the refugee camp wall and when I went -- because I worked in another refugee camp, Kahindo, whereas my children were in Katale camp, so we were separated, because my children went towards Masisi and I went home alone to Rwanda, returned home alone.

And then they came, one by one.  And later I learned that the soldiers had prevented the young men from leaving with the others for Rwanda, so my son was held back by the soldiers, and when he came back to Rwanda, he came as an infiltrator, an infiltrating combatant.  He was arrested in Ruhengeri, questioned over Radio Rwanda, and some people saw those pictures on Rwanda TV.  The people who heard that and saw that told me about it.  His mother also saw it, and his mother spoke to me of it later.  And after that incident we didn't hear anything more about him, and I don't know where he is now -- perhaps he is dead.  
Q.	Now, I'm going to pass a list of names up to you, which we have.  And I'm going to ask you about two of the names on the list.  
MR. HOOPER:
	And this, Mr. President, is the list that we're familiar with, of which you have a list with pseudonyms as well, but this witness is just getting the list with 10 names on it.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.       Now, if you look at that list -- if you look at that list, I want you to look at the last two names on the list.  And I want to ask you if you know those people and in what context.  
A.	I know both people, No. 9 -- I know No. 9, ******************************************************************, from which you can deduce that I've known him since he was young.

And as for No. 10, it is the brother of No. 9.  Moreover, the elder brother of those two people who died during the genocide was like my father-in-law.  It is he who gave me my wife for a spouse -- I considered him my father-in-law, so as those two people are survivors, when I was in exile I was given some information according to which these two people were imprisoning people and that they had people killed.

People would tell me that they also looted people's goods, saying that those things had -- that property had belonged to them before.  That is all I can say about those two people.  
Q.	Now, in terms of No. 10 -- well, first of all, in respect of both of them, do you still have occasion to meet them or see them?
A.	Yes, I meet them very often.  I meet them very often, because even to date we live in the same secteur. 
Q.	Have you ever had any conversation with either one of them about any case or trial?
A.	I talked with No. 10 about this trial.  He told me that he was returning from Arusha.  It is he himself who volunteered the information.  He said that he had come to give testimony against such-and-such a person, and I asked him, "What did you accuse him of?"  I said, "No, these people did bad things."  So I said, "Are you sure that this person was amongst the criminals?"  And he said, "They're the same people."  As to No. 9, on the same day, he also told me that he was returning from Arusha, and he said to me, "You're doing things and we are aware of what you're doing, and you will see what will happen as a result."  So I concluded that he was aware of the role I would play in this trial.

I remember that at one point I talked with him and he said, "In the coming days I shall go to study and I know you, too, will be absent", so I also concluded that he knew that I would be coming here.  Apart from such discussions, however, we didn't talk about anything else.  
Q.	Thank you.  I'm unclear -- I can't remember whether I dealt with this yesterday, but forgive me if I did and repeat the question.  Either in the course of the history of events that you witnessed, particularly at Kayanga, or from anything that you've heard, then or in the 11 years since through conversations or with Gacaca meetings, have you ever heard it said that André Rwamakuba played any part in the genocide, either in the months leading up to it or during it in Gikomero commune?
A.	From 1994 onwards, when I returned from exile in Congo, I've never heard anyone say -- even in Congo when I was there, people talked about what had happened; people admitted that they had killed here and there, that they were helped by such and-such a person in committing their crimes, but I never heard anyone say that Rwamakuba played any role whatsoever.

Moreover, in Gacaca sessions there was a collection of information.  All those who had any information contributed to the collection.  Even today people are still providing information, but in the Gacaca sessions that I attended, either in Gikomero or elsewhere, I've never heard anyone accuse Rwamakuba of anything whatsoever.

I know that due to my work sometimes I cover five secteurs in one day, but I have never heard anyone accuse Rwamakuba of any crimes. 
Q.	And when you say "work", was that the particular function you described yesterday in closed session?
A.	This is the position that I hold today and for which I receive a salary. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you a general question, if I may, as to whether you can help the Chamber as to what you witnessed, or what you can assess the position was in Gikomero after the 6th of April in respect of access to it by vehicles coming from Kigali.  Can you help us as to that?
A.	After the 6th of April no vehicle came from Kigali to Gikomero, but there was a vehicle that came from Rubungo, which came carrying Interhamwe from Rubungo to Gishaka to come and loot.  I'm referring to the time when I myself was in Gishaka, so this must be the 11th or 12th of April.  This is the only vehicle that came from elsewhere to Gikomero.

Apart from that, during that time the only vehicle that was driving around was the commune ambulance.  The other vehicle was the one that Nyarwaya  had confiscated.  Yet another vehicle driven around Gikomero was that belonging to a businessman called Kambanda.  Kambanda's vehicle carried his family and his goods.  There was also Kayunga's car that used to drive around Gikomero commune which carried his family.  There were no military vehicles that came to Gikomero, although there were military positions in Gikomero commune.  I think that even their vehicles did not bring supplies to them.

There was a military position in Gasabo secteur, in Bumbogo secteur as well, amongst others, but it was realised that the movement of vehicles during that time was considerably reduced. 
Q.	Do you know if access from Gikomero by vehicle has been the subject at Gacaca, or not?
A.	From where?  What are you referring to, which place?
Q.	Were vehicles coming into the commune from outside, and particularly Kigali?  Do you know if that's been the subject of discussions at Gacaca or not? 
A.	From the information I obtained during Gacaca sessions, nobody has talked about vehicles.  Generally, people talk about what they experienced personally.  I have not heard anyone talking about vehicles, which, in my view, means that vehicles didn't come to Gikomero from outside the commune.

In any case, concerning the place where I was located, no vehicle could reach there, because all the roads had been blocked, because everyone had been ordered not to move about.  I remember that I tried to go to the small trading centre and the soldiers prevented me from moving about.

From the 9th of April roads, especially those of Rutongo, were not usable, because the RPF had already taken that place.  As to the east, the eastern region, I can't say anything, but I do not see how a vehicle would have left Kigali and come to the east.  I do not see how that was practicable, since all the roads had been blocked 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  Now, I just want to put into your hands a document.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask you, the Judges, to accept just two copies because I'm afraid I've left my copies elsewhere and I don't have them to hand?

Mr. Witness, you've got a copy of, in fact, a selected portion for the purposes of my questions.  

Though we can in due course provide the Chamber with a full copy of the document.  I don't know if Mr. Issa has gone off to a photocopier, but if he has, I was wondering if he could be prevailed upon to make a further two copies.  I'm sorry, but I've copied them and put them aside.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that's where he has gone to.
MR. HOOPER:
I was going to say, if that's going to take just a minute or two, I could go to something else at this point and perhaps await for the copies when he returns.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So what I'm going to do, Mr. Witness -- we'll come back to that document in a moment, but what I'm going to ask you, which I've shown you before and you're now familiar with, and I now want to take you to something which, again, you've seen before, and you are familiar with to some extent, but I want to implore you, if I can, Mr. Witness, to take us and to verify photographs of the area of Gikomero.
MR. HOOPER:
We have a selection of about 50 photographs.  I think we can trip through them fairly quickly, I hope, with the cooperation of the Prosecution.

So, Ms. Oberti can go to the laptop.  Hopefully, the witness will get an image of this, or I can do what I did earlier and take my laptop to the witness, which -- are the televisions working to show the images, or do the images only appear on laptops?
MR. MORLEY:
The question really at this point is, we have a television screen -- Your Honours can see it -- but can we take each image and blow it up on the screen?  That will suffice.
MR. HOOPER:
If you have a copy of the numbered images, if you tap on them -- tap on it twice on your laptop, they should go full size.
MR. MORLEY:
No, what I'm suggesting is that the television screen which is in front of us is clearly linked to the laptop which is with your assistant, and you simply tap on the photographs on your laptop and the whole thing comes up in court.
MR. HOOPER:
I can't see this television.  Is it on?  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
There's one here that isn't.  I'm being distracted by it.  Is it in colour?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.

BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	So we'll start with No. 1 and go through it.  With the Prosecution's consent, I'd seek to summarise each photograph and invite you to agree.  If you disagree, you can let us know.  Is that acceptable?

Again, with reference to our sketch plan, is it right photograph 1 shows a view along the river at -- perhaps you can name the river first at Nyacyonga.  What is the name of the river there, please?
A.	The river is called Nyabugogo.  It runs along Nyacyonga hill. 
Q.	Can you help us with the spelling please, the river?
A.	N-Y-A-B-U-G-O-G-O.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness spells.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And looking at the photograph there, can you help us as to the state of that river in the rainy season?  Is it like it is there?
A.	During the rainy season this river is quite full.  Some people even drown there.  Sometimes small bridges are washed away by the floods, so that people might lose their lives there.  But during the dry season the river -- the flow of the river is normal.  This is a river that flows out from Lake Muhazi, and goes to join river Nyabugogo. 
Q.	I think it's right, the photograph that we have here is taken from the Nyacyonga bridge looking south towards Kigali, which is the direction which the river flows; is that right?
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And the hill that we can see immediately behind the river to the left, which sector is that, please?
A.	The hill is in Ngere secteur.  At that time that secteur was in Rutongo commune. 
Q.	And now --
A.	I am referring to the left side of the photograph. 
Q.	And which area is it in now?
A.	You mean right now?  The place is called Buriza district. 
Q.	The photograph numbered, 1 in fact -- that was 1A we looked at -- photograph 1 is -- you would recognise as the Nyacyonga bridge that crosses that river at the point indicated approximately, on our sketch plan, just a little north of Kabuye; is that correct?
A.	Yes, you're right. 
Q.	Can you remember, is the bridge as we look at it now the same bridge as was there in '94, or not?
A.	No.  I think the bridge was as it is today, that is, it was in 1994 what it is today.  Oh, I think, actually, that they have just repaired the bridge.  There was another bridge that was old and they must have repaired it.  There was a small bridge, but they put up a more solid bridge.

On the other side of the bridge, that is part of Gikomero commune.  So below the bridge is Buriza region that I referred to a while ago 
Q.	You referred earlier in your evidence to displaced people at Nyacyonga.  Is this an area where some of those displaced people were living, or not?
A.	Yes, persons displaced by war occupied the entire hill.  There was a forest on the hill before that, but they cleared the hill and occupied it.  Beneath the bridge, also, there is another hill which is part of Rutongo commune, which is also occupied by persons displaced by war. 
Q.	Now, we can see a road going off to the right on the other side of the bridge.  Would I be right in saying that that's a road that leads eventually, or can lead eventually to André Rwamakuba's home at Nduba?
A.	Yes, the road to the right -- no, no, that's not the road -- that's not the road going up. 
Q.	Sorry.
A.	The road going up goes to the Jehovah Witnesses' church, but beneath that one you see a small road beyond the bridge.  That is the road that leads to Nduba, the place of Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Indeed, if we look at the next photograph, photograph 2, briefly, I think that may show that road; is that correct?  No, number -- it's No. 2; it's headed "2. Road, Nyacyonga/Nduba".  All right.  I'm not sure if we've got that photograph, or if we've all got that photograph.  

Well, in any event, let me move on.  Photograph No. 3 -- no.  No, it's not numbered.  Excuse me a moment.

I'll go from the disk, because it may be -- photograph No. 3 -- I don't know if you can help me -- sometimes one hill looks very much rather like the other.  Do you know where that view is taken from, what it shows?
A.	The person who took this photograph was standing in Shango secteur in Nyura cellule.  One can see a road.  This road is in Nkona cellule in Bumbogo secteur.  To the right you can see a forest.  To the right -- to the left, a little further off, you can see Kami military camp.  This camp was in Rubungo commune.  Well, the camp is still in the same place today but the photograph was taken from Nyura cellule. 
Q.	When you say "the camp", is that the lighter area in the middle of the photograph at the bottom of the valley?
A.	No, it is beyond the wooded hill that you can see.  There's not much vegetation on that hill.  There's houses, mostly. 
Q.	And if we look at our sketch plan, is that a photograph taken from the bottom edge of the sketch of the commune, below the word "Nduba", looking out south at that point?  It's looking south directly from the commune of Gikomero; is that right?
A.	No, no; it is not towards the commune.  It is actually in the direction of the city of Kigali. 
Q.	Yes.  Yes, I think there was -- perhaps lost in translations.  We're looking south from the commune towards Kigali and towards Camp Kami where the soldiers came from that you told us about?
A.	Yes, you're right. 
Q.	Now, the next photograph, which is No. 4, does that show again a view taken from the southern edge of Gikomero commune, as we can see it, to the left of our plan on our sketch looking again south away from the commune, but this time looking towards Bumbogo hill, and the distant hill is Bumbogo hill; is that correct?
A.	That's right.  The hill in the background is Bumbogo hill and you can see the banana plantation that is there at the bottom of the photograph.  That banana plantation is in Shango.  The person who took this photograph was therefore in Shango cellule and was pointing towards Bumbogo. 
Q.	Now, if you look at photograph 5, is that looking out from the southern part of Shango, across the valley between Shango and Gishaka, and the hill in the middle that's clearer than any other hills behind it, is Gishaka -- you can see in our sketch how Gishaka sticks out a bit and that's that hill there.  And if we look at No. 6, is that a similar view looking out from Shango, again looking towards -- looking over Gishaka where the commune offices were and the church was that you spoke about?
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And photograph 7 --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Counsel.
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Photograph 7 is on Bumbogo hill showing a road on the plateau up there; is that right -- do you recognise it?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Photograph 8, do you recognise those people?
A.	Yes, the old woman is Rwamakuba's mother, and that man is Rwamakuba's nephew.  The young lady is the daughter of Rwamakuba's brother-in-law, and the child you see is the great grandchild of the old lady.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Actually, the interpreter adds, it is the child of her great grandchild.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And in fact that child's mother isn't in the photograph; I think she's died; is that right, so that the lady there isn't the mother of the child?
A.	That's right.  That girl is not the mother of the child in the photograph. 
Q.	Now, the boy and girl there, whose children are they?
A.	They are the children of Michel Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	You've described him as brother-in-law married to André Rwamakuba's sister, who was murdered by the Interhamwe, by the responsable Sendekezi; is that right?
A.	It is Sendekezi.   
Q.	And the house behind them, is that part of the home of André Rwamakuba, his parents' home?
A.	Yes, it is, that's true. 
Q.	If we move now -- right.  So just pausing there, the few photographs we saw, going back to the sketch plan, are taken on the route crossing Nyacyonga bridge into Nduba secteur, and up, or to Nduba, with the last photograph at his parents' home, and the other photograph's going along the road from -- towards Gishaka, or the turn-off to Gishaka.  Now, this photograph we now see, is a secteur office; is that right?  And do you recognise --
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Do you recognise which place --
A.	Yes, this is a secteur office.  But it seems to me that this is not a secteur office in Gikomero district.  This must be in a secteur in Rubungo. 
Q.	I can confirm that, this is the Rubungo, R-U-B-U-N-G-O, secteur office and it is written on the wall, actually, just above the first window, and if you blow the photograph up a bit, which I can't do here, it does say "Rubungo".  And these photographs that follow were taken on another trip -- so it's not a continuation of the first one -- on a trip leaving Kigali via Kanombe, at the bottom of the plan and then turning left up into Rubungo commune.  And this is the secteur office, and is this in the centre of Rubungo?
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And that being the place where you say the Interhamwe came up to attack at Gishaka; is that correct?
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	And the next photograph is just a view again of the road on the top of the plateau, going up towards Gikomero?
A.	In fact, it was in Nkuzuzu, which I already mentioned, and not far from there Nyarwaya separated my wife and I.  He took away my wife, leaving me there at this place. 
Q.	Now, the next photograph is taken -- let's see if you agree -- I suggest is a photograph taken along the eastern valley, as it were, or across the eastern valley towards the hill which contains Gikomero secteur, and further down, Kayanga, Rutungo, Gasabo.  So it's taken across that -- do you recognise that, sir, as being that?
A.	Yes, I would agree with you.  I think that the hill we can see in the background is a hill in Gikomero secteur, but the cellule is Murambi.  I think it is a hill there in that locality. 
Q.	And the road that runs from -- down to Gikomero secteur and on to Gasabo is out of sight there -- it's on the top -- the very top of the hill; is that right?
A.	Quite.  The road runs along the top of the hill, but it is not the hill we see in the preceding photograph, because the hill we see is rather lower in that photograph.  There is a higher hill, and that road runs along the crest of that hill. 
Q.	We go to the next photograph -- I think that might demonstrate what you say.  And does this photograph -- this one here with a field in front and then a valley and then a hill -- is that in fact the hill that appeared in the last photograph?  And behind that, is that the big hill that contains Gikomero and the other places?
A.	Yes.  First you have the hill before, where the photographer was standing, and then there's another hill beyond, but I think you've changed the photograph -- you've just changed the photograph.  But the hill in the very back of the photograph is the hill on which runs the road.  You have Gikomero on one side, and a valley at a place called Mubuga and beyond the valley you have Kayanga and then you go down towards Rutongo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphone not activated)
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Do you recognise this photograph, sir?
A.	Just a moment, please.  I'm not sure I recognise this, but it could be part of Gikomero.  Here, in the background, you have Lake Muhazi.  On the left is a hill which is the beginning of Kayanga secteur.  It's actually the border between Kayanga and Gikomero, but on the Lake Muhazi side. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  The next photograph is a further view of a hill looking towards Gikomero.  Can I go on to the next photograph?  And a further view of valleys there, another view looking towards distantly, I suggest, Gikomero and Kayanga and the hill there.  And I think we can skip this series of photographs which shows Gikomero commercial centre, otherwise known as -- is it Kurupangu?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you scroll down until we come to photograph 32.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, I've just leapt to my feet.  The photograph which flashed up momentarily a moment ago, my learned friend mentioned the Gikomero commercial centre.  Could we have a few more seconds to have a look at that, please?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Could my learned friend remind me of what number that is?
MR. HOOPER:
That's 17.  I can go through the Gikomero commercial centre photographs, if you like.  It's just that they didn't feature in this witness's testimony, and in fact, I thought they were witness-sensitive, but looking at the way they are on the disk, they are not.  So we can run through them fairly quickly.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	I'm going to show you a series of photographs fairly quickly, and ask you at the conclusion if you agree that they show photographs of the Gikomero commercial centre in a general sweep, as it were, of the centre -- of the one spot in the centre.  So if we can go through them just very quickly.
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	Just pausing there, that's a sort of more capturing shot.  Do you recognise that as the commercial centre there?
A.	Quite.  It is quite clearly the trading centre. 
Q.	And that photograph with a group of people looking towards the camera, behind -- between the buildings there's a path or road that leads up to the secteur office, which lies behind the trees there; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Looking south from the centre towards, very approximately, Gishaka.  Those were the photographs of the centre of Gikomero on this disk, or Gikomero secteur commercial centre.  In fact, Gikomero centre is a different place, is it not?  There's Gikomero secteur and Gikomero commercial centre, both in Gikomero secteur; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  They are two different places.  There is the marketplace and there is another trading centre where there is no marketplace, but both are trading centres, and they are in Gikomero. 
Q.	And the photograph we're looking at now, do you recognise that as the chapel or church of the Protestant school in Gikomero secteur?
A.	Quite.  It is the Protestant school -- no, there are two --
MR. MORLEY:
Can I ask --
THE WITNESS:
There are two trading centres, yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Can I ask for the number, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
That's 32.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Do you recognise that as being Gikomero Protestant school with the playground or courtyard?
A.	Yes, that is the primary school.
MR. MORLEY:
Is that 33, or have you skipped?  
MR. HOOPER:
Thirty-four.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.

BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Another view taken looking north-east, slightly, from the school, and just distantly between the trees one can see a lick of water which is part of Lake Muhazi; do you agree?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	A similar view point showing a bit more of a lake down there?
A.	Quite. 
Q.	And, again, a similar view point with what may or may not be a site of exhumation; do you agree?
A.	It is possible. 
Q.	Photograph 39 is a view of the west side of Gikomero secteur, secteur office.  Do you recognise that as being that?
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	That was taken recently.  The gentleman in red there, does he play any particular function?
A.	Yes, people who wear that uniform are members of what we call civil defence corps, who are based at the sectoriel office and who are responsible for order and public safety. 
Q.	Do you recognise this place?
A.	I think we're in Kayanga, but not Kayanga health centre.  This looks like, I think, Kayanga trading centre -- the place generally known as Ku Muremure.  
Q.	Is that on the way from Gikomero secteur to Kayanga health centre?
A.	Indeed.  
Q.	Is that a view of the same place?
A.	Yes.  We're now on the left of the place where we were before, and it is on the Kayanga road. 
Q.	A little further down, on the left of that road, is there this building which is the Kayanga secteur office?
A.	Indeed, that is correct. 
Q.	And opposite that is there this school, the Kayanga primary school?
A.	That is true. 
Q.	A little further along that road on the left, is there this building which is the Kayanga health centre, which is, as you can see, slightly -- there's a sort of mound you have to go over, the road goes over, before you get there from the road?
A.	Yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Number, please?
MR. HOOPER:
Forty-four.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Counsel.  
MR. HOOPER:
That's 44 -- the No. 44 on the photograph.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Forty-five, do you recognise that view point?
A.	Yes, I recognise what is depicted in the photograph.  He was in -- the photographer was in Nduba secteur, and in the background you see Batsinda hill in Kagugu in Gisozi secteur.  Here you see our hill which was that of Kagugu proper, and on the left you see Kinyinya secteur, and in fact beyond there you have Kigali.  The picture was taken from Nduba pointing towards Kigali town.  

The photographer, in my opinion, was in Muremure cellule and looking towards Gasanze and other hills.  Here this picture you're showing me now is Kayanga.
Q.	That's the health centre; is that right?
A.	Yes, it is Kayanga health centre. 
Q.	Another photograph taken from Kayanga health centre looking north, with the building that's there, I believe a new building, not present in 1994.  Can you confirm that?
A.	Yes, that house was not there then.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, it is 10:30.
MR. HOOPER:
Just finishing with this then again -- 
THE WITNESS:
On the left you can see the nutrition centre.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And all those buildings were there and built as part of the health centre in '94 -- they were present there in '94; is that right?
A.	Yes, all those buildings were there in '94.  On the left we see the nutrition centre at the entrance, whereas on the right there is the clinic.
MR. MORLEY:
Number, please, of the last three photographs.
MR. HOOPER:
Forty-six, 47 and 48.  Thank you very much.  If that's an appropriate time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short recess.  We'll try and keep it strictly to 15 minutes. .
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1052H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We grant special dispensation, so you may continue while Judge Hökborg stands.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	We were on number 48 I think when we rose, which is this photograph, and I'm going to show the next sequence of four photographs fairly quickly, which I believe show the other side of the road from the Kayanga health centre, so looking east from the Kayanga health centre, and that last view again capturing Lake Muhazi in the distance.  Do you agree with that, sir, those last four photographs showing what I suggested?
A.	Yes, you're quite right, Counsel.
Q.	And those photographs were 49, 50, 51, 52.  So I'll just go back.  There's the cow again.  I'm just going to call that a valley view, unless you particularly recognise it, sir, and go on to the next photograph.  Do you recognise that place?
A.	Yes, I recognise that place.  It is Rutunga centre.
Q.	Is the view in fact looking up the road back towards Kayanga?
A.	Yes, that is correct.  When you come from Rutunga -- when you go from Rutunga towards Kayanga.
Q.	This photograph is out of sync and in fact is a photograph from the Gishaka direction towards Gikomero.  I pass on.  Are we back now in Rutunga, more photographs of the area immediately after the last photograph of Rutunga that we saw?  Again, Rutunga?
A.	That was correct.
Q.	Rutunga again?
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	And those last photographs were photographs 55, 57, 58 and 59.  Photograph 60, a view, I suggest, from the Kayanga/Rutunga area looking west across towards Gishaka, Shango, Sha, that area; would you agree?
A.	Yes, I agree.  The photograph was taken from Rutunga at Gasabo and you can see beyond to Shango.
Q.	Do you recognise this view?
A.	Here again, you can see part of Shango, but the photo was taken from Gasabo.  You can see Kagugu cellule, Nyamagana cellule (ph) and beyond you can see Gishaka.  The photographer was certainly in Gasabo secteur, standing in Gasabo secteur.
Q.	Can you help me as to this?  I don't know if you can see -- is there an arrow appearing on the screen there in front of you moving about?  Can you see an arrow head?  I'm just asking you, is that a road there, or not?
A.	Where you're moving the arrow?  You mean where the arrow is flashing around?  I know that that is the road to Shango.  You can see a big field where there is some -- a cattle barn, and above is the road that runs to Shango.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That should be cattle stables, or cow barn.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	I think that's a similar view point.  I'll go on to the next picture.  Do you recognise that view?  Might it be looking towards Rugambazi [sic] or not?
A.	Yes, you're quite right, beyond is Rusasa commune, in Mugambazi -- at present it's called Buriza district.  The photographer was certainly in Gasabo.  You can see Shango and you can see Sha secteur, right at the back, at the very back.  There's a valley, and in the valley there are water ditches that run into Nyabugogo.  Beyond there is Rusasa.
Q.	Can we see the tarmac down there, or not?
A.	You cannot see the tarred road from here, no, but it is on the Rusasa side.  The tarred road is near the pond or the marsh.  You cannot see it.  The road follows the valley.  You can see it, but it is in the plain there somewhere.
Q.	Thank you.  Now, is this a photograph taken from -- between Rutunga or Kayanga looking out towards Gishaka?  Where the arrow is, is that Gishaka?
A.	Yes, Gishaka is beyond that, but after that is -- below there is Rutunga -- the road you see there is Rutunga secteur.  You can see Gishaka but right in the background you can see Ntyazo cellule, but at the very top is Bumbogo region.
Q.	If you can see the arrow, can you stop me when I get to the hill where Gishaka is?
A.	Yes, there -- there where the arrow is now.  Just move up a little bit -- move the arrow a little bit -- up, yes, that's right.
Q.	So that's where the Catholic church is, and the communal office is, in that area; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	But the church and the communal office are separated by what sort of distance?
A.	They are separated by 800 metres, or thereabouts.
Q.	Thank you.  Is this a view of the road running from Rutunga towards Gasabo, just as it comes to Ndatemwa?
A.	That's the road that leads to Ndatemwa, rather.  It is some distance off -- a very short distance.  It's not far from Ndatemwa, and Ndatemwa is somewhat below that road.
Q.	I suggest in fact Ndatemwa is just -- the centre itself is hidden by these bushes that are on the right of the road.  If one carried down the road to the point where the arrow is and turned right, the centre is about there?
A.	Yes, you're right.  After that arrow you will get to the Catholic church and then you have the centre.
Q.	Where the arrow is here, we can see a house or houses.  Do you know --
A.	The houses are a little further off from Ndatemwa.  Ndatemwa is somewhat to the right of the arrow, in a sort of dip in the land, if you will.
Q.	I'll just say a valley view for that.  I'm not sure where it is.  And I think these might be out of sync again and we may be in Nduba.  Yes, we've gone out of sync.  We know who that is.  We're back to the beginning.  I think that's it.  Thank you very much.
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness.  

THE WITNESS:
Before we proceed, at one point I had some doubts when I answered questions regarding the photographs.  I am referring to the bridge.  A question was put to me as to whether the bridge was as it was in 1994.  During the break I thought about it, and I remembered that the bridge was rebuilt before the war, not after the war.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  Do you wish to ask any further questions arising out of that?
MR. HOOPER:
No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Witness.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	I have one final matter.  If we can return to the document, which you've got -- is there a copy for me because I've given mine up -- can I borrow it before we put it in, Mr. Issa?  Thank you very much.

Now, this is a document that's -- well, a document.  These are five pages or so, or six pages, extracted from a report, the front page of which in the French version appears as the first page of the handout, and we can see there that it is dated February 1996.  And it is entitled "The preliminary report of the identification of sites of genocide and massacres committed in April to July 1994 in Rwanda".  And it's produced by the commission -- the Genocide Memorial Commission.  And the full document will provide further details of its provenance, and details those who compiled the report and their objectives and their methods.  I haven't copied all that, but I'll make that available in due course to the Chamber.

And it's a review of genocide sites throughout Rwanda, and the part that's been extracted is the part relevant to our concerns.  At paragraph 2.9.8 on the second page, which is page 192 of the report, "Gikomero commune", and we can read and see that it says there that the "bureau communal is in Gishaka secteur at cellule" -- and it gives the cellule, it names the bourgmestre at the time.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The cellule is called Akanyamugarura, the witness corrects.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And it then names the secteurs that were most affected -- Gishaka, the church area and village, Gikomero, the Protestant church, Rumbogo -- R-U-M-B-O-G-O -- and Kayanga.  It then says:  "Number of victims:  between 5,000 and 10,000," mainly in the cellule of Burima at the parish, the Protestant parish, and in Lake Muhazi where people preferred to drown themselves rather than submit to the torture of wounds by machetes.  The number of those who escaped, about 1,000.  Date of the genocide 13th to 15th April 1994.  And then it names those responsible for the massacres.

And among the ones it names, we can see the names listed there on that page, and Michel Nyarwaya appears there.  Then it says responsables of the cellule and over the page it lists names.  We can see those names including Rubanguka who you've mentioned, and Kamanzi who you've mentioned at least as being present at the Kayanga health centre.  

Those who saved, and it names two people.  And then it has "Informateurs", those who provided the information.  I just want you to help me, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) -- sorry, Mr. Witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I have that redacted?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It will be done accordingly.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	-- Mr. Witness, by that name as it's spelt here, Rutamarirwa, Faustin, actual bourgmestre,  what do you say about that?
A.	It is actually Rutabagirwa, Faustin.
Q.	Right.  And he was one of those who provided the information here.  He was the bourgmestre, as we heard you say, although you weren't there when he was appointed, just right at the end of the war, and continued for several years to be bourgmestre. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet at this stage.  Your Honour has heard this sort of argument in another case.  This is an interesting document, and perhaps if the witness might remove his headphones for the moment.

I'm not quite sure what the foundation is for using this witness to put in this document.  There's not been any examination of the witness to establish whether he's ever seen it before, or helped to write it, and reviewed it and agreed it.  And what my learned friend has done over the last 10 minutes or so is simply make a short speech about the contents of the document.  

The only question he's in fact asked the witness is about the spelling of the informer.  Now, I know that in this environment evidence of this nature is, broadly speaking, admissible and it all goes to weight.  But I'm inviting the Court to be conscious of the fact that the witness seems to be being used as a vehicle for introducing a document about which there's no foundation, the witness has any opinion or had any review.  We in fact have the entire document here, which runs to several hundred pages, and it is an interesting read, and shortly I'll be referring to bits of it as well.

But I'm just a little uneasy that this isn't really examination-in-chief; it's making observations about a document under the pretext that there is the document in front of the witness.  It's an unusual way of introducing evidence.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you're not the author of this document; of course you're not.

Mr. Witness, I can't see you, so I can't attract your attention.
MR. PRESIDENT:
His headphones have now been put back on.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, you're not the author of this document.  It may well be that you hadn't seen it before I showed you these passages when we met last week.  But we know ********************* up until 1994 and we know *************************************************************** and the fact that you live there and extensively know the commune.  So I am putting this document in your hands, because you have a certain knowledge on which you can give us some advice --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper --
MR. HOOPER:
-- rather more than, say, Mr. Baghel, Your Honour, who some time ago had numerous documents thrust at him and was allowed to comment on them.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I suppose one of the points raised by Mr. Morley -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
  Your Honour, your microphone, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
One of the points raised by Mr. Morley is that we're only hearing from you about it, and the witness has not been allowed to answer anything.
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps I've over controlled the witness.  Can I in fact revert to then a happier position?  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, having seen this document, can I first ask you this: have you discovered in it the name of André Rwamakuba?
A.	Rwamakuba is not referred to in this document.  All the sites of massacres are mentioned.  The perpetrators of the massacres are mentioned as well, but there is no mention of Rwamakuba anywhere.  However, I know some of these perpetrators of massacres.  I do not know others.  I don't know all of them.  For example, when reference is made to Gakuba and Mbonampeka, I'll say that I've never heard anyone talk about them.  When all the conseillers of secteurs -- that's because of authority -- are mentioned, except for Rutsinga -- they said that it was true that Rutsinga -- all the conseillers were in prison when I returned from exile.  I cannot say anything about all the conseillers, because I did not go to all the secteurs to determine or to find out whether all the conseillers took part in massacres.  Of course I saw some conseillers actively taking part in massacres.  Others I saw did not take part.

In the case of Rutaganira, he was included amongst the perpetrators because he was the bourgmestre and if he got authority, but I personally do not know that he committed any crime or did any evil thing.

In the case of Mulisa, I cannot say anything.  He's an old man.  They said he took part at meetings, but I know nothing about that.  As to the figures of authority in the cellule, I cannot confirm that all the -- all of them played a role.  As for Pasteur Nkurana, I cannot say anything, either.  I can't say anything about the teachers, either.  They were ordinary members of the public.  I heard people talk about Callixte during Gacaca sessions.  As to Rubanguka, Mathias, Etienne Kamanzi, I'm sure because I saw them.

I cannot say anything about Bwenge either.  In the case of Jérémie Kabano, I cannot say whether he did take part or not.  In the case of -- I don't even know who Sabin Ndayisaba is.  The people who provided information, I acknowledge that Rutabagirwa provided information.  I do not know whether he confirmed this as an eyewitness or not.  I cannot say anything about it.  Perhaps he received information in his capacity as bourgmestre, but I cannot say that he was really an eyewitness, or whether he heard about it, because he himself was a refugee.  He had fled.  Perhaps he is aware of events or of information about events that occurred from the place where he sought refuge, but he cannot be aware of everything that happened in the commune.

As to Gatambara, I think that he's able to give information on the events that occurred in Gishaka -- a very limited part of Gishaka, I might add.  That is all I can say about those who provided information.

As to the sites of the massacres, these are sites that are often mentioned, but of course people died in other places which are not referred to as frequently as these ones are in other cellules -- people were killed, because people were killed in several places.  So I must say the list of the sites is not exhaustive.
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions.  Just wait there, please, Mr. Witness.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, at the commencement of your testimony I explained that you would have to answer questions from lawyers on both sides.  Now it's the turn of the Prosecutor to examine you and you'll have to answer his questions.  Do you understand that?

THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It is clear from the document in front of you that the list of massacre sites is not exhaustive.  You've just told us that.  That's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	It would be right to say that the list of people participating in the genocide is also not exhaustive; that's right, isn't it?
A.	You're right.
Q.	Other people may have been involved in organising killings who are not listed on that document; that's right, isn't it?
A.	I don't know about the planning and the organising -- the planning and organisation of massacres, but as to the participation in massacres, I know some of the perpetrators.  I cannot say anything about who planned or organised or did not plan or organise massacres, and I can say that the list is not exhaustive insofar as the people who participated in massacres are concerned, but I really couldn't say anything about the planning and organisation of massacres.
Q.	There are people listed on this document whose participation in the genocide you know nothing about; that's right, isn't it?  You told us that a moment ago.
A.	That's true.
Q.	Despite your position and knowledge of the genocide in your area, some of these names have not been mentioned to you before; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.  If I took the time to look through this document, I would find information that was previously unknown to me.
Q.	You would accept that you don't know everything about everyone who was involved in the genocide in your commune; that's right, isn't it?
A.	That's true.  I do not know what role everyone played in the genocide.
Q.	The names on this document were produced in February 1996.  We can see that from the front of the document.  Do you agree?
A.	Yes.
Q.	There have been nine years since February 1996, we agree?
A.	Yes.
Q.	In those nine years, despite your presence in the commune, you have not heard all the names mentioned in the context of the genocide that appear on this document.  Do we agree?
A.	Yes, you're right, I have not heard all the names that are mentioned in this document.
Q.	People can have come to the attention of the authorities as genocidaire at an early stage and yet never be mentioned to you; do you agree?
A.	Yes, that is entirely possible.
Q.	We suggest that is what has happened with Rwamakuba.  Do you understand the suggestion?
A.	I understand your suggestion.  However, he may have been mentioned.  I did not see him personally, and I did not hear about him in my region.  Certainly people mentioned him for their own reasons, but I, for my part, do not think that he is guilty of the massacres that were committed in Gikomero, because so far as I know, he did not come to Gikomero during the time of the massacres.
Q.	You agree, then, that Rwamakuba's name has been mentioned in the context of the genocide?  You just told us that.  
A.	I did not hear the name of Rwamakuba called or mentioned, except on the radio.  I did not hear his name mentioned by the public, nor did I hear it at Gacaca sessions.  This document was prepared in 1996.  Rutabagirwa gave testimony.  He talked about these people.  So did Gatambara.  He said he saw Gakuba and Mbonampeka, who came from Ndera, but he did not mention Rwamakuba.  Why did he not mention Rwamakuba who was a native of the same commune as he was?  Whereas he did say that he saw other people who came from another commune.  And afterwards he remembered that he saw Rwamakuba.  It doesn't seem logical to me.
Q.	So is it the case that you know he has later mentioned Rwamakuba?
A.	I do not state that it is he who mentioned Rwamakuba, but I am referring to this document.  Rutabagirwa is amongst the informers, and yet there's no mention of the person -- someone coming from his commune, a commune that he was the senior official of.  When Rutabagirwa was bourgmestre there were conseillers in all the secteurs -- Nduma, Shango, Sha, Gikomero, and the other secteurs.  I do not understand why he didn't receive information about Rwamakuba, whereas this was after the genocide.  He could have received information about Rwamakuba from these conseillers.
Q.	Plainly, on the face of the document, the list of names is too short to be exhaustive.  We're agreed on that, aren't we?
A.	It is possible that the list is not exhaustive, but it is also possible that it is.
Q.	It's your evidence, is it, suddenly, that 10 people were responsible for the entire series of massacres in your commune?  Are you changing your evidence, or am I mistaken in understanding you?
A.	You say that I mentioned 10 people in my testimony?  I do not believe I gave an exact number.  Are you referring to the people who are mentioned in this document?  I have commented on this document and in respect of these people mentioned here, I said that they are not the only ones who committed genocide, even if these people were amongst the leaders of the massacres.  If you say that I mentioned 10 people, well, I didn't say that it was only these 10 people who perpetrated the genocide in the entire commune.  I was commenting on the list in this document, but I did not say precisely that such-and-such a person was the leader of the operations in respect of the genocide.
Q.	So we are agreed that the list of names is a selection?
A.	Yes.
Q.	That some names have plainly been left off?
A.	It is possible.  It is possible.  I do not know the people included in the document.  I do not know whether these are the planners, the perpetrators -- I do not know.  This is a question that should be answered by the people who prepared this document.
Q.	Well, you're not wrong there, and you're not in a position to help us with that information, are you?
A.	I am not one of the authors of this report, but based on this report, I have told you that I acknowledge that some other people also participated in committing genocide.  I'm not changing the list.  I am just giving my opinion about some of the names on the list.  I do not wish to change anything on the list.  I talked of people I knew well, and as to the others, I expressed my doubts and I said, "I cannot say anything about these people."  I was more precise for the others.  I said that I was certain that these people had taken part in the massacres and for others I said that I knew full well that they couldn't have participated in the massacres and for yet others I said that I had doubts.  I did not know whether these people had participated or not in the massacres.  That is what I said.
Q.	Finally, on this small point, Rutabagirwa seems not to have given an exhaustive list -- yes?
A.	It is possible that other perpetrators of genocide did exist.  It is also possible, however, that the list of perpetrators is exhaustive as given in this document.  I, for my part, confirm that some of the people on the list are indeed perpetrators of the crime of genocide.
Q.	The document refers to people being thrown into latrines.  Latrines are built to certain specifications; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	The person responsible for the building of latrines is the local director of hygiene; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, that wasn't the case before and it isn't the case now.  There is no one who is in charge of or supervising the digging of latrines.  Everyone does what he can with what he has.  A five-metre or 10-metre pit could be dug, depending on one's strength, and also depending on the land in which the pit is dug.  One might dig and come upon a rock when one gets to five metres and then one would stop there.  In that case the latrine would be used in that state and, if it becomes filled, another latrine is dug in another place.
Q.	Rwamakuba was a director of hygiene in Kigali, wasn't he?
A.	Yes, he was, at one point.
Q.	Do you think there may have been any relationship between the extensive use of latrines for disposing of bodies and Rwamakuba's position as director of hygiene in Kigali?
MR. HOOPER:
Is that being asserted as a charge?
MR. MORLEY:
It's plainly a question.
MR. HOOPER:
It is not in your indictment.  

MR. MORLEY:
It is still a question.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, your question should be relevant to your indictment.
MR. MORLEY:
It's certainly relevant to the indictment, whether it's in it or not.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, before we bat on, we've had no notice of this, and my suspicion is Mr. Morley's off on a jaunt of his own here, of his own imaginations, but if I'm wrong about that, perhaps we could share his information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
He's cross-examining the witness.  He's gone by the answers.  It's clear -- well, it would seem clear that he has no support for the question, but he's cross-examining the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Very well.
MR. MORLEY:
It's a pointless question, as the witness has now been listening to the exchange, so I will move on.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Can we have photograph number 8 helpfully produced on the television screen again, please?  While my learned friend is doing that, may I just deal with one final matter with regard to the document we've all been interested in?

Mr. Witness, we can see the first page of the document refers to the report being a preliminary report.  Are we agreed on that?
A.	Yes, I can.
Q.	The inside cover, next page, of this report has a paragraph written by a Dr Joseph Nsengimana -- N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A -- who is the author of the report.  Do you understand what I've said?
A.	Yes, I follow you.
Q.	The first sentence of the second paragraph on that page reads (French spoken).  Do you understand what I've said?
A.	Yes, I understand.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter adds the translation of what counsel read in French is: "these documents do not claim to be exhaustive"; is that correct?
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q. The third sentence of the same paragraph reads (French spoken).  Do you understand what I've said?  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
In English: "I do not say that there are other imperfections."
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand.
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, my French suggests that je ne doute pas means "I don't doubt" that there are other imperfections, not -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Okay, Counsel, I apologise, but you did say "doute", which I misinterpreted.  "I do not doubt" is the correct interpretation.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	There's no big point here, other than to say, Mr. Witness, you would agree that a document written in February 1996, which doesn't claim to be perfect, probably isn't perfect?
A.	Yes, I agree with you that there are imperfections in the document.
Q.	Now, let's have a look at the family photograph.  You are able to tell from the small amount of wall that you can see in the background that that is Rwamakuba's parents' home; that's right, is it?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You clearly know the house well; that's right, is it?
MR. HOOPER:
I think it's right I should point out that when I showed this witness photographs -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Headphones off, please.
MR. HOOPER:
-- I showed him -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Remove your headphones.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
When I showed this witness a photograph, I showed him more photographs than this of the house.  In fact, others appear on the disk, but I have others as well, as you may have noticed when we had the difficulties at the beginning.
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps the witness might have his headphones back on again.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Can you answer the question?  It's right, isn't it, plainly you know the house well?
A.	I do.  I know this house.
Q.	You know the lady who's seated on the right.  That's Rwamakuba's mum?
A.	I know her.
Q.	You even know the little boy who's in the front of the photograph; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You know that the lady standing behind the little boy is the daughter of Rwamakuba's sister -- yah?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And what's the sister's name, please?
A.	The mother of those children is called Anasthase Nyiramakuba.
Q.	What's the daughter's name?
A.	I do not know the young girl's name, but I know the young man's name.  He's called Gilbert Banamwana.
Q.	The man you were referring to is the man on the left in the white shirt; is that right?
A.	Yes, that's true.  Actually, he's a young man.  I think he's in fifth or sixth year of secondary school now.
Q.	Which school?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	That man is the brother of the lady in the middle; isn't that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You have known André Rwamakuba since he was a boy; isn't that right?
A.	Yes.  I know him from since he was a young man and was attending school.
Q.	You know the school he went to; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, I know the school he went to.
Q.	Did you go to the same school?
A.	No.
Q.	You know that he went on to be a doctor -- yah?
A.	That's true.
Q.	You know that he went to Belgium -- yah?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	You know that he completed his studies at Butare university?
A.	That is true.
Q.	You know his sister quite well?
A.	I know his sister.
Q.	You know what happened to her husband, Michel?
A.	I know, because I heard about it.
Q.	The family are friends of yours?
A.	No.  I think friendship in Rwanda is a much stronger link.  We might say that these are my neighbours.  I cannot say that they're friends of my family.  It would be going too far.
Q.	You know their house very well?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You know the family members?
A.	Are you referring to the old lady's family?
Q.	Who else am I referring to?
A.	In her family there is the old lady herself, her great grandchild, and then other family members, but the other people who were in that house are people who work for her at home and in her farms.
Q.	So there are other people you know about who live at the house, are there?
A.	No.  Actually, there are people who come and go from that house -- in that house.  They're not always the same people who live there.  These are people who work on a daily basis and they work on the farms.  I really cannot say that I know their names, because they change all the time.
Q.	You are aware of the comings and goings of the people to the home, are you?
A.	No.
Q.	Michel Ngirumpatse was murdered by the Interahamwe; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	He was a Tutsi; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	He was seeking refuge in Rwamakuba's father's home, you told us yesterday; that's right, is it?
A.	Yes, based on the information that I received afterwards, since I was no longer in my secteur at the time of the events.  After 1997, when I returned to the country, I heard about this, and this confirms what you've just said.  Also, we heard about this in Gacaca sessions.
Q.	He was turned over to the Interahamwe by Rwamakuba's father as a Tutsi; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No, I cannot say anything about that.  I really couldn't state that for sure.  I know that this man sought refuge in the home of Rwamakuba's father.  Assailants attacked the house and found him there, and took him away to kill him.  So I cannot say that it is the father of Rwamakuba who plotted against this man, or delivered him over to the killers.  I cannot say.
Q.	You do know that his daughter, Anasthase, was very upset with her father; that's right, isn't it?
A.	I don't know.
Q.	We have heard that, sadly, Rwamakuba's father took his own life.  Do you know about that?
A.	That's right, I've heard about it.  It is said that he killed himself.
Q.	And was it the case that you understand he was fearful of RPF reprisals, and so avoided reprisals by taking his own life?
A.	No.  Actually, I heard that he killed himself to avoid being killed by the soldiers of the RPF, because they said they killed people in a horrible manner.  That's one version.  Another version is that he killed himself because he was afraid that the RPF would kill him to avenge the death of his son-in-law.  So this is the information that came to me.  This is information that was given to me by other people, who told me about it.  It was a rumour.  But the fact is that this man killed himself.
Q.	What was the ethnic origin or group of the Rwamakuba family?
A.	It is a Hutu family.
Q.	You would agree that they are not some different ethnic group, neither Tutsi, Tutsi nor Twa; as you understand it, they are Hutu?
A.	I know that they are Hutu, because from the time I knew them first, it's always been said that they are Hutu.
Q.	If it was to have been suggested to people in this courtroom that Rwamakuba was not a Hutu, you would say that was nonsense, wouldn't you?
A.	Well, if another ethnic group is mentioned as being that of Rwamakuba, and it is explained to me that this is true, I would agree.  But as I said to you, I do not know whether Rwamakuba was born in Nduba or in Congo, but when I was young Rwamakuba's parents lived in Congo and worked there, and they would come to Rwanda on holiday.  When their contracts in Congo ended, they returned to the country with their children.  This was in 1964 or 1965.  It is at that time that I came to know Rwamakuba.  He was a young man, as I was, and in the course of that time he went to the Christ-Roi College where he continued secondary school.  

At that time it was said that his family was Hutu, and that is what is still said today.  I do not know that they have any other ethnic origin.
Q.	Thank you.  You have spoken with representatives of the Tribunal and -- I'm sorry, representatives of the Office of the Prosecution and representatives of the Defence of Rwamakuba on previous occasions; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, it's true.
MR. HOOPER:
If it's being said that this witness has made a statement to the Prosecution, has that been disclosed?
MR. MORLEY:
A moment, please.  I'm assisted by the ever helpful Ms. Cummings-John who tells us, yes, disclosed 21st July 2005.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I have the proof of that, please?
MR. MORLEY:
It will come along shortly, but may I continue in the meantime?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
Just so we're clear, this statement was served on the Defence in July of this year?
MR. MORLEY:
So I'm told.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we'll see. 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you made a statement to --
MR. HOOPER:
I'd like to see the statement that's being relied on at this point.  We have not been served it by the Prosecution.
MR. MORLEY:
Of course my learned friend can have a look at the statement if he doesn't have it to hand.  I don't have a copy of it immediately to my hand.  If Your Honour would allow me a moment.
MR. HOOPER:
If Mr. Morley is in a position to do so, we can step over this point and return to it when Ms. Cummings-John returns, if that's convenient.
MR. MORLEY:
I can rejig things a bit.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in fairness to you, I wish to make it plain that my suggestion is that in relation to Rwamakuba, you are someone who considers himself to be a friend of the family and you have come to Court to assist the family, and you have told things to the Court which are not accurate.  Do you understand my suggestion?
A.	Yes, I understand your suggestion, but allow me to say that it is incorrect.  I am not a friend of the Accused's family and there is no -- and we're not related.  If I made a statement to the Tribunal people, you can give me that statement to refresh my memory, and then I can answer your questions when I have the statement before my eyes.
Q.	All in good time.  You have been spoken to in 1999 and twice in 2004; that's right, isn't it?
A.	Yes, that is correct, but it was a long time ago.  I don't remember very well, but I know I did meet various people who put questions to me.
Q.	Just dealing with dates, you were spoken to on the 11th of August 1999 by Tribunal investigators; will you accept that date from me?
A.	I don't remember the dates.
Q.	You were spoken to -- you were spoken to on the 5th of April of 2004 by a representative from the Defence; will you accept that date from me?
A.	Yes, I met those people.
Q.	Your wife was spoken to on the 21st of July 2004.  Were you aware of that -- by the Defence?
A.	Yes, my wife informed me thereof.
Q.	You were spoken to again by the Defence on the 22nd of July 2004; will you accept that date from me?
A.	I think there are too many dates.  I really wonder if I met all those people on all those dates, unless you can show me a document.  Otherwise, I don't remember having met those people as frequently as that.
Q.	Once in 1999, twice in 2004; do you understand -- three meetings?
MR. HOOPER:
I think you put that he was seen on the 21st and 22nd July.  I may have misheard that.  But it confused me, the way I heard it.
MR. MORLEY:
It was his wife who was seen on the 21st of July.
MR. HOOPER:
I think you actually put that it was him, and the next day he was seen on the 22nd, but --
THE WITNESS:
That is not true.  Those are days that follow each other.  I think one of the dates must be mistaken.
MR. HOOPER:
I can quite happily accept, because of the statements I've got, the Defence statements, which the Prosecution have -- one's dated 5 April 2004, and my friend can lead on who he saw if he wants to, and the other one is dated the 22nd of July 2004.  Those are the two statements.
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps they're notes of interview, to help you with your nomenclature.  They don't seem to be signed.
MR. HOOPER:
In fact I think one of them may be.  I think the [inaudible] one may be.  But those are the dates that he was seen by different investigators on the part of the Defence.  He was seen by me again in July of this year, and he was seen by me at the safe house two weeks ago.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  My learned friend will no doubt confirm that his wife was seen on 21 July, the day before the last statement.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, you've got the statement date in front of you.  If that's what it says, I can only say that's the date on the statement.  I wasn't present, so I'm not in a position, but I accept that's the date on the statement.  But the witness seems to think it wouldn't have been on consecutive days -- maybe the same day, I don't know.
THE WITNESS:
I told you that -- I have stated that the Defence investigators met my wife -- did meet my wife, but I'm not sure of the date.  Perhaps it is that date which you put to me, but it is bizarre to tell me that my wife saw them on the 21st and I saw them on the 22nd.  I don't know if it's really on two -- two following days, two successive days.

BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Now, to assist my learned friend, the ever helpful Ms. Cummings-John has produced the interoffice memorandum addressed to him via the ever helpful Mr. Hometowu, disclosing, amongst other things, the (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) -- excuse me, I wonder if that name could be redacted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the redaction will be made.
MR. MORLEY:
My apologies, Your Honour -- the witness statement, and I can hand this, with the helpful Mr. Issa, across the court.
MR. HOOPER:
I have no recollection of receiving these documents at all.  I see that, for example, there's a statement from Faustin Twagiramungu, which I would have thought would have been a memorable statement to have received.
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the witness's headphones could come off.  I'm not sure where the conversation is going to go at this point.
MR. HOOPER:
So I'm going to, if I may, make my own inquiries.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 20 past 12.  We're going to break in 10 minutes time.
MR. HOOPER:
I will follow it up.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This could be managed between yourself and the Prosecutor after we've adjourned.
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, in the three records --

Headphones, please.
 
	I'll start again.  You have told us today that you were present at the Kayanga health centre when people were taken outside and murdered.  You mentioned it earlier; is that right?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You told us that you were in a ward numbered 20 within the health centre at the time; is that right?
A.	No, it had no number.  It wasn't numbered, but it was in the maternity ward.  It wasn't numbered.
Q.	You told us that you stayed in that room and observed what happened to people outside; is that right?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You saw people being dragged outside; is that right?
A.	Quite.
Q.	You told us there were about 300 refugees at the health centre; is that right?
A.	Two hundred -- between 200 and 300 refugees.
Q.	You saw people being murdered; is that right?
A.	I saw the people being dragged, beaten, taken out of the health centre.  Even if I didn't see them -- witness them being dispatched, I know that they were killed.
Q.	There may be a misunderstanding on my part.  I thought you said earlier today you saw them being killed.  Do you agree that you said that?
A.	I told you that they were dragged from the building and that they were beating them, so as they had bludgeons, swords, some of them had firearms, they dragged them outside the health centre.  That means they killed them.  They dragged them outside the health centre.
Q.	You told us earlier -- and of course I'll be corrected by the transcript -- that you saw people being dragged outside and killed outside.  Do you disagree that you said that earlier, that you saw people being killed outside?
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I never asserted that I saw them dragged and killed.  I said I saw them being dragged and beaten, taken outside of the health centre.
Q.	Help us with how many people you saw, please.
A.	There was a family that was sick, there were people who had been seriously beaten, there were three young people -- young youths and their sister -- and they were all members of one family, so they had injuries, and had come to the health centre for treatment.
Q.	How many people, please -- add them up and give us an approximate figure.
A.	I saw four people dragged.  The assailants took them out of their hospital beds, dragged them outside, and dragged them outside the health centre.
Q.	You told us in evidence that the date was the 15th of April; that's right, is it?
A.	That is true.
Q.	You weren't at the health centre on the 13th of April, nor the 14th of April; that's right, isn't it?
A.	No.  I exited on the 17th of April.  I arrived there the 15th and I left on the 17th.
Q.	On the day you say you saw something happening to people, the number of people was only four; that's right, is it?
A.	That is true, I only saw the four victims.
Q.	If there had been a massacre of far, far more people at that health centre in the preceding day or two days, you wouldn't have seen it -- yah?
A.	Yes, that's true, I wouldn't have seen it, but in fact I know there were massacres, because I heard about it.  There was one massacre outside the health centre.  Many people had fled, and Tutsi and Hutu, and the Tutsi were massacred on the spot -- a big massacre.  I can't tell you who the perpetrators were, but when -- because when I arrived there, the massacre had already taken place, and even when I was in the room where I sought shelter, it's possible that the killings continued outside the building, because I couldn't see outside.
Q.	As you've just said -- last question -- you don't know who was the organiser of the big massacre which had happened before you got there; that's right, isn't it?
A.	I couldn't tell you.  The only thing I can do is imagine what happened.  They were the same -- it was the same attackers who took the road from Gikomero to Rutunga and who we saw on that road.  They said it was those assailants who were leading the operation, even if someone came and said it wasn't those assailants who undertook the massacre, but you could see clearly that it was the same assailants who were controlling the situation, were running things during the massacres at that place.
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you for your imaginative thoughts.  I wonder if, Your Honour, that is a convenient moment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we'll take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.  

As I said yesterday, during this or any other adjournment you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  We'll take the adjournment now.  Was there anything further to discuss?  We will take the adjournment now until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1236H)
