P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, Presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 26th of June 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case Number ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Do I say that the appearances are the same this morning?
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Not quite, Mr. President.  There has been some movement in my change (sic).  I have returned following 15 days of absence; Chantal Hounkpatin, that is, representing Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  But as I said -- not quite, Mr. Ngirumpatse's not present in the Court, I just wanted to indicate I am present and that my co-counsel, Frédéric Weyl, is absent.  I now leave the floor to my colleague.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. President, as you have noticed this morning, Mr. Édouard Karemera is not present.  I spoke to him twice, and he told me that following the decision of the Appeals Chamber on judicial notice, the information and press section of the Tribunal published a communiqué in which it was noticed that from now on genocide in Rwanda is of public knowledge, and therefore the Prosecutor no longer has to bring evidence in the course of trials.  Mr. Édouard Karemera is very concerned about the information that goes as far as saying that genocide now has a legal status, and this would suppose that anything -- anybody saying anything to the contrary would be trying to promote revisionist policies.  Therefore, I wanted to point out that I could not present my case without letting the Chamber know -- or, rather, enquiring as of -- of the Chamber as to the decisions that it took.  

In conformity with Article 20 of the statute, paragraph 4 -- in particular, 4(A), there was a need to inform the Accused, in a language he understands, of the motivations of that investigation, the decision to take judicial notice.  And that therefore the Accused would like to be in a position to assess the weight this will place on his defence.  It is, therefore, requested that a French translation be conveyed to us so that I, as his counsel, may be able to enlighten him on the consequences of the decision to take judicial notice.  

Mr. Karemera is aware that your Chamber did not agree to the judicial notice issued by the Chamber of Appeal.  Nevertheless -- and he is of the view that this is a precedent that will have heavy consequences on the course of the trial, in that he would, first of all, want to be enlightened.  For this reason he is not present and, Mr. President, requests that the sitting be adjourned until such a time as he is in a position that is equal to those parties that understand English, so that he may continue to defend himself.  

Mr. Karemera is requesting additionally, that if, however, the Chamber refuses to grant his request, that at least the provisions of 82 bis of the rules of procedure be applied to him.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, thank you, I am speaking for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

Yesterday evening I arrived, and indeed I was made aware of the problem following the Appeals Chamber decision.  And I was, this morning, informed that my client was not in the courtroom.  I spoke to him, therefore, on the telephone in order to obtain his position, and he confirmed to me he was not attending the hearing for the reason just explained to you by my colleague, Félix Sow, that is, his wish to be availed a copy of a translation of the decision into French.  

My understanding of English is not sufficient to allow me to explain to him in detail the consequences on the legal front of the decision.  You know that I practice in French, and that, although I make an effort to follow the proceedings in English, I would not want to be placed in a difficult position by my failure to properly understand legal terms and legal expressions.  And I don't want to be made responsible for the consequences that my failure to properly understand such terms would entail.  

Therefore, this decision by my client, in conformity with Article 20, paragraph 4(A) and (B) of the Tribunal statute -- and I would further hope that the translation of the decision is made available.  I am aware that some efforts were made to translate it.  Therefore -- when we had requested for the translations.  

However, in the instant case, I notice the consequence that you yourself have noticed, that none of the Accused is present today.  Therefore, that the impact of the decision of the Chamber of Appeal, as well as the way in which it was rendered in the press, has concerned -- has raised concerns for the Accused.  Therefore, measures have to be taken to ensure that the decision is translated as soon as possible so that, in effect, the Accused will be informed fully and therefore be able to follow their trial -- the proceedings in their trial.  And it is for this reason that they are not present in the courtroom today.  

Therefore, this is what I was called to say to you, Your Honours, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will be brief.  Mr. Nzirorera supports the positions of his colleagues.  He understands the decision, because he's good at English, and I understand it, and I think that, moreover, his boycott to these proceedings today is a protest of the substance of the decision which he sees as relieving the Prosecutor of its burden of proving the case against him, which we believe is the first time in any international court such a decision has been taken.  And we find it to be a very disturbing development, not only for his case, but for international jurisprudence, and one in which the Appeals Chamber has allowed the completion strategy to influence what is otherwise supposed to be a fair trial.  

So, for that reason Mr. Nzirorera has declined to come to Court today.  But he also told me he wanted me to make it clear to the Trial Chamber that, as for him, he consents to proceeding in his absence, and he believes that the Trial Chamber recognises the same principle that he believes in when it issued its decision in the matter, and that we should not disturb the proceedings of the Trial Chamber because it ruled in our favour on the motion in the first place.  So that's his position.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
When the decision was first published, the Appeals Chamber's decision on judicial notice, immediate steps were taken to request the translation as a matter of high -- the highest property.  And the registrar has just enquired for detailed information as to the status of that exercise.  So, I would imagine that during the course of today I will be able to receive information as to the current status of the translation exercise, and hopefully a firm date as to when it would be completed.  

Now, as to the content of the decision, I think it's obvious that the press communiqués are not always the most faithful source of the content of judicial decisions.  And as far as the Bench is concerned, we do not think that there is anything in the decision which affects the -- what we are doing now, that the testimony of the witness in the witness box, and the process of examinations of this witness, is not affected by that decision, in our view. 

In terms of the witness's -- the decision of the Accused to boycott the proceedings to demonstrate their -- their protest against either the content of the decision, or the delay in the production of a translation of it, we do not think that that is a sufficient justification for discontinuing the trial.  We think that the reasons which permits the Trial Chamber to order a continuance of the trial, on the refusal of one accused person to attend, exists in this case.  

We will make certain -- we don't know, for example, at this stage whether this is a protest or a boycott which is simply intended to be a visible statement of their protest and is going to be short lived, or if it's going to be a long-lived boycott.  So, in those circumstances I don't make any further order at this stage.  Because, under normal circumstances, if the Accused are not going to be in Court, we would have taken steps to facilitate better information about what's happened, to assist them to give instructions to their legal counsel to act in their absence.  But, in the absence of any information at this stage, I wouldn't make any further orders.  We won't be sitting tomorrow; Court will be resuming on Wednesday.  And if it is necessary to make any further orders to facilitate them having adequate notice and facilities for their defence, orders will be made at that stage.  

But, as of today, I think we will order the continuation of the trial.  Now, it's already midday, which means that we are going to have only an afternoon session.  

When we broke on Wednesday, there were a number of -- yes.  When we broke on Wednesday there were a number of legal issues which required our -- us to adjudicate on.  Now, our deliberations on the objections with regard to the admissibility of the evidence is not yet complete.  So we don't rule on that at the moment.  Unfortunately, that means that the cross-examination on those issues, we cannot direct that the Prosecution does not take place.  We think that it ought to take place, but in the context that we have not as yet concluded our deliberations on the admissibility.  

With regard to as to whether the cross-examination should be adjourned or not, we feel that the cross-examination should not be adjourned because, in any event, there was a substantial portion of the cross-examination which is not going to be affected by this issue.  We are not satisfied, as of this stage, that any part of the cross-examination will necessarily be affected.  But we think that it might be, and that if it is, that counsel should make an application at the appropriate time, and we can address it at that stage.  

So, we will order the cross-examination to continue with the reservation that if counsel runs into a difficulty with regard to a need for further recall of the witness to address particular issues, we will consider such an application if it is made.  

Now, there was one matter which I omitted to -- to address on the issue of the continuation of the trial in the absence of the Accused.  

Mr. Robinson has specifically indicated that he has authority to proceed in the absence of his client.  But Ms. Hounkpatin and Mr. Sow have not indicated what their position is.  As far as we are concerned, the Rule 82 bis requires that the interest of the Accused be represented by trial -- be represented by their counsel in the absence of their clients.  And just for the record, I would like to enquire first whether counsel are going to represent the interests of their clients in their absence this afternoon.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, my client has not given me instructions to this effect.  I raised Rule 82 bis for this reason -- for that reason, rather.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, the same goes for me.  I will use the break to call him back, so as to know his position on that possibility, and first -- as soon as we resume this afternoon I will inform you of the outcome.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, we have the view that your responsibility as Defence counsel does not require detailed instructions for you to function in the interests of your client in their absence.  So, we think that -- that, unless the client terminates your mandate, that you would have an obligation to represent their interests in their absence.  I feel that the Court -- the Chamber does have the power to direct you to do so.  I don't know if it is necessary to do that at this stage.  Should we issue a directive?  

Presumably -- I don't anticipate it is necessary to issue such a directive, because -- but we would like to get an assurance from counsel, at the commencement of our proceedings this afternoon, that they will be representing the interests of their client, which is a condition for the continuation of the proceedings.  

In this context, I will just mention Article 4 of the Code of Ethics for Defence Counsel, which I think may have some bearing on the responsibility of counsel in this matter.  

Ms. Hounkpatin and Mr. Sow, we have been considering whether it was necessary to make any directives in this area.  But, we have decided that it would be premature to make any such directives, because you have not stated that you don't intend to represent the interests of your client.  In that context, we would give you an opportunity to consult, and we would hear from you at the resumption of our sitting this afternoon.  

We propose to adjourn until 2:30, for the continuation of the hearing.  We would expect that we would be able to proceed with the cross-examination of the witness at that time.  We would not be sitting tomorrow, and we expect that we would resume on Wednesday.  

We have not actually heard from yours (sic) yet as to the anticipated duration of cross-examination, but from my own assessment, I anticipated that the complete examination and re-examination of this witness, based on the content of his testimony-in-chief, would be unlikely to exceed two days.  I don't know if that's a reasonable assessment.  But -- 

Yes, Mr. -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I think in my view it's not likely to be a reasonable assessment, but I think we should wait until the examination begins to get a better idea.  But given the scope of the permitted direct examination, I expect my own examination of this witness to take the rest of the week.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  With regard to authority to represent, I will try to contact my client, but I know that during the lunch break it is not possible to communicate with the UNDF.  I wonder if measures could be taken to ensure that we may communicate during that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I will ask the registrar to facilitate such communication.  

Yes, Mr. Sow, I would -- and the Bench feels that I should let you know that we will be addressing this matter, whether you succeed in getting any instructions or not, because we think you already have certain obligations by virtue of the fact that you are counsel representing the Accused.  But, we will direct the registrar to provide assistance to you to make the communication that you have expressed a desire in making.  

We take the adjournment now until 2:30.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Inaudible) ...for one parting thought, Your Honour, and it's basically in reaction to Mr. Robinson's estimation of his length of cross-examination.  When we look at the transcripts of the Bagosora trial, where this witness was giving direct evidence against Nsengiyumva, the cross-examination of all four counsel lasted one day-and-a-half.  And the scope of this witness' testimony in this case is much more circumscribed.  

Now, it may be unfair -- or, may not be completely appropriate to compare our Trial Chamber to the Bagosora Trial Chamber, but it should provide some indication to how this witness has been dealt with in the past, in a case where there were four Accused cross-examining a witness who had much more direct evidence to offer in that trial than he has in this trial.  So we will wait to see how things go, but it would be surprising if his cross-examination in this case far outstripped his cross-exam -- cross-examination in a case where he had much more evidence to give of a direct nature against the Accused.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We break for lunch now.  
(Court recessed from 1255H to 1436H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Robinson, just before you start your cross-examination, I thought I would make just a brief comment after -- flows from your comment on the cross-examination.  

Although we have not completed our deliberations, it is quite clear that even if we did order the admission of the evidence that -- to which the objection is being raised, it would be for the limited purpose of dealing with the limited issue stated by counsel.  Now that, to my way of thinking, does not necessitate the opening up of new areas of examination which the Prosecutor would not be allowed to introduce in any event.  

I don't know if that assists you in any way, but we thought it would be useful to make that comment as a means of some guidelines as to the extent of the parameters of your cross-examination.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand what you're saying and I appreciate that, but as a practical matter, I don't think it's going to shorten my cross-examination for the reason that it's our position that almost all of these meetings never took place, and therefore there was no collaboration between the civilian and the military authorities as to that -- those particular meetings.  So, I don't see that I could disregard them.  In fact, what I need to do is establish enough information so that we can bring, in our Defence case, evidence to contradict it.  

So, I appreciate what you're saying, and I think under other circumstances it would be some guidance where I could cut things out.  But I must say that Mr. Webster did tell me that the Prosecution is not going to call Mr. Serushago as a witness, so I was able to eliminate some questions with respect to the direct testimony that dealt with Mr. Serushago.  So there was a little bit of progress, but maybe not as much as you would like.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

Could you call the witness, please.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before -- 
MR. SOW: 
Monsieur President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, I apologise.  I forgot.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President, for facilitating communication with our client.  It was quite useful.  I was able to inform my client of the Trial Chamber's appreciation of the Appeals decision, and I told him that the Trial Chamber had told us that the decision did not affect the trial, as such.  In that connection, I asked my client if I could continue to represent him during the hearings, and he said yes.  And I will continue to represent him.  However, he said that as far as he's concerned, he would like to receive a French version of the decision in order to be able to scrutinise it -- discuss it with me, that we may fully understand the decision of the Appeals Chamber.  

That is a summary of the discussion I had with my client, Mr. President.  

I went on to tell him that the Trial Chamber had taken all measures for the document to be translated into French as soon as possible.  He insisted that he would wait for the translation in French before showing up in Court.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I also had opportunity to meet my client, who has maintained his decision to be absent from the courtroom this afternoon, but has granted approval that I continue to represent him throughout the first part of the cross-examination, which will be conducted by my learned friend, Robinson.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much for those assurances.  And we will note that counsel has agreed to represent the interests of their clients during this portion of the trial.  

Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, returning to the situation with Witness XBM -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Who is that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Witness XBM, the next that we're going to -- the one that we're -- that I'm cross-examining. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I thought the one that you were cross-examining was a different pseudonym.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Not unless I -- I would be very woefully unprepared if that's the case. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm sorry, it's me.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
You had a really long weekend!  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, I did.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Well, in any event, over the weekend I did take all the steps that you -- as you told me to be ready for my cross-examination, and I had exhibits distributed, so I am prepared.  But -- and I will also indicate that the Prosecution did not bring any other witnesses today, so only one party to the two -- only one option was in fact available to you.  

But, in any event, I discovered over the weekend that I hadn't received any Rule 68 material for Witness XBM, and I sent an email to Mr. Webster, and he's advised me that in a CD of the 2nd of May, Rule 68 material was in fact provided for Witness XBM, as well as two other witnesses.  I checked my CD-ROM, and there's no folder for Witness XBM.  So it looked to me I hadn't received any Rule 68 material for Witness XBM.  

In conferring with Mr. Sendze, he's telling me that he thinks the Rule 68 material that was labelled for Witness AWB actually was the Rule 68 material for XBM.  And I'm going to go ahead with my cross -- if that's the case I have had sight of that material, although I found it to be completely useless, and I don't see any link to Witness XBM from that material whatsoever.  But on the representation that the -- all the material for Rule 68 for XBM has been disclosed to me, I'm going to go ahead, as you've ordered me to do, with the cross-examination.  But I wanted to put this on the record, because if it turns out I haven't had all the Rule 68 material for Witness XBM, there will be problems relating to that.  But we'll cross that bridge if we come to it.  

In any event, I just wanted to inform you of that, and I'm ready to begin the cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, we've taken note.  

Mr. Registrar.
  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, as we're waiting for the witness to be brought in, might I enquire of the Court if there's any word from the registry in compliance with the Court's order to provide us with an update on Mr. Serugendo's medical condition?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's my understanding that report that has been filed.  I have not seen it as yet.
(Witness entered courtroom)  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We are now ready to continue with the -- with the trial.  We have to sit this afternoon until 2:30 -- until 5:30, then we have to take another break tomorrow for one day, and so you will start your examination this afternoon, and it will be continued on Wednesday.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony in this trial.  

This afternoon you will be cross-examined by the Defence attorneys, and the person who will begin your examination will be the attorney representing Mr. Nzirorera.  That's Mr. Robinson.  And he will commence his cross-examination now.  

Mr. Robinson, we are just trying to access the material you have distributed.  

Okay, Mr. Robinson, you can start.  
WITNESS XBM (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	I'm doing very well, thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness XBM, I noticed last week when you were giving your examination that you referred to some papers that you had brought with you.  Can you tell us if you have been referring to any notes or other documents prior to or during your testimony?  
A.	I am somewhat surprised about your question on documents.  I never brought any documents with me.  
Q.	Well, I noticed last week that you had a white piece of paper in your shirt pocket, and I observed you take out that piece of paper and read from it.  So, can you tell us if that helps you recall that you've had something that you've been referring to?  
A.	You must have noticed a short while ago I was given some sheets of paper to help me take notes and work my way around, to help me -- assist me with my memory.  
Q.	And do you have some notes that you've been taking during the course of your time here in Arusha?  
A.	I believe that my answer is clear enough.  Maybe you want to rephrase your question if you want to get further information.  
Q.	Okay, I will do that.  Do you have any notes with -- with -- to which you have been referring during your stay here in Arusha? 
A.	I do not quite understand.  What time frame are you referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	I'm referring to the time that you arrived here from Rwanda until the present day.  
A.	I am able to read and write.  Let me reassure you that, when I took down any notes, it was in relation to the questions that were put at any given time in the examination-in-chief.  I took down those notes to be able to answer the questions as they came up.  I don't know what other answer you expect from me to your question.  
Q.	Do you have those notes here in the courtroom?  
A.	Unless you don't want me to take any more notes, is it not my right to take a pen and paper and take notes in the Trial Chamber?  I don't quite understand why you are not in agreement with that.  
Q.	I'm just asking you if you have the notes with you in the courtroom.  
A.	Please do not dwell on this issue; that is in the past.  I have not kept hold of those notes.  And when I took those notes, I did so in public.  I do not see why that would be any business of yours.  And the facts that I am recounting before the Trial Chamber are events to which I was a witness and I am not fabricating facts here.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, as I mentioned to you earlier, it's the responsibility of the Judges to determine when a question is improper.  The enquiry you were asked as to whether you have notes is not an improper question, and you can answer it very simply and indicate to the Court whether the notes that you took -- do you have them with you now?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  As far as those notes are concerned -- well, I didn't take a record of everything that was happening in the Trial Chamber.  I only noted down the questions that were put to me so that I could know whether that -- whether a specific question had already been put to me.  And that's why I was taking those notes, so that I could know whether a question had previously been put to me, or whether I was required to provide further information in response to a specific question.  So, I do not see why Defence counsel is dwelling on the subject.  

I might have noted down a question or two.  Of course, it depends.  Sometimes I might have written down a -- or, drawn a line, as such.  It depends what stage you're -- you are at during the examination.  Earlier I wrote down the name of Mr. Robinson on a piece of paper, just so that I know that he is counsel for Nzirorera.  So, I do not see why he considers those notes to be of any importance, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, the reason why I'm dwelling on this matter is because you haven't answered the question, which is a very simple one, both put to you by me, as well as the Presiding Judge.  Do you have the notes that you have been taking here with you in the courtroom?  
A.	No, I don't.  
Q.	And did you refer to those notes from the time you left the courtroom on Thursday until you've come here this morning? 
A.	As Mr. President just asked me, I would like him to talk to you directly so that we can move forward in this cross-examination.  You seem to be giving over too much importance to this piece of paper on which I took down notes.  I do not now see the link between this piece of paper and your work here.  If you want to know the content of my statement, well, that was more than three years ago now.  It was a long time ago.  

I don't really see why you think those notes are of such importance.  As I said, I took those notes in order to reassure myself that you were not putting the same questions to me that you put to me in the past.  I do not see quite where your questions are leading.  If you want to ask me questions on the subject of the events that occurred in Rwanda, I am ready to answer those questions.  I do not know whether it is the first time that you are doing this kind of work, or whether you've done it so before, but I don't see why you are asking me such questions.  I see it as a waste of time, personally, and a waste of the Trial Chamber's time.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I suggest to you if you're truly interested in saving time, you can just answer the question.  If there's something wrong with the question, then the Prosecutor knows how to object, and the Trial Chamber knows how to make a ruling.  

But my question was simple.  I just asked you if you had referred to those notes prior to -- from the time you left the courtroom on Thursday until the time you arrived here this morning.  So, that's a question that can be answered by a simple yes or no, and we could have moved on to other things by now, if you had done so.  
A.	The answer I could give to that question is as follows:  I am used to answering questions, and you are not the first person -- question (sic) to put questions to me, whether it be the Judges or counsels (sic) in general.  And as I said, the question that you are asking me is a simple one.  Well, if you think that I am providing a bad response, well, you can give me zero out of ten.  I do not know whether I have understood you correctly.  Do you want -- well, maybe you want me to give you the answers that you're looking for.  
Q.	Well, I'm not here to rate your testimony like some television show.  I'm asking for a simple answer.  So my question, to give it to you again, for the third time, is whether or not you have looked at your notes from the time you left the courtroom on Thursday, until the time you arrived here today.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the Chamber doesn't like to get too involved in the question process, unless something wrong has taken place.  But I think I should suggest to you that it would be much better for the progress of the examination if you did not try to analyse the reasons for the question that you have been given.  

As of now, I don't think that counsel has asked a question that's improper by asking if you referred to the notes.  And you could answer that either yes or no, simply, and then we can move on.  I don't think there's any suggestion, up to now, that it is wrong or improper for you to refer to notes which you, yourself, have made.  So, I don't think that really could be the purpose of the question, as of now.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  It's very lucky for me that you be here acting as a referee between myself and counsel, for you to judge the relevance of the questions that he is putting to me.  

Mr. President, I believe that I have done my best to answer the question, but I would like you to tell him that I have already answered the question -- unless he is deaf, of course.  I already answered him by saying that I do have -- not have any notes on me.  And I told him that I had taken notes in order to help me remember whether such-and-such a question had been put before or not, because I had noted that he seems to ask open questions, endless questions, and I would like you to ask counsel to no longer insist on the issue of the notes.  

Please tell him that it is rather cumbersome for him to harp on on the same line of questioning.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, have you referred to your notes from the time you left the courtroom on Thursday -- or, excuse me, on Wednesday, until you came to the courtroom today?  
A.	Well, you will probably ask me whether I have taken a bath or had a meal.  I have not looked over those notes again.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like the witness to be shown a piece of paper on which I have written a name.  I'm going to ask him some questions about this person whose name is on this paper.  And I put it on the piece of paper so that it would not reveal his identity.  

Excuse me, Mr. President, I don't believe that that was shown to my colleagues on the Defence side.  They also need to see it; otherwise they won't understand my examination.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, do you know -- or, did you know the person whose name is on the piece of paper that's been placed in front of you?  
A.	I know a number of individuals by the same name, because many Rwandans have similar names.  I heard you say that you had seen some documents.  Do you think that I am the author of that piece of paper?  I was not the person -- the person who actually wrote that name down on that piece of paper.  
Q.	No, Witness, I was the one who wrote down that name on a piece of paper, and I did that so that we can discuss this individual without mentioning his name in Court, because I was concerned that if we discuss his name in Court, it may help identify you, which I'm trying to avoid.  Do you understand?  
A.	That individual has nothing to do with my identity.  If you like, you can say the name out loud because it does not worry me in the least.  It is neither the name of my father, my grandfather, my cousin, or my uncle.  So it should not be of any worry to me.  
Q.	This person was murdered on the 8th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you spent almost nine years in prison for his murder; did you not? 
A.	You say that I was in prison because I was suspected of having killed him, or because I was convicted of having killed him?  
Q.	Because you were suspected of having killed him.  
A.	Do you want to know whether I was convicted of murdering that person?  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you want to know exactly how far ahead the case is, or -- what exactly do you want to know?  
Q.	Did you spend almost nine years in prison because you were suspected of the murder of the person whose name is on that piece of paper? 
A.	Before answering that question, I actually have a question to put to you, Counsel.  

Do you want to listen to what I have to say to you, or do you want to tell me what I should say to you?  
Q.	Well, I think, Witness XBM, that you have a very full opportunity to explain the circumstances of this individual's murder, but for now I just wish to establish whether or not you spent almost nine years in prison because you were suspected of having participated in his murder.  
A.	Well, in order to move on from this question, I would like to say that the judicial (sic) is still questioning the murder of this individual.  And, at this stage, I am no longer suspected of having killed this individual.  I am quite simply suspected, or accused, of having been present on location during the murder.  When you talk about this individual, fine.  If you were talking about somebody else who was murdered elsewhere, I don't know.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I was going to ask you some questions -- I am going to ask you some questions about the murder of this individual, and it occurred to me that since you had been arrested for his murder, that by mentioning his name, it might assist others in identifying you.  And so that's why I wasn't going to mention his name, but I was simply going to enter this piece of paper as an exhibit in this case, under seal.  

So, I will ask you again, do you prefer that I proceed in that way, or do you have -- would you prefer I mention his name?  
A.	Listen, I did not take part in preparing your cross-examination.  You can ask me any questions you like.  I am not in the least worried.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would be prepared to proceed by asking the witness about this man by mentioning his name, unless anybody directs me to the contrary or there's any objection.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
With the leave of the Court, I would make the following request:  That we do not mention the name of the person written on the piece of paper during the cross-examination of this witness.  Because it seems obvious to me that this name could lead to the identification of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, what you've suggested is obviously a proper course of action.  But we can't proceed if the witness does not answer the question that is put to him.  
MR. LAHAIE: 
Yes, I understand that, Mr. President.  But I think it might be a technical problem in the sense of the decision that was already handed down by this Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, the process of the trial will be much smoother, we will be able to protect your rights, as well as the rights of everybody else, if you would just answer the questions that are put to you, quite simply.  It's not necessary for you to get into an argument with anyone.  In fact, that does not help the proceedings at all.  

Now, I'm going to ask you:  The name that's written on the paper before you, do you know the person?  
THE WITNESS: 
I know that individual, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
And is that the individual about whom Mr. Robinson has been questioning you for the last few minutes?  
THE WITNESS: 
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, I will direct that this document be put in evidence under seal.  I am in receipt of that paper.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, Mr. President.  That would be Exhibit D. NZ157.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted in evidence, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ157 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, this person was murdered on the 8th of April 1994, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that was the same day that you told us you were at Mudende university, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And his murder took place a long way away from the Mudende university, correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What was the distance between Mudende university and the place where this individual was killed? 
A.	Approximately four kilometres away. 
Q.	And you were in fact at the place where he was killed, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You testified that no one moved without a weapon.  What weapon did you have on the 8th of April?  
A.	I had a stick as a weapon. 
Q.	And did you use that stick on the person whose name is on the Exhibit D. NZ157? 
A.	I did not use that stick. 
Q.	Did you, along with your elder brother, kill the person whose name is on that paper with a club? 
A.	As Mr. President just said, there are courts in Rwanda that lead that type of investigation.  And an investigation was carried out.  There are also Gacaca courts that carry -- excuse me, cover this type of event.  

As far as my brother is concerned, it is true that he was there with other individuals.  I was also there.  Investigations were led by the public prosecutor's office, and I think that the only information that the public prosecutors have on me is that I was there on the scene of the crime, but I arrived after the individual had been killed.  And the investigations bear the name of the individuals who killed that person, and who then fled to the Congo.  

The victim had some**********, and some people who did not take part in his murder looted his *************.  So, I was placed in custody, not because I had taken part in his murder, but because I had eaten part of the ***********belonging to that individual.  That is what I can reply to your question.

1525H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So you did not kill that person with a club; correct?
A.	That is correct.  And that is the information that the public prosecutor's office has at its disposal, and also the Prosecutor.  The public prosecutor's office investigation has very clear results as far as I'm concerned. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness be shown document number one in my packet of exhibits, please.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, the document that I've placed in front of you, in handwriting, dated the 1st of February 1995, that's your confession to this murder, isn't it?
A.	I would like to say that on the 1st of February 1995 -- I hope you're going to follow my explanation because I think that you are an educated person.  On the 1st of February 1995, Rwanda had been free for approximately four months, which means that the government had been overthrown and had been replaced by a new government.  At that time, the situation was an explosive one.  Anybody who was suspected of having taken part in the genocide was caught up with, or anybody who was suspected of having links with anybody who had committed or perpetrated genocide, and so it was an ideal time for people to confess.  Those people were arrested by soldiers who had no training whatsoever in the rights of the individual, and when those soldiers arrested you, you would do everything in your power to save your life.  So you could make a statement knowing full well that you could come back on that statement at a later stage.  So that is how I'm explaining to you the circumstances under which I gave this statement, or confession.  

In the month of January of the year 2003, I had the opportunity to come back on the contents of this document and the public prosecutors office understood my explanation because at that time people were given the chance, notably those people who had thought that they were compelled to give statements, and they were given the opportunity to subsequently come back on those statements. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you to read this statement so that the Judges and everyone can understand in their own languages what is contained in the statement, but before you do, I caution you not to mention your own name, which is listed in the statement, nor the name of your parents, nor the name of the victim.  So perhaps maybe I -- I will try to guide you in that so that you don't cause any problems in terms of revealing your identity.  So if we can look at the first line of the statement, does it indicate that "I", and then it gives your name, and it gives your father and mother's name, and then it gives the area that you resided, "do hereby confirm that on 8 April 1994, around 11 hours, I killed a man named" and then it gives the name of that person who I wrote on that piece of paper "who resided in the secteur", and then it gives his secteur.  Is that what is contained in the first sentence of that document? 
A.	In a few words, and you know in order to move the cross-examination forward, let me say that I have already explained that this statement was given in the context in which it was given at the time.  It was a time when people were being tortured, but subsequently when human rights became -- or, were being upheld, other documents were written down.  And if they were to be tendered by the Court, I would entertain them, otherwise I can only say that these other statements, which I reject, were made in order to spare my own life because -- by the way, you do not find the name of the person who interviewed me at that time.  What I am saying is that these statements were made in the very midst of dictatorship, and the statements were given under duress.  I subsequently revisited those statements and corrected them accordingly before other bodies, that is why I believe that any statement that was given under duress is not tenable before this Trial Chamber, that is the International Criminal Tribunal.  So you are referring to documents which were produced in very bad times when people were constrained or compelled to make statements. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you about the circumstances under which you made this statement, but first it's necessary for us to understand the content of the statement.  And in the first sentence, did you confirm in the statement that on 8 April 1994, at around 11 hours, I killed a man named", and the name is written in the paper in front of you "who resided in a secteur", and a secteur is listed but I won't repeat it.  Is that contained in your statement?
A.	This is what I can say to that.  I signed the statement, but I am not the author of that statement.  And you need to understand that.  The individual who compelled or forced me to write that statement does not exist.  I was facing very serious problems, and the person who forced me to make that statement had his own problems.  So let me say that one of the persons who arrested me, told me to endorse what my colleague was putting to me, warning that if I did not do so I would run into problems, so I did so.  And I think it is a waste of the Court's time to continue to dwell on this document.  I have nothing else to say except you are going to beat me up here as I was beaten up at the time.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I'm asking you right now simply to engage in an exercise of reading and, you see, I'm giving you many opportunities to explain yourself, but what we're doing now is simply reading the statements so the Judges know what is in there.  After that we can discuss why.  So to turn your attention to the document, does it say that you confirmed that on 8 April 1994, around 11 hours, you killed the man whose name is on the paper in front of you who resided in the secteur which is named.  Does it say that on the paper?
A.	I know how to read Kinyarwanda, and indeed that is what is written down.  I have just read it, as I read that excerpt, I also went on to explain to you that the statement was made under very difficult circumstances.  The person who got me to make that statement wanted my life, and I do not see why I should revisit a document written under such circumstances of torture.  I see that there is a number on this document, and this must indicate or must point to the fact that there are other documents in my file.  So if you bring those documents -- those other documents in my file I think that would enable everybody to have the full big picture. 
Q.	Yes, I assure you we're going to go over the other documents in your file.  But for now I'm asking you, on this document, did you also say that you were assisted by your elder brother to kill him?  "We used a club and we killed him because he was Tutsi.  We buried him in", and then the name of the place where he was buried is mentioned."  Is that contained in this document?
A.	That is what is written down in the document, but I have told you that I am not the author of this document.  I simply signed it.  Look at the content of that document.  I know that you are defence counsel and you can understand the value that may be ascribed to a document.  Do you really believe that I could have said that I committed those crimes myself, as if I were signing a receipt for receiving some kind of money?  Well, I was in detention with my elder brother.  And in order to get out of trouble, we agreed to make this statement.  And I was forced to talk of myself and my senior brother.  And so I had to mention my senior brother and he had to mention me so that we be treated similarly.  What I'm saying, therefore, is that this statement indeed was made, but when things changed subsequently, each individual was given an opportunity to correct their statements so that the said statements would not be used against them.  So my turn came, and I made another statement rejecting the content of the previous statement and I was released.  Those who knew the matter better were then brought to book.  So the document you have before you is a document which could have been used to keep me in gaol, but at some point government understood that the document was not written -- or, the statement was not made under normal circumstances.  Why then would you want to insist on this document which already has no value in the eyes of the government because it was written or produced at a time when human rights were not being upheld?  
Q.	And in this statement, did you also indicate that you were together with the following individuals and then listed a total of seven names?
A.	I was arrested at the same time as other persons.  And, at the time, soldiers did not know anything about human rights.  And they were angry because their relatives or friends had died.  And anybody who was arrested was accused or charged of having been involved in the genocide.  If I mentioned any names, it was because I was asked to mention names.  And at that the time, you -- one could give any names of anybody, even those who had not participated in the genocide.  That is why I say and I insist that at that time -- or, any name any manner of name could be provided.  And I don't know why you insist on putting this question, counsel.  
Q.	Well, we see on the piece of paper seven names listed in about the centre of the paper, one after the other.  Did all of these seven people, in fact, participate in the murder of that man whose name is on Exhibit D. NZ157?
A.	I told you that I was arrested at the same time as those persons.  These were persons who lived in the area where the victim was buried.  We did not have enough time to explain whether or not somebody was innocent.  What happened is that all those who were arrested by soldiers were at a risk of losing their lives, and it is under those circumstances that these names were mentioned.  However, this does not mean that these people are shared in the meal or the eating of the*****, as I did.  
Q.	When you said that "we were together with these individuals", and you listed the seven people, was that statement true or false?
A.	I don't know whether I should interpret this document for you word for word.  And I don't know whether I will have ample opportunity to make a full statement so that we don't need to revisit this issue.  I have already explained that I was among those who ate the ****of the victim.  Now, what is contained in this statement is simply something that I was compelled to sign because I wanted to save my own life.  I have already had occasion to provide explanations relating to this statement.  At some point later on, those who actually ate that ******belonging to that gentleman, were identified and arrested.  And there are other names which do not appear on this piece of paper.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, you have told us that you made a false statement to the Rwandan authorities concerning your own involvement in this crime.  And I'm trying to find out whether you also made a false statement to the authorities about the involvement of others.  Did you falsely accuse any other individual of participating in this crime?
A.	Now I see the thrust of your cross-examination.  It would seem to me that you want to create some conflict between myself and the authorities.  The Rwandan authorities asked me to make the statement, and I had opportunity to explain to them the circumstances under which I made that statement, and that is how the government became aware of these circumstances and understood that this document was drawn up by a soldier whose name unfortunately does not appear on the document.  The content of the statement, as you can see for yourself, is not very clear.  So I cannot say that this individual who compelled me to make the statement was acting on behalf of government, maybe he just had something against me, maybe he had other intentions.  Now, you are saying that I lied in the statement, but what I am saying is that I met government officials subsequently and explained to them under what circumstances the document was obtained.  And these were circumstances that did not uphold my rights.  At that time, I was given the opportunity to make another statement, and in that statement I explained exactly what had happened.  And this was not something that happened only to me.  If you read the confession of -- my confession of 20 February, you will note that the deputy prosecutor himself agreed that my statement was in line with the offences for which I was charged.  That is why I believe that it is better to work on that other document rather than to dwell on the one you're dwelling on because it all amounts to a waste of the Court's time.  Again, this document was written at a time when I had no opportunity to explain what had happened, and the circumstances were not right.  Maybe you will ask me how it is that I made a false statement which is getting me into trouble today.  My answer is:  At the time I made this statement, the circumstances were difficult.  I do not know whether the individual who compelled me to make that statement was acting under government instructions, but when the judicial institutions or the legal institutions began to function properly, I had an opportunity to make -- to provide explanations, and I was understood.  And I am currently provisionally released.  That, however, does not preclude the fact that the gacaca system has recognised that my only crime was that I ate the victim's*****.  In very clear terms, please don't waste time on this document, except you intend to call another witness who will provide -- or, who will shed more light on this document than myself.  
Q.	Well, Witness XBM, I think we can agree from your testimony that you gave false information or that you are now claiming to have given false information about your own role in this murder.  My question to you is whether you also falsely implicated other individuals.
A.	Counsel, let us understand ourselves properly.  Now, the statement of that date contains material that is untrue.  I have already told you that the statement was made under duress.  We must distinguish between a statement given under duress and a statement that is freely given.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, maybe you have enough information to put this statement in evidence.  The details of its content will then become apparent to us. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, Mr. President, but the one thing I'm lacking is the confirmation that, in fact, he has falsely accused other individuals in the past.  I've been trying to get that, and I think I would like to continue to try to get that.  And it would help, maybe, if you would direct him to answer my question, but I'll ask it again and see how it goes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness XBM, my question to you is:  Did you falsely implicate any of these seven people in the crime when you made your statement on the 1st of February 1995?
A.	We have dwelled on this question -- this statement of the 1st of February at length, and I believe that my explanations are sufficient.  I did not only lie about myself, I also lied about others.  And I have already told you the circumstances under which that statement was provided.  Yes, I did not speak the truth.  I did not say the truth.  In 1995, it was impossible to tell those questioning you that you were innocent, so all you needed to do was to please them and provide the answers they wanted to hear.  You are questioning me here today, you are looking for a number of answers, and that is exactly what those people were doing at the same -- at that time, that is, in 1995.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I think you did answer my question.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I, at this time, Mr. President, would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ158, under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ158 admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness XBM, can you tell us where you were when you made this statement, physically?  What was the place?
A.	That is a good question, the kind of question you should have put to me before now.  The statement does not show or reflect the name of the person who took the statement.  There is no venue mentioned on that document, this is, therefore, a document of doubtful source.  So we must wonder where was this statement made.  We must wonder who is the author of this statement.  What I am saying is I am not the one who drafted this statement to take it to the prosecutor's office, so you must ask yourself where this document was drafted.  If you were able to obtain this document, you should have found out where it was written.  You see, I should simply just throw out this document and reject it because it is not valid.  Now, even though I signed this document, this document was drafted under illegal circumstances, and that is why state officials in Rwanda understood my position because no one knows at what time the statement was made, whether it was in the day or at night, I do not know the person who interviewed me, and I was forced to sign the document. 
Q.	Witness XBM, you were arrested in November 1994; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on the 1st of February 1995, you placed your signature on this document; correct?
A.	Yes, I agree with you. 
Q.	And can you tell us the circumstances under which you place this -- your signature on this document?  Did someone come and get you from your cell?  What happened that led to you signing this document?
A.	I think you have information at your disposal.  I was arrested on the **** of November 1994.  I was placed in custody in a military camp.  And as time went by, different soldiers would come to the holding cell in order to meet with you.  Whether they be high-ranking officers or ordinary officers, and they would come by the holding cell and interview us as to the motives or the reasons why we had been placed in custody.  We were questioned as to the allegations brought against us.  And as I provided explanations, then those soldiers would go and lead an investigation, whether it be the command of *******camp, where I was detained, or the soldiers working in military positions in the region close to where I resided, and also those military positions close to the place where the victim fell.  At a later stage, the soldiers of that military camp and in collaboration or cooperation with those soldiers working at military positions led an investigation and found that I was innocent.  And the authorities took the decision to release me.  What is more, they asked members of the population a number of questions, and they confirmed in saying that I had played no role in the murder of that individual.  

In the month of January, some unknown persons came to my residence at night and arrested me.  They took me to a certain place.  And three or four days later, they told me that I needed to choose between life or death, and they said even if you are not responsible for the murder of that person, it was in fact members of your family who killed him.  I tried to put forward a number of reasons and explained to them that I was not responsible for the murder, but they did not want to listen to me, nor did they give me time to explain myself.  So, in the end, I told them that they could do with me what they would.  And I think you then know what happened, I have already told you. 
Q.	And where were you when you signed that document?
A.	I told you that I was in a bush, as it were.  They had placed me at a military position.  
Q.	So you were outdoors?
A.	It was out in the countryside.  
Q.	You were not inside a building?
A.	We were -- we had been locked inside a house, but there was no light and we could see no daylight.  
Q.	And how long had you been locked up in those conditions before you signed those statements?
A.	I told you that, once again, I was arrested on the ****of January, whereas I had been released beforehand, and I had just spent two weeks there.  You say -- you can see the time that elapsed between the ****** of January and the 1st of February.  I think that was two weeks.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I do have some more questions about this, but I'm wondering if you would like to take our afternoon recess.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are going to stop at 5:30 this afternoon.  And so we'll take a short mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1605H)
(Pages 18 to 24 by Roxane Meena)

























(Court resumed at 1637H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness XBM, I'm almost ready to move on from the statement of February 1st 1995, but before I do, I want to ask -- make sure you have had a full and fair opportunity to explain the circumstances under which you made this false statement.  So, is there anything else you would like to add?  
A.	No, I have no further explanations in relation to that statement of 1 February '95. 
Q.	And I've asked the registrar to place a piece of paper in front of you, and what I'm going to ask you to do now on that piece of paper is to write down the names of the people who were with you who can verify your story about having been tortured, about giving the statement under duress.  So if you could take that piece of paper and write the names of any soldiers who were present or any fellow citizens who were present who can verify your story.  
A.	As I explained earlier on, this statement was not taken under conditions that are legally acceptable.  It was a statement made under torture.  Each person was tortured individually.  So calling the witnesses of the torture is not the solution.  The solution lies in bringing the document which replaces this one.  That is the valid solution.  I believe that the place from which you abstained -- obtained this document can also source for you the more valid one.  I believe that I am entitled to abstain from naming or calling any witnesses.  These things are matters of the past.  You are not going to be defending me, and I therefore do not see what the interest would be in providing those witnesses' names to you.  
Q.	Well, for example, you told us you were in a house with no light, with other people, after the ******of January, during the two weeks that you were held and made this statement.  Can you write down on that piece of paper the names of any other people who were kept in that house with you? 
A.	I was not alone in that room, but also in this court it is not only you and I who are present.  I was arrested in November '94 and questioned in February '95.  I told you that I was held for ***********in that house without lights, **********, not two weeks.  I therefore do not know where you find any reference to a two-week period, except you are focusing on something else.  You are putting questions to me in a manner that tends to be leading so that my answers would be what you want.  
Q.	Can you write down the names of the people who were with you in that dark house for the ********** period that you've described?  
A.	Go and find out from the people who provided that document to you.  They are the ones who know the names of those people with whom I was detained.  I was in a very difficult situation and I did not have to remember the names of those who were detained with me.  
Q.	Do you remember the names of any persons who were detained with you or the names of any soldiers who participated in your detention or the taking of your statement?  
A.	I don't know whether you understand what I am saying clearly.  When you are arrested, the person who arrests you has the right to arrest you and has authority over you.  He is not obliged to introduce himself to you or to tell you his name.  Do you understand that?  Now, furthermore, I say that it is not proper for you to put that question to me because it was for the person who questioned me to identify himself on that document.  Therefore, it is not my fault that he didn't write down his name on the document. 
Q.	Do you remember the names of any of the people who were with you in that dark house at the end of January, or any of the soldiers who participated in your detention or your taking -- or the taking of your statement?  
A.	That is not an easy thing for an ordinary ********to remember the name of a soldier, except when we are dealing with a soldier of very low rank.  Those at that level can give you their names, but very few of them will disclose their names to you.  So it is not easy for an ordinary civilian to know the name of a soldier.  Furthermore, the situation was so difficult at the time since the war had come under new powers four months ago, and one could not therefore ask a soldier to give one his or her name.  One could not ask the person who had arrested them to tell one their name, so I do not know.  
Q.	Okay.  So I take it that you don't know the names of any of the soldiers.  Do you know the names of any of the people with whom you were detained?  
A.	I have just told you that it was not easy to chat with those with whom I was detained.  You could not begin to tell your story to the person with whom you were detained, whereas that person might not have been interested in your story.  Now, let us take this courtroom.  I do not know whether, after two days sitting, you will be able to remember the names of the persons who were present in court.  It is even less likely for someone like myself, who was detained in a dark room, in a dark place.  So it is very difficult to know the names of those with whom one was detained.  We were all distressed, but if you ask me to provide names of those people with whom I was detained at the central prison, fair and good.  I think I would be able to give you some names.  

So, we were held or detained in that dark place, in a house with several rooms, and people were held in separate rooms.  And I have no recollection of the people with whom I was detained.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you -- 
A.	I was in a room to myself. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And now I would ask that you be shown our next document, number 2 in the list of exhibits.  Now, Witness XBM, not only did you confess to killing the victim, but other persons implicated you in that killing at around the same time; isn't that true? 
A.	Please, give me some time so that I can decipher this document, which is not very easy to read. 
Q.	Yes, take your time.  
A.	Yes, I have read through the document. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that this document contains statements from three people who accused you of participating in the murder of the person whose name is on Exhibit D. NZ157?  
A.	Counsel, you can see for yourself the statements that were made by those witnesses.  They are trying to absolve themselves because they made the statement in 1995.  If I read the document properly -- because it isn't very legible -- this document, it would seem to me that the allegations in that document against me do not refer to any authority before whom those charges or allegations were made.  We do not see the names of any interviewer, we do not see the location on which -- at which the statement was made.  So, to my mind, this is a trap.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, looking at the text, it appears that one of the persons making the statement is a certain ***********************************************; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that **************was one of those who accused me, but those who made the statement are well known to me.  So he is, indeed, one of those who accused me.  But there was also a lady whose name appears further up.  And there is another one, whose name is further down, who accuses me as well.  So I know all of them.  

So if you look at the document carefully, you would see that they were planning to kill me, and that is obvious.  That is why their statement is very concise.  Their plan was not to tell the truth in relation to the manner in which the crime was committed.  They wanted to get rid of me.  They wanted to eliminate me.  The idea, therefore, was to use testimonies or statements like these from these types of witnesses to accuse me, and to eliminate me.  

I, therefore, do not recognise this document.  I reject this document.  I do not see the name of the drafter of this document.  Was this document prepared by members of the population or -- well, I don't know who drafted this document.  But from the statements made by these persons in gacaca hearings, I can tell you that their statements were different.  They changed their testimony.  And I'm certain that if you sought other documents then you would find that their content, if relating though this matter, will be quite different from the content of this document. 
Q.	And the other people who accused you of killing the victim in this document are************************* ********************************************************************************; is that correct? 
A.	I have already provided you with explanations.  It is not simply a case of looking at the names of those individuals, I know them very well.  I even come across them in Rwanda.  Those things took place in 1995.  And you can see in the upper part of this document, it is written that it was the wife of the victim, the person that we talked about here.  And the president of the Trial Chamber asked for us not to quote that person's name in public.  

Now when the wife of the victim heard that I had been released, she became worried, and she started to lead an investigation herself.  She was not happy with the decision that had been taken by the soldiers.  And she tried to instill fear in certain people in order to have me put back in custody.  

The lady*********************, is, in fact, the wife of the victim.  And when she learned that we had been released, she went to find further elements in order to have us arrested once again.  That meant she was not happy with the situation, and that she wanted us to be caught.  She went to meet with certain individuals, and asked for them to make a statement.  And you will understand that that is not a normal state of affairs.  A simple civilian will not go and take a statement for judicial reasons.  

This is all to say that what is said in this document, I think that it was all a plot set up against me.  And I was released legally.  And that person specifically sought other means in order for me to be rearrested.  And that was done with a view to making me confess to crimes that I had not committed.  There is another document that will prove to you that this is, indeed, correct.  And I had promised when taking the oath that I would tell the truth; and that is the reason for my presence here. 
Q.	And can you tell us what interest the wife of the victim had in falsely accusing you of her husband's murder? 
A.	As far as her interests are concerned, I can explain as follows: What I noted about that individual, whether it be she personally or the children that she had with the victim, when I was arrested on        the******of November 1995, this old lady and her son, who was a soldier, walked passed the entrance, the gateway to my residence.  They then went towards the place where the husband of this old lady had been killed.  And in view of the fact that I had good relations with those people and that we shared a number of things, I would say -- I would even venture to say that they were in fact my friends.  And I say that because if, for example, you come across somebody today who notes that you are thirsty, and then asked you to have a drink with them, well that person is considered to be your friend.  And if you think that such a person is in a situation, then you will react in kind.  And that was the kind of relationship that we had, myself and those individuals.  

Three or four months after having learnt of that -- the death of that gentleman, I went to see the people who had been arrested.  Had I played a role in the murder of that individual, I would not have gone to meet those people.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Those people who were bereaved, correction from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
THE WITNESS:
So those people who went to the location where he had been killed and buried, the members of the family of the defunct insisted that they be paid compensation for the ************of the victim that had been looted.  The members of the family managed to recuperate some ****that were in the area, and they asked for those people who had those ******in their possession to be prosecuted.  

They also asked me to help them, but I did not do what they wanted me to do.  And in noting that I was not coming up with the goods, they then decided to say that I had played a role in the death of that person.  And I told them that I could not give way to fear and confess to a crime that I had not committed.  So, the people who accused me and my elder brother and the other individuals mentioned in that document of having killed a person and taken his**********, well I would like to say that the people who did indeed loot the *********are on that piece of paper.  And they were, in fact, the first people to pay compensation to the members of the family of the victim.  And that is to prove to you that that old lady tried to obtain such a document in order to instill fear in me, and force me to pay a form of compensation.

I think, therefore, that I should be tried for the **********that I ate, but I did not kill the person I am accused of having killed.  But those people thought that if they did accuse me of having taken part in his murder I would be frightened, and I would pay them money.  That is what I would like to say to you, Counsel.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	This document was found in your file in the Rwanda judicial system.  Did these people, in fact, make this statement to the authorities? 
A.	Well, I think maybe you should not ask me that question, you should ask those people who drafted the document.  You should ask them in what circumstances that document was taken and how it was sent to the Rwanda authorities.  If I were to answer your question then I would be involving myself in something that absolutely does not concern me. 
Q.	Were you aware that this statement was a part of the charges against you in the file behind those charges in Rwanda? 
A.	For an individual to know what is contained in his case file, he must wait for the time when he is just about to appear in court.  At that moment in time the Accused has the opportunity to read the entirety of his case file.  Otherwise, before that moment in time, before appearing in the trial chamber, that case file will remain in the hands of the public ministry, and investigations are undertaken in secret. 
Q.	And have you had the opportunity to review your case file in Rwanda? 
A.	During the nine years that I spent in custody, I was not -- I did not appear before a court.  There was a presidential decision that was signed in 1993.  And in that decision, people of a number of different categories were due to be released.  That presidential decision was signed in 2003. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Repeats the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
And it was asked -- requested that those people who had explained to the authorities everything that they knew should be released.  And that those people who were underage at the time of the genocide should also be released.  In that decision it was said that -- should be released also those persons for whom the case file was not complete.  They should also benefit from that release measure, and notably those people who had told the truth about the events that had occurred in Rwanda.  And it was under those circumstances that I was released, along with other people who were thought to have said the truth.  

I could not deny the fact that those individuals had perished in view of the fact that I was present when they were murdered.  Secondly, I admitted having eaten the **********belonging to the victim.  And those people who wanted my life used those facts in order to say that, because I had eaten the ********belonging to the victim, I had also taken part in their murder -- or his murder.  So, that is what I can add to my answer, Counsel, in order to prove to you that the evidence within my case file were not valid -- or was not valid.

I explained to the investigators, whose duty it was also to examine the statements of the Prosecution witnesses, and I asked the authorities also to have a close look at my case file in order to find out precisely where the truth lay.  And when my case file was reviewed, I was considered to be one of those people for whom the case file was not complete.  And in the year 2003, it was decided that those individuals who had an incomplete case file would be transported to their villages with a view towards asking the citizens who knew them whether they knew that those people had taken part in the unfortunate events of 1994, and then decide whether such-and-such or such-and-such a person was actually in custody without any proof or evidence.  So, that is how I came to be released.  So the documents you are referring to were not considered to accuse me in any manner.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I think I would ask that this document be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ21.  I will not offer it in evidence in light of that explanation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Now, Witness XBM, did there come a time what you gave a statement on the 8th of June 1995 before a prosecuting officer in Gisenyi at Gisenyi prison?  
A.	I didn't quite grasp the date that you mentioned, Counsel. 
Q.	8 June 1995? 
A.	I no longer remember the date, but I know that whilst I was in custody, I had the opportunity to meet the deputy prosecutor, the criminal investigations officer.  I met them on a number of occasions, and I don't know whether, on that specific day that you mentioned, I met with them.  But were you to give me the name of the person who took down my statement that might help in refreshing my memory. 
Q.	Leonard Mukeshimana, that is spelled, M-U-K-E-S-H-I-M-A-N-A? 
A.	I have never met a person by the name of Leonard Mukeshimana.  However, I do remember that that gentleman was a prosecutor in 1995 in Gisenyi; however, he never interviewed me and he never asked me any questions. 
Q.	Are you sure? 
A.	Indeed, Counsel, I am sure.  I know the people who interviewed me in 1995.  I was interviewed by a criminal investigations police officer, Bumburunaniye.  It is not Mr. Mukeshimana, Leonard. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness please be shown number 3 in my list of exhibits? 
 
Mr. President, I don't know if you are inclined to take five minutes earlier, but this process of going through the statement will take quite some time.  I'm happy to go right up to 5:30, but if you are willing to take the break now it might be a more natural break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we can take the adjournment now.

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If can I make an enquiry on scheduling before we actually break, and I make this enquiry simply because I'm trying to plan for tomorrow, but I have gotten some informal indication that the procedures that are expected to take place in the Seromba trial will extend into Wednesday.  And I'm wondering if this Trial Chamber has gotten any further indications along that line.  And perhaps we can resolve, as of now, how long things may take. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have received no such information.  And we are scheduling to sit on Wednesday. 
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we take the adjournment now.  As I had indicated earlier today, there are -- there is another activity occupying our Chamber tomorrow.  So we cannot sit tomorrow, but our hearing will resume on Wednesday.  I remind you that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during this or any other adjournment.

We adjourn now.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
(Court adjourned at 1725H)
