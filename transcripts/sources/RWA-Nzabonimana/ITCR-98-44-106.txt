P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  I suppose I should begin by saying, welcome to the status conference.  I have been -- my name is Dennis Byron, Judge Dennis Byron, and I joined the Tribunal in June of this year.  And on the 1st of November I was assigned as the presiding judge for the Karemera trial. 

I think it would be, I suppose -- the first order of business is to get to know who are the counsel in the trial.  And I would like, first of all, to invite you to introduce yourselves to me, starting with the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Good morning, Judge.  We take great pleasure in continuing this trial with you, so we welcome you.  

My name is Don Webster, the senior trial attorney for this team, originally from the US by way of Jamaica.  I have been with the Office of the Prosecution for the last six years, five of those years I've spent in Kigali.  I have been here in Arusha for the past year, and I have been associated with this trial for the past year and a half or so.  

The Prosecution team also includes Holo Makwaia; she is from Tanzania.  She -- (microphone not activated).  The team includes Dior Fall; she is legal advisor, trial attorney as well.  She is originally from Senegal.  She was the procureur de la republique in Senegal.  We have Gregory Lombardi, who is the assistant trial attorney.  He is from the United States.  He has been with the Office of the Prosecutor for the past year. 

On the second row we have Mr. Bongani Dyani, who is from South Africa.  He is a former prosecutor from South Africa.  He has been with this team and with the Office of the Prosecutor for the past year.  We have our associate legal officers.  They are Tamara Cummings-John; she is originally from Sierra Leone.  She has been with this office for at least two years now and has been associated with this trial team for the last year.  We also have Ms. Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh; she is also from Sierra Leone.  She has been associated with this trial team for the past year.  And Mr. Takeh Sendze, who is from Cameroon.  She is our most recent recruit on the trial team.  He has been with us for the past month or so.  In court as well, there are three legal interns who have been assisting us for the past several weeks.  

And collectively, we comprise the team for this case.  And once again, we thank you for making this opportunity available to us, and we welcome you to the trial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
On the Defence team?
MR. ROACH: 
	Good morning, sir.  My name is Charles Roach, R-O-A-C-H.  I am the lead Defence counsel for the client who is beside me here, Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Sir, before I introduce the other members of the team, I should just tell you that I am from Toronto Canada.  I am a member of the Ontario bar.  I am originally from TNT.  Not too many people know what TNT is; they think it is dynamite, but it is Trinidad and Tobago.  And I have had the pleasure of serving at this Tribunal for the last six years.  

And I have with me a number of able people, including from Paris, a member of the Parisian bar,     Mr. Frederic Weyl, who is here, W-E-Y-L.  I also have with me two other members of our team; and one is Mr. Cheickh Bangoura.  Dr. Bangoura is a legal assistant, and he is from the Guinea bar.  And we have, as this seems to be an open session so far, which we welcome, we always welcome open sessions, we have Phil Taylor, one of our investigators who is here with us.  

Just before I sit down I want to congratulate you on your appointment here, and say that we are very hopeful that things will work out very well.  

Now, I have to tell you that there is -- my client is thinking of a reconfiguration of his Defence team.  And we will be in a better position to tell you more about that later on.  I have not had a chance to speak to him as yet; but he has indicated to me that he has been thinking about making a change in his Defence team, and as such, we are a little bit not sure about how we will be proceeding, but I'm quite sure that this will cause no delay. 

I also would like to say with respect to most of the matters this morning, my colleague Mr. Weyl will be speaking to them.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Roach. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President.  My name is Dior Diagne from the Dakar bar.  I am lead counsel for   Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I work with Mr. Felix Sow from the Senegal bar, and it is my pleasure to have him as my co-counsel on this case.  We also have two legal assistants with us on our team, but they are not here today.  I shall have an opportunity later to introduce you to them.  We also have an investigator on our team.  

On behalf of my client, I welcome you and congratulate you on your appointment.  Thank you,         Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Diagne.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Good morning, Mr. President.  I'm Peter Robinson from Santa Rosa, California.  I won't congratulate you on your appointment.  I think maybe condolences might be more in order, but I will offer you a very warm welcome to the case.  

With me is my client, Joseph Nzirorera.  I have been on the case for two and a half years.  He has been in jail for six and a half years.  And we are happy to have a fresh start to the trial.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Robinson.
MR. HOOPER: 
	Good morning, Judge. May we convey our congratulations to you on your appointment, and we know that it is just one of many high offices that you have served in, in a very impressive legal career.  

My name is David Hooper.  I am of the English and Welsh bar, practicing in London.  I have been here since the outset of this case in 1999.  I am assisted by my co-counsel, Andreas O'Shea, who is here today.  He is also counsel from the English and Welsh bar, for several years has been working and living in the Republic of South Africa and holds the office there of professor of international law at the University of KwaZula-Natal.  He has been the author of various publications, the latest being O'Shea on Amnesty, which I believe signed copies can be obtained on request.  

We also have somewhere between Paris and here, Seynabou Benga, of origin Senegalese, as she is very proud to say, of nationality Français.  She, I hope, can join us by Friday.  There was difficulty in obtaining authority for the team to come here.  And the result is that we have arrived in rather a staggered way, and we are not all quite here yet.  Between us, I hope we can be of the fullest service and assistance to you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I must appreciate this very full introduction, and it allows me to put faces to the names that I have been reading about. 

Mr. O'Donnell. 

Yes, it is likely that the chamber team may be known to you, except for one or two new additions to it, but I think it might be appropriate at this time to invite for Mr. O'Donnell to arrange for introduction of the chamber team. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
Well, thank you, Your Honour.  My name is Everard O'Donnell, and I think I am familiar to most of the people in this room.   I am of the United Kingdom bar, but now I am a grey, invisible man behind the scenes, which is a very pleasant place to be.  I would like to invite each of the team from chamber to just introduce themselves briefly.  This will assist members of the two teams in knowing who to approach in the corridors or who to reproach.  Let's start with Mathias.
MR. REUSS:
My name is Mathias Reuss.  I am originally from Germany and associate legal officer in chamber.
MS. DENIS:
Good morning, I am Catherine Denis.  I'm a coordinator in the Karemera trial, and I am from Belgium. 
MR. ADJOVI:
I'm Roland Adjovi.  I know most of the people here.  I am also a legal officer on this team. 
MR. O'DONNELL:
And I think while we are at it, Your Honour, perhaps the registry team would individually like to say who they are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MR. FRY:
Good morning.  My name is Christopher Fry and I am a courtroom officer in the case.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
My name is Constant Hometowu.  I come from the Republic of Ghana.  I am the coordinator for Trial Chamber III.  Thank you.  
MS N'GUM:
My name is Aminatta N'gum and I am the deputy chief and the officer in charge of the Defence counsel in detention management section at the moment.  Thank you.  
MR. JUMA:
I am Ramadhani Juma.  I'm from Zanzibar.  I am courtroom assistant for Trial Chamber III.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you very much.  And I suppose we should recognise our translators in the translation booth, and the court reporting team.  Thank you. 

As you know, the full Trial Chamber has not yet been appointed.  I have been appointed as Presiding Judge, and I anticipate that in the near future we will have a full Trial Chamber team, but it was important, I thought, for us to try to define operating methods which will assist in efficient and effective work together, and also guarantee a fair trial. 

And the first issue really was to deal with the Article 20 obligation of trying to minimise delay.  So, it was important that we -- I thought that we should start without necessarily waiting for the appointment of the full Chamber.  

We have worked out a programme which was designed after consultation with all legal teams, and we think that we have prepared an arrangement which has taken into account all issues that have been raised.  We thought that we would have our first session today with the going through the agenda that has been circulated.  And over the next week it might be -- we thought it would be useful to have a few working sessions where the detailed problems which have been identified could be more thoroughly analysed, discussed and possibly solved.  And we would have the final session next week, Wednesday, at which time any orders or decisions that need to be taken or made could be done.

Hopefully, at the end of this week of working together we would be in a position to have established an appropriate method of operating for the rest of the trial.  And, hopefully, we may even be able to develop some scheduling plans as well. 

Now, before we actually got down to --  get down to the detailed management of the agenda, I was informed just before we started that some counsel had not had an opportunity for consulting with their clients, and may require some time.  Is that so?
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Yes, Mr. President.  I think we may be able to hit on some of the items on the agenda, but we arrived, unfortunately, in the period of a holiday so we were unable to see our clients until just before court this morning.  And as a result also of the holiday, none of the filings that were made by the Prosecutor, the motion for severance, the disclosure index, have been received by our client.  And we haven't had an opportunity to discuss any of those things with them.  So we are limited on some subjects on your agenda, and I leave it to you to manage that, but I think we are handicapped of discussing any substantive issues relating to disclosure or the severance until we've had more full opportunity to discuss those with our clients.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see you subscribe to the philosophy of pro-active judging because you are inviting me to make a ruling without having made any application.  So I'm not really sure what you want.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Well, I was trying to not inconvenience you.  I know you were prepared to go -- proceed at 9 o'clock, but what I would really prefer is to have some time to discuss these things with Mr. Nzirorera.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would a half of an hour --
MR. ROBINSON:
Two hours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, two hours.
MR. ROBINSON: 
	Well, we need -- basically, I was going to sit with my computer and show him the electronic version of all of those things that were filed on Friday.  And some -- the disclosure was for 67 pages in and of itself.  I don't have to go over in excruciating detail with him, but I think it will take a little bit of time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does anybody --  what we are thinking -- what I am thinking of doing is resuming at 11 o'clock, that may still give us an opportunity to complete our session by the time we break at 1:00.  Unless there are any other comments, we can then take -- yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER: 
	Just two things I omitted to say when I was on my feet earlier.   Your Honour may have noticed, I'm sure has noticed, that the Accused that I represent, Dr. André Rwamakuba, is not here today.  And, indeed, for a large part of the proceedings hitherto he has voluntarily absented himself.  At the outset he did attend hearings, but that has been his habit during the course of the previous hearings we had here, the trial hearings.  I mentioned that.  

I was able to see him yesterday.  I was able to do that because I didn't seek permission to go to the prison, so it wasn't refused; I went there and they let me in, so I was able to talk to him.  He is not here today and what I intend to say was that through me, he conveys his congratulations to you also. 

The only other matter is that I received a Prosecution motion for severance on Monday, that is when I first was aware of it and saw it.  I have submitted a written motion, two pages, this morning, asking for us to have further time, if further time is necessary, without going into the argument about effective dates and things, asking, indeed, for time to respond to that no later than Tuesday of next week, that is before the status conference on Wednesday of next week.  

I have got a hard copy here, and I have a copy I can let Mr. Webster have.  And when we rise I will provide through your clerk a copy for you.  I know that court administration --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, if you may permit me. 
MR. HOOPER:
Certainly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will notice that there is an agenda item for today's meeting discussing the indictment, and that may be an appropriate time to discuss those details.

MR. HOOPER: 
	Certainly.  In the meantime, I will try to get that document to you so the time is not lost in the meantime. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we can now rise until 11:00  a.m.  Thank you very much.
	(Court recessed at 0938H)
(Pages 1 to 7 by Donna M. Lewis)   



























	(Court resumed at 1110H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Welcome back to the status conference.  Were the conferences concluded? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.  We were able to completely go through the material and we are ready to proceed.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now, I think an agenda has been circulated.  Are there any comments?  Anybody have any issues which need to be added to the agenda?  Good.  Well, we can proceed on the agenda circulated.  I would like if possible, though, to just change the order of the agenda and start with the issue on indictment.  During the recess, we had the chance to study the application filed by the Accused Rwamakuba requesting an extension of time to respond to the Prosecution motion for severance.  It may be possible to address that issue at this stage.  

Mr. Webster, does the Prosecution have any position on this? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour.  I've read the submission from David Hooper, and it seems reasonable to me, if he can file his response by Tuesday and that's satisfactory to the Court, then it's also satisfactory to the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is an issue that I have, though, which was only subtly mentioned in Mr. Hooper's submissions.  What is the position with regard to the consequential adjustments to the indictment for the other accused persons? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We are currently working on a draft amendment for the other three accused persons.  It is not in its final form yet.  We will not be prepared to file it probably until sometime next week. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be too late, I think, because it would spoil the whole purpose of these sessions if it is not in a position for discussion during the working sessions and the indictment. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you get it done by Friday? 
MR. WEBSTER:
With all due respect, Your Honour, I don't think it's possible to finalise it by Friday.  Aside from actually doing the drafting, there is a very extensive procedure that is internal to the OTP that requires the participation from the chief of Prosecution and from the Prosecutor, himself, and I don't think in all seriousness that I could make an undertaking to have it by Friday.  I would like to further state, however, that with all due respect for the Court, we see the issue of severance and the issue of the consequential changes to the indictment of the other three Accused as completely separate issues.  In fact --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that the other three Accused have no say on the issue of severance?
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I do, Your Honour.  That's our position, that the only party that has an issue on the severance is Rwamakuba.  He is the only one that has standing to contest the severance.  So our submission is really directed to him.  It's filed as a courtesy with the other three Accused, and our position is that this Court is in a position to decide the severance issue without seeing any proposed changes to the indictment against the remaining three Accused.  In fact, this Court could move for the severance and leave the indictment against the four exactly the way it is.  Severing Rwamakuba does not require the Prosecutor to amend the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if that is the case, why can't you file the new indictment by Friday? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We can leave the indictment in exactly the same form and then make a further motion to amend at a later time, but we are not in a position to change --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you need a motion to amend?  If your position is that the severance of Rwamakuba does not require major adjustments to the other indictment, why do you need that time? 
MR. WEBSTER:
We don't need a motion to amend; we don't need an amendment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you need time?
MR. WEBSTER:
Why do we need time?  Because we'd like to make changes, further changes, to the instrument.  There is already a motion to amend that's pending; that was the subject of responses from the Defence, I believe --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that's been in existence for quite a long time.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that has not been -

MR. WEBSTER:
 It has not been decided or --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And before that decision, you want to make further amendments? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The amendments that we have in mind are not to add new charges to the indictment; they are simply to streamline the proceedings, to re-examine one or two of the counts.  Much of what has to be done is going to be the result of missions that were undertaken in Kigali last week.  We still do not have the complete results of those missions.  So there are things that we would like to consider, and rather than finding ourselves in a position where we submit one amendment and then two or three weeks from now request further changes, we would like to do it in one fell swoop.  So in the interests of having a very clear position on all of the issues that arise from the indictment, we are requesting, or we would prefer to take a bit more time in crafting the amendment that we submit.  It's two separate issues, as we see it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I don't -- the -- you cannot have a trial without an indictment.  So the first issue is establishing the existence of an acceptable indictment.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is the condition precedent to commencement.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's understood, Your Honour.  And our position is that the indictment of the 18th of February 2004 is the indictment that is currently valid and that guides this trial.  Our amendment -- excuse me, our motion that was filed last Friday was to sever Rwamakuba from that indictment and to file a separate indictment against him.  That does not invalidate the indictment of the 18th of February against the other three Accused.  That indictment is still in place.  We do have plans and we envisage filing an amendment to that instrument against the other three remaining Accused, but we are not required to do so.  It's completely discretionary with us, and it's discretionary with the Court whether it grants that amendment or not.  We are not required to amend that indictment in order to proceed against the other three accused in a separate trial.  There have been many cases before this Tribunal -- in fact, this case itself started out as an indictment against eight persons.  Three of those persons were never arrested.  We severed those three persons from the original indictment against eight without changing that indictment.  It went forward as the indictment of the 21st of November 2003, and that's the indictment that we started this trial with.  And originally, that same text was originally -- was the indictment against seven persons altogether.  So there is no requirement -- there is no legal requirement that simply severing -- that a severance for a failure to produce persons that were originally accused requires to us amend.  So the amendment is completely discretionary.  It's discretionary with the Office of the Prosecutor and it's discretionary with this Court, if it sees fit to grant it.  As we speak, what is before this Court is the indictment of the 18th of February 2004 which we claim or would submit is the legally valid instrument that's before this Court and our motion to sever Rwamakuba from that indictment and to file a separate indictment against him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the documents leading up to the status conference, every Defence team has raised a legal issue with regard to the indictment of the 18th of February.  So, by making that assertion, you indicate that there is a controversial issue which requires adjudication.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that's your -- and you intend to insist on that position? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think that we have any choice in the matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I had assumed that if you were filing applications for amendment, that that creates a new scenario which avoids that controversy.  It makes the controversy completely unnecessary. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't believe so, Your Honour, because the amendment itself -- the Court would be forced to consider the amendment in relation to the document that it is amending, and if this Court is going to consider the indictment of the 21st of November 2003 as the valid instrument, then its consideration of the amendment is going to have to be so much more extensive, and it's going to open the door to a volley of preliminary motions on any decision that this Court would make to grant the amendment because we would be back to square one; whereas, if this Court finds that the amendment of the 18th of February is the valid instrument that's currently in place, then the changes that are suggested by the Prosecutor will not occasion new charges.  They will not be new allegations.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that's not the only issue that affects exercise of discretion at this time.
MR. WEBSTER:
Right.  I'm not suggesting --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I mean this is 2004 -- this is the end of 2004 -- that we are talking about, so that is a factor which affects the exercise of discretion.  This trial has been in suspension since May.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.

MR. PRESIDENT:
And this is the end of November.  And it's shocking to me that these issues arise at this stage. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the wheels of justice turn slowly.  That's all I can -- that's the best response that I have to that.  This -- we are not in a position -- well, let me put it this way:  We are starting this trial from ground zero now.  That is news to the Prosecutor.  We had argued all along that the trial could continue from the point at which Judge Vaz withdrew.  The Appeals Chamber found otherwise.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Assuming that to be the position, you should have been in a position to start the hearing.
MR. WEBSTER:
To start? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The hearing. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Which hearing? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do we need these extensive adjustments to the indictment?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm not suggesting that they are extensive.  In fact, I'm suggesting that they are minor, which is why we would like to give them some due deliberation.  I think that if we amend or if the amendment is successful, it will not occasion new charges against the defendants, the Accused, it will not occasion a new series of preliminary motions.  There are minor changes.  In fact, they are along the same lines that were suggested in our motion of the 24th of September.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you think it is fair to the parties in this trial to have this adjudicated in a piecemeal fashion?  Wouldn't it be fairer to have considered the entire issue at the same time, fairer to all parties?
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think so, Your Honour.  With all due respect, I don't think it would have been fairer.  I think the fair approach is to look at the issue of severance first and if the Court --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But sever from what, from whom? 
MR. WEBSTER:
There are four persons, four Accused, before this Court at this time.  Whether the indictment of the 21st of November 2003 is the valid instrument or the indictment of the 18th of February 2004 is the valid instrument, there are still four parties before this Court in one joint indictment.  Our application is to sever Rwamakuba from that indictment.  It has nothing to do with amending the indictment for that preliminary question.  The question is severance. 
Once the issue of severance is decided, then we go on to the issue of indictment, of filing a separate indictment against Rwamakuba and introducing an amended indictment against the remaining three Accused.  From our perspective, they are discrete issues, and if we deal with them incrementally, that's the most effective and efficacious manner of proceeding. 

From our perspective, it is not fair to a determination of the issue to combine all of these matters into one pot to consider the brew.  The preliminary issue is that of severance and a separate trial.  That is an issue between the Prosecutor and André Rwamakuba and this Court.  It doesn't concern the other three Accused.  Once that issue is determined, we move on to the secondary and tertiary issues. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Yes, are there any other views on this?
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, thank you.  I'd just like to draw Your Honour's attention with regard to the point made by Mr. Webster that the issue of severance of Dr. Rwamakuba does not affect the other three accused.  I would just like to quickly draw your attention, Your Honour's attention, to the authority of Prosecutor and Kunarac and Kovac which of course is an ICTY decision, a decision on the joinder of trials of 9th of February 2000, where the Court indicates that "the applicants' right to a trial without undue delay under Article 21(4)(C) of the Statute has to be assessed in the light of the same rights of the others."  And I say that -- I draw Your Honour's attention to that decision because, in this particular case, the Prosecution are not, in their severance motion, relying upon conflict of interest but on interests of justice, in particular, the question of undue delay.  So, obviously, that does affect the other Accused. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm not going to address the question of severance.  I think that can be addressed later by us, but I do want to go to what I consider the core issue which we are kind of slopping over into number 4 on your agenda, and that is the status of the decisions made by the Trial Chamber, and in particular the decision of the February 18th indictment.  And I think this is a core issue that has to be decided to have any of our session, working sessions, this week be meaningful.  Because it's our position, as you know, that the decisions of the Trial Chamber were tainted by the appearance of bias which has now been found to have existed by the Appeals Chamber, and that includes the decision to amend the indictment.  And I believe that our -- I won't argue that point at length right now, but I think that our interpretation is the only reasonable interpretation that can be given effect.  The Appeals Chamber didn't order new testimony.  They ordered a new trial with all of the decisions to be -- that are made at a trial and regarding a trial to begin afresh.  But the reason that it is significant is because if -- it really comes down to a question of how we proceed once the new indictment is presented and if it's approved.  If our starting point is the February 18th 2004 indictment approved by the Trial Chamber, then it may very well be that amendments being proposed to that indictment do not constitute new charges and, therefore, there is no opportunity to make preliminary motions.  On the other hand, if the motion -- if the indictment of November is given effect, and not the Trial Chamber's decision, then we are entitled to an initial appearance and to make preliminary motions.  And all of those things will decide how we proceed.  So I believe that that's a fundamental issue that needs to be resolved very soon in our work this week.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thank you.  I wish to associate myself with what has been said by my colleague Robinson, but I also wish to add how I do agree with your indications, according to which what needs to be done first of all is to determine what indictment we are going to be dealing with.  An answer to that question would already provide us with an answer to the question of the fate of decisions made during the previous attempts at trial, because the outcome of those decisions would dictate on what indictment we use.  The Prosecutor indicated that he does not yet know what indictment he will base his allegations on because there has been a mission in Kigali a few days ago in Kigali.  We are disturbed by those statements because the trial ought to begin tomorrow, whereas the Accused have been here since 1998.  We cannot allow the Prosecutor to determine how allegations can be added to the indictment as and when the Prosecution's investigations proceed in Rwanda.  If we were to go that route, there will always be discussions tomorrow, in one year's time, in two years' time, regarding what the allegations are.  We cannot allow this to continue. 

And I wish to associate myself with your desire, Mr. President, to have, first and foremost, an indictment.  We need to determine which indictment we are going to be dealing with, and then we can organise our activities subsequent to that.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, by your leave, I wish to support the Defence colleagues regarding the indictment.  We need to agree on our methodology, and you have indicated that.  This will enable us to have a fair trial.  You have also stated quite clearly that we need an indictment, but which are we going to choose?  In that regard, there seems to be a fundamental divergency, and we need to determine which way forward, because when we say that severance has nothing to do with the indictment per se, this means that if we accept that as a given, we are already going to be agreeing with accepting the indictment of the 18th February.  We wish to say that this is not possible. 

There is a decision which has been rendered for a trial de novo, and I think you need to stress on methodology.  Up until today, we have not received a French version of the Appeals Chamber's decision, and this places us in a situation where we cannot appropriately determine what -- which way forward the Chamber needs to go.  Now, if we were to have a copy of that decision, I believe that when it is said that a trial is started de novo, it starts from square one, and this is what we need to insist on.  The problem remains we need to know which indictment we are going to be relying on.  And once again, it is up to the Prosecution to do its job properly.  The trial which has been dealt with by the Chamber's decision shows how far the Prosecution has failed in its duties.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd like to come back to this issue of the indictment because that seems to be the dividing line with the issues that we are trying to resolve now.  Yes, the Appeals Chamber decision of the 22nd of October 2004 found that an apprehension of bias attached to Judge Vaz and extended to the other two judges.  It does not necessarily follow that every decision made by the previous Trial Chamber is tainted with bias or tainted with an apprehension of bias, and it is my submission that this Court should look at each decision and the circumstances that gave rise to each decision and make a separate determination for which decisions stand and which decisions are questionable and which decisions must be put aside.  And if we start --
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask you a question, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many decisions were made by that Court? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I haven't counted them, Your Honour, but I would suggest --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I counted that 48 were made during the course of 2004 only.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you seriously suggesting that I should do that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I am, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Look at each decision? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we should look at least at several key decisions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's a waste of time.
MR. WEBSTER:
What is the Court's suggestion?  That all decision should simply be cast aside? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I don't say that either.  There are certain key issues.  The indictment is one issue.  It is quite possible for the approach to the indictment to make that consideration unnecessary for a fair number of decisions. 
MR. WEBSTER:
M'hm.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  I agree, and I'd like to address --
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's an approach that can remove the controversy on those issues.
MR. WEBSTER:
Right.  I'd like to address the approach with respect to the indictment, and if we start by going back to August of 2003, which is when the motion to amend was first submitted, up until August of 2003, the indictment that was in place was the indictment of 21 November 2001.  We filed a motion to amend.  On the 8th of October 2003, Trial Chamber III rejected that motion.  Judge Vaz participated in that decision.  Now, are we to say that that decision is thrown into doubt as well?  That's a decision where Judge Vaz ruled against the Prosecutor.  Our motion to amend was denied.  Following that decision on the 8th of October -- excuse me, the 8th of October 2003, the Prosecutor appealed that decision.  The Appeals Chamber came back on the 19th of December and ruled in favour of the Prosecutor and vacated that Trial Chamber III decision.  Subsequently, we refiled our amendment.  On the 13th of February, Trial Chamber III now granted the Prosecutor's application to amend.  Does the fact that Judge Vaz participated in that decision automatically throw -- cast doubt upon that decision?  Judge Vaz or Trial Chamber III in that instance were simply following the instructions of the Appeals Chamber.  Subsequent to filing that amendment on the 18th of February, the Appeals Chamber has rendered three decisions where it has considered the Trial Chamber decision of the 13th of February, and in all three decisions, the Appeals Chamber has found that there was no abuse of discretion, that there was no misapplication of the law.  In fact, if we direct our attention to the Appeals Chamber decision of the 27th of August 2004, it says quite clearly that the appellant -- in this case, it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse -- has shown no basis for concluding that the Trial Chamber misdirected itself as to the principles to be applied or as to the law which is relevant to the exercise of discretion or that it gave weight to extraneous or irrelevant considerations or that it failed to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations or that it made an error as to the facts upon which it exercised its discretion.  Now, in light of the history of that litigation over the amendment, it stands to reason that this Court should be able to look at the way the motions were introduced and how they were decided and the way that the Appeals Chamber intervened in that process and find that the indictment of the 18th of February is not tainted by bias, that it is, in fact, the indictment that should be considered the valid instrument that is currently guiding this trial. 

That is an issue that is subject to contradictory debate, and the simple assertion by the four Accused that they contest it does not mean that this Chamber must accept their submission.  It's a submission that the Trial Chamber must rule on, and that preliminary decision is what's going to guide any other decision or any other motion that we present to the Trial Chamber, including the motion for severance, and including the motion for further amendment. 

If we go back to the issue that Your Honour first posed, the issue of an amendment to the remaining indictment, this Court has the power right now to decide the severance issue and to decide the amendment issue as it is put forward in our motion of the 24th of September.  If this Court decides that motion and says no further amendments, then we are stuck with whatever the Court decides, and I would hope that that would be the indictment of the 18th of February 2004.  We are not required to file a further amendment.  There are enough motions before the Trial Chamber for this Trial Chamber to decide those outstanding motions and establish a schedule for trial. 

Now, we would prefer -- we would prefer -- to submit a motion for further amendment, but it's not required, and if this Court thinks that it's going to occasion undue delay, then it can decide all of the motions that are currently pending and establish a schedule for trial on that basis.  There is no ambiguity from this side of the room as to what indictment is guiding these procedures, and if there is ambiguity, then it is for this Trial Chamber to set us straight and to let all of the parties know what accusatory instrument is currently governing this trial, what accusatory instrument is keeping these four persons confined at UNDF, because something has to be in place.  If there was no indictment, these four persons could walk out of this courtroom today.  There is an indictment; there is a legal basis to refrain -- to curtail their liberty.  If there is doubt as to which one it is, it is for the Court to decide because the Prosecution and the Defence differ in their analysis of the law with respect to that question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I am taking the floor to request that you be wary, Mr. President, and I'm insisting on this, because there are statements being made by the Prosecution generally speaking.  I'd like to go back to the fate of the decisions thus far rendered.  A proposal is being made for a method to find a way out, and there has been the question of whether -- of the 48 motions decided on in the year 2004, would we need to look at them one by one to determine which we are going to keep and which we are going to set aside, in light of the Appeals Chamber decision of the 22nd October?  The Prosecutor -- I've already read one such statement in one of his motions -- is inviting you to keep decisions which were favourable to him, and I would like to say that there are many decisions among the 48 which were rendered this year which were confirmed or rather -- confirmed by the Appeals Chamber. 

Personally, my own invitation to you is that each time that we need to decide on the fate of these decisions, the Appeals Chamber was only recently seized of this issue concerning the bias affecting Judge Vaz and the two other judges who composed Trial Chamber III.  The Appeals Chamber accepted the Prosecutor's motion, and it was not aware of the issues which motivated the decisions which was taken on the 22nd of October.  All these decisions were, in the meantime, rendered before the 22nd of October, 2004, and they did not take into account the recent issue which led to the decision of the 22nd of October 2004; in other words, this appearance of partiality or bias which weighed heavily upon the three Judges.  So I don't see how today you're going to be having excuses given that there were decisions rendered by the Appeals Chamber, and that -- I would like to say that this issue which arose was well known, and therefore the Appeals Chamber rendered a decision on the 22nd of October.  This was because that issue had not been discovered earlier.  Had it been so, definitely that decision of 22nd October would have been taken earlier than that date of the 22nd October.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of issue, I would prefer that we had waited until we had that agenda item to discuss that aspect of it.  What I'm trying to do now is to complete the position with regard to the issue on the indictment.  And what I'm thinking is this:  The goal of our status hearings this week, I do not think, could be adequately achieved unless the Prosecution clarifies the situation as to the issue as to the indictment that we are considering.  Issues with regard to disclosure are also affected by the issue of the indictment. 

Now, it seems to me, from the comments made by learned Prosecutor counsel, Mr. Webster, is that there does not -- there is not much difficulty in identifying the indictment on which he is proposing to prosecute the trial.  I would think that everybody's tasks would be facilitated if, by Friday, he were in a position to clarify that position.  You see, if that were possible, it would enable all parties to reply by Wednesday, the 24th, Wednesday of next week, and I could adjust our subsequent sessions to allow the working session on the indictment to take place on Thursday, 25th, Thursday of next week, and we could perhaps then have the second status conference on next week Friday.  It would give us a real chance to have settled an issue which is -- I consider to be the most important issue in proceeding with the trial.  So if -- yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I was just trying to respond to your comments. 

Your Honour, the issue can be resolved quite swiftly.  If you order us to file and indicate to the Court what indictment we plan to proceed on by Friday, it will be done by Friday.  It's really that simple.  We would prefer to take more time.  If it is the position of the Court that no additional time is appropriate, simply order us to do it and it will be done.  If we get to Friday and we have not made the changes that we would like to make, we will file what we have, and that will be the indictment of the 18th of February, as reflected in our motion of the 24th of November.  There are minor changes that were introduced.  They were more in the nature of spelling and grammar and one or two minor points where we expanded the window of dates for specific allegations, but if we get to Friday and that's all we have, then that's what we will file.  And if that's what's required to move this case ahead, then so be it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think that would be a great help, because it would make the rest of the session, these two weeks, much more meaningful, and it may very well be -- I have looked at these documents myself, and it may very well be that the issues may not be as controversial as they appear on the surface. 

But in that case, I will give my first decision in this matter, and it's really a decision, oral decision, on the motion by the Accused Rwamakuba requesting an extension of time to respond to the Prosecution motion for severance of Mr. Rwamakuba from the indictment and a separate trial. 

I think in the interests of a fair trial and in the interests of justice, it's reasonable to put all Defence teams in a position where they can indicate at the same time their position on the severance issue and on consequential amendments to the indictment concerning the other accused persons.  I have heard representations from all counsel, and I would order the Prosecution to file the consequential amended version of the indictment for the other three Accused -- Karemera, Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse -- no later than Friday, 19th November 2004.  I would like to remind all parties of their obligation to file a reply no later than five days from the date on which the motion is received, and that would, by my calculation, be Wednesday, the 24th.  And I would suggest that the working session for the indictment, devoted to indictment issues, take place on Thursday, 25th November, and I would also like to change the date of the second status conference from Wednesday to Friday, the 26th of November 2004.  So we'll have the second status conference on Friday, the 26th November.  I would also like to instruct the registry to take all necessary measures for the implementation of this order. 

Mr. Prosecutor, you overheard the question? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I didn't.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was drawn to my attention that I should have invited you, if it was possible, to file also in French.
MR. WEBSTER:
I didn't hear the question, but I got up to respond to that issue because one thing I wanted to clarify or ask you to clarify for the registry is to make sure they have available translators and interpreters to assist us, because there is no way that we can file the documents in French.  We will file the documents in English, and it will be the responsibility of the registrar to provide translation or to translate those documents in a timely manner so that they arrive with counsel for Ngirumpatse and Karemera in French, but I didn't overhear the question, but that's what motivated my request to speak.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

I recognise Ms. Diagne.  You were trying to say something a while ago?  Were you trying to address me some time ago? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Indeed, Mr. President.  I must acknowledge that you taught me to wait just a few moments before I spoke.  We just wanted to say that in our Defence team, we never received the documents in a timely fashion so that we may reply to them, and so it is difficult for us to reply within sufficient time as the Court wishes, but, Mr. President, seriously, since we are beginning today for the first time with you, we would like to tell you that for one year we have been running after French versions of decisions that have been rendered and which regard us, and we must tell you that there are still decisions to this day that we have not received in French, even though the old trial has come to a halt.  We still do not have some decisions in French.  So I should like to draw your attention to the fact that we should start on a new footing and we should, from today, deal with this issue as it seriously affects the Karemera team.  We suffer dearly from this issue.  Mr. Karemera has had to deal with this prejudice for one year, and we would simply like to draw your attention to this very serious issue, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  I subscribe to my colleague's submissions, and I should like to add one more thing.  During the previous trial, we had difficulty deciding when the time limit started running because, according to the Prosecution, when he filed the document, we were supposed to start from that time, and so the time limit started from the time the document itself was filed.  However, there is always delay in transmission, from the time the document is filed with registry and the time it is disclosed to us.  We can only truly work on that document from the time that it is put before us.  So if the Prosecutor is to file on Friday and we are only given the French version on Sunday or Monday, we will have very little time to work on the document, especially since, on Saturday and Sunday, it is difficult for us to go to UNDF to discuss with our clients.  So if the document is filed on the 19th and we have to file a response by the 24th, we will only really have three days to work on that, and that is if we get the document in French on Monday.  I simply wanted to draw your attention to this issue.  It does arise very often, and for me, the time limit can only run from the time that myself and the Accused and lead counsel have the documents before us in our hands.  Most obliged, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if we may have just one point of clarification.  On Friday, what is expected from the Office of the Prosecutor is a proposed amendment to the indictment against the three remaining Accused.  The responses from the Defence will go to the motion for severance against Rwamakuba.  Is the Court also expecting a motion to motivate the amended indictment against the three remaining Accused?  How many motions are expected on Friday, and what responses are expected from the Defence? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are different levels of expectation, Mr. Webster.  The ideal situation would be to put us in a position where the -- all issues relating to the indictment can be clarified during these working sessions that we had scheduled.  That is, in fact, a major outcome that I had anticipated from this week's working session.  I would have hoped that at the end of the day, we would have been able to identify what issues remained to be, well, controversial, and to have made decisions resolving all the non-controversial issues, and then set a timetable for dispute resolution on the matters which remain controversial.  So I would have expected that at the end of this week we would at least have reached the stage of identification of what were the issues that required adjudication; at least that.  So if you were in a position to file a motion for amendment, it would facilitate that process. 

With regard to the translation issues, we had expected to have that discussed under the heading of "Disclosure," because we would like, as far as possible, to remove the issue of translation as a cause for delay in the trial process.  What we will try to do with regard to this particular document being filed by the Defence -- by the Prosecution, is that we will try to -- my Chamber team has already commenced discussions with the registry officials, and they are trying to determine the most appropriate method of assisting in ensuring that there is a French translation on Friday.  So I anticipate that during the course of today, some decisions on the methodology would be made to achieve that objective.  Well, now, have we clarified the issue of the indictment?  Is the position sufficiently clear for us to move on to the next agenda item, because I would imagine that all other detail matters can be discussed initially in the working session scheduled for next week Thursday.  

Mr. Webster?

	1200H
MR. WEBSTER:
Your instructions are clear, Your Honour, that we are to file the indictment, the amended indictment, the motions to motivate it so that all the issues are before the Court or with the parties by Friday, the -- I guess it's the 19th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
Now to the extent that -- yes, that much is clear.  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other outstanding issues on the indictment, on the Defence side? 

Mr. Webster, it has been drawn to my attention that I might order what time on the day on Friday you might file it.
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think that's appropriate for the Court to order, Your Honour.  I think we have rules of procedure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But there is a problem here because it is a question of working in tandem with the registry, who are -- will be expected to produce a translation by Friday, as well.  Because my calculations would not work adequately if the translations were delivered on Monday.  So I wanted to ensure that there was some interaction with the relevant officials which would permit the translation during the day on Friday.  That is the object of my comment.
MR. WEBSTER:
And what is the Court's suggestion? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  At this stage, I would -- once the principle is accepted, I would ask my trial coordinator to work with you and the registry and work something out, if that's agreeable to you.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, okay. 

We are going to move on to the next agenda item, which is designated "Counsel assignment and fees issues."  This agenda item was in response to representations made by certain of the Defence teams and I would like, first of all, to invite Mr. Robinson to put his position forward. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I think the inclusion of this item on the agenda has already had some effect in having the registry attempt to resolve these issues with me, and I hope that during the course of this week they can be resolved.  But my motivation in bringing this to your attention now, even though it's not ripe for any decision by the Trial Chamber, is that if the situation were to continue as it exists now, I would have to resign from representing Mr. Nzirorera at some point during these proceedings, for financial reasons, because I simply couldn't afford to support my family and to work here under these conditions at the same time.  And so I thought that I was obligated to bring this up now before the trial commences so that if there is going to be a change in counsel for Mr. Nzirorera, it can be done without as much disruption as it would cause were I to resign in the middle of the trial.  

Essentially, the problem, Your Honour, is that the registry makes cuts in my bills, and the basis of those cuts vary but the assumption is either that I'm lying to them about the time I spend or I'm foolishly spending time on things that don't need to be spent.  Under either of those scenarios, if that's the position of the registry, I don't think that they should have me as a lawyer in this Tribunal if they don't have the trust in me that I am correctly billing for the time that I'm spending and that the time I'm spending is necessary for Mr. Nzirorera's defence.  And so I think that there has to be a resolution:  They're either going to have to trust me that I'm doing a professional and competent job and pay me for the work that I do, or we should part ways and someone else who is willing to work under conditions like that is brought in to represent Mr. Nzirorera.  

What I'd like to do is have you schedule this for some later time during the week, and in the meantime, allow me to meet with the Deputy Registrar and the people from DCMS to see whether these concerns can be solved informally.   

I have a pending appeal with the Registrar that I filed in September.  I sent a letter on October 14th, asking them to acknowledge that they have received it, because the last time I appealed, they lost it for two months.  They have never responded to that letter.  And I sent another letter on the 5th of November, asking them to acknowledge, and I've never received a response to that letter.  So I hope that your including this on the agenda will motivate some response from the registry, and I would like to have this put back to report to you at a later time.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I suggest that you report to the trial coordinator, Miss Denis, because if the matter is resolved, then it would not be necessary to put it on the agenda.  If it's not resolved, we can deal with it next week, Friday.  Yes.

Yes, Miss Diagne-Mbaye. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
I would like to associate myself with my learned colleague's comments and point out to you that we are at a critical stage within our team, to the point where we have one member of our team who has informed us that he must withdraw from the team.  We are discussing with him how it will be possible to retain him on the team, but there doesn't seem to be any way out. 

This, of course, will lead to some problems at this stage of the process.  He arrived in this situation, and I should request that another -- that the Court make a ruling such that no other members of our team have to go to such extremes, and so I would like to subscribe to Mr. Robinson's comments and point out that there is indeed a problem of payments for our fees and even payments for our trips to have to meet witnesses, our trips here to Arusha.  I could take up an entire half day if I should have to list out all the problems that we have to confront.  That is not necessary, of course, but I will take advantage of this opportunity of being in Arusha to contact the Registry and speak on an informal level with them about these issues.  But you, as presiding Judge of this Chamber, must be informed of these issues, and I simply wanted to point this out by taking the floor.  

Thank you Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Miss Diagne-Mbaye.  We have taken the advantage of the issues raised to conduct certain inquiries with the Registry, and, in fact, a representative of the Deputy Registrar came here to answer any inquiries which might be raised.  We would like to rely on the assurances given by the Deputy Registrar of his willingness to resolve the issues which have existed.  

He has also commented that some of the problems have resulted from their effort to apply the Rules as they understand them, and so it may very well be that some consultation with the Deputy Registrar may remove some of the controversies which currently exist.  So it might be useful, during the course of this week, to indulge in conversations of that nature, and if the problem remains unresolved, then you can communicate with our trial coordinator on this issue.  Thank you. 

We had an inquiry from Mr. Weyl, Mr. Frederic Weyl, on the issue of investigators joining the trial team.  Yes. 
MR. WEYL:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I thought that we were going to deal with this under item 8, "Any other matter."  Indeed, this is an issue we are dealing with.  May we have with us investigators at trial, one or two investigators, according to the needs?  We have been systematically refused this possibility previously, and we would simply ask that we don't have the same difficulties when we begin trial again.  

We need assistants, just as the Prosecutor is assisted on a permanent basis by investigators and other assistants.  We need our assistants, our investigators, to verify issues raised by witnesses during trial, for example, and we cannot be deprived of the assistance of an investigator during trial, as has been the case previously. 

We simply wanted to raise this issue right now so that we can prevent any difficulties before we move to trial.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the DCMS representative wish to say anything on this? 
MS. N'GUM:
Yes, Your Honour.  We could say that it is the policy of the registry not to allow the investigators to appear during the trial phase, especially during the Prosecution case, because the funding is just not available to accommodate everybody.  And on top of that, the investigators' job description does not include appearance in court.  And it is our submission, Your Lordship, that the investigators should be in the field doing investigations, and if counsel feel that they should do any investigations relating to a particular witness, the investigator can do that from his or her jurisdiction, but not in Arusha.  

It has been the same with the other joinder trials and the other single-case trials; investigators have not been allowed to come to Arusha.  It is just that the legal aid funding that we are using is not 
open-ended, and we are not able to accommodate investigators in Arusha with the funding costs that are to be incurred in that case.  

So in that case, Your Lordship, it is our submission that, as has happened in the other Defence teams, only the lead and co-counsel and the legal assistant, one of the legal assistants, will be authorised to come to Arusha.  Thank you, Your Lordship.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does that answer your query, Mr. Weyl? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, this is a negative answer, and I would ask you to arbitrate on this difficulty because it's obvious that if the registrar has a policy which doesn't enable the Defence to work properly, that policy should be set aside.  We have, on a daily basis, difficulties which we have during sessions when we have documents in Kinyarwanda and we cannot translate them because I do not speak Kinyarwanda.  It is not a special requirement that we speak Kinyarwanda.  

We need this assistance, and in the case of the Prosecutor, this is available to them regularly.  We need to be able to deal with witness testimony.  We have documents which are presented in Kinyarwanda.  There are also statements made by witnesses in court in Kinyarwanda.  We need to have our investigators with us, at least one of them, in the court sessions.  And this is not because the policy is held by the registry that the Defence will not be allowed a fair trial.  We cannot be happy with that response.  We had wished that the response be in conformity with the Rules pertaining to a fair trial, that we be able to work with equality of arms and that we need to be assisted by at least one investigator in court sessions so that we can work properly and in equality of arms with regard to the Prosecutor, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, up to now, you have only identified one service that these investigators would provide in court, and that's translation.  That is the service which you don't require the investigators for. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it's not a matter of problems of translation.  There's also problems with answers, not on a -- but in real time.  We need to have verifications made from time to time, and this does occur during trial.  

I recall that there was disclosure by the Prosecutor of CD-ROMs and of videos of rallies, and we were, for two or three days, unable to do anything because we didn't have our investigator with us to help us in reading these documents and also to verify them. 

But insofar as the investigator is not with us, we cannot whistle him into court to help us when there's a problem of disclosure, for instance.  Experience teaches us that their presence is necessary on a day-to-day basis and that the way in which we are deprived of their services on a daily basis weakens us in our ability to carry out our work.  So we need them not only for translations but for verifications of investigations on the basis of developments occurring on a daily basis in court.  So if we don't have our investigators, we are falling short of meeting our requirements.  

We've lived with this for several months, and we do not wish to suffer the same problem in future because we wish to work efficiently, and we therefore require to have full capacity, including the availability of the investigator.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I would suggest that if you wish to advance this any further, you should take the trouble of actually defining the services that are required to be performed in court by the investigator. 

Now, the other issue to which reference was made this morning was made by Mr. Roach.  Are you in a position to comment further as yet? 

MR. ROACH:
No, I am not at this time in a position to take the matter any further, but that's just because I need quite a bit of time with our team to discuss the matter, and we will take a day or so before we can respond to the issue.  So that's our position at the present time.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it be reasonable, therefore, to programme an intermediate meeting on this, or do we refer it to the next status conference next Friday? 
MR. ROACH:
Now, it's difficult for me to judge that, but I would prefer if we leave it until next -- next week at least, sometime next week, because I'm sure, by Monday, things will be quite clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Robinson, we had an issue.  We notice that you are the only counsel, lead counsel, without a co-counsel, and we wondered whether or not the trial process would be facilitated if you had a 
co-counsel, and preferably a bilingual co-counsel.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I don't think it would facilitate the trial process at this time.  I think I am working well enough on my own, and I would note that I've saved the registry over $100,000 this year by not having a co-counsel.  

I had planned from the very beginning of the case to divide the responsibilities on my team between myself and a co-counsel in such a way that I was responsible for the cross-examination, which is something I have experience in, and a co-counsel which I would obtain from a civil law system, a French-speaking co-counsel would be responsible for the direct examination and the Defence case.  And it's been my thought to bring that co-counsel on board at some time during the Prosecution's case so that the person could familiarise himself with what needs to be done, with what witnesses need to be seen, statements taken from the witnesses, and then be prepared to present those witnesses in direct examination when our case is -- it was our turn to call witnesses.  And I don't think it's necessary for me at this time to spend the resources of the Tribunal to have a co-counsel right now. 

I also think that it would be difficult -- I find it very difficult to justify the expenditure of those funds when I'm not being paid properly, and I also don't want to subject a co-counsel to an uncertain situation, if that may arise, that the co-counsel would have to become the lead counsel.  So until that's resolved, I also think that --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour's microphone. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry that I allowed the invisible man to have a voice just now.  But a couple of serious issues are raised, Mr. Robinson.  One is just basic logistics, and the trial is going on for a long time:  illness, availability.  We wouldn't want the trial to grind to a standstill if you became physically inconvenienced for a couple of weeks, for example.  It's a simple issue.  But when we are doing a long trial, the trial itself has certain needs that ought to be satisfied. And one of the issues that I should like to, as far as advance planning can achieve it, to remove causes for delay.  And this is an issue. 

Another question is I don't know whether the issue of bilingualism has been a problem for you and your team, but we have noticed -- I've noticed that it's an issue and it already arose today.  We would like also to eliminate the issue of language, eliminate language as a cause for delay, and it was in that capacity that I was wondering whether or not your functioning at the trial would have been facilitated with a bilingual co-counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I understand, and I would just say that throughout the entire proceedings, I have not been sick for one day, and nor have I ever asked for an extension of time, despite all of the decisions being rendered in French by the Trial Chamber, and I've been able to work with my team.  

I've never raised language as an issue for any delay in all of the proceedings.  I've always worked with the French through my team, or my own very rudimentary French, that I can read basic French.  So I think that I'm equipped to continue in that way.  

I have to say, just to speak very frankly to you, that I'm concerned to bring on a co-counsel who doesn't know the case, who doesn't have the cross-examination skills, and put that person in a position and put Mr. Nzirorera in a position where, some day, that person might be asked to do the job that I'm supposed to be doing and that I'm much better equipped to do, knowing this case as well as I do after two and a half years.  

I mean, basically, I should be the one cross-examining the witness, and if I'm sick for a day or two, to bring in somebody who doesn't know how to cross-examine so well, who doesn't know the case so well, and accommodate the Court to -- for those two days would be a great disadvantage for 
Mr. Nzirorera.  And so I'm reluctant really to put someone in that role, frankly.  And so that's also a concern of mine. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
But do you think that's a good reason for not having a co-counsel? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think it's a good reason for Mr. Nzirorera's interest.  It may not be a good reason for the interests of the Trial Chamber, but I really think in the balance --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly, having no co-counsel -- if, in fact, it is a fact that you don't get sick, you see.  The point is that you'll always have the primary responsibility for the case.  And the trial is, I think, just too long for one person to manage on his own.  I don't know how long you have been here.  You have been in the trial about two years already.
MR. ROBINSON:
I've been in the case since April of 2002.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I don't know how much more time we have.
MR. ROBINSON:
It will be considerable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am just nervous about having a solitary -- I mean, is it fair to the trial process?  Is it fair to justice?  I'm not going to make an order today, but I would like you to know that the Chamber itself, the Judge, thinks that that's an issue which ought to be resolved, the issue of a co-counsel.  So I'll leave it as loose as that for the time being.
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, if I may go to the other issue which has already sparked some controversy this morning, and that's the issue of the status of previous decisions and pending motions.  

I think I have to ask the Prosecutor to start on that issue.  Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If you would just give me one moment, please.  

All right.  Your Honour, we did spend some time looking over the collection of decisions that had been made in this trial, going all the way back to the beginning of 19 -- excuse me, the beginning of 2003.  I didn't count them as the Court did, but we did break them down into, roughly, four or five categories.  And I think it would be fair to suggest that there are a number of decisions on the issue of cooperation, where Defence counsel, particularly Mr. Robinson, filed a number of motions requesting cooperation from various states.  
There are a number of decisions on disclosure.  Most of those, as well, have been filed by 
Mr. Robinson.  

	A number of decisions on disqualification.  Those, for the most part, are moot.  

A number of decisions on evidentiary issues, and I think the two most significant categories are those on disclosure and those on evidentiary rulings during the trial and decisions on witness management.  

If we just look at the disclosure issue, I think many of those issues will sort of fade into the background when we go over the disclosure.  Many of the requests that were made have been complied with.  Whether the Trial Chamber denied the Defence applications or granted them in the most -- quite often, they were denied, but the materials that the Defence requested were disclosed to them.  If they weren't disclosed when the decisions were rendered, they certainly have been disclosed by now, or they will be disclosed within the next few weeks.  

We've proposed, and I think I've mentioned this in my memo to the Court, an electronic disclosure suite whereby a number of documents that are in our database will be made available to the Defence.  So much of the materials the Defence has already requested, whether the Court has honoured their request or not, will be made available.  So we can go through those decisions one by one and see which ones still have any merit or still raise an issue of controversy that the Court has to decide, but when I went through them, I had the decided impression that all of those issues are going to fade in the background.  And that's just the issue of disclosure. 

The next issue, I think in order of importance, are the evidentiary rulings, and those too, for the most part, are going to be moot.  They're requests for permission to cross-examine, requests to exclude evidence, various requests that are going to be moot because we'll be hearing the testimony all over again.  And we would have to go through those item by item.  I have a list.  I think that it would be more appropriate to address those in a smaller working session, and if we could work that out with the Defence, perhaps with the assistance of the senior legal officer, then we could report back to the Court on Friday which motions are going to be -- still have some merit, that the Court would either have to decide to respect the previous decision or to make a new decision.  But I think, once again, it would be more appropriate to address that in a smaller working session.  

The other large category has to deal with witness management.  Those are the 90 bis motions to bring witnesses from Rwanda here.  Those again, I don't think it's an issue of controversy.  They are  procedural motions to simply produce the witness here in Arusha.   

The controversy that attaches to some of those applications though have to do -- have to deal with witness protection issues, which is still a live issue, and I don't think it's going to go away.  There are a number of motions that were filed by Mr. Robinson concerning his request to cross-examine 
Witness G and Witness T from The Hague.  That's an issue that the Court is probably going to have to revisit.  

Most of these things, I think, are more appropriately dealt with in a smaller session which would allow us to come to some agreement as to where there is controversy and then perhaps request the Court's intervention at that point.  But if the Defence wants to comment on these issues, I'd be happy to respond to their concerns during this session.  

There are pending motions as well.  Some of them are moot, and I think all of these issues actually would be more appropriately addressed in a smaller session, after which we can report back to the Court on the issues which are still controversial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for those comments.  In fact, what we had in fact thought -- we had much the same idea earlier. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had much the same idea, that we could probably arrange a working session to go through the issue of pending motions and the decisions.  So depending -- well, I'll just invite the Defence counsel to make their representations and then perhaps we could schedule a working session on this issue. Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I think there's a fundamental legal issue that has to be decided by Your Honour, and that deals with the effect of the validity of the prior decisions made by a Chamber that has now been found to have the appearance of bias.  

As a practical matter, I've identified 15 motions that were all the decisions to be considered not valid.  There'd be 15 motions that I would file that are still what I consider to be live issues.  So I don't think it's necessary to go back and revisit decision by decision because, as Mr. Webster says, many of them have been overtaken by events or don't need to be revisited.  

But what has to be decided, and it's a very important point, is whether the trial is going to continue with the cloud hanging over it of the appearance of bias, and whether some day, in an appeal from a final judgement, decisions which were made by that Trial Chamber are going to be issues on appeal because they were not -- because they remained in the case. 
It seems that the most commonsense approach would be to declare that the decisions made by that Trial Chamber are not to be given effect and to make -- have the parties file whatever motions they feel are necessary before the new trial commences and to get rulings on those motions and not to worry about what decisions in the past should be given validity, which are moot.  I think the first step is to interpret the Appeal Chamber's reasons for the decision in ordering a new trial and to determine, as best as can be seen from that document, what was the intent of the Appeals Chamber.  Were they only ordering new testimony to be taken or were they essentially ordering new proceedings to start from the very beginning? 

I think one answer to that -- they didn't deal with it clearly, that's for sure -- but one answer to that is found in paragraph 71 of the decision.  And after discussing how the indictment itself and its amendments and the issues raising to that -- the issues relating to that had already been decided by the Appeals Chamber in other decisions, they go on to say, "To the extent that Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera have other concerns about the indictment, they should raise them in the Trial Chamber rather than on appeal arising under Rule 115 bis (D)."  

And so that language -- the concerns that I had raised, for example, in the appeal included whether or not the joint criminal enterprise allegations that had been added to the indictment, we had proper notice of those when the trial continued in the middle.  And that, I was saying, was a reason why the trial should be started anew.  And so, if we were to simply give effect to all of the decisions of the prior Trial Chamber, there would be no opportunity for Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera to raise other concerns about the indictment in the Trial Chamber, all of those concerns that had already been raised and decided by that Trial Chamber.  And so I think that that language suggests that the Appeals Chamber had in mind that all the decisions of the Trial Chamber would be not given validity and that the decisions would be presented to a new Trial Chamber and made afresh.  

I think that's the only logical way in which we can proceed to have any certainty about how this trial is going to go from this point on.  And I would say that if the trial -- if the President or the Trial Chamber were to make a decision to the contrary, we would ask to have a right to certify that issue for appeal or even to go directly to the Appeals Chamber and ask them to clarify their ruling on the decisions, because this is a very fundamental point.  Three Judges having the appearance of bias cannot fairly be said to have decided issues that were before them.  It's just fundamental, and unless that fundamental principle is honoured, we feel that this trial that you are going to preside over will be forever tainted by that error.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

	Any other comments? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  Once again, I totally agree with what has been said by my colleague Robinson.  The suspicion of bias was not borne when the Chamber recognised the grounds thereto.  And this suspicion of bias does affect everything which was produced by the Chamber to date.  But during the discussions, another idea has come up for me.  We cannot resume the trial on the basis of decisions already taken prior to the composition of your Chamber, Your Honour.  I do believe that maintaining one decision of the previous decisions rendered, that would be denying you, yourself, and the two judges that will accompany you, the fullness of your sovereignty and competence.  

You ought to be able, yourself and the two judges who will join you, you should be able in your discussions to exercise your full competence on all issues which, up to now, have been decided upon or have been affected by the way and manner in which your predecessors exercised their own competence under the suspicion of bias.  You should be fully competent, and all the decisions taken by your predecessors need to be set aside.  I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Yes. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Your Honour.  From a legal point of view, it would seem to me, and it may be that this might have to be ruled upon by Your Honour -- I hope not -- but it seems to me that it's a logical corollary or it's implied in the Appeals Chamber finding of a reasonable apprehension of bias that any decision by a Judge which is the subject of that reasonable apprehension of bias can no longer be relied upon. 

There was never any suggestion, for example, that Judge Vaz should sit on the Bench to decide on continuation of trial.  If reasonable apprehension of bias means that there's a reasonable apprehension of unfairness in any future decisions, it seems logical that that should apply to the past.  

Apart from the legal aspect of it, in my submission, there's a very practical side to all of this, which is that there is an order for a trial de novo.  And how can, in all common sense, a new Bench of Judges be saddled with the range of decisions from the previous trial which has been vacated?  

Not all of those decisions were in writing.  Some of those decisions were oral.  And in my submission, to take an approach that one has to look at the different decisions just makes Your Honour's life too complicated, in my submission.  

The practical way forward is to vacate all of the decisions by -- which were made by the Judges who have been held to be the subject of a reasonable apprehension of bias.  The Prosecution and the Defence can then state which decisions they are happy with, and those decisions can be reinstated by consent.  So, in our submission, that would be the practical way forward, if appropriate.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Does Karemera have anything to add?  Miss Diagne-Mbaye? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, we gave our observations earlier with regard to the decision of 22nd October, that no one knew at that time before the trial began. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I would like to invite discussion on a couple of issues that seem to be relevant to this discussion.  

	This trial started a long time ago, and there are decisions which were made before the composition of the Bench which lead to the issues with regard to the presumption or perception of bias.  What is the effect of decisions made prior to the composition of the Bench?  So in any declaration of nullity or non-applicability, it seems to me that one criteria that is applicable is the question of the Bench composition.  

Now, in my opinion, a blank order for a trial de novo would carry with it inevitably that decisions made affecting the evidence, evidential issues, would automatically have to go.  But would other issues be automatically null, be affected by any issues of that nature?  

For example, there are certain matters which have nothing to do with the actual judication per se.  Matters affecting, for example, witness protection, for example, are these affected by an order for a trial de novo?  So it would seem to me that one would have to evaluate the criteria of issues which are affected by the order for the new trial.  And in relation to decisions which fall within certain categories, that those decisions would have to be declared to be of no effect.  

But there are other issues which are just a blanket denial of validity.  They have adverse consequences which are unrelated to the -- not affected by the relevant issue whatsoever.  That's one of the reasons why we thought that it may be useful to actually have a working session, where the counsel on both sides could identify the issues which need to be declared to be of no effect and also the issues which require to remain in force, just to preserve peripheral issues to the trial process. 

I think the same thing is true of the pending motions.  It seems to me that some of the pending motions, for example, motions for leave to appeal against decisions which are no longer binding, are unnecessary, and so on.  There are certain motions which are no longer necessary.  There are other motions which are necessary, regardless to what other decisions are taken.  And the question that one would have to determine is whether those motions remain for determination or whether there is a withdrawal of the motions and a filing of new motions. 

Now, it seems to me that it would be a waste of effort to file a new motion if it is going to be identical to the motion which is already on file, and so I would think that another activity for the working session would be to identify the motions which are no longer necessary and to have a process for removal of them from the record. 

I got the impression that this seems to conform with the views of everybody here, and so we could simply schedule a working session for this activity to take place.  

Yes, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour, I think that would be quite appropriate, and, in fact, that's the suggestion I thought I was introducing when I first spoke.  

In response to Mr. Robinson, however, I would like to make one further comment, and that is that I have a different reading of the Appeals Chamber decision of the 22nd of October.  

I think if the Appeals Chamber wanted to jettison every prior decision of the former Trial Chamber, it would have said so explicitly, and when it directed the parties to the Trial Chamber, it was because the new Trial Chamber, or the Trial Chamber that would be composed for the trial, is best suited to decide the issues that, I think it was Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera were trying to raise during the appellate process.  

Going back to your original question about how far do we have to go in terms of looking at prior decisions, I would simply remind the parties and the Trial Chamber that the issue that gave rise to what was later characterised as an apprehension of bias was one week in September of 2003.  So any decision that Judge Vaz participated in prior to September of 2003 is really unblemished as far as the Appeals Chamber decision is concerned.  

And with respect to the remaining two Judges, Lattanzi and Arrey, I think it was very clearly stated in the decision that the apprehension of bias would attach after the 27th of April.  So there are clear parameters, even in the Appeals Chamber decision, as to what prior decisions of the Trial Chamber may be called into question. 

Even looking at those sets of decisions, there are a number of decisions that the Appeals Chamber itself has rendered upon prior decisions of the Trial Chamber, and I think that those are in a wholly different category as well because this is not simply a decision from the Trial Chamber but now a decision from the Appeals Chamber that has adjudicated issues of law, for example, the whole series of applications concerning joint criminal enterprise.  It is our submission that it would be a waste of this Court's time to re-litigate issues that the Appeal Chamber has clarified for all of the parties because it has gone into the jurisprudence and addressed an issue of legality in joint criminal enterprise pleadings and whether it's a part of international customary law.  

The same thing for the international character of the conflict, and there are legal issues that were litigated at the appellate level that take those considerations out of the purview of whether they are corrupted by an apprehension of bias, and I would wish that the Trial Chamber would take that into consideration as well.  

Now, I think the best way forward is as the Court suggested, to organise a working session to look at the whole list of motions, see which ones contain live issues which have to come before the Court in one form or the other and proceed on that basis, which is essentially what the Court has recommended.  So I support the Court's proposal, but I simply wanted to indicate on the record that we do not acquiesce to Mr. Nzirorera's characterisation or Mr. Robinson's characterisation of the Appellate Court's decision of the 22nd of October.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  It was not necessary for you to with -- draw the fact that you were the first person who made the proposal.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was not necessary for you to characterise it as "my proposal".  

Okay, now I think we can safely move to the next item on the agenda, which is the issue of disclosure. 

Again, I think, Mr. Webster, it would be appropriate for you to lead the discussion, lead off on that issue. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  I believe it was last Thursday we submitted a document to the Trial Chamber coordinator, which was copied to the parties, which was a listing, an exhaustive listing, of our understanding of our Rule 66 obligations with respect to the 80 or so witnesses that are listed for trial.  

Practically speaking, it's literally impossible to have a complete record of everything that was disclosed in this case.  Disclosure in this case started back in 1998, 1999.  Most of our disclosures were filed with CMS for transmission to the parties.  Records have been -- you know, perhaps were not kept as accurately as we would have liked them to be, but I think I can say with confidence that the listing of disclosure that was made in the filing on Thursday is but a small fraction of the volume of materials that made their way to the Defence over the past five or six years.  

Aside from these materials for the 80 or so witnesses that we anticipate for trial, we also anticipate putting together an electronic disclosure suite which will allow the Defence to access a large volume of materials that are in our OTP database.  They would include a number of materials that counsel for Nzirorera has asked for on a number of occasions:  MRND documents, communiqués, radio transcripts.  So, basically, the whole volume of documents, public documents -- quasi public documents that we have in the OTP would be made available to the Defence.  

The only materials that would not be made available at this time are materials that we define as coming under Rule 70:  confidential materials, attorney work product, internal correspondence within the OTP, materials that would compromise ongoing investigations as narrowly defined at this stage in our completion strategy and witness statements.  

Witness statements are going to be incrementally added into an electronic disclosure suite.  We are not prepared logistically to put witness statements in the electronic disclosure suite at this time, but the long-range plans are for all of the witness statements in the OTP also to be included in the electronic disclosure suite in redacted form.  So we are essentially moving to a form of open file disclosure in our cases.  

There would be a wide number of materials available to the Defence, and the condition for having access to these materials is to sign a memorandum of understanding and confidentiality which will lay out how the parameters of these materials can be accessed and how the information can be shared or the limitations on sharing such information.  So I think this is something that we can work out in working sessions.  

I've already received a document from Mr. Nzirorera listing some of the items he claims he has still not received, but the disclosure is going to be so extensive in the weeks ahead that I don't see this giving rise to much controversy, but I'll leave the floor open to the Defence.  They can express themselves, and then I'll be happy to respond.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, with respect to  disclosure, before we get to that, if I could just ask that we return to the previous item for one moment.  And that is that I didn't understand, number one, when the working session was going to be held concerning the previous decisions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can give an answer to that.  That's an agenda item to schedule and determine the methodology for the working session.  So I think it's the -- well, this is the last real controversial issue, and we'll discuss that in a few minutes.
MR. ROBINSON:
And also I would ask that -- I think that it would be very helpful for such a session if we had a list of all of the decisions produced by the registry so that we're all working from the same page, because I think people have different records of what was decided.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So going to disclosure, I think that probably between OTP's list and what I submitted, we're in close agreement as to what has actually been disclosed and there's only a few items that the Prosecution says they've disclosed that I don't have -- I can't find or don't have a record of it.  It may be my fault, it may it be their fault, but it's not an insurmountable problem.  

What is the problem is what is listed as  the OTP "to be disclosed" and what they recognise that they have not yet disclosed and which I estimate to be about 5,000 pages of material that under 
Rule 66(A)(ii) must be in our hands at least 60 days before the trial.  And so we have a considerable way to go with the disclosure before we'd be in a position to even be 60 days before the trial.  And I think that's something that needs to be addressed this week, also, is to get that done, get that accomplished.  And I think I provided a list attached to my letter of the 8th of November as to what should be raised at the status conference, and now with the OTP's list, I think we probably have a pretty good idea of what is outstanding, but the question is when is it going to be done, because the trial schedule, in my opinion, cannot be set until we know when we have that disclosure.  

And I think there also are some issues that are -- around disclosure that are going to have to be decided by the Trial Chamber that are the subject of fundamental disagreements between the parties as to whether there's an obligation to disclose in the first place, and examples of those are witness confirmation statements, which is the subject of a pending motion, materials relating to the assassination of President Habyarimana and statements that contradict --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of interest, what do you mean by witness confirmation statements? 
MR. ROBINSON:
These are documents that when the Prosecution has -- intends to call a witness, they send their investigator out to show the witness the prior statement and ask him if he wants to make any changes to it.  And there's a form generated by this, which I attached to my motion, in which the investigator fills out the form and says what the witness is now maintaining about his prior statement, whether it was correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is that controversial? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it is, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't a decision on that in the Simba case recently?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, could you repeat that? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't there a decision on that in the Simba case recently, a judicial decision on that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, there wasn't.  A motion was filed.  It was not resolved.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was sitting on the Simba case when a decision was rendered.  I should have stated it more positively than to ask a question.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, every time I take off my microphones to speak, I don't hear what you are saying because the acoustics in the room are so bad.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm saying that matter has already been decided.
MR. WEBSTER:
In another case?
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the Simba hearing.  So it might be useful.  I don't think that really is controversial any more.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Thanks.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
The other issue of fundamental disagreement between the parties is whether there's an obligation under Rule 68 to provide statements of third parties which contradict the Prosecution's witnesses.  Even in my opening statement in November of 2004 -- 2003, I gave examples of how a witness named Omar Serushago was maintaining certain things and the OTP had interviewed other witnesses who say that absolutely is untrue, and Mr. Webster takes the position that that's not Rule 68 material.  And it's our position that that is material contradicting Prosecution evidence and has to be disclosed.  And we went for a full year of trial without ever having that material disclosed to us, except when another Prosecutor named Stephen Rapp was handling two witnesses, Witness T and Witness G.  He interpreted the Rule differently and he did disclose to us statements of third party witnesses which contradicted those two witnesses.  But for many other witnesses, that disclosure has not taken place, and we're going to ask the Trial Chamber to order that it do take place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a pending motion on that?
MR. ROBINSON:
There's no pending motion.  I believe that the Trial Chamber has ruled against us on that issue in the past.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh.
MR. ROBINSON:
So that's something that we would wish to have a new Trial Chamber decide.  So anyway, I just want to emphasise the connection between full disclosure and the beginning of the trial, and we consider that an absolute, but for full disclosure 60 days in advance, we would not be prepared to begin the trial.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say, when I looked at what seemed to be the problems, it seemed to me that they were all capable of being resolved in a round table discussion by counsel.  So I trust that that is also a subject matter of a working session which, hopefully, would work out what could be worked out, and if there are legal issues to be resolved, they could be specifically identified for adjudication.  But I would imagine that there would not be many legal issues that require adjudication on the subject matter.

MR. ROBINSON:
I agree.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Anybody else?  Okay.  Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just follow up a bit on some of the comments made by Mr. Robinson.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
Looking through this listing of Annex A, there are a number of indications for materials that are to be disclosed, but, as I read through it, these are all, for the most part, materials that are unredacted witness statements that the previous ruling of the Trial Chamber was that these materials would be disclosed 30 days before the beginning of the trial session in which those witnesses testify.  So when I hear a figure of 5,000 documents, I'm not sure --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Pages, not documents.
MR. WEBSTER:
Pages, pages, it seems well out of proportion to what I glean from this document.  I think it is much less, but it raises an issue that I would like to have us discuss here today, and maybe it will come in in another agenda item.  If we have to put the discussion off, I'm sure the Court will let me know, but for the many -- for the most part, most witness statements have been disclosed in unredacted form.  So most of the parties now know the identities of the witnesses that will testify against their clients.  

We have been very hesitant to go beyond the requirements of our protective orders with respect to the witnesses against Joseph Nzirorera, in particular, and that is because Mr. Robinson has a very aggressive approach to Defence investigations.  And witnesses against his client complain with great frequency that they feel that their lives are being put at risk because of the nature of the Defence investigations.  So quite a number of these disclosure issues hinge on our apprehension that we cause great concern to our witnesses because the nature and the vigour of the Defence investigations makes them apprehensive about their own security.  And that's an issue that I think this 
Trial Chamber needs to address.  And it's not in terms of issuing another non-disclosure order or protective order, but reinforcing to all of the parties what the spirit of these non-disclosure orders are, because I don't think we can change the letter of the Trial Chamber orders and make the witnesses feel any more secure.  But what needs to happen is that all of the parties need to have, you know, some sense, you know, even a gentlemen's agreement, of what is appropriate in Defence investigations, and how much the methods of one particular Defence team causes discomfort and concern to witnesses.  

I received an e-mail just this morning from one witness who raised again, for the third time, his concern that his identity had been compromised because of the way questions were being asked about him in his area where he resides.  I have a copy of that e-mail correspondence that I would be willing to share with the Court, if it desires, but it is an issue that I would like to bring up, and it is completely pertinent to a discussion of disclosure, because the issue of disclosure is really one of witness protection, and it's a live issue that the Court is going to have to address, if not today, at a later time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you saying that the existing orders for witness protection are inadequate, or are you saying that they have been broken? 
MR. WEBSTER:
No, I'm not saying that they are inadequate, and I don't know if they are being broken or not, but I know that witnesses for -- that are testifying, primarily against Nzirorera, have complained repeatedly that their identities are being compromised in their communities because of the nature of Defence investigations.  And we don't seem to have that problem with witnesses against Karemera and witnesses against Ngirumpatse and witnesses against Rwamakuba.  That problem seems to crop up habitually for witnesses against Nzirorera.  So it is a problem.  It is not a problem in the letter of the order; it's a problem in the spirit in which the Defence teams approach the order, and I don't know how to address it.  

Clearly, the Defence and each Accused has a right to investigate the witnesses against them, but all parties and this Trial Chamber and this Tribunal have an obligation to respect the privacy and the concerns for security of the witnesses that appear before us.  So how we address it I really don't know, but it's something that I need to bring to the attention of this Court, because as late as this morning, I received yet another e-mail from a witness who claimed that the ICTR is doing nothing to protect him because people are asking about him in relation to Nzirorera.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  It is now just beyond one o'clock.  I think that we can wrap up our session in 15 to 30 minutes, and I would prefer if we completed it rather than resume this afternoon.  Is that the general view?  Okay, thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, I think you need to respond.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to respond to that.  

Mr. Webster has never given us any specifics of what he is talking about, so it is difficult to respond.  It is true that we do investigate the witnesses' allegations against Mr. Nzirorera, and it's a very important part of our Defence preparation for cross-examination.  We are very clear that we are not to contact -- not to have any contact with any Prosecution witnesses, and I don't believe that we have ever done that.  Now, when we go out in the field and we are investigating the allegations, there is some necessity to ask people about the information that we're investigating, and it is almost unavoidable that someone may believe that they know who's the source of information.  

I will give you an example of that.  We had a witness, GBG, who testified that when he was a primary school student he attended a meeting at which Mr. Nzirorera spoke at a football field in his own commune, and that it had been required by his teacher and the headmaster for everyone to go and attend this meeting.  And in order to investigate that, of course, we had to go to the school and talk to the headmaster, who said there was never any such meeting, and to the teachers who also said there was never any such meeting, and to other students who attended the school who also said there was no such meeting.  And those people will be coming as witnesses for the Defence, and quite properly.  So we are trying to conduct proper investigations.  

We absolutely have no intention of intimidating any witnesses and I don't believe that we have ever done so.  And Mr. Webster knows that when I have met witnesses for the Prosecution in his presence, I have been extremely polite and professional with those people.  And our investigators are received warmly in Rwanda, and I have been there many times myself and have been received very warmly there.  So without any specifics, I think it is very difficult to understand what needs to be done to cure the perception that Mr. Webster has, but I'm certainly willing to work with him and to try to make any effort we can to reduce the anxiety by people that there is any kind of problem.  

I will say that Mr. Nzirorera and I have known the identity of the witnesses against him for many, many years, and not a single witness has ever been harmed or even threatened, that I'm aware of, who is coming against Mr. Nzirorera.  So I -- that's the best I could say.  And I understand that in the Simba case, there was an allegation that a witness was murdered and -- somehow in connection with his testimony.  I don't know if that is true or not, but I want to make it very clear that Mr. Nzirorera completely deplores any retaliation, intimidation or threats to witnesses, and would never want anything like that being done on his behalf.  And I want to make it very clear that that is our position, that we take witness protection issues very seriously, and there will be need for witness protection for Defence witnesses, as well, that we expect the Prosecution to take seriously.  

So we are willing to work with the Prosecution to understand the concerns, if he can give us 
specific information.  And we want to make it clear that, as a matter of policy, we will do everything we can to make sure that witnesses are not threatened or intimidated or exposed unnecessarily.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may, Your Honour, there is -- I can provide specifics or give the Court one example of something that can be addressed with the media effect, and that is Mr. Robinson's attempt to meet all of the Prosecution witnesses before they testify.  Now, the prior Trial Chamber put in -- or contained in their protective measure, there was an instruction that any attempt by the Defence to meet with the Prosecution witness would have to go through WVSS.  And WVSS, the witness and victims protection service, would be the ones to find out from those witnesses if they wished to meet with Mr. Robinson; but on more than one occasion, Mr. Robinson has not been willing to rely on representations from WVSS and has insisted on confronting the witnesses themselves with the question of whether they wanted to meet with him or not.  

In one instance, that generated a memo from David Chappell, dated the 1st of December 2003, because Mr. Robinson went out to the safe house and attempted to meet with the witnesses, to ask them if they wanted to speak with them.  And this is one documented incident where he overstepped the boundaries that had been laid down by the Trial Chamber.  Now, this is an incident in the past, but it is an incident that is ripe to reappear, because even with respect to Witness G -- or is it Witness T? 
-- excuse me, Witness T, who is one of our confidential informants that is currently in a foreign jurisdiction, Mr. Robinson insists on being able to confront him in person to find out whether he wants to meet with him or not, in spite of the fact that he has already communicated through third parties that he does not want to meet with Mr. Robinson, with the Nzirorera Defence team.  

One of the issues that he has put on his agenda to discuss with the Court today was to see the documentation of Witness T's refusal to meet with him, when that has already been disclosed to the Trial Chamber, and we've made a decision not to disclose that documentation to Nzirorera and his counsel.  So at every step he has tried to confront witnesses in person in order to ascertain whether they want to speak with him or not, and it is inappropriate under the circumstances.  

The e-mail that I received this morning, I'm willing to serve a copy on the Court.  The Court clerk can actually bring this up to the Judge.  I have redacted my e-mail address and the name of the witness.  It is in French, but presumably it can be translated for the Court so that you, Your Honour, can see the witness's own words with respect to how he evaluates the risk that he feels is being caused by the Nzirorera Defence team, and it is a serious issue.  

Now, I'm at a loss to suggest a way to address it, because the protective orders, if they are followed, should be adequate.  And Mr. Robinson claims that he is following those protective orders, and I cannot suggest that he is not; but somehow the witnesses that he tries to investigate always seem to complain that they feel their identities are being compromised in their communities.  So there is a problem that the Trial Chamber needs to address because we don't want to find ourselves in the same position months from now that the litigants in the Simba trial find themselves, where a witness is dead and everybody can wring their hands and feel sorry about it, but someone's life has been lost in the process.  Whether it is because they received instructions directly from the Accused or not is irrelevant, because the risk does not have to come from the Accused himself personally --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I didn't comment when Mr. Robinson made the comment, but I don't think that I can remain silent at this stage.  I was on the judicial panel in the Simba case when the witness died.  And as far as I'm aware, official investigations have been carried out into the death of the witness and persons have been detained on suspicion for the murder.  I am not aware that any of the official reports associate his death with the trial.  So I don't know what is the source of the comments either you or Mr. Robinson have made, but I would just like to make that comment.  I myself don't know how to respond to this.  My first reaction is to -- is to fall back on the two questions that I asked earlier:  One, the adequacy of the protective measures and the question of compliance with them.  If the protective measures are adequate and they are being complied with, what I'm not certain is what response the Court can give.  So there seems to be the need for further evaluation of either the order -- the orders themselves or the level of compliance with the orders.  Until that evaluation is done, I'm not certain if I can make any comments.  

We had listed one or two other questions to ask concerning the issue of disclosure.  I'm not sure if this is the appropriate time, but I will just mention, it seems that there has been -- all the lawyers have expressed uncertainty, and I don't know if anybody has, as yet, compared the various disclosure records -- or if it is necessary to do it -- with the OTP records, Defence records, and the CMS records, but I don't know if that's -- I presumed that that step was no longer necessary if Your Honour is going to work through the disclosure issues at the working session during the course of the next week.  

We also wondered about the issue of reciprocal disclosure.  Is there anything that needs to be done by the Defence teams, issues with regard to alibi, issues with regard to -- any other reciprocal issues that require to be discussed?  We also note the issue of maps and photographs.  Are there any issues outstanding with regard to matters of that nature?
MR. WEBSTER:
We have an issue, Your Honour, and I think we can address it during the working session and then report back to you and then seek your intervention if there is controversy.  Rule 67 requires the Defence to engage in reciprocal disclosure.  If they request to see Prosecution exhibits under Rule 66, and presumably if they agree to participate in electronic disclosure under the new rule, Rule 68(B), which -- the provision under which we would set up an electronic disclosure suite, then they have an obligation, as well, to make disclosures to the Prosecution.  And we would simply request that when the Defence, for example, comes across Rwandan witness statements, Rwandan PVs, that the Prosecutor does not have, that they disclose those to the Prosecution prior to the witness's testimony; that when they have maps and photographs that they would like to use during the course of the trial, that those materials be made available to all the parties well in advance, so that we are all operating within a regime of full and complete disclosure.  I think it would lead to a better administration of the trial, and it's a legal obligation of the Defence if they look at Prosecution materials under Rule 66 or Rule 68(B).  So that is something we can discuss in our working sessions, and if there's disagreement, we can bring it back to the Court on Friday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We also noted an issue of discussing -- which we think should be discussed probably in the working sessions as well -- modalities for making witness statements available for interpreters and confirming that all parties refer to the same edition of any particular witness statements, and also the issue of translation problems, which is an issue which we would like discussed fully, as we would like to eliminate this as a cause of delay in our trial.

So I suppose that -- I think we have completed.  Are there any other issues on this that require discussion?  

Okay.  We're coming down to the --
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, pardon me.  Because we brought up the issue, I would just like to have a couple of words.  You, rather, raised the issue of alibi that the Defence could introduce, and the Prosecutor dealt with the problem of late disclosure by the Defence.  

I would like to say two things that go back to what you first said at the very beginning of this status conference.  For the Defence, there is no question -- there is no question that we will disclose materials before we know exactly what we are responding to.  So the request for disclosure of alibi -- the request for disclosure of alibi materials made by the Prosecutor, he was very clear that we will not respond to that issue before the Prosecutor changes the indictment from one week to another, for example.  The motion filed in September demonstrated this and gave us a supplementary argument to refuse to respond to anything dealing with that before the proceedings are not fixed and before we know exactly what we are responding to.  

Secondly, Defence disclosures:  I don't believe that at any time we were lacking in our disclosures; we would like to disclose any materials.  On the contrary, we see that the Prosecutor has disclosed materials late.  Sometimes we receive materials right before a hearing in the morning.  A witness is heard, and in the same morning we are given information at issue, and in such circumstances we must point out that there is systematically this surprise.  If the Prosecutor stops that practice, we indeed will be able to disclose materials more directly, more immediately.  But since this issue has come up, I would hope that the Prosecutor lead by example by disclosing fairly spontaneously and immediately without surprising the Defence.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.

Mr. Weyl, I would hope that on issues of this nature, we could safely use the future tense, and I would hope that problems experienced before would no longer exist.  I hope that if you have your discussions on disclosure that many of these issues would be discussed and operating methods would be worked out which would eliminate problems in the future.  That's my desired outcome of the working session on disclosure which we hope to schedule in a few minutes. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thank you.  I share that opinion.  I simply request that we receive disclosure -- the results of the Kigali investigations that were conducted last week.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Now, on the issue of directives for trial, the issues that we had listed, which I can just briefly mention, which I hope could lead to some interaction between the counsel and our Trial Court during the week, which could result in some formal action at the next status conference on Friday, had to do with the issue of motions, first of all, and it also relates to the issue -- and that is with regard to motions that are filed in writing, if there are any.  

Without in any way trying to undermine the rights of the counsel filing or the party filing the motion, the more concise and precise the motions are, the more effective they could be and they also eliminate translation problems.  So we would be -- we would like to require counsel to pay attention to brevity and precision in the structure of documents filed in the trial.  

The other issue that is of great concern is the question of translation, and we would hope that these issues would also be discussed during the course of this week.  I think that it is quite clear that the Article 20 translation obligations must be faithfully observed.  But with regard to the other translation issues, we would be expecting that all counsel would utilise the practical tools which are available to minimise the issue of delay on the proceedings.  And the practical tools which we are aware that have been put in place rely on cooperation between the Defence team members, and it stresses the importance of bilingual Defence teams.  I note that there is already ample jurisprudence indicating that the Prosecutor is required to work in both working languages.  I think it would be actually, from a logistical point of view, impossible to have every document translated, and so Defence teams who require assistance with translations have to identify priorities.  And we will be expecting our trial coordinator to be working with you in this regard.  But we expect that practical operating methods will be worked out during the course of this week so we can issue some practice directions to facilitate this process.

Now, this brings us to the scheduling of the working sessions -- well, no, I should also mention that we also invite any of you who have any ideas for practice directions, please, to communicate that with our trial coordinator, so that we can try to develop proper operating methods for the conduct of the trial.

Now, in terms of the working sessions, we had thought of four headings for working sessions for subject matters.  One is the status of previous decisions and the issue of pending motions.  We thought that that was an issue which could have been probably the first matter to be discussed maybe tomorrow.  The other three topics would be the indictment, disclosure issues, and the pre-trial and trial scheduling.  Now, we have already fixed the indictment for Thursday, the 25th.  We thought that the disclosure issues, we thought that -- we thought of scheduling them for Monday, or Monday and Tuesday, and we thought that the pre-trial and trial schedule could be dealt with on the same day as the disclosure, probably on Tuesday.  I don't know if it makes sense to discuss the pre-trial and trial schedule before the issue of the indictment has been resolved.  It might be that we might have to schedule that for the same day as the dealing with the indictment, on Thursday -- Thursday, the 25th.  

I don't know if anybody has any comments on the timetable. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I don't know if this is directly responsive to your question, but I had a few questions about the working sessions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would like to know, first of all, if you would be working as part of those sessions, and I would also like to know if I can have my client assisting me during those sessions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we had discussed the composition of the working team, and I would be available to participate in the working sessions, but I also thought that it -- that there might be issues which you might prefer to discuss in my absence.  So we were -- I was thinking of asking Mr. O'Donnell to be primarily responsible for managing the working sessions, and I gave him the assurance that if he thought that my presence would assist that I would be available to join at any time.  I would be on the Tribunal premises, and I would be willing and available to join if it was thought that I could assist in resolving any issues that existed. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's fine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
With regard to your request for the attendance of your client, I had not previously thought that the attendance of the Accused, the personal attendance of the Accused, was necessary for the working sessions, but if it -- if it becomes a fair trial issue and you want them present to facilitate in the making of decisions, I would have no objection to that.  But I think you should communicate with the trial coordinator and work out the -- so that the details could be worked out, but we had not originally thought that it was necessary.  But if it becomes a fair trial issue, then I don't think we would have any objection to their presence.  

Mr. O'Donnell has recommended that it might be sensible to invite all the Accused persons to participate, so I do that now.

With regard to the issue of lists of pending motions and the pending decisions, our trial coordinator has a list which will be circulated to all parties this afternoon, so that would facilitate discussions tomorrow.  

The commencement time suggested is nine o'clock tomorrow morning. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I must have missed something, because I didn't realise we had scheduled the working group for tomorrow.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, tomorrow is Thursday.  That was the status of previous decisions and pending motions.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I didn't realise that that had been suggested.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that too early for you? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that too early? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it is, because we will spend most of our energies over the next day or so working on the indictment, Your Honour, so we would actually prefer that we not start any working sessions until Monday.  Of course the Defence will claim that they need time to work on their responses and to look at the indictment, so we are sort of stuck on that.  But if we don't have all day tomorrow to focus on the indictment, there is no way that we will be able to comply with our earlier agreement.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper?
MR. HOOPER:
I had half withdrawn the idea, actually, but, Your Honour, I was wondering -- I appreciate 
	Mr. Webster's difficulties tomorrow.  He is having to work on that indictment.  I know that.  But I just wondered, even it was just for an hour tomorrow, we could at least get an idea of the range of disagreement between us in an informal discussion, and between now and Monday, we would be in a better position perhaps to all consider our individual, subjective positions and have a shorter meeting as a consequence next week.  I don't know if that's an attractive idea, but I'm thinking of something like an hour tomorrow perhaps might be enough to cover, you know, at least the perimetres, if not the detail, of that area which seems to be, frankly, quite precise, and perhaps it actually boils down to not a great deal.  We know that Mr. Robinson is forearmed with his 15 motions, so we know that there are those -- he has obviously considered his position and he can display that.  But for our part, those numbers come to mind, and I don't know how the others are minded, but I just thought it might help if we just cut the ground, as it were, quickly tomorrow if there was time for Mr. Webster to deal with that briefly and we would get a better idea of it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, my only thought on that is that when I looked at Mr. Robinson's correspondence and the Prosecutor's correspondence, I thought that if the indictment issue was resolved that it cuts the ground of controversy away.  So it seemed to me the resolution of the indictment is the secret to the whole -- so I'm not quite certain whether it is -- it would be better to wait until you saw the indictment, which that -- that, in fact, might take away some of the -- it might -- or it might identify that the controversy is greater, but I rather suspect the opposite.  I think it is likely that it will help facilitate making a decision on those issues. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say, the comment made by my trial coordinator was if you gave the Prosecutor time to concentrate on his indictment, are you going to have to give the Defence reciprocal time to concentrate on their reply?  But then, of course, you will have Saturday and Sunday. 

MR. HOOPER:
Whatever the view of the registry may be.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, a question:  Of your Defence (sic) team, couldn't you allow someone to attend a short conference tomorrow which would assist in concentrating -- what could be achieved is, you know, removing the peripheral issues and so one would only be left with the areas where there was a genuine controversy, and that might facilitate everybody's work, and it might not take -- it might not need much time. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It sounds like a reasonable suggestion.  I'm not opposed to it, but we prefer to have the entire day to concentrate on the indictment.  But if the Court deems it a priority for us to meet shortly tomorrow, we are willing to comply.  I would also like to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Might I ask you, would it be necessary for you personally to be here for that?
MR. WEBSTER:
No, not necessarily.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because that might be a way of allowing you to supervise the -- well, I consider the issue of the indictment resolution the more important issue, and I would not like that to be jeopardised, but it may very well be that if you could send somebody for a short part of the -- for a short session, it could facilitate the end result next week Friday as well.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  We are more than willing to do our bit to move the process along, so we will oblige the Court in that respect.  

But I would like to say to Mr. Hooper that, rereading his response to our motion to amend of the 24th of September, it didn't seem as if he was as adamant as the other Accused in rejecting the indictment of the 18th of February, and there is nothing to stop him from communicating directly with my office, and there may be issues that we can resolve that don't require the participation of the other parties or the Court, and my office is always disposed to speak with any of the Defence team individually to expedite matters.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. O'Donnell, have we completed the business of the day?  Is there anything that is left uncertain?

Well, I think we have completed all business.  We'll adjourn until tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.  The sessions are formal, and so we hope that the -- we expect that there will be court reporters and translation equipment so the proceedings will be on the record.  

I therefore adjourn today's session until tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. 
	(Court adjourned at 1350H)
