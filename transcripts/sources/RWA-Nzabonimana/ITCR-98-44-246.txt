MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Good morning.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short, and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday, the 3rd of March 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No.  ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could I say that the appearances are the same?  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I should like to point out that Mr. Édouard Karemera is present this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Robinson, as you commence, there's one remark I thought I could make to follow up the closing sequence yesterday.  You know, one of the reasons why the testimony is prolonged is that the witness has been speaking much more than necessary and sometimes has not been exactly responsive to the questions that you ask.  It would be better for you if you, rather than the Court, try to control him and get his questions (sic) more focussed to the questions -- his answers more focussed to the questions that you ask, and that may contribute to reducing the length of his testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, Mr. President.  I'll do that. I'm always reluctant to cut off a witness, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I know that.  I understand why you don't want to do it.  I think it's even worse if I did it.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'll do my best.  

Mr. President, before I commence my cross-examination, I have a matter I want to bring to your attention, and it involves the testimony of Witness G, who, as you may know, has just completed his testimony in the Military II case.  During the course of that testimony it was called to my attention that some testimony he gave in our case was inaccurately either translated or transcribed, and what I'm referring to specifically is on the testimony of Thursday, the 13th of October 2005, in the English transcript at page 18, I asked the question:  "Did you ever obtain a weapon?"  And the answer was, "No, I didn't obtain any weapon."  

And in the French transcript of the very same proceeding, my question, "Did you obtain a weapon," and the answer is, "I obtained a weapon."  So we have the absolute opposite from French to English, and I have the two transcripts that I can provide.  So my request, first of all, is that the Trial Chamber order that somebody review the tape of that session and give us the definitive correct answer of this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a process which can be done quite -- normal proceedings.  So I will make the order, and it will be done.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  And I'll offer to hand the transcripts to the registrar, to whoever's going to implement this order.  It would make it easier for them if they had it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'm ready, then, to proceed with the cross-examination.
WITNESS UB 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  How are you?  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	We were speaking yesterday of the meeting in Murambi, and I just have a few more questions about that.  The first question is, can you tell us approximately how many people attended that meeting?  
A.	There were the local inhabitants of Murambi commune who were attending, and they were -- the local inhabitants were MRND party members.  I couldn't really say how many MRND members there were in all in that commune.  
Q.	Well, I'm looking for an estimate from you.  It doesn't have to be exact, but you can tell the difference when there's ten people at a meeting or a hundred people or a thousand people.  So give me an estimate of how many people were in attendance at that meeting.  
A.	I couldn't venture there.  Murambi were (sic) quite populated, and there were many MRND members.  There must have been more than 5,000 in the whole commune.  So I couldn't tell you whether there were 200 or 300.  That wasn't part of my duties.  But I can tell you that Murambi commune was quite highly populated, and there were quite a few MRND members.  And there were other MRND people from neighbouring communes who came to that rally.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB -- 
A.	So to ask me to put a figure on it would be an untruth on my part, if I ventured there.  
Q.	Witness UB, can you give us the names of anyone besides yourself, Gatete, Ngirumpatse, and Kabagema, who attended this meeting?  
A.	I'd already explained that there were many people.  So now if I started to say such-and-such participated, that would mean that it was my task to enumerate the participants.  
Q.	Okay.  Witness UB, you're speaking in riddles.  Now, I asked you a direct question, and we need a direct answer.  I'm going to repeat my question, and I want you to give me the names of any people who you can recall at this meeting, other than the ones I mentioned -- Ngirumpatse, yourself, Gatete, and Kabagema.  Now, if you can give me zero names, if you have no other recollection of any other person at this meeting who you can name, you just tell me, "I don't know." 
A.	I told you that it was a mass rally.  It wasn't a secret meeting.  There were many people.  How can I start to enumerate the people present?  It would have meant that that was my job.  So please excuse me if my answer doesn't match your question.  I'm trying to answer the question as I understand it.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, it's our position that Mathieu Ngirumpatse never attended that meeting in Murambi.  And we are now going to try to find if there's anybody who -- anybody in the world who can support your testimony that he was there.  So I'm asking you, if you could give us the names of anybody else who was there; and we can go to them, and we can ask them, "Was Mathieu there or not?"  So can you do that for us?  
A.	I have explained that Mathieu Ngirumpatse did participate in that meeting -- that rally.  And you're saying that you're sure that he didn't.  Well, it's your right to say so, but bring another witness, then, to say that, because I am present here, and I say what I say.  You can challenge what I'm saying and say that Mathieu wasn't present, but I tell you, the rally took place, and Mathieu was there.  

It's up to the Trial Chamber to order the necessary investigations to see whether Mathieu was not present, and if that is the outcome of the investigations, you'll be right.  But I should like to tell you that the rally did, indeed, take place, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse was, indeed, present.  
Q.	And can you name a single other person who attended this rally besides Kabagema, Ngirumpatse, Gatete, and yourself?  
A.	No.  Murambi was heavily populated.  If you feel it's necessary, go to Murambi commune and undertake an investigation -- or maybe you've already done so.  If I give you the name of someone from Murambi commune who was present, and you go to see that person, and he tells you that Mathieu was present, you won't believe him either because you don't believe what I'm telling you.  So you want me to give the name of an ordinary citizen who took part in the meeting so that you can go and question him?  I don't think that's a very difficult problem.  I tell you that the meeting took place and that he attended it.  He was there.  
Q.	Witness UB, let's move to the meeting at Kibungo.  Now, can you tell us at this meeting in Kibungo, which of the leaders of the MRND were present?  
A.	I have stated that I did not take part in the rally held in Kibungo.  So when I mentioned it, it was just an example of a rally that was held.  I did not take part in it.  So I'm not in a position to know who was there.  But certain events occurred after the meeting.  So because I did not participate, I cannot tell you the names of the people that did attend.  But it was a mass rally, and most of the people of Kibungo commune took part in it.  
Q.	I'm going to read to you from the interview that was done on the 26th, '7th, '8th, and '9th of April 2004, by the crime analyst, Mr. Ndiaye, and I'm reading from page 7 of the English version, number 16.  It says, "According to the witness, in late 1993, he participated in a meeting at the headquarters of Kibungo préfecture, which was presided over (sic) Ngirumpatse, with a huge number of Kibungo and Kigali Interahamwe in attendance."  And then you went on to repeat what Mr. Ngirumpatse stated at the meeting.  Now, did you tell the Office of the Prosecutor in April of 2004, that you had participated in this meeting?  
A.	I don't think I told him I took part.  I think I only told him that a meeting was held -- a rally was held in Kibungo.  What you just read and what is in the document, then, is not true.  I am here to speak to you of the events that I recall.  I did not take part, but the fact is that every time there was an MRND rally, extracts were broadcast over Radio Rwanda.  If per chance I did say that to the Prosecutor or the investigators, it would be a mistake.  Perhaps I made a mistake.  I heard about what had happened at that rally over the radio.  
Q.	Now, you've also testified that after the meeting in Kibungo, there was a communiqué issued by the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville; is that correct?  
A.	Which communiqué are you referring to, Counsel?  
Q.	Well, I'm referring to your testimony in which you testified that after the meeting in Kibungo, the préfecture committee of Kigali-ville issued a communiqué, criticising the Interahamwe.  Do you understand?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  I don't quite understand the testimony.  Which testimony is the Defence referring to?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm referring to the testimony of this witness on direct examination, that after the meeting in -- I believe it was given on the very last day as part of the quote, "mop-up operation," that after the meeting in Kibungo, the MRND préfectoral committee in Kigali had gotten together, had issued a communiqué, criticising the Interahamwe.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, do you recall that testimony?  
A.	In my testimony I stated that the Kigali committee had published a communiqué, saying that they were not satisfied with the conduct of the Interahamwe.  You say that it was after the rally in Kibungo.  That could well be.  I mentioned that communiqué because at that time, the Interahamwe had a certain conduct.  And the president of the MRND in Kigali is present, and he knows better than I do about that communiqué.  So you say after the mass rally in Kibungo, that, I don't know, I don't understand.  What I don't know is that the communiqué was made public after a meeting of the préfectoral committee you have referred to.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, when you testified, in answering the Prosecutor's questions, you told us that the communiqué was in response to the violence that had followed the Kibungo meeting which had spread from Kibungo into Kigali préfecture itself.  Now, were you in error when you gave that testimony, or was that testimony correct?  
A.	No, that is not a mistake.  I told you we did make a communiqué public.  I was with the Kigali party president.  I think your procedure is very legalistic.  I'm not a jurist.  What I know is that the communiqué was broadcast, and that was because the Interahamwe conduct was wrong, and the acts of violence that took place in Kibungo could have been -- there could have been similar acts in Kigali to those in Kibungo.  And when the committee realised that, they made the communiqué -- they issued the communiqué, but it wasn't -- it was not because of what was -- had happened in Kibungo.  It was what was going on in Kigali, in general, and in Kibungo, in particular, and it was the president who signed that communiqué.  It wasn't I.  I was merely a member of the préfectoral committee for Kigali town, a simple member of the committee.  
Q.	And was this communiqué discussed by the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville during one of its meetings?  
A.	It was the préfectoral bureau of Kigali town which was responsible for executing all decisions.  So if the political bureau takes a decision, it turns to the préfectoral committee to do it, to implement the decision.  So it was up to the national bureau to discuss the communiqué.  Those were the people who had to discuss it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If the interpreter understood correctly.  Sorry.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	If before the communiqué was issued by the Kigali MRND, was it discussed by the Kigali préfectoral committee?  
A.	The committee stated that acts committed in Kigali urban préfecture and in peripheral areas were not worthy of persons of integrity.  So the committee didn't discuss the communiqué.  If the bureau had issued the communiqué, it wasn't up to the committee to discuss it, either at préfectoral level or commune level or national level.  It was the bureau that had the last word.  So we, as the préfectoral bureau for Kigali, we issued the communiqué.  The president was present and, in my opinion, supported the communiqué.  So we drafted the communiqué, and we made it public.  If it did not please our leaders, I don't know, but what I do know is that it was broadcast.  
Q.	And can you give us the names of the Kigali préfectoral bureau at that time?  We know Jean Habyarimana.  Give us the other names.  
A.	The bureau was made up of the president, the vice-president, the secretary, and the treasurer.  Those are the people who make up the préfectoral bureau.  
Q.	And the president was Jean Habyarimana; the treasurer -- excuse me.  
A.	Yes, the president was -- president, chairman -- was Jean Habyarimana.  
Q.	And the vice-president?  
A.	Juvénal Uwimana.  
Q.	And the secretary?  
A.	Gashegu, Dismas, who replaced Jean Bizimana.  
Q.	Was there just one vice-president?  
A.	Yes.  The vice-president -- at préfectoral level, there was only one vice-president.  
Q.	And after this communiqué was issued, then -- excuse me one moment.  

After the communiqué was issued, did you receive information from Jean Habyarimana as to the reaction to the communiqué from people at the national MRND?  
A.	I spoke of the people making up the préfectoral bureau,  and I (sic) mentioned three people.  Perhaps you've forgotten the fourth person.  Habyarimana was the spokesman of the party.  He told me that the top people were not happy with the communiqué we broadcast over the radio, criticising the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Witness UB, I had a reason relating to your security, concerning the fourth member of that préfectoral bureau, and that's why it wasn't gone into.  Do you understand?  
A.	Oh, yes, now I understand you.  
Q.	Now, when Jean Habyarimana reported the reaction of the national committee, were the -- was that report made to the préfectoral committee or the préfectoral bureau?  
A.	When he told us of the national bureau's reaction to the communiqué, it was clear that we had to do something.  So when the préfectoral bureau met, he told them of what he'd heard from the national bureau and also had to report to the national bureau what was discussed at the committee.  And when the national bureau reacted to our communiqué, we couldn't do anything about it because they were the top body, supreme organ.  
Q.	And was this matter ever discussed among the 20 members of the préfectoral committee in Kigali?  
A.	Yes.  After the bureau, the matter was raised at the préfectoral bureau level.  All the people who meet every time, they are called by the chairman of the préfectoral committee -- the president of the préfectoral committee.  So I know it was discussed within that committee.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, let's move to another rally or speech that you had talked about attending, and that was one that occurred at Amahoro stadium.  Now, can you tell us, first of all, this meeting at Amahoro stadium, approximately when did it take place?  
A.	I don't remember the exact date, but I can tell you it was towards the end of 1993 or beginning of 1994.  As to the date, I don't remember very well, nor can I tell you the month.  But I think it was either towards the end of '93 or the beginning of '94.  
Q.	And was this rally attended by President Habyarimana and his wife?  
A.	Yes.  President Habyarimana and his wife were present.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, I'm trying to understand a few things.  First of all, isn't it true that at the end of 1993 and early 1994, Amahoro stadium was occupied by the UNAMIR?  
A.	UNAMIR did not work in the stadium.  There was a playing field within the stadium.  The UNAMIR wasn't there, didn't work there.  They had offices there, but when there were sporting events, the playing field was used by the people who were involved in whatever sport was going on there.  
Q.	So is it your testimony that the MRND held a rally at Amahoro stadium while UNAMIR was present?  
A.	UNAMIR had its offices there.  The offices were not on the playing field in the stadium.  The rally took place in -- on the playing field in the stadium.  It didn't -- it wasn't -- the rally didn't take place in the UNAMIR offices.  It was a mass rally, public rally.  So it was on the playing fields in the stadium.  
Q.	And, Witness UB, I'll put it to you that after the congress of July 1993, President Habyarimana never attended any other MRND meetings.  What's your comment to that?  
A.	Personally I'm saying that after the 1993 congress, President Habyarimana did not take part in meetings as the president of the MRND but as an ordinary party member.  So I confirm that such a rally did take place in Kigali préfecture, and President Habyarimana, the ministers, and other MRND members took part in the rally.  If you say President Habyarimana took part in no further rally, I tell you that he was there.  He attended.  I can tell you personally.  I was present myself.  I was a member of the préfectoral committee.  I attended that rally.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, I put it to you that there never was a rally in Amahoro stadium after July of 1993 when the MRND held its national congress.  Now, in this rally that you're telling us about and that you claim to have been present at, did Mr. Ngirumpatse participate?  
A.	Yes.  Ngirumpatse attended.  He attended that rally in Amahoro stadium.  At Kigali préfectoral level, the person who spoke was not Jean Habyarimana but Juvénal Uwimana.  Uwimana is still alive, and you can ask him if -- whether that rally took place or not.  But I know that it did, because I remember that we had organised a march from the office of the prime minister all the way to where the rally was held.  It was organised by the préfectoral committee, which is why Juvénal took -- spoke, to greet and welcome all the distinguished visitors.  He is still alive.  Ask him whether the rally took place or not.  But I persist in saying that the rally took place.  I know that Mathieu spoke.  Bonaventure Habimana spoke in his capacity as the dean of all the MRND members after the report.  So you can ask Habimana, Bonaventure, whether Juel (as interpreted) Habyarimana and his wife were not present, but I remember very well that when that rally took place, Habyarimana, the president, was no longer president of the MRND party.  
Q.	Witness UB, I put it to you that the MRND rally at which Juvénal Uwimana gave the word of welcome, and at which Bonaventure Habimana spoke, took place on the 7th of November 1993, at Nyamirambo stadium, and President Habyarimana wasn't there.  What do you say to that?   
A.	Rallies in Kigali préfecture were frequently organised, and they could even be organised twice a month.  I have just explained to you the circumstances under which the Amahoro national stadium rally was organised.  Now, as to Bonaventure Habimana, I know that Mathieu invited him very often to take part in MRND rallies.  Each time rallies were organised, Mathieu would ask him to take the floor.  This was someone who enjoyed respect in the party.  I, therefore, maintain that the rally in Amahoro stadium did take place.  I am giving you the names of the participants at this rally.  Even if Jean Habyarimana did not take part in that rally, he did help us to organise the rally in Amahoro stadium.  
Q.	Did Jean Habyarimana speak or attend the rally in Amahoro stadium?  
A.	He was not present, no.  He wanted to attend the rally, but in the meantime, he had family problems in his préfecture of origin, Gisenyi.  So it is Juvénal Uwimana who spoke on behalf of the chairman of the préfectoral committee.  
Q.	Witness UB, I'm going to once again refer you to the interview report of the 26th to the 29th of April 2004, where you were interviewed by the crime analyst, Mr. Ndiaye, from the Office of the Prosecutor.  And I'm reading from page 6, number 12, and the first paragraph says that "According to the witness, after his resignation as MRND chairman, President Habyarimana, accompanied by his wife, participated in a meeting of MRND at Amahoro stadium, Kigali, between July and October 1993."  And then it goes on to say that Jean Habyarimana -- well, it says, "Jean Habyarimana reiterated the loyalty of the population of PVK to President Habyarimana, and to the MRND, and then referred to the opposition party -- parties as the enemy and incited to fight the enemy."  Now, did you tell that to the Office of the Prosecutor in April of 2004?  
A.	In any case, I gave a statement to employees of the Office of the Prosecutor.  So I do not know why you are putting questions to me.  Everything is in my statement.  I know that I talked about the rally in the Nyamirambo regional stadium after the assassination of President Ndadaye, and I know that all of this is contained in my statement, and you have it.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, perhaps you don't understand.  I'll try to make myself more clear.  About two minutes ago, you told the Trial Chamber, in testimony under oath, that Jean Habyarimana did not attend this meeting you recall at the Amahoro stadium.  And I have just read to you that in April of 2004, you told the Office of the Prosecutor that Jean Habyarimana did attend and that he spoke, and he referred to the opposition parties as the enemy and incited to fight the enemy.  Now, one of those is true, and one of those is not.  So why don't you tell us which is true and which is not.  
A.	I believe I said that during the rally that came just before the death of President Ndadaye, that is, the rally following the death of President Ndadaye, Jean Habyarimana took the floor.  I never saw that -- I never said that Jean Habyarimana spoke during the rally in Amahoro.  I actually said that he took the floor during the rally that was organised in Nyamirambo stadium.  
Q.	Well, Witness UB, what I have just read to you, I'm going to read it again so we're clear.  According to the witness -- that's you -- "After his resignation as MRND chairman, President Habyarimana, accompanied by his wife, participated in a meeting of MRND at Amahoro stadium, Kigali, between July and October 1993."  So it's very clear what meeting this statement refers to.  It's not the meeting at Nyamirambo stadium after the death of President Ndadaye.  In fact, you speak about that in a different part of the statement.  But it's the meeting at Amahoro stadium that you're talking about.  

And you go on to say that "Jean Habyarimana reiterated the loyalty of the population of PVK to President Habyarimana, and to MRND, and then referred to the opposition parties as the enemy and incited to fight the enemy."  Now, can you tell us why, in April of 2004, you made such a statement to the Office of the Prosecutor?  
A.	As I have said, when I am in the witness box, as I am now, it is to emphasise what I have already said before -- or what statements I have made before.  And I have also told you that this rally did take place in Amahoro stadium.  I have given you evidence.  And I have given you the names of people who can corroborate what I have just said, and you can put questions to these people.  

Now, as to saying that Jean Habyarimana took the floor in Amahoro stadium, I say that it is not true.  Jean Habyarimana was not present.  I said that Jean Habyarimana took the floor instead at the rally in Nyamirambo stadium.  You're asking me why I made such statements in 2004.  Listen to what I'm telling you now.  Do not use that statement as a pretext.  That was just an example.  I did talk about that rally, and I believe I said that Habyarimana was not present.  If per chance I said that Habyarimana was present, then it must have been a mistake.  

I have taken the oath before the Court.  So take account of what I'm telling you now.  Do not put questions to me about why I made such-and-such statement in 2005.  I wonder, myself, whether I did make any such statement.  I am not at all sure of it.  Well, since I signed that statement, it may well be that I stated what is contained therein, but I'm telling you to take account of what I'm telling you today.  Let's not dwell on this rally.  If you are saying that I'm a liar, then you have the right to say so.  You're talking as a jurist.  I'm an ordinary peasant.  I am not a legal specialist.  So take account of the answer that I have just given you.  

If you are saying, "Well, if you said that, then you lied," well, then take it as you wish.  But I repeat that during the rally organised in Amahoro stadium, it is Juvénal Uwimana who welcomed our very important personalities.  I say that Jean Habyarimana was there.  He's still alive.  There was Bonaventure Habimana.  He is still alive too.  So put these questions to them.  I might be in error.  I could forget.  I just gave an example, just one example of a rally -- of one of the rallies that were organised.  If I make a mistake regarding details of one rally or another, then you must understand.  I cannot advance any other reason, but I am asking you to take account of what I'm stating here, and you will analyse it as you please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the witness might remove his headset for a moment.  

In fairness to the witness, he's under the impression he signed a statement.  My learned friend knows that what he's reading from are some notes which were prepared by an investigator who spoke with the witness.  But what has not happened is, the witness has not gone over those notes.  I have to say there are an awful lot of them.  They go on for several pages.  The witness has not had an opportunity to review that material and sign it as correct.  In his answer a moment ago, he was opining that he must have signed the statement, and it may be only fair to him to let him know that this is not a statement.  These are some notes of a conversation which took place, the accuracy of recording of which is always a matter for consideration by the Tribunal.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'll do that, Mr. President.  

If the witness could put his headphones back on.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, the document that I was referring to that was created in April of 2004, is a typewritten report by the investigator for the Office of the Prosecutor who spoke with you at the UNDF here in Arusha on those days.  And what I read to you is what he wrote down as what you have said.  It's not a statement that you, yourself, signed.  So we're all aware of that, but I wanted to make sure that you also were aware of that.  

And I also want to say to you that the last answer you gave was much too long and was a speech, not an answer.  And you have to discipline yourself to do better than that in the future or else I'm going to be in trouble with the Presiding Judge, and so are you.  So I ask you to keep your answers brief and answer my questions directly, not with speeches.  

Now, at this meeting in Amahoro stadium that you recall, was Mr. Nzirorera present?  
A.	I said that there were senior figures of authority in the party and members of the national committee.  If I said that such and such a person was present, then that would be like -- as if I was giving you the number of participants.  I said that there were government -- members of government and party officials, including Nzirorera.  So I'm stopping here because you asked me to be brief.  
I'm not making speeches.  I'm just answering your questions.  The problem is that when I answer, you refuse to understand me.  But I say that Nzirorera was present, as well as members of government and senior party officials.  I remember that I spoke with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He was with Munyazesa.  So if you're going to ask me what my conversation with Mathieu was about, then I'm going to tell you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness?  Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was possible for you to have compressed that answer into one word -- "yes," Mr. Nzirorera was present.  We'll get along much quicker if you were able to make your answers more concise.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, for calling me to order.  I shall try to answer the questions that have been put to me -- or that are put to me.  But when I answer the question, Defence counsel should not seek to trap me or to lead me on to -- on a slippery slope.  So I shall try to be brief.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was Mr. Karemera present?  
A.	There were many members.  I do not remember if he was present.  
Q.	Was Laurent Semanza present?  
A.	Yes, he was present.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that you had a conversation with Mathieu Ngirumpatse during this rally.  Can you tell us what that conversation was about?  
A.	I did not speak with Ngirumpatse during that rally.  We raised the problem of a woman called Fatuma who had been killed in Ngororero.  She was intercepted when she was on a bus.  The members of -- the Tutsi people who were on the bus were asked to come down, and they were killed.  So we asked that the body of that woman be given over to us, handed over to us, but our request was refused, was denied.  So I talked with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as well as the minister of the interior at the time who was Munyazesa.  The body was given to us because he called the Gisenyi préfecture office.  The woman was killed by the Interahamwe of Gisenyi.  When her body was given to us, we buried her in Gitarama.  When I talked with Mathieu, it was not about this political rally.  It was about this woman who had been killed.  
Q.	And did that conversation with Mathieu take place at this rally?  
A.	We talked in Amahoro stadium.  We were waiting for the rally to begin.  
Q.	And also at that time you were with Mathieu and Faustin Munyanesa (sic), the minister of the interior?  
A.	Yes, you're right.  
Q.	Was anyone else with you?  
A.	There were three of us, and we raised the matter with him.  
Q.	Who were the other two people besides yourself that raised this matter?  
A.	I was there.  So was Hamadi.  Mathieu was with Munyazesa, who was minister of the interior.  That is when we raised the matter with him, that is, the matter of the woman who had been killed at that place, and we said that we wanted this woman's body to be handed over to us so that it could be buried.  
Q.	And this Hamadi, can you tell us where he is now?  
A.	Hamadi is among the names that I gave to you.  Perhaps he's in exile.  In any case, he's not in Rwanda.  In view of my current situation, I'm not able to know where he is right now, but he's outside Rwanda.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, could you get the witness to spell "Hamadi."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, Witness UB, can you please spell the name "Hamadi."  
A.	Hamadi is spelled H-A-M-A-D-I, Hamadi.  
Q.	And is that the same Hamadi Nshimijimana?   
A.	Yes, that is he.  He was the vice chairman of the party for Nyarugenge commune.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And we have the spelling written down by the witness yesterday as N-S-H-I-M-I-J-I-M-A-N-A.
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Now, I'd like to talk about the speeches that were made at this rally you say you attended at Amahoro stadium.  You told us that Juvénal Uwimana took the floor and welcomed the people there.  Can you tell us who spoke after him?  
A.	Juvénal Uwimana took the floor, and he was followed by the chairman of Kigali-ville préfecture.  So this was Semanza, that is, he was the chairman for Kigali-ville préfecture.  This is Laurent Semanza.  
Q.	And who spoke after him?  
A.	After Semanza's address, Mathieu Ngirumpatse took the floor.  
Q.	And who spoke after him?  
A.	After Mathieu, it was Bonaventure Habimana who spoke.  He was the dean of the MRND membership, at least insofar as the people who were present at that political rally were concerned.  He was the oldest member.  
Q.	And were there any other speakers that you can recall on that day?  
A.	No one else spoke.  The rally was chaired by the chairman of the party, who took the floor.  There were entertainment groups to make the ceremony more pleasant.  Afterwards, we went home.  
Q.	And did any of the speakers refer to the Tutsi?  
A.	Well, he talked about the enemy.  He talked about opposition parties and accomplices.  That is what was said during the rallies.  
Q.	And who are you speaking of when you say "he"?  Who talked about those things?  
A.	It was the national chairman, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  It is he who said this to the participants at the rally.  He was the senior -- or most senior official of the MRND.  
Q.	And can you tell us, to the best of your recollection, what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said on that occasion?  
A.	He made a long speech.  I cannot remember all the details.  What I do know is that it is he who chaired this rally.  If you are asking me to remember the entire speech, I cannot remember everything.  He just said, "Mr. Chairman," or "Your Excellency," or something like that, "we're going to support you.  We're going to fight those who oppose our party.  We're going to fight the enemy."  There were Interahamwe in the rally, and they sought to show how strong they were.  But I cannot remember all the details.  
Q.	And was there any reference to exterminating the Tutsi?  
A.	No.  I said that Mathieu is an intelligent man.  He didn't say this explicitly.  I have always said that Rwandans like to speak in riddles.  Those who wish to analyse the speech will be able to know what it does mean.  
Q.	Now, did anyone else at the rally at Amahoro stadium make any reference to the Tutsi or to exterminating the enemy?  
A.	I told you that there was a set procedure that we followed during rallies.  It is the party chairman who was supposed to chair the rally.  In a popular rally, all we did was listen to what the party chairman was saying.  We did not focus on the details.  He said, "Your Excellency, Mr. President, we support you.  We are prepared to fight opposition parties, accomplices, and the enemy."  It is Mathieu Ngirumpatse who said that.  
Q.	My question was, did any of the other speakers who spoke that day make any reference to the Tutsi?  
A.	No.  During that political rally, there was no mention of Tutsi.  That word was not mentioned there.  
Q.	And during this time, in late 1993 or early 1994, the MRND was dealing with opposition parties who wanted power; correct?  
A.	Yes, you're right.  
Q.	And the government was also dealing with the RPF, which had attacked Rwanda; correct?  
A.	The Rwandan government and the RPF had signed an agreement -- power-sharing agreements had been signed.  So I wonder that you say that the Rwandan government was fighting the RPF.  
Q.	Well, hadn't the RPF violated ceasefire agreements on at least three or four occasions prior to 6 April 1994?  
A.	Before the 6th of April 1994, I do not know how the RPF had violated these agreements because I was not a member of government.  I, therefore, could not know whether or not the RPF had violated these agreements or whether it was the government that had refused to have the agreements implemented.  
Q.	Well, you know that the RPF attacked in 1991, 1992, February of 1993.  You do know that, don't you?  
A.	I know that in 1991, the RPF was attacking, but in 1992 and 1993, the government and the RPF were negotiating.  I thought the negotiations were supposed to lead to something.  All Rwandans knew that the government and the RPF were negotiating so as to see how to share power.  
Q.	And in February 1993, despite the existence of a ceasefire, the RPF attacked Rwanda; correct?  
A.	I don't know very well if the RPF violated a ceasefire.  I'm not a spokesman for the RPF.  I know that the RPF had occupied part of Rwanda.  The Rwandan government occupied the rest of the country.  So I don't know if it was the RPF who violated the ceasefire or if it is the Rwandan government who went to attack the RPF in those parts that they held.

1015H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Really, Witness UB, you -- is it because you're presently held as a prisoner in Kigali, where the government is controlled by the RPF, that you're giving such absurd answers?  It seems like every Rwandan knows that it was the RPF who attacked in February of 1993.  Now, are you simply giving us these answers because you're afraid of the repercussions to yourself because you're in prison in Kigali? 
A.	I -- no -- no, I don't think everybody knew of that state of affairs.  You say that I am imprisoned in Kigali and, consequently, must defend the RPF.  I say no.  If you heard over Radio Rwanda that the RPF had violated the ceasefire, people listening to the RPF radio heard that it was the government who violated the ceasefire.  So I can't conclude as to whether it was the RPF or the Rwandan government had violated the ceasefire.  The position I held did not make it possible for me to determine which party had violated the ceasefire. 
MR. MORLEY:
May I just offer a thought, with the witness taking off his headphones, please. 

With some delicacy, again, flowing on from yesterday's thoughts at the conclusion of the day's business, is this line of enquiry about the history of RPF attacks in Rwanda the sort of line of enquiry which my learned friend may not need to pursue with this witness?  It might be thought that, to review the history of when and where the RPF attacked Rwanda with Witness UB, who's a witness who gives evidence about his association with the MRND and how it worked, it might be thought that this is an unnecessary line of cross-examination with this witness.  

I can imagine there are other witnesses that can be asked about this.  There are experts who got a knowledge of the history of Rwanda, but it might be asked to what issue does this line of enquiry go with this witness.  It could be thought it's a bit oblique.  

I don't know what's in Mr. Robinson's mind, and I may be speaking entirely out of turn, and it may be that he's got a very good answer and I'll be embarrassed, but I do wonder if this is an example of how we can speed things up. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, this goes to the witness's credibility, and he's obviously -- the question of whether or not the RPF attacked in February of 1993, and his answer to that, I think, will go to his credibility.  But I'm ready to move on, anyway, so I'm prepared to do that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, we're now going to speak about some meetings that took place in Nyamirambo stadium in the fall of -- in the late 1993 and early 1994.  And the first of these was a meeting at which 
	Froduald Karamira spoke and took place after the death of the president of Burundi.  And you've told us that you attended that meeting personally; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And do you know which party organised that meeting? 
A.	I don't know which party took the initiative to organise that rally, but I know that the Kigali MRND president had told him that -- Mathieu Ngirumpatse that all MRND party members join the members of all other parties at the regional stadium in Nyamirambo. 
Q.	And was there a march -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We've lost you, Counsel, sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was there a march leading up to the stadium before that meeting? 
A.	Yes.  The political parties organised the march from Kigali town centre all the way to Nyamirambo through Nyarugenge, Nyakabanda, all secteurs of Kigali town on the way to the regional stadium. 
Q.	And did Mr. Ngirumpatse participate in that march?  
A.	No.  Neither did he take part in the march or in the rally. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera take part in the march? 
A.	Nor did he -- he -- he was not -- he was not -- he did not attend. 
Q.	I'm going to direct your attention to -- going to read from -- read to you from a report of 
	Massamba Ndiaye, this crime analyst for the Office of the Prosecutor, who interviewed you in February of 2005, and item number 13 -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe it would assist if we just gave the witness a copy of the statement.  That was done in the past with other exhibits, and the witness seems to be able to read French.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I can do that, Mr. President, if you'd like. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, Mr. President, I don't have a hard copy of the French version of that present.  Maybe the Prosecutor has the -- that that they can provide to the witness.  I just have the English here and electronic copies of French. 
MR. MORLEY:
As always, there are some slight markings on this and bracketing, which I had marked, but there's no highlighting.  And the bracketing related to another defendant, which has got nothing to do with what my learned friend is asking about.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, these -- this report has different paragraphs that have numbers next to them, and I would like you to try to find number 13.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, where can I find it?  
MR. ROBINSON:
This is a statement of 27, 2000 -- 27 February 2005 by Massamba Ndiaye, crime analyst. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, does it have a number on your exhibit list? 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's not the tab -- it's part of the witness statements that's provided in the -- in the electronic form.  It's a witness statement for Witness UB.  It's not an exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It's in the Prosecution case file.  If you go to the folder that's entitled "Rule 66 Disclosures," there should be a whole folder for UB, and you'll find all of the statements in that folder. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 	 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, have you located the paragraph that is number 13? 
A.	Yes, I see the paragraph.  
Q.	And I'm going to read you the English, so tell me if this is what you have also.  It says, "According to the witness, following the assassination of President Ndadaye, he took part in a protest march, which continued as far as Nyamirambo regional stadium.  M. Ngirumpatse, J. Nzirorera," and some other names listed, "among others, took part in the march." 

Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you tell the Office of the Prosecutor that Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Nzirorera had taken part in this march? 
A.	From what I understood, I think I was told that Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera had played a part in the march.  I never said they took part in the march, but Ngirumpatse gave us the permission to organise such a march, authorised it.  I also said that after the march it was Jean Habyarimana, president -- Kigali president of the MRND, took the -- spoke.  I remember that that is what I stated.  It was he who spoke at the rally on behalf of the MRND party.  

As to this report, prepared by people from the OTP, perhaps I made a mistake or didn't explain myself correctly.  It's possible that I'd be mistaken, but I subsequently remembered that Ngirumpatse never came to the rally held at Nyamirambo regional stadium.  As regards Nzirorera, I do remember I didn't say anything concerning him.  
Q.	If you look at the same document, just three paragraphs below the one we just read, it's also part of number 13.  Did you not also say Ngirumpatse also made a speech and delivered a similar message, but the witness does not recall his exact words? 
A.	I see Nzirorera's name in this report.  I see references made to the rally, Semanza.  I think that under 113, I say that Ngirumpatse spoke at the Amahoro rally.  But as regards the Nyamirambo rally, I never said that Ngirumpatse spoke.  In any case, he never came to Nyamirambo stadium. 
Q.	Let me just read this to you, and then we can end on this note.  According to the witness, following the assassination of President Ndadaye, he took part in a protest march, which continued as far as Nyamirambo regional stadium.  M. Ngirumpatse, J. Nzirorera, F. Karamira, J. Mugenzi, 
	J.B. Barayagwiza, and F. Ndahimana, among others, took part in the march.  At the stadium, a rally, which was broadcast on the radio, was held, during which Mugenzi said the Tutsi will capture the country if we do not oppose him (sic).  He added, "If Hutus do not stand up, the Tutsis who killed Ndadaye will also kill our president."  

"As for Karamira, he spoke about Hutu Power, meaning the unity of Hutus to fight against the enemy.  Ngirumpatse also made a speech and delivered a similar message, but the witness does not recall his exact words."  

So, Witness UB, is that what you told the Office of the Prosecutor about this rally in Nyamirambo stadium? 
A.	At this juncture I should like you to distinguish between different types of rallies and meetings held at Nyamirambo.  I know I spoke of the rally held at Nyamirambo in which the people I've referred to took part, led by Jean Habyarimana.  

As to Semanza, myself, I think you are confusing matters.  Many rallies were held at Nyamirambo stadium.  It is not easy for me to identify each one so as to say in detail what was said.  I know that the parties met in Nyamirambo.  There was Barayagwiza, members of the PDC, and other political parties.  I am not defending the Office of the Prosecutor that prepared this report, but I know that they could have gotten mixed up between rallies.  I know that, in any given court, there might be three rallies at Nyamirambo, one chaired by -- there was one chaired by Ngirumpatse, Mathieu, another led by Jean Habyarimana, and that is when Karemera (sic) took the -- spoke to speak (sic) of power.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if you would like to take the break now, I can do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  We take our midmorning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1033H to 1110H) 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, we're speaking of the rally of the 23rd of October 1993, at which Froduald Karamira made his speech about power.  And we were speaking of those who attended and who also addressed that gathering.  Now, I showed you -- it's not necessary for you to look at the document anymore, so can you return that to the registrar?  

Now, I showed you what had been reported by the Office of the Prosecutor, that you said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had spoken during this meeting.  And that's -- you made that statement in 2005, at least as far as it was recorded by the Prosecutor in February 2005.  

Now, I'm going to read to you a short paragraph from the amended indictment in this case of 
August 2005, because paragraph 25.1 says that "On or about 23 October 1993, in particular, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, among others, participated in a rally at Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali where they made speeches that characterised the Tutsi as accomplices of the enemy."  

And my question to you is to clarify, once and for all, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse attend that rally and make a speech? 
A.	I said that I remembered that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was at the Nyamirambo rally and that he stated that they would not agree to be part of the government because the Tutsis had received many -- had been granted many positions in government.  I said that Mathieu took the floor during the Nyamirambo rally, but it is not at this same rally that Karamira said what I referred to.  It was not at that same meeting that Mathieu took the floor -- or, at that same rally that Mathieu took the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'll make an unwelcome comment, that I would ask the Prosecutor to consider withdrawing paragraph 25.1 from the indictment in light of the witness's change in -- in position, or perhaps a mistake in the first place, in what the witness was recorded (sic) to have said.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, if you could tell us if Justin Mugenzi was present at the rally at which Froduald Karamira spoke.  
A.	Justin Mugenzi, who was representing the PL party, was present. 
Q.	And did he make a speech? 
A.	Yes.  The representatives of the political party spoke on behalf of their respective parties.  As I told you, Habyarimana spoke, Froduald Karamira spoke, and other representatives of political parties took the floor at this rally. 
Q.	My question was, did Justin Mugenzi make a speech? 
A.	I said that he also made a speech during that rally. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the witness could be shown a Prosecution exhibit, and it's P. 5.  It's a transcript of the speech of Froduald Karamira on the 23rd of October 1993, and it's found in tab 147 of the Prosecution's exhibits.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	While that's being distributed, Witness UB, we can agree, can we not, that Justin Mugenzi was from the PL party, correct? 
A.	Yes, Justin Mugenzi was in the PL party.  
Q.	Now, directing your attention to the transcript of the radio broadcast that day, which includes Karamira's speech, I'd like you to go to page 5 of the Kinyarwandan, which the page numbers are on the bottom right-hand side.  And for the English this is -- 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	For English it can be found at K0271031 and -32.

Now, when -- at the end of his speech when Froduald Karamira is using the term "power" as it -- on page 5, he speaks of MRND Power; and then on page 6, CDR Power; and on page 6 also, MDR Power, Interahamwe Power, JDR Power.  Nowhere in this speech does he speak of PL Power; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you're right.  That is what I see here. 
Q.	And I put it to you, Witness UB, that Justin Mugenzi never attended this rally of the 23rd of October and never made any speech at this rally.  Do you have any comment to that? 
A.	I do not know who prepared this document.  I do not know whether it is you or someone else.  If it is you who prepared the document, perhaps that is the way you saw things.  But I am telling you that, during that rally in question, Justin Mugenzi took the floor.  He was present.  

I do not know the person who transcribed this.  Perhaps the person did so deliberately.  But I know that all the heads of political parties took the floor during that rally.  The fact that PL Power is not mentioned means nothing.  He didn't mention PDI Power or PSD Power.  That is how Karamira chose to express himself.  He did not enumerate all the 15 authorised political parties.  All I know is that he was present, that he represented the PL party, as he represented other -- as other heads of political parties were representing their parties.  This is something I can confirm.  This is not information I obtained from a third party.  
Q.	Witness UB, I'll assure you that the transcripts of the radio broadcasts that you're seeing were actually transcribed by the Office of the Prosecutor and provided to us, so you need not fear that I've misrepresented anything with (sic) connection with those transcripts. 
Now, I want to turn to another meeting that was held at Nyamirambo stadium on the 7th of November 1993, and this was a rally of the MRND.  And you were asked about this on direct examination.  I'd like you to have in front of you Exhibit D. NZ14, which is the Kinyarwandan version of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech, and I'll be referring to D. NZ51, which is the English version.  

Witness UB, directing your attention to Exhibit D. NZ14, which is a transcript of exactly what Mr. Ngirumpatse said -- this is one of the few occasions when we actually have the exact words, so we don't have to rely on people's memories.  What I would like you to do is look at that speech and tell us if anywhere in that speech you find anything that indicates that he's advocating the extermination of the Tutsis, either directly or indirectly.  
A.	You are saying that this speech comes from the Office of the Prosecutor, and you're asking me to tell you whether Ngirumpatse called for the extermination of the Tutsis.  If the Prosecutor obtained this speech, he must have done so from Mathieu's office or from the MRND offices.  You must make a difference between the transcript and the speech itself.  I do not know whether it was Mathieu who prepared the speech before he made it before the MRND membership or whether he wrote down this speech after the party rally.  So I cannot accept this document as evidence, and I cannot agree that he did not say that the Tutsis could not be part of government.  

I have told you that Mathieu is an intelligent man.  Sometimes he speaks in riddles.  Sometimes he speaks directly, but he chooses his words carefully.  I say that Mathieu never said that the Tutsis should be exterminated, but, to my recollection, to the best of my recollection, he did say that he would not accept Tutsis as part of the government.  So this bit of evidence does not in any way alter the evidence I've given.  I gave that statement according to what I heard Mathieu say.  So you must study Mathieu's speech and all the documents, and you will realise that -- you'll realise what Mathieu said and what he actually meant.  You're a legal professional, so consult the speech, analyse it, and then draw your conclusions as a jurist. 
Q.	Well, Witness UB, first of all, we have the tape of the speech -- videotape.  You can look at it yourself, if you'd like, so we know that these words were spoken by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  You can watch it yourself, see that he's speaking these words.  So there's no manipulation.  That doesn't work.  

Now, as to your recollection as to what is said at these different meetings, you've been giving a lot of testimony about what you heard, what you understood.  But now we have a situation where we actually have a very reliable source to know what was said at a meeting.  We have those exact words.  And, frankly, I don't find the word "Tutsi" anywhere in Mathieu's speech.  So I'm asking you to look through the speech -- it's in front of you -- and tell me what you meant when you gave your direct testimony that at this meeting Mathieu Ngirumpatse said he would never accept to share power with the Tutsi.  
A.	The speech that Mathieu Ngirumpatse wrote after what was said at this rally was based on an objective.  You say you have a tape, but you cannot prove to me that this tape was recorded live and that it contains all the details.  I think these were tapes that were recorded by people who were supposed to make changes to them.  So you can take a tape and try to change -- change it, or to highlight some things.  So when you refer to a tape, I do not know whether such a tape is an original.  

The last time I told you that Mathieu is a -- an intelligent and clever man and that when the interim government went into exile, it took everything with it.  So I cannot trust this speech because it was prepared by Mathieu to be pre -- to be presented in evidence if he ever were charged.  

So when I was referring to what he said, I am referring to what he said and not what he wrote down.  He said that the MRND could never agree to be part of government in which the Tutsis had many positions.  This is what he said in the original stadium of Kigali, that is, in Nyamirambo.  I was not the only person who was present at that rally, which is why I am confirming to you that this is what was said.  

If you are going to contradict me, you are entitled to do so, and I quite understand.  But I insist that this speech was made.  He said that the RPF had five positions and that the PL had three, which was a total of eight.  So I cannot trot -- trust this speech that Mathieu and his henchmen prepared to change the version of fact.  So I maintain that Mathieu did say what I say he said, and I have nothing to add to this speech. 
(Pages 15 to 22 by Ann Burum)

THE WITNESS:  (Continuing)
When I read this speech, it is easily obvious that it contains nothing bad, but I will tell you that Rwandans speak in riddles.  If you take this speech and you try to analyse it, you could change things in it.  So he said these things.  I heard this from -- I heard him say it.  There were many members of the public present, and the proof is that the government that he was opposing was never actually set up. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness UB, I don't think it's wise for us to discuss a transcript of a speech which you don't accept, so I'm going to move on to the next meeting that occurred at Nyamirambo stadium in January 16th of 1994.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And we have a transcript of this speech as well; it's Exhibit P. 14.  And I would ask that Exhibit P. 14A be given to the witness, which is the Kinyarwandan version.  And if P. 14C could be brought to me, that's the English version, I would appreciate that.

Q.	Witness UB, the -- what's been placed in front of you, Exhibit 14A, is a Kinyarwandan version of a broadcast that occurred on Radio Rwanda on the 16th of January 1994, and within this broadcast there is a short excerpt of a speech that was given on that day by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And I'm going to -- I think the easiest thing for me to do is simply read you the portions of the speech, because I don't know exactly where in the Kinyarwanda transcript this is, but it's on page 11 of the English transcript, and it's titled, "Speaker:  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, president of the MRND."  

"In our opinion, there will be peace of the people come together to discuss the problems, if there is an equitable power sharing without any threats, as is the case today.  As I have said, we have accepted the Arusha Accords and to participate in a government so that the Rwandans live in peace.  We abide by our commitment.  However, I added that there is no law that compels a political party to participate in or remain in the government.  Nothing has, therefore, compelled us to accept that, but we are in search of peace and we shall defend it.  

All members of the MRND stand not to create trouble, just as they do not wish to be aggressed.  As for those that want to tell the United Nations --"
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm not following this in the English translates.  Are we reading from the same thing or is this a separate translation again?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm reading from page 11 of the Prosecution's Exhibit 14C. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	"As for those that want to tell the United Nations and the representative of the Secretary-General that the MRND was ready for war, that the MRND was distributing weapons here and there, that the MRND -- one gives the impression that we are working harder and that every day we engage in military training."  And he laughs.  

"Those people who hackney such rumours, just as in 1961 and 1962, will bear the consequences of such rumours.  We, therefore, think that such lies should cease.  The MRND is the spearhead of the parties that supported the deployment of the United Nations' troops.  Furthermore, we were the ones that proposed our assistance for the success of their mission so that by the time they leave, we would have ended the elections.  We abide by that commitment, and we are truly going to support them.  However, we call upon them not to lend any credence to the lies propagated by certain people, not to succumb to the distraction of certain people that claim we are preparing for attacks and murders, whereas it is the same people that are concocting lists of people to be murdered.  We call on them to be vigilant so that these people concoct while saying that we are the ones that have criminal intentions with the risk of seeing the truth too late." 

Now, Witness UB, in your direct examination you said that you understood from this speech that there had been mistakes made in 1959 by only targeting the men and that this time the Tutsi should be prevented from returning by killing the women and children.  Now, can you tell me where in this speech you got that from?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
While the witness is answering, could the registry provide me with a copy of Prosecution 14C, please?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I just took the copy from the registry, so I'll have the registrar give it to you, because I'm finished using it.  
THE WITNESS:
I said that the speech there is a written document written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  If I said that we must not commit the same mistakes as those committed in 1959, that can stand alone.  

In 1959 the Tutsi fled from the country, and in 1961, I think, Mathieu knew what he meant -- knew what he meant because he was a great politician.  So this document you provide as proof that Mathieu had called on the people to co-habit peacefully must be a speech addressed to international community, which doesn't prevent him when he got home to have criminal intentions.  

I am not a jurist.  I cannot analyse the speech and draw any conclusions from it.  The question you might put to me is to know whether if what I said Mathieu had said was said or not, that he couldn't tolerate the establishment of that government and indeed the government that he contested was never established.  But I cannot analyse -- I don't have the tools to analyse the speech by Mathieu.  Maybe he used it to try and defend himself. 

I tell you that he said what he said at a political rally.  You are contradicting me.  All well and good, that's up to you, but don't ask me to change my mind as to what I have said in my testimony.  And you can't disagree with that.  What he said at political rallies and what he said in other places and times were perhaps different.  The Interahamwe were undertaking acts of violence, and he never condemned them.  This speech that you say he drafted, maybe he drafted it in his office for the purpose of defending himself.  I didn't know that questions would put to me regarding those speeches; otherwise, had I known that, I might even have made my own recording of those speeches. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, Witness UB, for your information these -- what I read to you was broadcast on Radio Rwanda on the 16th of January 1994.  It wasn't something that was written in Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's office.  And the point is that every time we find a transcript or a broadcast of a speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse or even President Habyarimana, it doesn't agree with your version of what was said.  And I'm giving you an opportunity to explain to the Trial Chamber why it is that you claim at this meeting in January of 1994 Mathieu Ngirumpatse was calling for the extermination of Tutsis when, in fact, the actual broadcast of what he said makes no reference whatsoever to anything like that.  So can you explain yourself? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
You know, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this way of posing the question puts the witness at a disadvantage.  Quite frankly, I have the transcripts in front of me, and I have difficulty following the questions coming from the Defence.  Number one, if we're talking about the meeting of the 7th of November 1993, which was the -- 

Mr. Witness, if you could remove your headphones, please. 

I believe in the witness's previous response he put in question the accuracy of the transcript for the 
7th of November 1993 rally.  And that was a very perceptive comment on the part of the witness, because that transcript, even though it was provided by the Prosecutor, comes from the MRND, in fact.  That was a videotape that was recorded and commercially released by the MRND.  The Prosecutor came in possession of that, transcribed it, and now served it to the Defence.  

So if the witness is questioning the accuracy of that transcript, he has every right to do so.  And the fact that it comes from the Prosecutor doesn't mean that it didn't originate with the MRND.  

And now with respect to the rally on the 16th of January, I have trouble following the question by reading it, and I have the transcripts in front of me.  I think the fairest thing to do is to give the witness time to review the actual tape or the actual video recording, and that's something that can be done over the weekend.  And Mr. Robinson can continue his questioning along these lines on Monday morning.  But you cannot take snippets of a speech and then ask the witness to recharacterise it or recharacterise his answer.  These were speeches of 28 to 30 minutes long.  And if we want to be fair to the witness and really get at the truth of the matter and have an accurate understanding of what the witness is trying to say, then he should be given an opportunity to review the entire content of the videotape in its original form.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I could just say that that's an interesting observation since Mr. Morley in his direct examination did exactly what I did, took portions of the speeches where we had transcripts and put questions to the witness based on what was contained in those transcripts.  So perhaps that was advice that Mr. Webster should have given to his colleague before we began, rather than making it as an objection.  

I have no problem if this witness wants to review the -- the transcript or the video.  In fact, I would like him to do that.  We can ask some more questions about that on Monday after he's had a chance to do that.  So I do accept that suggestion and ask that the registrar facilitate the witness being shown 
Exhibit P. A -- P. 12A, B, and C, which is the video of the Nyamirambo meeting of the 7th of November.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My recollection is that Mr. Morley asked a very different type of question.  He took a portion of the transcript and asked the witness to comment on it.  My understanding of Mr. Robinson's question is where in the transcript does Mr. Ngirumpatse say thus and such, which is an entirely different thing.  So they're two different types of questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar will be directed to facilitate the witness viewing the video.  

Can we move on?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, since you attended so many rallies of the MRND leading up to April of 1994, and since you observed so much activity engaged in by the Interahamwe, including violence, possession of weapons, et cetera, was it clear to you that by April of 1994, the Interahamwe were responsible for violence and threats against Tutsis? 
A.	In April 1994, I saw Tutsi killed by Interahamwe.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, did you -- were you able to verify the consistency of the exhibit with the electronic, 
tab 152? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
They may be transcripts of the same speech, but they are definitely different recordings -- different transcripts.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you see, the difficulty which you appear to have, we have as well.  I am proposing that over the weekend if some method could be made to -- to verify -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yeah, I will certainly look into it.  It's not something I can do right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping).  I just wanted you to know that we have the same problem.  Mr. Webster, the problem was that the electronic version of the transcript was not identical with the hard copy which you produced, which the registrar has, so we -- we want to get that verified.
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand that.  I actually -- that's why I asked to see the hard copy myself because it didn't match with mine either, so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm afraid we have a request for a short break from the witness.  So we will rise for a few minutes. 
(Court recessed at 1153H) 
(Pages 23 to 27 by Sherri Knox) 






(Court resumed at 1201H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, during the brief adjournment I had a look at the paperwork.  It appears that the document put in front of the witness with regard to the 16th of January speech by Ngirumpatse is tab 153.  That's where the confusion arose.  In tab 152, we have a fuller version of the speech of Ngirumpatse, and what troubles me -- and this is why I'm on my feet, not merely to correct the tab number -- is the witness may be forgiven for thinking, having had the document put in front of him by Mr. Robinson, that the quote that Mr. Robinson offered was all that Ngirumpatse said.  That is not so.  We see in tab 152 the length of the address by Ngirumpatse, and we see in 153 that the material is a series of observations by journalists, with snippets of the different politicians' speeches.  And one snippet is a snippet by Ngirumpatse.  

It troubles the Prosecution that the best evidence was not put in front of the witness.  There have been a number of difficulties which have been emerged gradually with some of the exhibits offered by Mr. Robinson.  For example, there was the Canadian judgement, which was just a series of snippets of a snippet.  There was also the power structure of the MRND, where items three and four on the first page did not originate in the 1991 statutes.  And now we have an important speech, the speech of the 16th of January, being offered to the witness for comment in order to demonstrate nothing unpleasant on the part of Mr. Ngirumpatse, but being offered to the witness in such a way that the witness may have been misled into thinking that that is all that was said, when it is a matter of record known to Mr. Robinson and known to Your Honours that that is not all that was said.  So I'm on my feet, unhappily again, simply to fire another shot across the bow of Mr. Robinson. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that has been resolved to some extent. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because the registrar has been directed to show the video over the weekend.  For my sake -- for my purposes, the correction of the tab number was important because I don't know exactly what has got into Mr. Webster today, but he was very unusually reticent and -- because while I was having difficulty following the -- finding the passage at page 11, I could see him searching, as well, and he didn't object.  So I thought that there must have been an explanation which I couldn't see.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it's right to say that what was quoted at tab 153 is directly lifted out of the speech of Ngirumpatse, so we all recognised it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that, but we looked at the wrong tab, you see.  What I wanted to be satisfied is if the Exhibit D. NZ17 -- the exhibit number was -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
It's Prosecution exhibit, Mr. President, 14C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
14C.  So I just wanted, for my record, to be satisfied.  Was that -- was 14C actually in tab 153?  
MR. MORLEY:
Can I just pause there?  My understanding of 14C is that 14C appears in tab 152, and the document put in front of the witness was not 14C.  But Mr. Robinson is shaking his head. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you clarify that?  Mr. Registrar, could you assist us, please?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I can clarify that also.  Mr. Morley is not correct.  The Prosecution Exhibit 14C apparently comes from tab 153.  I thought that -- but the Kinyarwandan Prosecution Exhibit 14A comes from Exhibit 152 -- tab 152.  I think they were misfiling their exhibits at some point or something.  But you can look at Exhibit 14C and you'll see that it's not an exhibit -- not in tab 152, but it's in tab 153.  

But if I could say, I am really offended here by Mr. Morley.  This is the Prosecution exhibits.  During the -- Witness G, they chose to exhibit 14C as the version of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech.  What I did was simply use what the Prosecution had already laid a foundation for and had admitted into evidence.  Now, for Mr. Morley now to be complaining that that was somehow an inadequate portrayal of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech, the burden of that falls 100 per cent completely on him, because that was what he chose to offer as the excerpt or the record of that speech when he introduced it with the witness who was present.  So, to say that I am somehow misleading this witness by showing him some document that is incomplete is really unfair, because I showed him the very document that the Prosecution chose to use that they laid a foundation for during their examination.  

Now, over the weekend I'll go back and look at Exhibit 152 and see what Mr. Morley's fuller version contains, and I can reopen my examination on this point, but it's really unfair for Mr. Morley to criticise me for using his own exhibit and saying it's incomplete, and I don't appreciate that.  
MR. MORLEY:
We may simply be at cross-purposes, and I don't mean to offend my learned friend.  I can hear his anxiety rising in his voice.  Prosecution Exhibit 14 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I think I'd like to cut across this discussion at this stage.  I think the record is clear now -
 
MR. MORLEY:
It's not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not?  
MR. MORLEY:
No.  Prosecution Exhibit 14 ought to be the fuller version of the speech.  That is what was used during the course of the examination of G. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that's not exactly the problem.  The Prosecution Exhibit 14, is it all contained in one tab electronically?  
MR. MORLEY:
It should be in tab -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But is it?  
MR. MORLEY:
It should be in tab 152. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it is not -- 
MR. MORLEY:
What appears to have happened is that somehow, because there are versions of the same speech in tabs 152 and 153, and if you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I ask you:  Does tab 153 represent any exhibit that has been entered into evidence?  
MR. MORLEY:
It shouldn't.  What should be in evidence -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So why is it given to us as part of the Prosecution exhibit bundle?  
MR. MORLEY:
It appears to be a mistake which has arisen on the part of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of whom?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it may be the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but the registry did not prepare this electronic exhibit bundle. 
MR. MORLEY:
They lifted the -- it's nothing to do with the electronic exhibit bundle.  It's to do with -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but that's where my problem arose, you see --
MR. MORLEY:
Well, can I help Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
-- because in tab 152, the exhibit that was referred to doesn't exist.  It's been suggested that it's in tab 153, and I will verify that when I have some time. 
MR. MORLEY:
I can explain this, Your Honour, if you allow me to.  The exhibit which was offered by the registry is marked as an exhibit from 152.  That is a mistake.  The registry has lifted from the hard copy bundles prepared by the Prosecution a document which it has thought was the document being referred to during examination-in-chief of G from tab 153, mistaking tab 153 for 152.  And it's easily done because tab 153 is behind tab 152.  So, if you think that the tab begins with the front page, when in fact it begins at the last page, one can see how the mistake arises.  

To cut to the point:  The document which should be Prosecution Exhibit 14 is the full speech of Ngirumpatse which appears in tab 152.  The registry appears to have made a mistake in lifting from tab 153 and marking it as tab 152 the shorter version of the Ngirumpatse speech.  It's the sort of mistake -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, can I ask you, was that admitted in evidence?  
MR. MORLEY:
What was admitted in evidence -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  Was tab 153 admitted in evidence?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, it was tab 152.  And if Your Honour looks at what is marked by the registry on the document which was admitted wrongly, it's marked as tab 152, but it comes from tab 153. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I understand that.  If tab 153 was not admitted in evidence, why is it in the exhibit bundle, electronic exhibit bundle?  
MR. MORLEY:
What is in the electronic exhibit bundle is all the material which will be put in evidence, and it is not yet in evidence.  What is in evidence arising out of the examination of G ought to be tab 152.  So when my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, makes -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But just as a matter of interest, how do we distinguish -- when we review these matters, how do we distinguish what's been in evidence from what's not been in evidence?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will be assisted by the registry, who, of course -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registry is not present at our deliberations. 
MR. MORLEY:
No.  This goes back to something I raised right at the beginning of the trial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there an index or some document that we can use to just be accurate when we consider these matters?  
MR. MORLEY:
There isn't an index at the moment cross-referencing Prosecution exhibits or Defence exhibits with tab numbers or items which are produced from outside the original bundle.  Your Honour may remember at the beginning -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is that too much work?  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it's not too much work.  It hasn't had to be done yet, but Your Honour may remember at the beginning, and I was told it was inappropriate to raise it, that it would have been best if the exhibits, as they go to the registry, recorded exhibit numbers which reflect the tab numbers, because what is happening is we've got a sequential exhibit number as items are admitted which bears no immediate relationship to the tabs.  And that is where the difficulty is arising to Your Honours, as I predicted it would.  It seems to me that an index will, of course, be of assistance.  

But on the narrow point of Mr. Robinson's complaint, I hope he accepts that we're at cross-purposes.  I'm uneasy if he feels offended.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just take one moment to clarify.  The electronic exhibit bundle is simply an electronic duplication of what we produced physically, so those bundles over there have been scanned and have been provided to the Court and to the parties in electronic form.  Those are all the exhibits that the Prosecution anticipates will come in issue at some point during the trial.  What has been admitted is scanned into TRIM after the sessions, usually two or three days afterwards.  So, for example, in my record-keeping, I have an electronic file of everything that I'm getting directly from TRIM so I can see what the registry has admitted in evidence, and that's separate from the Prosecution case file which we all have. 

So with respect to the mix-up that we just encountered, what I believe -- and I'm simply repeating Mr. Morley's comment -- is that the registry may have mistakenly mislabelled what had actually been admitted in evidence.  What we had admitted as Exhibit 14 was the entire speech of Ngirumpatse.  What the registry did was take a separate tab and mislabel that as Prosecution Exhibit 14.  

So I think this is something that we can straighten out after the court session but, clearly, we were looking at different documents when the witness was testifying, because the Kinyarwanda original came from tab 152 but the English translation was taken from -- mistakenly taken from 153.  

But what I suggest as a matter of management is that the Trial Chamber coordinator, or someone from Chambers, actually creates a separate electronic file of everything as it is admitted in evidence.  I do that myself, so I have one file which is the scanned versions of things with the registry's markings on it, and that is separate from the Prosecution case file, which is simply an electronic scanned copy of everything you see on that cart over there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Mr. Robinson, we are going to stop at 12:30, whatever happens today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where are we now?  
MR. ROBINSON:
You mean how far have I gotten in my outline?  I'm on page 19. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, dear.  
JUDGE SHORT:
That's where you were yesterday. 
MR. ROBINSON:
No, I was at 17. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Seventeen.  So you have moved two steps ahead. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Some of these, my outline notes are very compressed, such as these meetings, and others, such as the events of April 1994, my outline is very explicit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to have to do something about this.  Mr. Webster, how many witnesses are we going to complete during this trial session?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Looking at the pace that we've been proceeding, Your Honour, I think two.  We had lined up eight witnesses.  We had, you know -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you think that figure is realistic?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I thought four was realistic. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, where we are now.  Let's move forward.  I want to know if there's any assistance the Court can give to guarantee that we accomplish something, something that is possible.  I'm not trying to force the impossible on you, but if you can agree what is possible, let's develop a time to ensure it happens.  
MR. WEBSTER:
At this stage I would like to ensure -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't necessarily mean to do it publicly.  Maybe -- you don't have to give your answer right now, but I'd like you all to think about it.  Let's identify what is really, realistically, possible. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It would be unrealistic to put over a witness that has travelled to Arusha twice before for the next trial session, so I think we have to make a commitment to finish at least two witnesses, this witness and Witness ALG.  It's unrealistic, to me, to send ALG back to Rwanda for the third time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fine.  So the -- I do not know if I should leave you all to speak alone over the weekend -- when we rise, and produce a timetable that will achieve that.  Would that be a reasonable thing to expect you to be able to do?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think what would be more reasonable is to direct someone from -- the Trial Chamber coordinator to sit with us right after this session concludes, and let's work it out, right now, immediately following today's session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that be acceptable to the Defence team?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Well, Mr. Robinson, let's see if you can use the remaining ten minutes effectively. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I can do that.  I don't know about "effectively", but I can use it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness UB, can you put your headphones back on?  Thank you.  

Witness UB, I was asking you that, by April of 1994, it was clear to you, was it not, that the MRND and the Interahamwe were the cause of threats and violence against Tutsi?  
A.	Yes, in 1994, the Interahamwe threatened the Tutsi in April; that was, they were killed, that is the Tutsi, and their bodies were strewn along the roads all over.  The Interahamwe were working with the soldiers to kill people. 
Q.	But even before 6 April you knew, from attending these meetings at which you say speeches were made, from observing the weapons of the Interahamwe, from your vast knowledge of the MRND and its operations, you knew before 6 April, even, that the MRND and the Interahamwe were responsible for threatening and committing acts of violence against Tutsis before 6 April, correct? 
A.	Yes, that's how it was.  It could be easily observed in the city of Kigali, where some people were killed and others had their houses destroyed.  Some even fled to other secteurs for refuge. 
MR. ROBINSON:
May the registrar show the witness what is Exhibit 10 in my packet of exhibits?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness UB, what has been placed in front of you is a transcript of Radio Rwanda cassette number 901, broadcast on the **************1994, which contains an interview with you.  Do you recognise -- well, first of all, do you recall being interviewed by Radio Rwanda on the ************1994?  
A.	I was interviewed on Radio Rwanda, yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
So at this time, Mr. President, I'll offer this as Exhibit D. NZ71, and ask that it be placed under seal since it identifies the witness by name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ71 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
And it's only in Kinyarwandan, so I'm going to try to go through this with the witness and have some English -- I'm not necessarily going to read the entire interview but excerpts of it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness UB, when we are discussing this document, let's try and omit the name of the secteur that you were the conseiller of.  Now, in this interview, is it true that you identified yourself and you said that to the radio announcer, that "You have just told me about security this week but it's not true because the security situation has lasted more than 10 days.  And that since" a certain person - and I won't mention his name because it may identify your secteur -- "has been killed, the killers are still unknown.  We've asked the brigade of ****************to conduct an investigation in view -- to know the origin of such a situation, and at this moment security is not good but we're trying to restore it in the secteurs."  

And then you were asked by the radio interviewer, it says, "He said that there was something that those who fled continued to say without substantial evidence.  They say that people who fled and the people who are threatened are coming from one ethnical group."  And he asked you, "What do you say on that?"  

And can you tell me from reading this transcript what you answered to that journalist?  
A.	The journalist put a question to me regarding security in my secteur, and I answered that there were some security problems, but that the competent authorities were seeking a solution to the problem.  He put a question to me as to how -- why people had left their homes following attacks by Interahamwe.  I couldn't go on the air and say that the Tutsis had fled their homes because they were being threatened by the Interahamwe or members of the CDR, but this did not prevent me from drafting a report that I sent to my superiors to explain the problem that existed and the people who had caused that problem.  So I did not want to say that such-and-such a group of people was threatening them, because it might have made the situation worse.  

And I informed the people in charge of security, but the bodies in charge of security did not do anything to solve the problem.  It transpired that they themselves were involved in this situation.  So I acted -- I responded as a figure of authority, which is why I said that we were doing everything in our power to re-establish security, but these people were of the same ethnic group and they were fleeing attacks that were targeting them. 
Q.	And isn't it true that you said that, "These people who fled, they can't show us who it is that threatens them," correct?  
A.	That is a problem because those people were saying that -- those people were saying that the conseiller was one of those who were threatening other people's security, whereas the conseiller should have been guaranteeing the security of people.  So somebody might say that you jeopardised his security and that you did nothing to save him.  If somebody is killed, you might be held responsible.  Sometimes there are figures of authority who are important in this situation and could not prevent other people from committing these acts.  

So, if I were accused of leading these attacks, it is because I was unable to do anything whatsoever to save these people.  But I'd informed my superiors of the situation, but they failed to do anything.  My superiors, that is, the bourgmestre and the préfet, cannot say that I did not inform them of this security problem that we were facing.  So that, I think, is the way the problem was.  There were problems with security in that secteur, as in other secteurs.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think I can go on with the remaining questions about this document on Monday, if you would like to take a break now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Today is Friday.  It is our adjournment for the weekend.  So we do take our day's adjournment now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
MS. HOUKPATIN:
Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  There is a problem with the identification of documents in the French translation.  The exhibit tendered by my colleague is not D. NZ75, but D. NZ71.  I just wanted to clarify this for the record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are saying that there was a translation problem in that.  Okay.  I trust that's sufficient to correct the record.  

Mr. Witness, I was just letting you know that you have come to the end of your testimony for this week.  We take our break now, and your testimony will resume on Monday morning.  I think I've advised you sufficiently as to your obligations about not discussing the matter during this or any other adjournment, and I require that you continue to observe those directions.  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Duffy will act on behalf of our trial coordinator when you try to discuss how the rest of the trial session will be played out, and I suggest that that could happen immediately after we rise now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I suggest a member of CMS participate in the discussion as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hometowu has also agreed to participate.  We take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1232H)
