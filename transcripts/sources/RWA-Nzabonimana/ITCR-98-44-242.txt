P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 27th February 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have appearances, please?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the parties of the registry.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, Ian Morley, Greg Lombardi, Takeh Sendze.  The record should also reflect the presence of Massambe Ndiaye, our crime analyst, and Elena Rubinov, our legal researcher.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am Mr. Felix Sow, assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva.  And Mr. Karemera is here with us, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we would like to welcome Mr. Karemera back to the trial, and we trust that his health has improved and he'll be able to sit through the proceedings without too much discomfort.  
MR. SOW:
Most obliged, Mr. President.  I should have liked, before we hear the witness, to make certain observations, with your leave, of course.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, one and all.  I am assisted by Anta Guissé for Ngirumpatse.  I'm Catherine -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
For the English speakers, that's Chantal Hounkpatin for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And good morning, Mr. President and members of the Trial Chamber, Peter Robinson, and Leopold Nsengiyumva, who will be joining us shortly for Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, Mr. Sow, there is something you wish to say to us at this stage?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, most obliged.  With your leave, I should have liked you to call upon the witness to take off his earpiece.  

Now, what I wanted to say was as regards the health of Mr. Karemera.  He should like, Mr. President, to thank you for everything you have done to improve his health and to enable him to be here this morning.  However, Mr. President, Édouard Karemera's Defence should like at this point to say that Mr. Karemera has never refused to attend court.  That issue is a matter of principle.  It's a matter of course, as you know, Mr. President, that the pain on the sciatic nerves and the secondary effects of the medication administered have been observed by the doctors, and Mr. Karemera was, and is still, in the situation of a patient.  

It is obvious, Mr. President, that Rule 82 bis had been changed since the 26th or 27th of May, 2003.  At the same time that same article, this is Article 15 bis of the same rules, has been changed.  You see that 15 bis that talks about the absence of the Judges also talks about ill health, and 82 bis wanted to sanction, and this is how Karemera sees it.  If you apply 82 bis, he believes that he's been punished, whereas he was sick, and so far as he's concerned and for the Defence, too, Mr. President, refusal to attend court is a voluntary act on the part of the Accused, and very often the Accused ask counsel not to represent him, and we have several cases, and those cases show -- especially those cases, disease is not voluntary.  We can all fall sick.  

The essential thing is that it is verified that the person in question is sick and that measures be taken, and that we -- moreover, Rule 82 says that we are in a joinder here, and even in a joinder the Accused still has his rights and, therefore, he believes -- and he is sick, and this is why he didn't attend court.  And he has asked counsel to represent him, and this shows that he is obedient.  

Now, if each and every time that we apply Rule 82 bis we are saying that the Accused don't have the right to be sick, and this is a precedent, it has tremendous repercussions.  And it is important at this time that this Chamber reviews its position on this issue.  And even if we were to talk about hypothesis in which Karemera said that he did not want to come to court or he refused to come to court, measures under 82 bis should be abided by, and at that level, Mr. President, there is a compulsory notification that the registrar should make to that effect.  Mr. Karemera was not notified to that effect, nor me.  

Talk about jurisprudence at this level, Trial Chamber II in Pauline Nyiramasuhuko rendered a decision on the 23rd of January 2006 concerning - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, I think you have represented to us in a manner which we understand what Mr. Karemera's position is.  I don't think you need to go to the second level of addressing jurisprudence at this point, because I think we understand the issue which is being made.  We had made it clear in our rulings that we made that we had not made any adverse judgments about Mr. Karemera's attitude, and continuing the proceedings as we did was not used as a sanction or as any punishment at all.  

You will recall that when we decided to proceed, that we tried to make steps to provide facilities and time for his defence, and I can assure you -- I would like you to assure your client that the Court has not made any judgement against him in this context.  We explained to you how we understood the term "refusal to," what meaning it had, and we did not consider that we had to determine whether the reason for his decision was a good reason or a bad reason, and we specifically said that we did not enter into a judgment of that issue.  

So, as far as his concern about the reputation that he has with the Court, the Court has made no findings that should put him into feeling that he's being -- had a judgment against him for which he's being punished.  That is certainly not the position that we have, and we have tried to explain it already, and I trust that this further statement will address the issue.  

Now, in terms of -- I don't know if you are going to deal with the question of redress but the issue is that those days have already past.  We are not going back to hear the evidence a second time.  And he's here now, and it's not really necessary to go into it at this stage unless another problem arises in the future, and at that time you can then make whatever submissions you have to make.  

I presume that his presence here today is an indication that his condition is at a level that he'll be able to continue during the course of this week.  So what we were thinking of proposing is that this morning we will take our mid-morning break at 11 o'clock, and for 30 minutes, and then we will resume to our normal scheduling.  We will resume at 2 o'clock this afternoon, and tomorrow morning we will start at quarter to nine and break at 10:30, and that would be within the two-hour limit which was recommended.  

If there's a problem with regard to the temperature and it is drawn to our attention, we will also try to see that proper adjustments are made to minimise any discomfort which he might experience in court.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I'm most grateful, especially for the good disposition of Chamber.  

Let me say something in terms of proposing how we can help him.  Now, so far as the massages, et cetera, are concerned, the work has been done but we would like to continue it.  Last time, I drew your attention to the fact that Mr. Karemera has persistent constipation and this results -- if this goes on, it will have -- it will affect his loins and his back.  And as was suggested by the doctor from Moshi, a scanner should be used and a scanner would determine the present problems, because I don't want him to fall sick once again because this can impede our procedure.  

I am most obliged to you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The registry will certainly be monitoring the situation, and if any assistance is needed, it can be referred to us through the registrar.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Can I just briefly be heard on this issue for less than two minutes?  I'd like to make a motion that the testimony that was taken last Thursday and Friday be stricken from the record, and my motion is based on the fact that we believe that the Trial Chamber in absentia last week, especially when it became aware of information that the medication that Mr. Karemera had taken was causing him to be unable to attend the proceedings and the Trial Chamber made no -- went ahead without making any enquiry to determine if that was, in fact, the case.  

By the time on Friday you received the medical report, you learned that, in fact, the medication had had the effect of making him unable to attend by being so drowsy and that the medication was, in fact, adjusted.  So I think -- it seems to me that we proceeded on Thursday and Friday under the mistaken or erroneous belief that Mr. Karemera was refusing to attend, when you didn't even have medical evidence to support such a finding.  

Now, the question is, what is the remedy for that?  We can certainly complain on appeal, at the end of the case, if there's a judgment against Mr. Karemera and the other Accused that the Trial Chamber proceeded in absentia and violated the rights of the Accused to be present under Article 24, but it seems wiser, since you can correct the problem now, to do so by requiring that the testimony be stricken from last Thursday and Friday and that testimony be given in the presence of Mr. Karemera.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours made a decision, the decision was that we proceed in absence.  It was a judicially-motivated decision.  Great care was taken to look after the rights of Mr. Karemera.  Enquiries were set in motion in relation to the medical circumstance.  The rules under 82 bis were carefully considered in the circumstances; the testimony was received.  

The motion my learned friend makes is after the fact.  The issue has been decided, and my learned friend is simply seeking to reopen it and have it reconsidered.  He basically wants Your Honours to say you were wrong.  It's my respectful submission that although Mr. Robinson fights the good fight, this is another motion which is perhaps misplaced.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could raise one point.  I'm a little bit concerned about the way we're proceeding with Mr. Robinson's application because I'm confused as to who is representing whom.  To me, I think we also have an issue of standing here.  If Mr. Karemera's attorney wanted to put on the record that he was somehow dissatisfied with the transcripts or his ability to review the proceedings from last week, that would be one issue, but I didn't hear a motion for -- to strike the testimony before it was trial in absentia coming from the Karemera Defence team.  And I think in terms of setting the tone and setting the way we proceed for the rest of this trial, there should be some discipline on the Defence side as well.  So I'm concerned about who is representing whom and whose applications are really before the Court in a way that is proper. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I simply wanted to say that I raise this issue concerning 82 bis because that rule should not have been applied.  Therefore, there is no problem where the motion of Mr. Peter Robinson is concerned that I support totally, sir.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, let me assure the Prosecutor that we are together here in the Defence, and that Mr. Robinson's motion is acceptable.  We support it.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, do you want to hear from me on this as to why I feel it's important?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you see, the point is we are going to rule on it; unfortunately, it's not in your favour because we have considered the application and we are going to deny it.  We think that the points that have been raised have been -- we considered this carefully already last week and we think that adequate facilities were granted to Mr. Karemera for -- and time to defend the issues which have arisen.  He is suitably represented by counsel, and other steps have been taken place which we think put him in a position to represent his interests properly in regard to the testimony that was given last week.  So we have decided to deny your application.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I understand.  If you feel it's necessary to have some discussion about the propriety of my making observations concerning what -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't think so at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have understood that Mr. Sow had, in fact -- I thought that Mr. Sow was addressing that issue, and it may very well be that when I cut him off, he didn't complete what he was going to say.  So we don't have a problem at this stage.  

Mr. Morley, are you ready to continue with your witness?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm always ready.  May I mention to Your Honour that as a result of the enquiry invited by the Court in relation to the court of appeal judgement which I set in motion -- I think on Thursday -- we have now received a fax copy of the 31-page court of appeal paperwork collection, which includes the motion filed with the court of appeal by those defending the witness.  I see he is not wearing his headphones -- he is wearing his headphones.  Can he take them off, please?  

We now have the 31 pages of paperwork, which include, as I know Your Honour will be familiar with from your elsewhere jurisdiction, the grounds of appeal which were filed and then the discussion about the receivability of the grounds.  And the decision of the court of appeal on the thirty-second page of the paperwork is dated the 11th of June of 1998, and as the witness has said, the court found that the grounds which were filed were unreceivable, which I think Your Honour may understand, in a different world, as being without foundation.  They were legal arguments filed, rather than arguments contesting the factual circumstances, inviting, basically, a fresh trial.  And the legal arguments -- and there were four -- are very briefly dealt with on pages 30 to 32.  

The document is in French, and has been distributed to my learned friends.  I've had it since quarter past nine this morning.  And I'm simply assisting Your Honours with what is a cursory glance over the document.  I may be entirely wrong in my assessment, but I hope that assists both the Court and my learned friends.  We now have the paperwork.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Morley.  Before the witness puts back on his headphone, we also think that we should make the ruling with regard to the application that was made concerning the admissibility of the Murambi and Kibungo meetings, which I can do now.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If it is a written decision, could the interpreters have a copy?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  While we just have a moment, I also would just like to raise the possibility with the Trial Chamber -- I see that occasionally you come in and read what appears to be a decision that's already in writing, and I was wondering whether the Trial Chamber might consider as a matter of practice, if you have a written decision, whether it can be actually issued in written form and distributed to the parties and put on the TRIM so that it becomes a better part of the jurisprudence, if it's already written out.  I understand that at certain times you'll make oral rulings that aren't in that form, but I would ask that the Trial Chamber consider, when making rulings which you've had the time to actually write it out, that the ruling be distributed to the parties, placed on TRIM.  Perhaps that would also save court time for you, not having to read it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The reason why we are doing it this way, frankly, is to deal with the issue of translation.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I understand, but even perhaps after you read it, it can be issued in written form and placed in the jurisprudence of the Tribunal.  I realise that most of these decisions are going against us and maybe we're not making very good jurisprudence, but I think it would help others to have the knowledge of what's been decided.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Robinson, what I should tell you is this, that we do have established in the Chambers a database on the oral decisions that have been issued in Karemera.  I am not quite certain whether that has been actually put on TRIM, but we can make enquiries.  And it would not be difficult for that to take place. 

Our oral ruling starts now.  

On 23rd February 2006, during the course of Witness UB's testimony, the Defence for Nzirorera raised an objection to the Prosecution leading evidence in relation to certain MRND meetings alleged to have taken place in Kibungo and Murambi in 1993.  

Relying upon a previous oral ruling of this Chamber, Mr. Robinson objected to the admission of the witness's testimony about the meetings on the basis that they were not contained in the indictment or in the pre-trial brief.  He submitted that the meetings constituted material facts which must be pleaded in the indictment.  Since they were not, the testimony of the witnesses in relation to those meetings should be excluded.  

Mr. Morley, for the Prosecution, opposed the objection, distinguishing the Chamber's previous oral ruling and also submitting that the Defence had given prior notice to the fact that the witness would testify to the meetings in question.  He referred the Chamber to the relevant disclosures outlining the substance of the evidence sought to be led in relation to each meeting.  The Chamber now delivers its ruling on the issue.  

Pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the rules, the Trial Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.  Although not specifically provided for by the rules, the Chamber has to exclude testimony when its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  The admissibility of evidence should not be confused with the assessment of weight to be accorded to that evidence, an issue to be decided by the Trial Chamber after hearing the totality of the evidence.  

The Chamber notes that the failure to specifically plead certain allegations in the indictment does not necessarily render the evidence inadmissible.  The Trial Chamber has the discretion under Rule 89(C) to admit any evidence which it deems to have probative value, to the extent that it be relevant to the proof of other allegations specifically pleaded in the indictment.  

Now, the Kibungo meeting:  In the Nyiramasuhuko Appeals Chamber decision, 2nd July 2004, the Appeals Chamber said that for an indictment to be pleaded with sufficient particularity, it must set out the material facts of the Prosecution case with enough detail to inform the Defendant clearly of the charges against him so that he may prepare his defence.  It also said that the required degree of specificity would depend very much on the facts of the case and the nature of the alleged criminal conduct.  

In the instant case, the Chamber has reviewed the indictment and the anticipated testimony of Witness UB, notably, the Prosecution's reference to K-numbers K0342146 and K0342147.  The Chamber is of the view that in relation to the evidence of the meeting in Kibungo, general allegations contained in the indictment, notably at paragraphs 24 to 26 inclusive, concerning MRND meetings and Ngirumpatse's alleged presence at such meetings, in conjunction with the notice of the facts contained in the witness statements disclosed to the Defence, in paragraph 12 of K0342146, renders the evidence admissible in its entirety.  

With regard to the Murambi meeting, with respect to the anticipated testimony of Witness UB concerning the rally in Murambi commune, the Chamber has reviewed the relevant paragraphs of the witness's statement in the context of the indictment.  The Chamber finds that evidence of the fact of the meeting having taken place and of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's presence as an alleged person at the rally may be led by the Prosecution.  Again, the general allegations in the indictment as well as the notice contained in the witness statement are sufficient for evidence of such a nature to be led.  However, the Chamber finds that the relevant statements concerning the naming at the meeting of persons married to Tutsi women and the fact of them having been killed by the Interahamwe subsequent to that meeting should have been specifically pleaded as material fact in the indictment.  

The Chamber notes that the Prosecution did not refer to any part of the pre-trial brief where this allegation was made.  In the circumstances, the Chamber considers the prejudicial effect of such evidence would highly outweigh its probative value.  Consequently, the evidence is inadmissible.  

The Chamber, therefore, upholds the Defence objection in part.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters found it very strainful.  Perhaps it would be advisable to supply them with a copy prior to decisions being rendered.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is noted.  
MR. MORLEY:
For my own purposes, so that I am not klutzy -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
So that I do not misunderstand Your Honours' ruling on trespass improperly, do I understand that in relation to Murambi I can lead from the witness the existence of the rally and the presence of Ngirumpatse?  And whether or not anti-Tutsi sentiments were expressed, although I should not lead from the witness the specificity of witnesses being identified and subsequently killed?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I can just be heard about that.  I don't think you can expect to have testimony as to the content, any reference to the content of those -- what was said there without cross-examination as to the details of what was said, and so to open the door by saying there's anti-Tutsi sentiments expressed is contrary to your ruling and I think is going to create a lot of problems for the Defence to cross-examine without violating your ruling.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I offer a thought?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we had looked at the disclosure to which -- the skeleton of the witness's testimony and there we are looking at the last paragraph -- the last paragraph on what was numbered in handwriting "19".  We thought that the fact of the speech by Gatete could also be addressed.  We thought the content of the speech was what had the problem.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I say I respectfully understand and agree?  My concern in relation to the two rallies is simply to set the scene for what was the later rally in October.  And it's all very well to establish on the record that there's a meeting in Murambi and that Ngirumpatse attends, but the point of establishing that on the record is to establish that it wasn't a happy meeting for relations between the Hutu and the Tutsi.  And what I'm trying to establish at the moment is the extent to which I can elicit from the witness that there was an unhappiness expressed between the Hutu and the Tutsi at that meeting as part of the general background, which leads on to the Kibungo rally.  

My learned friend's observation that he would then have to cross-examine in reference to the three named individuals, I respectfully submit is neither here nor there.  The question at the moment is, what is the evidence which should be before the Tribunal through direct-examination of the witness.  What Mr. Robinson does thereafter -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we understand your question.  

Mr. Morley, we thought that we had made it quite clear what we had in mind.  You see, we had in
fact -- we are not certain if it's the Trial Chamber's role to tell you exactly which sentences in the skeleton we thought were -- had crossed the line, because there were sentences at the bottom of the paragraph which, in our view, had crossed the line of what was permissible.  If I were to put it in general terms, we thought that the topic of the -- the topic that was addressed was admissible, to give a proper context and background to the meeting, but then there were allegations which named the people and said that they were killed, which specifically introduces the content of the meeting.  The content of that nature would certainly cross the line as to what was permissible. 
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully understand, and I think I understand quite clearly where the line is so that I believe I'm not going to get it wrong.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- yes, Mr. Robinson, do you also understand what we're driving at?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand what you're driving at, but I want to call something to your attention which I think is going back and emasculating your ruling in what you are explaining, because the content of this meeting -- as I understood from what you said that the evidence of the fact of the meeting and Mr. Ngirumpatse's presence could be led.  Now, if you -- now you seem to be saying that the content of the meeting, meaning what Mr. Gatete said -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, not what he said, what he spoke about.  You see, the problem we had was this, right, that there's a very ticklish distinction in giving evidence of what he spoke about and paraphrasing what he said, and that was the problem that we -- that was the narrow line that we're trying to cross.  We're not certain exactly in what language to use, because if he paraphrases the speech, then your point about opening for cross-examination becomes a real issue.  

At the same time, if you're going to say there was a meeting, you have to say what the meeting was about.  So that is what we thought was proper, stating what the meeting was about.  We thought that was proper.  We thought that the details of what was said, particularly in relation to what was alleged here, would cross the line of what was permissible.  But we didn't think that one could say that there was a meeting without saying what the meeting was about.  So Mr. Morley is going to have to be careful as to how he adduces that evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON:
What I would like to call to the attention of the Trial Chamber is that since Mr. Ngirumpatse is present at such a meeting, the Prosecution is trying to make the point of adoptive admissions, that what the meeting is about and the fact that he is present somehow means that he endorses or is responsible for what is -- what the content of that meeting is or what the meeting is about.  They have done that every single time.  

The best example of this is Mr. Karemera's presence at the meeting of the 23rd of October 1993, where the mere fact that he arrived at the end, they're trying to show that somehow he approved of the violence or the contents of what was said.  So it's a very slippery slope when you have an Accused present and you're trying to give any information about the contents of that meeting.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we think the jurisprudence is very clear that no convictions can be based on anything that occurred at that meeting.  If persons are giving testimony of a series of activities, some of the background activities, it is necessary to give context to the general background of what transpired.  And what we are permitting this evidence about is purely for the purpose of context and background information.  It has nothing to do with the specific charges in the indictment and cannot be used for that purpose.  I hope our decision made that clear as well.  But we think that it is necessary for matters to be placed in context, and that is what we're permitting.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I understand that, Mr. President, but I think that the jurisprudence, that when you look at all the various rules that provide for evidence of context and background, exclude acts and conduct of the accused.  You have that in Rule 92 bis.  You have that for judicial notice.  You have that for expert testimony in general.  So, now, when you have a meeting where the Accused is actually present, it seems to me you should not allow any evidence of substance to come in where it involves the act and conduct of the Accused on the rubric of background and context.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, the problem, in my view, I don't think that you would have raised this argument if Mr. Morley had not used the unfortunate phrase "anti-Tutsi speech", because what the topic was here, as far as I've seen from the -- was not exactly that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think we have to see what happens.  I would also point out to the Trial Chamber that the witness is not going to simply provide a read of what's here.  We are running a danger here that it's going to be very difficult to confine the testimony to what you're expecting, but I guess we can try, and I'll object. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think Mr. Morley would have -- I would expect that Mr. Morley has understood the perimeters that you have described and I expect him to control his witness.  

Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
If I may continue with the witness.  Before I do so, simply explain to Your Honours that when I take the witness through the events of 1994 to around July, I then propose briefly, if I can put it this way, to mop up on some matters which I missed.  I'd be going back to '92, then back up to '94.  It won't take long.  And it's in that context that we'll deal with those two rallies, so I won't be dealing with them now; it will be later.  
WITNESS UB
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on Friday you were helping us with what had happened on the 7th of April of 1994.  You told us about seeing 20 bodies, told us about the events at the JOC home, where there had been 80 young girls.  And you told us that you communicated with the Préfet Renzaho as to what it was that you had seen, and his response was simply to suggest that trucks should be obtained for the movement of bodies.  That is where we had got to on the 7th of April.  

Now, were trucks obtained for the movement of bodies and, if so, can you help us with who drove them?  Were you involved in driving them?  What was the movement of the trucks, if you have any information, please?  
A.	I said that after having informed the préfet of Kigali-ville about what happened, he said that he had sent trucks to all the various secteurs to pick up the dead bodies.  He did not say that he was going to get those bodies.  He ordered trucks to be sent to the various secteurs.  

So far as my area is concerned, I saw a Toyota truck driven by a policeman based in Kigali-ville.  There was a truck, and that truck picked up dead bodies.  Now, you are asking me whether I played any role in those activities, sir.  Since I was reassured by the implementation of my boss, that truck came by my residence and I dispatched it to areas where dead bodies were to be found.  And then, later, the people loaded the dead bodies on the back of the truck and they were taken -- the dead bodies were taken to the public cemetery.  We did that from 7th to the 30th of April.  I continued to see trucks from the préfecture, trucks from the ministry of public works.  All these trucks went up and down the city, collected dead bodies, sir.  
Q.	You've told us that you also saw trucks from the ministry of public works.  Can you help us with which party that minister was a member of who was helping with trucks for bodies?  
A.	This ministry was held by a PSD militant.  However, since the préfet of Kigali had oversight over all activities covering the town, the city, he had the power to order the movements of all vehicles, both state-owned and private vehicles.  Private vehicles could be commandeered at any time. 
Q.	And when you say a PSD militant, when you use the word "militant", are you referring to a member of the Power wing of the PSD or not? 
A.	On the 7th, those who were in power were militants of the Power wing.  It was the Power wing which had formed a coalition with the MRND.  So those who were in power were the militants of the Power wing that had joined forces with the MRND.  This, therefore, means that when President Habyarimana died, those militants who did not belong to the Power wing had no more power in -- wielded no more power in their respective parties. 
Q.	There having been trucks dispatched by the préfet and the ministry of public works, what activity did you indulge in thereafter on 7th of April?  Did you go about your secteur?  Did you stay at home?  Did you engage in meetings?  Help us with the rest of your day, please.  
A.	On the 7th I was in my secteur.  Like every conseiller, I was in the area, in the secteur which I controlled.  Each conseiller was supposed to stay in his secteur, to ensure compliance with the instructions issued by his superior.  This means that at the time I was trying to implement the instructions of my superiors.  This means that we were supposed to collect dead bodies.  And when I was doing that, I did not feel safe.  My security, my personal security, was threatened.  To go to some cellules in my secteur, I went through other secteurs like Nyakabanda and Gitega.  So that is where I was on the 7th.  I did not go to the préfecture office to meet the préfet as I used to do.  
Q.	Can you describe the scenes in the two secteurs you just mentioned?  You've told us you went through Nyata -- a secteur beginning with "N", and a secteur called Gitega. 
A.	Nyakabanda.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you describe the scenes?  Were there bodies on the streets or not?  Were there roadblocks?  What was the general appearance of Kigali that day when you moved through those two secteurs? 
A.	I went through Nyakabanda and Gitega secteur.  There were many bodies on the road.  These roads go through three or four secteurs, which means that I saw many dead bodies, bodies of men, women and children.  
Q.	Were there any roadblocks or were the roads open? 
A.	Roadblocks were set up as from the morning of 7th April, beginning with the secteur where I was.  There were roadblocks manned by Interahamwe and others manned by soldiers.  So there were roadblocks in Nyamirambo, Nyakabanda and Gitega.  Practically the entire city of Kigali was covered. 
Q.	You mentioned some roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe.  Did you observe whether any Interahamwe were armed with firearms at any of these roadblocks or not? 
A.	Most Interahamwe were carrying firearms.  I refer to the Interahamwe that I saw on roadblocks and those I saw along the road.  They were carrying guns.  I saw them everywhere in these secteurs. 
Q.	Do you have any information as to where those firearms that the Interahamwe were carrying had come from? 
A.	There was no doubt.  I never doubted that these firearms carried by the Interahamwe had been distributed from the MRND party.  I knew that these people, the people carrying these firearms, were very powerful in the MRND.  I had no doubt about that.  And I said at one point to the préfet that I did not feel safe.  He sent policemen to provide protection for me and my family. 
Q.	And what was your perception of what the Interahamwe, armed with their MRND firearms, were doing at these roadblocks? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Before that question is answered, I once again ask that Mr. Morley establish a foundation for the previous answer as to how this witness knew that the Interahamwe had received guns from the MRND party.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  I take the point.  With Your Honour's leave, I'll ask the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you help?  When you say you knew that the Interahamwe were carrying firearms distributed by the MRND, what was your source of information?  How did you know that?  Had you spoken with the Interahamwe?  Had you spoken with others who told you?  How did you come to this conclusion?  
A.	First, I was a member of the MRND party, and I was active in various organs of the party.  Secondly, I was one of the figures of authority who were responsible for security within the secteur.  I, therefore, had to do everything in my power to find out what was going on in my secteur.  So I found out that the Interahamwe were in possession of firearms from the information that I obtained within my secteur in regard to the presence of these firearms and the fact that the Interahamwe were carrying them.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, absent a better foundation than that, I'm going to move to strike the testimony.  
MR. MORLEY:
Steady on, Mr. Robinson.  There are other questions which can be asked.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You mention that this is information which came to you within your secteur.  Had you spoken with any of the Interahamwe in your secteur that day?  
A.	I said, as a figure of authority, responsible for the secteur, I was in a position to know what was going on there.  You know that there were Interahamwe leaders in my secteur.  I know -- I knew that they had firearms and I made a report to that effect before the president was killed, and I said, "Such-and-such a person is carrying a firearm."  So these were things that I saw for myself, with my own eyes.  The leader of the Interahamwe for Biryogo secteur was moving about with the firearm; so was his assistant or his deputy.  There was no other source, possible source for these weapons.  It was the ministry of defence that was the source of these weapons, and the MRND was working with that ministry. 
MR. MORLEY:
I see the time.  I'm just conscious of whether Mr. Robinson wants to bob up again and have another go.  I respectfully submit that's more than adequate foundation. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I do move to exclude this testimony.  He's just speculating that because the Interahamwe had weapons, they must have been obtained from the ministry of defence, they must have been involved with the MRND party.  So I'm moving to exclude the evidence on speculation.  If he's not spoken with anyone who told him this information, then I don't think it has sufficient probative value to be admissible under Rule 89(C). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have to postpone dealing with this until after the break, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the mid-morning recess at the moment.  
(Court recessed at 1100H) 
(Pages 1 to 15 by Karen Holm)



















(Court resumed at 1151H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, Mr. Witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, it occurs to me -- perhaps if the witness removes his headset.  Thank you.  

Can he remove his headset, Mr. Issa?  Thank you.  

Your Honours may recall there was a brief intervention from my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, before 11:00, and it had occurred to me that the interruption may be one which Your Honours would deal with, as it were, pretty quickly, and there's been 30, 40, 50 minutes since then.  I'm just slightly wary that Your Honours have thought too much on the matter.  Insofar as my learned friend -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must confess, actually, there was another activity which we had to attend to.  So we did not actually come to a decision on this matter during the break.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, that's reassuring.  I don't wish to make a long point, but it does occur to me that I haven't gone into any depth on the submission.  It may be my mistake.  I took the view that it was one of those submissions which would probably be met quite quickly.  Your Honour will recall the witness has given quite a lot of evidence about the distribution of arms by Turatsinze.  There were 600 guns obtained by the ministry of defence for the MRND.  Insofar as he is describing an understanding that those weapons were in the hands of the Interahamwe as a result of their MRND membership, it's my respectful submission that Mr. Robinson's submission is of a fairly technical nature.  It's a submission that the evidence is inadmissible.  Your Honours are reminded that's the thrust of the submission.  And he is going, in due course, I anticipate, to invite Your Honours to do the American procedure of striking the record.  

Now, it's my respectful submission that in light of everything that's been learned from this witness previously, on previous testimony, and his description of being a conseiller and knowing what was going on in his local area, the admissibility threshold is more than passed.  And insofar as my learned friend wishes to develop the point, it being a matter of weight, he's at liberty to cross-examine.  But I am slightly troubled by the thought that -- maybe I'm just being oversensitive in light of the length of time Your Honours were out, and I'm re-assured by what Your Honours have said a moment ago -- that maybe too much is being made of this observation by Mr. Robinson.  

It's my respectful submission -- I understand why Mr. Robinson makes the point, but insofar as the evidence is inadmissible, I respectfully submit -- and I hope I don't overstate it -- that's nonsense.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, if I could just be heard briefly, I think the witness's evidence is very unclear on this point, on the source of his information.  If he's simply assuming from what he learned earlier, that these weapons were possessed by the MRND -- by the Interahamwe as a result of what Turatsinze told him in 1993, that's one thing, and it probably is admissible on that basis.  But I think you probably need to know that because that goes to the weight.  

On the other hand, if he was informed on the 7th of April, as maybe even suggested by some of the disclosure, then that's another incident -- aspect of the information for which you can decide what weight to give it based on who informed him and what the circumstances were.  

So I think that my objection might be able to be resolved by having more clarity as to if the witness is simply assuming from what Mr. Morley has said or if he has some other fresh information.  But the way the record stands right now, I don't think you have an adequate foundation in which to assess the reliability of the information that's sought to be offered.  Thank you.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, can't you ask the witness a simple question, whether he's assuming that these weapons that the Interahamwe were carrying were received from the MRND, or he was given specific information by somebody that the weapons came from the MRND?  
MR. MORLEY:
I can, of course, answer that -- ask that question, Your Honour.  And I had thought that I'd asked it in a different way, but if Your Honour finds that there's greater clarity -- and I accept that -- in the way Your Honour puts it, then that's the question I can ask the witness. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Because all he said was that from his position, he would know and that -- so from the evidence so far, it sounds like he's assuming that that is where -- that that is the source of the weapons.  So there's need for clarity, and I think instead of asking us to rule, a simple question to the witness to find out whether it's an assumption he's making, or whether he has specific information as to the source of the weapons, will clarify the matter.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, I take the point.  And with Your Honour's leave, that's what I'll do with the witness.  

Turning to the President, do I have Your Honour's leave to continue with the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You do.  
MR. MORLEY:
If the witness might put his headphones back on.  Mr. Issa, can you assist?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before the break, you were telling us about the weapons, the firearms which you saw in the hands of the Interahamwe on the 7th of April.  Can you help us with this -- and listen carefully to the question, please -- when you say that the firearms had come from the MRND via the ministry of defence, is that something you are assuming, or is that something you know as a result of what you were told by someone?  And if so, by whom?  Now, do you understand the question?  That's my first enquiry.  
A.	Yes, I do understand your question very well.  
Q.	Thank you.  Is it an assumption, or is it based on knowledge from what you were told, please?  
A.	I told you that the firearms were distributed so that there were Interahamwe that had these weapons.  That's what I said.  I also explained that probably those firearms were given to them and the party by the ministry of defence.  And, therefore, I'm saying that those that had firearms before the war were very limited in number, and it was only the Interahamwe that were trained.  So, personally, I had a firearm, and the other leaders in the MRND, too, had firearms.  The informational (as interpreted) conseiller had firearms.  

On the 7th, therefore, the firearms that were distributed were distributed in the morning, and they were distributed to those Interahamwe that did not have firearms.  It was the Interahamwe leader that distributed such firearms, five firearms per cellule.  That was Georges Rutaganda, sir.  He distributed five firearms in my secteur, gave them to the Interahamwe.  

But the first weapons or firearms that I mentioned earlier on, I mentioned those firearms because Ikitunza (phonetic) was a massacre, and he had a firearm (as interpreted).  I talked to (unintelligible) who told me that he had received the firearm from Razinzi (as interpreted).  I couldn't -- Turatsinze.  So I asked him, "What about those arms?"  He said they were their arms.  I informed my bosses.  I told my bosses that there were people in my secteur that had firearms.  This is how I knew that some Interahamwe leaders had firearms.  And on the 7th of April, all of us were given firearms also, sir.  
Q.	Can you help us again, what is the name of the young Interahamwe you spoke to who told you he'd received his weapon from Turatsinze?  
A.	I was saying that when I learned that Shitunze Ndayentali (phonetic), who was the Interahamwe leader in that area, had weapons, I talked to Turatsinze, and it was Turatsinze who told me that he was the one that distributed the firearms himself, sir.  
Q.	You mentioned Rutaganda, and in previous testimony, you have told us that he is somebody you knew and we know him to have been a member of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  What is it that you understood Rutaganda had been doing on the 7th of April, please?  
A.	No, this is not information that was given to me.  On the 7th of April in the morning, about 11:00, I saw, personally -- I saw Rutaganda distributing weapons to the various leaders of the Interahamwe at the secteur level.  He distributed five firearms.  He was in a vehicle.  I personally saw the weapons distributed in my secteur.  At that time, of course, the number of weapons distributed was limited.  Georges Rutaganda was living in Tahanje (phonetic) secteur, so I talked to him, and he said, "These are our weapons."  He was the vice-president of the Interahamwe at national level.  He was also a member of the MRND national party.  He was, therefore, very influential.  I couldn't contradict him because we were the same political party, sir.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'd just turn to Their Honours and Mr. Robinson, are we taking the point any further?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think it's been clarified, Mr. President, and I think that's useful.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you were at the roadblocks and you observed the Interahamwe with the MRND firearms, what is it that you understood or you perceived they were doing? 
A.	This is not an opinion.  I saw all those things at the roadblocks in the Gitegazi (as interpreted) secteur.  I saw dead bodies.  And there was an Interahamwe leader called Bernard Maniragaba who lived in Gitega secteur and was a member of the executive committee of the Interahamwe at secteur level, that is, the Gitega secteur.  I found him.  I saw him with the dead bodies that we were picking up -- or they were picking up, so that there were trucks running around the city to collect dead bodies.  Just as there were dead animals.  

When I got to Rezamenyamenyo (phonetic), I met one Sukali (phonetic), who was an MRND leader at the level of Nyakabanda secteur.  And at the roadblocks there were dead bodies, and we were waiting for the trucks to be able to -- to be able to take them to the common ditches.  It is not an opinion that I'm formulating.  It's something that I saw myself.  And the Interahamwe were very powerful.  
Q.	When you describe that you saw dead bodies at these roadblocks being run by the Interahamwe, one of which was being -- at which there was Bernard Maniragaba, can you help us, the dead bodies, were they simply young men who might have been fighters with the RPF, or were they more than simply that?  
A.	There were no RPF fighters in Nyamiramba (as interpreted), the RPF hadn't got there at that time.  So those were Interahamwe that were manning the roadblock.  Maniragaba  was an MRND leader at the level of the Gitega secteur. 
 
Sukari (phonetic) was from Biryogo, and they were members of the préfectoral committee of Kigali-ville.  Some of them were also national committee members of the MRND, so that they were not RPF people at the time.  No RPF person was killed.  It was civilians that were killed and thrown into common ditches, cemeteries.  
Q.	And I'm sorry to press you on this, but when you say, "They were not RPF fighters; they were civilians who were killed," were they simply young men at these roadblocks who were killed, or were other types of people killed, other than young men?  And if so, what sort of people, please?  
A.	People killed at those roadblocks were men, women, children, old men.  
Q.	And what was their ethnic origin, these men, women, and children being killed at these roadblocks, being run by the Interahamwe?  
A.	Those were Tutsi, sir.  Every Tutsi that wanted to go through the roadblock had to show ID cards, but some of them were taken from their houses as well.  Even before the 7th of April, the Tutsi residences were all known.  Tutsi homes were known, sir.  
Q.	How quickly had roadblocks gone up in Kigali, manned by the Interahamwe, where Tutsi killings had started?  
A.	On the morning of the 7th of April, there were roadblocks set up in all the secteurs of Nyarugenge commune so that it was on the 9th of April there were roadblocks everywhere in all secteurs.  Some of the secteurs were manned by soldiers as well, sir.  
Q.	Had you heard any order to create roadblocks throughout Kigali for the morning of the 7th of April?  Was there any official state announcement or ministry of defence announcement to legitimise these roadblocks, to your knowledge?  
A.	No, sir.  There was no order -- official order to establish the roadblocks.  We just saw that on the 7th there were roadblocks.  We were used to roadblocks.  Even in 1990, roadblocks were there.  Nobody announced anything over the radio.  What we did was simply to inform our bosses, in other words, the bourgmestre and the préfet, and told him what was happening.  
Q.	What impression formed in your mind, owing to the speed with which roadblocks appeared throughout Kigali, manned by Interahamwe armed with firearms, where men, women, and children who were Tutsi were slaughtered?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to this question "what impression."  That says -- it calls for pure speculation.  
MR. MORLEY:
Not at all.  The word "speculation" is being thrown out a lot.  This is a man who was present at the scene.  And what is interesting about the word "speculation" is that it is several shades away from what might be thought to be common sense, arising out of an understanding of what was going on on the ground.  My learned friend uses the word "speculation," I respectfully submit, too liberally.  This is a witness who was on the ground, could see what was taking place, and may be able to assist the Court with what, as a matter of common sense and then becomes a matter of weight for the Tribunal, is the impression which formed in his mind.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Morley, that's the issue.  That's what the question is.  We think it's permissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think part of the problem is the flamboyance of your language in the rest of the question.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's an old habit.  I'm sorry, it dies hard.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	If I come back to you, Mr. Witness, to lay the context, you've got roadblocks -- 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honours' leave?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Now, you wanted to change the question?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  But as I do so, I propose, unless it's frowned upon, to lay the factual circumstances we've heard as evidence, and then ask the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean you want to recap what he said?  If he said it, then it's not necessary.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is right in the sense that the question ought to flow naturally from the previous answers.  It may be the Court has observed that one doesn't always find the witness answering the question which is asked in the context of what's gone before.  It may be a function of translation, and it may be a function of cultural differences.  What I propose to do is just fix the witness with a context and then invite his impression.  If I don't do that, and I simply ask the open question without context, there is the danger, the Court may have observed from experience -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, you see, if you do that, you raise the question that myself and my colleagues were discussing, because it is possible that there's a particular inference that you're driving at, and if -- which would not be permitted for the witness to give evidence about.  Now, your question had not necessarily been pointed at a particular inference up to now.  But what you're saying is that you wish to do just that.  
MR. MORLEY:
I am seeking to control the witness in the sense that I'm seeking to get an answer from the witness which is relevant to the question which will be asked.  We've had a little time since we've had the previous answers.  It may be the Court observes from experience it is often useful to fix the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, yeah, the witness has given certain specific factual answers up to now.  He's not an expert witness.  So you can ask your question bearing that in mind, and you understand how we are thinking, I would imagine.  
MR. MORLEY:
I do understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. MORLEY:
Though I'm not sure which answer I'm going to get now, but I'll ask the question in the shortest form.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, given the speed with which the unofficial roadblocks emerged on the 7th of April, at which there were events you've told us about, what impression formed in your mind about the fact that those roadblocks emerged so quickly, manned by the Interahamwe?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, really, I'm objecting to that because it calls for an impression or speculation.  If someone told him -- excuse me, Witness UB, would you mind removing your headphones, please?  (Kinyarwanda spoken) 

Mr. President, if this witness was told by someone that the roadblocks had been placed on the morning of the 7th by the order of some particular person, that could certainly come up -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has answered that question already, hasn't he?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't think that question has been asked of him.  I think what Mr. Morley is trying to do is get the inference that because they came up so quickly, it must have been by some higher direction, but that's speculation.  That's something that may be the subject of expert testimony, even -- although I would say even that would be very improper.  But with this particular witness, he either knows how the roadblocks were established on the morning of the 7th or he doesn't.  Not his impression.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- you see, I think we spend too much time having these discussions.  The note I have is this.  "Question:  Had you heard any order to create roadblocks throughout Kigali for the morning of the 7th of April?  Was there any official state announcement or ministry of defence announcement to legitimise your (sic) roadblocks, to your knowledge?  

"Answer:  No, sir.  There was no order -- official order to establish the roadblocks," et cetera.  He's already answered that question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I respectfully disagree, Mr. President.  He was speaking of the official administration and source of oral orders to establish roadblocks given by the administration.  Now he's trying to lay this on the MRND.  It's a different issue.  He's not been asked whether he had any knowledge of whether any of the MRND officials ordered these roadblocks.  That's what -- Mr. Morley is trying to establish that by inference because he doesn't have the evidence to do it by direct -- directly.  And he's asking the witness to speculate that because these roadblocks were put up quickly, it must have been on the order of some higher authority as opposed to something else, but it's just speculation.  The witness has no information about that.  You can draw that inference yourself at the end of the case if you want to.  You don't need any more information from this witness if all he's going to do is give his impression.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I mention, Your Honour, that you've already ruled on this?  You permitted me to ask the question after Mr. Robinson's first objection which was on the same point.  So Mr. Robinson characteristically, with some gusto, is seeking to go behind the decision which was made a moment ago.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, not exactly, though, Mr. Morley.  There's a very narrow limit.  We don't (unintelligible) that you're entitled to point the witness to a particular inference and there's a possibility that your question was doing just that.  Now, at the time, we had not really thought so.  But, you know, if what you're driving at is what Mr. Robinson said, you should go about it another way and lay the factual foundation and allow us to draw the inference.  
MR. MORLEY:
I can go at it another way, but I anticipate we're going to have more arguments.  Let's see.  With Your Honour's leave.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what do you understand was the cause of the Interahamwe so speedily setting up so many roadblocks?  
A.	I did not get your question clearly.  Could you kindly repeat it?  
Q.	What did you understand was the cause of the Interahamwe so speedily setting up so many roadblocks in Kigali by early the 7th of April?  
A.	Personally, that was not surprising for me because the preceding events, that is, before the setting up of the roadblocks in Kigali-ville, said something.  The roadblocks were set up to prevent Tutsi from going around.  In other words, the roadblocks were there to organise the killing of the Tutsi.  So the president was dead, and Interahamwe that had been trained went on to implement or carry out what they had learnt.  So the Interahamwe embarked on killing people, and the officials did nothing to stop them.  In other words, they supported said killings.  

When I saw those dead bodies at the roadblocks and I saw military vehicles, and there was no reaction from the occupants of those military vehicles, I took it that such action was endorsed by the government.  What happened in Sirengi (phonetic) and other places was repeated in Kigali-ville.  It was Mugesera (sic) as well -- Bugesera.  
Q.	What was it that you could see on the 7th of April that the Interahamwe had been trained to do?  
A.	They were trained to manipulate firearms.  And that morning I saw them shooting.  So I don't know if they were applying, implementing what they had learned and overtly they were told what to do, and, therefore, they went ahead selecting -- the Interahamwe were selected and trained, and when they were trained, they executed or carried out what they were taught.  
Q.	And what were they told to do?  
A.	They killed the Tutsi.  
Q.	And who do you understand told them to do that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me.  Excuse me, Witness.  Let me intervene first, and if you're allowed to answer, you can do so.  

I object, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that's not a proper question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it flows naturally, I respectfully submit, from the witness saying that the Interahamwe, as I understand his evidence, were trained to kill Tutsi and were told to do that.  And I'm now asking who told them to do that.  
JUDGE SHORT:
No.  The question you should have asked him, "Who told them to do that," not "What do you understand?"  It's the language which you use which creates the ambiguity.  You should ask him directly, "Do you know who told them to do that?"  I'm sure Mr. Robinson would not object.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sure he would, Your Honour.  
JUDGE SHORT:
I don't think so.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'll ask the question the way that Your Honour invites. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, who told the Interahamwe to slaughter the Tutsi?  
A.	I told you that the people who were at the roadblocks were Interahamwe leaders in Kigali-ville, so that the Interahamwe were being controlled by the leaders of the MRND.  In other words, the members of the MRND executive committee, I have no doubt that they could make decisions about setting up roadblocks.  And if they made such decisions, that meant that all the leaders were informed.  They knew.  If you want me to tell you who gave those orders out, I would simply say that it was the leaders of the MRND and the president, vice-president, the secretary-general.  Those were the leaders of the Interahamwe.  Because the Interahamwe used to tell us that we had no control over them; they had to report directly to certain other people about what they did, sir.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr. President, excuse me, I think -- I'm not sure the witness directly answered the question, but it appears that the answer would have been that nobody -- he doesn't know who told the Interahamwe to set up the roadblocks, but he's assuming that the Interahamwe was directed by the executive committee.  And I think that's the kind of speculation that should not be permitted, and that's an inference that the Trial Chamber can draw on its own.  So I ask that the answer be stricken, given the fact that it was not -- did not produce evidence which would be admissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully disagree.  The witness has given long testimony as to how the Interahamwe worked.  He's given an abundance of evidence to show that the Interahamwe was controlled through the coordinated Turatsinze by the executive bureau.  He's given evidence that Turatsinze had distributed arms.  He's given evidence that Rutaganda distributed arms as a member of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  He has given evidence about how the Interahamwe could not act without the knowledge of and the approval of the executive bureau.  These are all matters within his knowledge as a figure within the MRND.  My learned friend is really banging the speculation drum, I respectfully submit, too often and too hard.  

As a submission that the evidence is inadmissible, I respectfully submit, not so.  As a submission that the evidence can be the subject of attack by the Defence as to what weight to attach to it, that's different and that becomes a matter of cross-examination.  It becomes a matter of comment.  But inadmissibility, no, I respectfully submit.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just respond briefly, but I'd like the witness to take off his headphones.  I can't quite see if they're on or off from my angle.  Okay.  Thank you.  (Kinyarwanda spoken)  

Mr. President, I think the problem is that Mr. Morley is trying to eat too much at the supper table here.  He can bring out all of those facts objectively from which you can draw the inference that it should have been -- that the leaders of the MRND ordered the roadblocks to be erected, but if the witness doesn't know that for a fact, he can't take it the one step further and ask the witness to speculate on -- to make the inference for the Trial Chamber.  It doesn't add anything to the -- it has no probative value.  

And I think this is a repeated problem that both Mr. Morley and I are having that's probably aggravating the Trial Chamber.  I think he's going too far, the one question too many or two questions too many.  He's going too far to draw from the witness matters which are the province of the Trial Chamber.  And he thinks that I'm objecting because I'm thinking that this is speculation.  

But maybe the Trial Chamber needs to give some kind of ruling or guidance, but I think this is a recurring problem from my perspective, where the Prosecution is taking the witness to invade the province of the Trial Chamber by asking him to speculate and draw inferences that are the province of the Trial Chamber only.  
MR. MORLEY:
This argument could go up and down all day.  So I'm not saying nothing more.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm glad because we are not going to permit it to go on all day.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I think that Mr. Robinson is quite correct.  Mr. Morley tries to make -- Mr. Morley's getting the witness to use inferences.  He's not an expert -- an expert witness.  He doesn't have any opinion to give.  And you see that he said that those that were in the Interahamwe depended on the executive committee, and everything they did was a result of something from the executive committee.  He cannot make any inferences therefore, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, there is a thought I do wish to offer.  It's brief.  My learned friends have started to suggest, and the Trial Chamber has started to opine, that inferences are not available to a witness to make.  I respectfully submit that inferences are available to a witness to make if the witness is able to provide testimony of the factual background against which he, the witness, made the inferences.  Whether the Trial Chamber accepts a witness's factual evidence, and based on the factual evidence, whether the Trial Chamber accepts any inferences which the witness offers is a matter for the Trial Chamber.  But it would be in error, I respectfully submit, to assume -- just because the word "inference" is thrown up in the course of the language of legal argument, it would be an error to assume that the word "inference" is debarred from a factual witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, are you saying that there are no inferences which a witness would not be allowed to draw?  
MR. MORLEY:
The one inference which the witness is not allowed to draw, generally speaking, in jurisdictions worldwide, is the inference that on the basis of all the facts known to the witness, a person is guilty.  But that is not what I am inviting.  I am inviting -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you're saying that witnesses who are not expert witnesses are entitled to draw inferences which will come under category of opinion evidence?  I mean there must -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're saying that?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, but one has to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but what does "yes" mean?  
MR. MORLEY:
It means yes, but I have to explain the circumstance in which I'm saying yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I know, but if you have to explain the circumstance, it means your answer is not an unqualified yes.  It means there are exceptions to it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, there are often exceptions.  I accept that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the point.  The point is, there are rules which govern what types of inferences the witnesses can draw -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and what types of inferences the witness cannot draw.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully agree.  However --
MR. PRESIDENT:
As to the question I was asking --
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  However, the general assertion coming from the other side of the room is that any inference based on a factual scenario offered by a witness cannot be admitted in evidence.  Now, for example, can I help Your Honour with a burglary?  A householder comes home and finds his house is burgled.  He did not see how the burglar entered the house.  He did not see the burglar leave the house, but he's found that the window is broken, and there are fingerprints and perhaps a little blood at the scene where the window is broken.  The householder would be perfectly entitled to offer to a Tribunal the thought that, having been in the house, having seen the doors, having seen the state of the windows, that inferentially, the only way the burglar had got in and gone out was through the window.  Now, that is the sort of inference based on a factual scenario which is perfectly available to a witness.  It does not constitute expert evidence.  

And there is a danger that the word "inference" is being improperly associated with expert evidence exclusively.  I respectfully submit, as Your Honour has observed a moment ago, that there are some inferences available to a witness to offer to a Tribunal, and there are others which are not.  It's always a matter for the Trial Chamber to distinguish between these matters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but there are rules which assist us which you ought to know.  
MR. MORLEY:
I don't follow what Your Honour is offering. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, but you're suggesting that there's a sort of absolute discretion that we apply which varies from situation to situation, and there are rules which assist us in determining what are inferences which are allowable and those which are not.  
MR. MORLEY:
I cannot imagine that there is a rule anywhere which defines with any clarity, as a straight line, the distinction between that which is and that which is not a permissible inference.  On each occasion as the factual scenario develops, the inference offered by the witness is a matter for the Trial Chamber to weigh as to whether it is offerable or not.  What I'm anxious to preserve is the thought that witnesses of fact can offer, in certain circumstances, inferential thoughts.  Because what's coming from the other side of the room -- and I understand why -- is an attempt to associate the word "inference" with the word "inadmissibility," and I respectfully submit one would be in error to find oneself articulating so bold and exclusive a rule.  So that is the thought I offer.  

It is a matter for the Trial Chamber whether where we are at the moment amounts to inadmissible inference.  I respectfully submit not so at all.  Here is a man who knows the MRND and has described throughout his testimony over previous days how it worked.  And I respectfully submit, he is perfectly placed to offer the thought that the Interahamwe could not have operated without the attention of the executive bureau.  That has been the thrust of his evidence throughout, and now that we come to the crunch point, that is to say, the point upon which the Prosecution present evidence potentially of a compelling nature against the interest of the Defendants, it is no surprise that the Defence make the observations and arguments persistently and repeatedly that they do.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, when the word "inference" is used in the context of findings of fact, which the Chamber has to make, it is in that context that I think the dispute arises.  In other words, when the witness has given evidence about facts which he knows, then it is for the Chamber to draw an inference from those facts.  I think it is that area that we are looking at and we are discussing whether the witness is entitled to draw an inference which amounts to a finding of fact which the Chamber has to make.  I think that situation should be distinguished from an inference of the sort you mentioned when a person comes into his house and finds that there has been a burglary or an opinion evidence which an expert should give.  
MR. MORLEY:
I respectfully agree with Your Honour.  Your Honour is observing that there are some inferences which are available to the witness to draw from the factual scenario known to the witness.  There are others which perhaps he is not entitled to draw.  It's a matter for the Trial Chamber to distinguish between them.  What I'm anxious to avoid is the absolute rule being repeated by the other side of the room that an inference is never available to a witness, because what I suspect is taking place intellectually is that my learned friends on the other side are failing to distinguish between that which is speculation and that which is an inference.  

As Your Honours will know, an inference is a circumstance of narrow logic upon which there being a fact and then perhaps another fact, an inference can be deduced, there being no other potential fact to be drawn from it.  If one says he has apples, all apples are green, inferentially one can say -- although one hasn't seen his apples -- the apples that he has are green.  It's not a matter of speculation.  It's a matter of narrow logic.  

But what is taking place at the other side of the bar is a confusion between the word "inference" and "speculation."  If Your Honours are of the view that the witness is speculating, then we stop.  

If Your Honours are of the view that the witness is making inferences based on the factual scenario, then the judicial reasoning might be as follows:  Firstly, is that inference available on the factual scenario?  Because it may be that Your Honours take the view that there are more than one factual inference available to the witness based on what is known.  And if so, then one is not dealing with an inference.  

On the other hand, if the Trial Chamber takes the view that there is an inference available on the strength of the factual scenario, the issue for the Trial Chamber, as a matter of judicial reasoning, becomes, well, is the witness right about the factual scenario?  

Inferences are an interesting species -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the only problem with that line of argument, as far as I can see, is, it plays right into the question asked you by Judge Short.  You see, the Judges don't draw inferences of fact until after we have heard all the evidence.  Now, you are going to be -- you are now asking us to make a finding of fact at a premature stage in the proceedings, which we're not likely to want to do.  So if what the witness is doing is usurpation of a judicial function, then it's quite improper for him to do it at this stage.  
MR. MORLEY:
The witness is offering his conclusions based on what he says are the facts.  If the Trial Chamber is of the view that the conclusions being offered by the witness are the very conclusions which the Trial Chamber must reach or examine, then arguably such inferential reasoning is inadmissible because it goes to the issue before the Trial Chamber, and as Your Honour puts it, there is a usurpation of the Trial Chamber's function.  

However, if the witness is offering an inference based on his understanding of the facts which simply helps to fill in the events which took place within Rwanda at the relevant time, then that is not a usurpation of the Trial Chamber's function.  Insofar as the witness offers an inference which appears to be not a proper inference based on what the facts are offered by the witness, because it's plain that various scenarios may be correct, then, yes, in time, that will be something that the Trial Chamber considers when weighing the evidence at the deliberation stage.  

The first issue for the Trial Chamber is, on the factual scenario being offered by the witness, is he able to offer an inference?  I respectfully submit, yes, in this case.  

The next question is, if he's available -- if he's able to offer an inference, then the question becomes:  Is that inference a usurpation of the Trial Chamber's function?  Those are judicial reasoning features rather than factual findings.  I respectfully submit that the witness is able to offer an inference based on his factual understandings of the workings of the MRND, and that is not an inference which usurps the Trial Chamber's function.  

Now, the only reason I've leapt to my feet on the word "inference" is because I'm anxious to ensure that we don't fall into the trap of thinking that every time the Defence say "inference," it means automatically inadmissible.  There is still a judicial reasoning involved, and there is a discretion available to the Trial Chamber.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President?  
JUDGE SHORT:
So where are we at the moment?  
MR. MORLEY:
We are at the moment in Your Honour's hands.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Yeah, I think after all those generalities, maybe you could apply what you have said to any specific issue which is in dispute between you and Mr. Robinson.  
MR. MORLEY:
The issue which is in dispute between us is this:  The witness has said that from what he knew of the way the MRND worked, the Interahamwe would not have been killing civilian Tutsis without the authority of the executive bureau.  That, I respectfully submit -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  Stop there for a moment.  Is that not speculation?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour introduces the word "speculation."  
JUDGE SHORT:
When you say he would -- the witness says that the Interahamwe would not have been killing people without the authority or knowledge of the MRND, the way you phrase that statement, does that not demonstrate that he's making assumptions or he's speculating?  Whereas, if he said that "I know for a fact that instructions had been given that A, B, C, D should be done at a certain point," then we are confronted with factual evidence.  You see, but if he says a particular event would not have happened but for something else, isn't he making assumptions or speculating?  
MR. MORLEY:
This is where -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Why don't you let him state the facts, and then based on those facts, the Chamber can draw the inference.  
MR. MORLEY:
But the unhappy feature of the present problem is that for him, the witness, it is a fact that the Interahamwe would not have been killing Tutsi civilians without authority from the executive bureau.  So from Your Honour's helpful contribution, one sees the importance of the distinction between speculation and inference.  From Your Honour's observation, it might be thought that Your Honour was offering the enquiry as to whether there can ever be anything more than speculation.  

I respectfully submit there is a species of deductive logic called inference which is a lot different to speculation.  An inference is a conclusion drawn on factual circumstances where there is no other reasonable conclusion to draw.  Speculation is where you offer a conclusion based on factual circumstances, where there are plenty of other possibilities available.  For example, if we go back to deductive logic, if one was to say -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Please, Mr. Morley, let's not go to deductive logic.  And I'm only going to say one more thing, and that's it.  If the Chamber has to decide whether it was the MRND that authorised the Interahamwe to kill, you see, that's a finding of fact the Chamber has to make.  Okay?  The witness is not entitled to say so unless he has direct information about that fact.  You see?  And that is the position.  You see, there, if he does say so without direct information, he's usurping the Chamber's function, and that -- that's the basic distinction that we're trying to draw here.  

You know, if ultimately this Chamber has to decide -- he has given evidence that the Interahamwe were killing the Tutsis.  Okay, now if the Chamber has to decide on whose authority they were doing this killing, then if he doesn't have direct knowledge of that fact, he cannot give evidence of it, because we have to decide whether it was the MRND who gave the instructions or not.  That's a finding of fact that we have to make.  And he's not entitled to draw that inference unless he has specific knowledge or information to support that inference.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, there's the catch -- "unless he has specific knowledge or information to support that inference."  The specific knowledge or information which he has to support that inference, which Your Honour acknowledges, therefore, to offer the inference, is, intimate knowledge of the workings of the MRND, the workings of the Interahamwe, what was taking place in his secteur, the distribution of weapons by those within the senior echelons of the Interahamwe, associated with the senior members of the MRND, and his knowledge of the way in which the MRND would liaise through Turatsinze to distribute orders to the Interahamwe.  Those are the aspects of his specific knowledge and information which entitle him to offer Your Honours the conclusion which he irrevocably draws that the MRND executive bureau were controlling the Interahamwe.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I must say that interest of management intervene.  We are 25 minutes past our scheduled luncheon adjournment time, and I think we ought to take the luncheon adjournment now.  It's going to mean that we have to resume later than our scheduled resumption time.  And I would take recess until 2:30.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour. 
(Court recessed at 1255H) 
(Pages 16 to 32 by Wendy Molnar)







(Court resumed at 1450H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can resume.  

May the witness remove his headphones, please. 

Mr. Morley, we think that the answer to what has happened before lunch goes something like this:  The Prosecutor is entitled to prove facts by circumstantial evidence, which is what you are trying to do.  And -- but we do not think that the witness should draw the inference you are trying to prove.  The facts you are trying to establish should be drawn by the Court based upon the surrounding facts of which you gave evidence.  

Now, in your submissions you suggested that all the background facts had already been given in evidence, at which point it is a matter for the Court to draw the evidence that is -- has been established by the circumstantial evidence. 
JUDGE SHORT:
The inference. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What did I say?
JUDGE SHORT:
"The evidence".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  It is for the Court to draw the inference from the matters which have been established by the circumstances which you have proven. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, Your Honour.  It occurs to me to mention that it may be that the matter resurrects itself a little later -- I see the witness is not wearing his headphones.  Good -- insofar as his understanding of where the orders were coming from had a role in what he was doing later in the course of the events in 1994.  But the matter doesn't become live just yet, but it may become important for Your Honours to understand -- no, for him to be able to explain why he was doing certain things, and the reasoning, I anticipate, is he thought that everything was being controlled by some very senior people.  It doesn't arise just yet, and I can move on, if that's agreeable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think you should. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 

Mr. Issa, with your assistance, the headphones, please. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were describing at one stage the distribution of weapons on the 7th of April by George Rutaganda.  Can you help Their Honours with what sort of firearms you saw him distributing, please? 
A.	Firearms.  Rifles, in fact. 
Q.	When you say "rifles", are you able to say what sort of rifles?  Some are quite well known, and you may know their title, as it were.  
A.	No, I was not a soldier.  I wouldn't be able to distinguish between the various types, so I can't tell you what sort of firearms there were.  All I can tell you, he was distributing firearms and munitions, and ammunition.  But the type of gun, I was not an expert in those matters, so I couldn't tell you, but he was distributing guns, firearms. 
Q.	Are you familiar with the term "Kalashnikov assault rifle"? 
A.	Yes.  I heard people speak of that type of weapon when we went to collect weapons at the ministry of defence.  We were told that the type of weapon distributed were Kalashnikovs. 
Q.	And do you know what a Kalashnikov assault rifle looks like?  For example, are you able to describe the shape of its magazine? 
A.	No, I cannot describe to you the magazine of that type of gun.  All I can tell you is that I saw people carrying firearms, people shooting, but I couldn't distinguish between the type of weapons.  Only soldiers could give you that type of information. 
Q.	You have told us that you were given a weapon.  Can you help us with what date that was, please? 
A.	The gun was given to me in 1992 -- it was a pistol -- in May, in the month of May. 
Q.	When you -- what year was that again, please?  Can you specify? 
A.	It was in 1992. 
Q.	During the events, after the death of the president, at any point did you receive any other weapon? 
A.	No, no other weapon was issued to me.  At that time I had policemen ensuring my safety, so I did not need any other weapons.  The weapons given to me were for the cellule people in my secteur.  I was to redistribute them to cellule people in my secteur. 
Q.	The weapons which were given to you to redistribute to people in the cellule, what sort of weapons did you understand those to be?  What was the name of the weaponry? 
A.	The weapons I told you of, the ones we went to collect at the ministry of defence, we were told they were Kalashnikov, and I did not give those to the inhabitants of my secteur; it was for the responsible de cellule in my secteur. 
Q.	How many such weapons were you given to give to the responsable of your secteur? 
A.	I collected five firearms*******************************************. 
Q.	The Kalashnikov weapons, five in number, can you remember what they looked like? 
A.	They were ordinary rifles.  They weren't pistols.  They were bigger than pistols.  I was with a policeman and I handed those firearms over to the policeman, and subsequently we gave them on to the persons they were intended for. 
Q.	On the 7th of April, when you saw the Interahamwe with firearms, can you tell us whether the firearms you saw the Interahamwe with resembled or not the weapons, the Kalashnikov rifles, you were given to distribute? 
A.	There were many different types of firearms.  Even the guns given to me weren't of the same type, so I didn't pay attention to see what sort of firearms the Interahamwe were carrying to compare them to the ones that had been issued to us.  I never thought that such a question would be put to me.  So there were many different types of firearms, and it wouldn't be easy to distinguish between them unless one was a soldier.  Firearms -- rifles might resemble each other without being necessarily of the same type. 
Q.	All right.  We will move on.  How did the 7th of April come to an end for you?  Where were you?  What were you doing? 
A.	On the day of the 7th of April -- the day of the 7th of April ended with me being at home.  We'd been entrusted with missions.  We hadn't been able to do everything, but at the end of the day, everybody went home. 
Q.	How were you feeling at home? 
A.	I did not feel safe because I would see people being killed, whereas they had not committed any offence.  Even babies were being killed, so that I also did not feel safe.  At any time I expected something bad to happen to me.  My family and I were destined to die, we thought.  Some conseillers were killed on the 7th of April.
Q.	We know that there were 19 conseillers within Kigali; how many conseillers were killed on the 7th of April, please? 
A.	Three conseillers were killed:  The conseiller of Gikondo secteur in Kicukiro commune, the Kagarama conseiller in Kicukiro commune, and the Gisozi conseiller.  The Nyakabanda conseiller was reported missing, but killed on the 30th. 
Q.	Why were they killed --
A.	Rather, the other three were killed.  They were killed because they were Tutsis. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I am just wondering if there was some kind of translation error about the conseiller from Nyakabanda.  I think there was translation to indicate that he was killed on the 30th, and I'm not sure that that's actually what the witness said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, maybe you should ask the witness to repeat because my note was -- he says the Nyakabanda conseiller was reported missing, but killed on the 30th.  Then he added, "Rather, the other three were killed."  So it was confusing. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you help us again.  You've told us three conseillers were killed because they were Tutsi.  Can you help us with when they were killed, each one? 
A.	I did not try to find out when they were killed, but given that we were conseillers responsible for secteurs, we could telephone our colleagues to ask them for information.  So a meeting was held at the communal office, and those three were not present.  So Gikondo secteur bordered my secteur, and we were told that he was killed by Interahamwes, who found him in his house, and he was killed, together with his family. 
Q.	That's one conseiller; what about the other two, please?  When were they killed, if you can assist? 
A.	Both conseillers of Gikondo and Kicukiro, as well as the one in Gisozi, all those were killed on the 7th of April.
Q.	You mentioned earlier that one went into hiding and you believe that person was killed on the 30th of April.  Is that one of the three, or is that another conseiller? 
A.	No, the person who went into hiding was not killed.  He was replaced.  The person -- therefore, you mentioned the date of the 30th of April.  On the 30th of April, there was a conseiller who was removed from his post, not killed. 
Q.	On the 7th of April, how many conseillers killed, please? 
A.	As I said, three conseillers were killed on the 7th of April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the names of the secteurs, could the witness be asked to spell them?  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, can you help us?  Can you repeat the names of the secteurs from which the three murdered conseillers came?  Repeat the names slowly, and then we will spell them.  Thank you.  
A.	I recall the name of the conseiller of Gikondo secteur.  That conseiller's name was Gashabizi.  Gikondo is spelt G-I-K-O-N-D-O. 
Q.	Can you help us with from where the other two conseillers came, please? 
A.	I do not remember the names of the conseillers in charge of Gisozi and Kagarama secteurs.  Gisozi is spelt G-I-S-O-Z-I; Kagarama is spelt K-A-G-A-R-A-M-A. 
MR. MORLEY:
We've got that.  Does that help?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but he didn't spell the name of the conseiller who he knew.  Could he spell that for us, please, the one from Gikondo. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, did you hear His Honour's question?  Can we have the spelling, please, of the murdered conseiller from Gikondo? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Gashabizi is spelt -- Gashabizi is spelt G-A-S-H-A-B-I-Z-I, and Célestin, C-É-L-E-S-T-I-N. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Maybe this is a technical point.  I didn't really hear the witness give those spellings.  Has the spelling been given by the interpreters or by the witness?  
MR. MORLEY:
As long as we've got consistency with the spellings, that's all we really need.  But may I enquire of the translation booth, is Mr. Robinson's observation correct, that the Kinyarwandan interpreters are assisting by spelling those words that they are familiar with?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is correct.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think it's a very nice thing for them to do, but really, we shouldn't be having the interpreters adding any substantive evidence.  For spelling, it may seem innocuous, but, as a practice, it is not something that we should permit. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, at least we should know the difference.  The interpreters should indicate -- if they are going to assist, they should indicate if they are doing it.  We would prefer the witness to spell the names, but if the interpreter intervenes, they should let us know that they are doing that.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, and I anticipate the interpreters have heard Your Honour's helpful observation.  Perhaps if I might move on now with the testimony. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On the 8th of April, can you describe what happened to you on that day, please? 
A.	On the 4th (sic) of April, I told the préfet of the préfecture of Kigali that I did not feel safe, and therefore, he sent communal policemen to protect me and my family.  As for what happened on the 4th of April, they were similar to the events that took place the day before; that is, killings went on, vehicles were going about the city, and people were being killed, and bodies were being evacuated.  But on that date it was still possible for some conseillers to go to the secteur office.  When the policemen sent by the préfet arrived, they told me that they were not going to oppose the Interahamwe, that they had simply come to protect my family and me. 
MR. MORLEY:
Point of translation:  I anticipate the witness was referring not to the 4th of April, but to the 8th of April.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Ask the witness to clarify. 
MR. MORLEY:
I anticipate it's a translation point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you repeat for us the date on which you told the préfet of Kigali that you did not feel safe, and he sent communal policemen to protect you. 
THE WITNESS:
It was on the 8th of April 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you go to your office as a conseiller on the 8th of April?
A.	The secteur office was built**********************, so I went there to draw up a report on the security situation prevailing in my secteur. 
Q.	When you were at the secteur office, were there any requests made of you by some of the people in the secteur about identity cards? 
A.	As usual, residents of each secteur were to address their respective conseiller, and on that day some residents came to my office and told me they had lost their identity cards.  However, there were others who had identity cards who indicated to me that if they displayed those identity cards, they could be killed.  So I issued identity cards, rather, indicating that they had lost previous identity cards. 
Q.	How long, approximately, did you spend at your office on the 8th of April?
A.	I got there in the morning, and I believe I stayed there for some hours.  The security situation was delicate, and I, therefore, could not stay there long.  Moreover, there was no need for daily office work anymore. 
Q.	Did the préfet convene any meeting of the conseiller and the bourgmestre, and other figures of authority within Kigali, as a result of the slaughter taking place? 
A.	The préfet convened a meeting on the 10th of April 1994. 
Q.	Did you attend that meeting? 
A.	Yes.  I attended it just like the other invited conseillers. 
Q.	Were the bourgmestres at that meeting? 
A.	Yes.  Bourgmestres were present, all except for the bourgmestre of Kicukiro, who had gone into hiding because he was under threat; his security was at risk.  He was a member of the MRND, and that is why he had gone into hiding at the time of the meeting.  But the -- Nyabwende (phonetic), Gakiro, and other conseillers, were present at the meeting held at the headquarters of the préfecture for ville de Kigali. 
Q.	What happened to the bourgmestre of Kicukiro, and can we have the spelling, please, of Kicukiro? 
A.	Since the bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune had left the MRND party, he had gone into hiding so that the Interahamwe would not kill him.  They had just killed one of his conseillers, so he was not present at the meeting. 
Q.	Can we have the spelling for Kicukiro, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O.  But, says the Kinyarwandan interpreter, the witness is not able to spell. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honours, the spellings are not substantive matters.  I just want consistency in the spellings.  Perhaps the Kinyarwandan experts in the translator's booth, who have been doing this trial for a long time, can give us the spelling. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was most appropriate.  It does assist the process if we get spellings.  That is not what I was concerned about.  If you didn't ask, I would have asked you to ask. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Are we both asking the translators for the correct spelling, please?  

Translators, can you assist if you think that the witness spelt it wrong?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kicukiro is spelt K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, at an earlier stage in the process there was the suggestion that a list of names and places, which is going to be referred to in the testimony, could be prepared, and that would be useful, not only for the process -- all the process in Court, but also for the written process of the court recorders, as they are putting this information into their dictionary for their court reporting machines.  So if it is possible to do that in advance, it would also be helpful. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  There is a spelling list helpfully prepared by Mr. Sendze.  The difficulty is that we don't always get every single named person or named place for the process.  I don't anticipate very many more difficulties with spellings, but I could be wrong.  

All right.  So if I may return -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me for one second, Mr. President.  I just wanted to know, I haven't received any spelling list for this witness.  So if there is one that Mr. Sendze has prepared, perhaps we could receive it. 
MR. MORLEY:
We will make arrangements for it to come across to my friend, but can I continue with the evidence, please?

MR. PRESIDENT:
It would also assist us if the list does exist.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may now proceed with the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I said, it would also assist us if the list does exist. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  If I may return to the witness.  The list will make its way forward, and I see the time anyway.  So, if it isn't immediately behind me, we'll have to go and dig it up.  

Returning to the witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What happened to the bourgmestre of Kicukiro who disappeared?  In the end, what happened to him? 
A.	I have just said that the bourgmestre of Kicukiro commune was hiding because he feared for his life.  He knew people were after him.  Besides, after some time he was sacked, and another bourgmestre was appointed for Kicukiro commune. 
Q.	Did the bourgmestre in hiding survive the events in Rwanda? 
A.	He did not come from the préfecture of ville de Kigali.  He survived like many others.  Therefore, he showed up again after the war. 
Q.	Bourgmestre, conseiller, préfet; who else?  What sort of other officers were represented at the meeting on the 10th of April, please? 
A.	There were also soldiers, political party leaders.  These people were also in attendance at the meeting held at the préfecture office for ville de Kigali. 
Q.	Which political parties were represented at the meeting? 
A.	All accredited or approved political parties present in the city of Kigali and parties supporting the government.  But I would like to point out that the MRND were represented, the MDR and CDR and other small political parties, like PDI, PDC, various parties, as a matter of fact, especially parties that were in government.  All these parties were present at the meeting held at the Kigali préfecture office. 
Q.	Of the political parties represented, were there any persons who were of a moderate disposition, or were they of a more militant disposition? 
A.	No.  Such people could not even show their faces.  There were people like, for instance, the PL party.  People in PL could not attend the meeting.  Those people could not attend the meeting.  They were at risk if they attended the meeting. 
Q.	What was happening to the moderate politicians throughout Kigali? 
A.	Those who were not in the power wings were not Tutsis -- rather, they were Tutsis, Tutsis who were in danger and could not show their faces.  Besides, many of them were killed. 
Q.	What discussion, if any, was there at the meeting on the 10th of April about how the killings should be stopped? 
A.	No, no one called for the meetings -- for the killings, rather, to stop.  Even though this was a security meeting, we were told that we should get together to achieve one objective.  So the killings went on, and we were told that, in places where vehicles had not arrived, to evacuate the bodies, that there was a need for those vehicles to go through the city to pick up the bodies. 
Q.	Within the meeting on the 10th of April, was there assembled at that meeting the capability of stopping the killings had the meeting decided to stop the killings? 
A.	No.  No decision was taken during that meeting, or in any other meetings convened, to the effect that the slaughter should stop.  No strategies were adopted.  We were told that we should keep on fighting and keep standing up to the enemy. 
Q.	If the meeting had decided to stop the killings, was that possible?  Was there the power assembled in that meeting to stop the killings, if the meeting had decided to stop the killings? 
A.	The meeting was a security meeting.  If participants had wanted, and since there were military officials and officials from the national gendarmerie, as well as bourgmestres and representatives of various political parties, had they shown that they did not support the killings, then, for instance, if there had been condemnation of the killings by participants of the meeting, they would have stopped.  

There were representatives from the public prosecution office.  At the security meeting of Kigali préfecture there was a representative from the court of first instance who was supposed to attend the meeting; there was a representative from the immigration department; there was a representative from the intelligence service, so that those attending that security meeting could have taken a decision to end the killings so that things would not have happened the way they did. 
MR. MORLEY:
Is that a convenient moment, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Morley.  We started just about 15 minutes ago.  We thought we'd stop and take the break at 4 o'clock. 
MR. MORLEY:
I see.  I now understand why Your Honour showed me four fingers.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Four fingers, that's right.
MR. MORLEY:
I thought Your Honour was saying four minutes, not 4 o'clock.  I will, of course, continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What could have been done to stop the killings? 
A.	First of all, the participants at the meeting should have condemned the killings if they were going on.  Secondly, the perpetrators of the massacres should have been arrested and imprisoned.  All bodies or authorities would have come together to restore security to the city.  There was a need to help the conseillers, for instance, to ensure that security was restored in the city.  If the perpetrators of the massacres had been punished, other perpetrators would not have continued to kill.  We had soldiers, gendarmes.  While it is true that the Interahamwe had been trained, if all the institutions at national level had joined forces, then the killings would not have been committed. 
Q.	What was said about the killing of the Tutsi? 
A.	Each secteur conseiller reported on the situation to the other participants in the meeting regarding events in their respective secteur.  Each one indicated the large numbers of Tutsis being killed, because the people who were killed, were killed in broad daylight. 
Q.	There being reports of the large numbers of people being killed in broad daylight to the senior figures responsible for Kigali, what was their reaction?  What did they say, in summary, about these killings? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to this question as being vague.  I think that if certain individuals made statements, they ought to be identified as to who said what. 
MR. MORLEY:
Let's see what the witness remembers, and then we'll descend into who said what.  With Your Honour's leave. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What was said by the senior figures?  Give us some idea of the flavour of what was being said after these reports about killings throughout all the secteurs.
A.	I told you, we were in a meeting.  Each one was given the floor, especially the conseiller de secteur.  Now, these reports were to be submitted to the bourgmestre, the bourgmestre who was to submit them to the préfet.  So the bourgmestre was aware of everything that was going on, and the préfet was also aware of all the events, and they were present.  So the authorities did nothing to halt the killings that started on the 7th of April and went on until the 30th of June.  The perpetrators of the massacres were never stopped, arrested.  No military or judicial authority ever took a decision to stop the perpetrators of the massacres. 
Q.	Last time:  Did anyone say anything about whether what was going on was a good idea, a bad idea, was the subject of any comment?  Can you help us?  What was said? 
A.	No.  No one condemned what was going on because everyone was saying that we were in the process of eliminating our enemies.  Now, you cannot tell someone who is saying that he is eliminating his enemy that he is acting wrongly.  We were all aware that the Tutsis were being killed, and from grassroots level to the highest level, everyone was aware that the Tutsis were being killed.  Everyone had the chance to see the corpses of Tutsis; therefore, I do not know who would have said that what was going on was a crime, whereas the top authorities, who were supposed to condemn these acts, were the very perpetrators of those crimes. 
Q.	Was there any other meeting of figures of authority that you became aware of on that day, the 10th of April?
A.	No.  I didn't participate in such meetings so as to know if they were being held.  But normally, when the prefect has received a report -- has just received a report, he reports in his turn to his superiors.  And who was the prefect superior?  It was the minister.  And who was above that minister?  It was the minister of defence.  So I don't know if such meetings took place.  Perhaps the prefect could answer that question.  But in any case, when he addressed us, he told us that decisions taken had come from above.  So he must know what sort of meetings he'd attended before giving us orders and instructions. 
Q.	Did anything happen at the Hôtel des diplomates on the 10th of April that you know about? 
A.	On the 10th of April, I should like to, first of all, make it clear that certain top people lived at the Hôtel des diplomates.  It was a very well-protected place in the vicinity of the military.  What happened on the 10th is that the Interahamwe told us that they had obtained weapons from the Hôtel des diplomates, and it was soldiers who had issued those weapons to them to ensure public safety, security. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, your question was, "What happened at the Hôtel des diplomates?"  Are you satisfied with the answer?  Was that the answer that you expected to the question?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour -- well, as you asked me, the answer is yes.  But I want to expand on what it is that the witness says.  What I am looking for in my mind at the moment is the most appropriate next question.  I haven't gone quiet because I've been stunned; I've gone quiet because my mind is feverishly working on what might be an important next question. 
JUDGE SHORT:
My question is -- the answer he gave, "The Interahamwe told us that they had obtained weapons from the Hôtel des diplomates, and it was soldiers who had issued those weapons to them to ensure public safety, security," did that happen at the Hôtel des diplomates?  
MR. MORLEY:
That's what the witness believes to be true. 
JUDGE SHORT:
It isn't very clear.  Can you clarify it?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, of course.  There is going to be quite a number questions about the Hôtel des diplomates. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	First of all, Witness, without naming the individual, what was your source of information as to what had happened at the Hôtel des diplomates? 
A.	I had a younger brother who was in the Interahamwe.  He was a responsable for (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) cellule, which was in my secteur, the secteur I led.  He came to my house.  He was carrying a firearm, a gun, and he told me that he had obtained it at the Hôtel des diplomates, and he told me that the Tutsis' fate was sealed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are wondering if, by identifying the cellule for which his brother was responsable, if he would identify himself.  Should we redact the name of the cellule?  
MR. MORLEY:
It had occurred to me to make that request.  One would have to be fairly hard-working to work things out, but Your Honour is right.  Your Honour's sensitivity is correct.  I would invite redaction of the name of the cellule.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The order is made. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, you had a younger brother who was in the Interahamwe.  He received a firearm.  Who did he receive it from, please? 
A.	He told me that the Interahamwe had assembled at the Hôtel des diplomates, that the soldiers came with a vehicle from Kigali camp, Kigali barracks, and that they had distributed arms to them, firearms.  And it was the chief of the Interahamwe for Kigali préfecture, Georges Rutaganda, and one Bernard, but that the top leaders were also at the Hôtel des diplomates. 
Q.	I am going to take this in stages.  First of all, what was Bernard's surname, if you can remember, please? 
A.	Maniragaba, Bernard.  Maniragaba, Bernard. 
Q.	Now, we know that man, and Rutaganda, to be members of the national committee for the Interahamwe.  You mentioned there were other senior people at that hotel.  Please name the senior people who were at that hotel when there was the distribution of guns, please.  
A.	My younger brother reported to me that the leaders -- the one who spoke was the minister of youth and cooperative movement from the MRND party, and he told me that in his speech he said, "On behalf of all the MRND national leaders, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera had agreed with the general staff, with the higher commander of the army, the chief of general staff, to distribute those arms."  The government had been instituted the day before, and all the top people were there, the top leaders from the MRND, as well as other leading figures were there at the Hôtel des diplomates. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have an objection to this, and also a motion that's related to this.  It's going to take a few minutes for me to state the motion, and I would ask that the witness be excused at this time so I can make the motion.  I think it will bring us to the time of our break, and I know he doesn't speak English fluently, but I think this is the kind of thing that he should not be present for. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have ten minutes to the mid-afternoon recess.  And, Mr. Witness, as far as you're concerned, our mid-afternoon recess will commence now, so you are excused.  You will be called back when we resume after the recess. 
MR. MORLEY:
As the witness is retiring from Court, may I mention, if this is a motion relating to what the witness proposes to tell us about, events at the Hôtel des diplomates on the 10th of April, which has been prepared in advance by my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, although one cannot complain about it loudly, it certainly is not something I have been on notice of, and it might have been helpful to put me on notice of it.  I do attempt, as best I can, to put my learned friend on notice of those things which are coming his way.  If this is something that is pre-prepared, can I express my disappointment that my learned friend has not been able to share its imminence with me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, if you can just contain yourself a little bit longer, you may be able to make your protest, if it is deserved.  Note the word "if" in front of it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, at this time I want to make a motion to exclude the testimony you have just heard from this witness about the events at the Hôtel des diplomates on the 10th of April, and I am also making a motion for a mistrial at this time.  

The basis of my motion is that the Prosecutor is in breach of his obligation to offer evidence -- not to offer evidence which he knows, or has reason to believe, is false.  We have heard testimony from Witness G that, on the 10th of April, the very same day, members of the national committee of the Interahamwe met at the Hôtel des diplomates with Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Ngirumpatse, and even Mr. Karemera, and ordered to go around to the secteurs and stop the killing.  

We now have testimony elicited by Mr. Morley, who also re-examined Witness G, that on the 10th of April the Accused had directed the military to hand out weapons at the Hôtel des diplomates for the killing of Tutsis. 

The Prosecutor also indicated in its pre-trial brief that this witness -- and I am reading from paragraph 89:  "Witness UB will testify that he, too, attended meetings with the MRND executive bureau and Bagosora at the Hôtel des diplomates around 10 April, and they ordered guns to be distributed to militiamen."  

So, where we stand now is the Prosecution has elicited evidence from this witness contrary to the testimony of Witness G, contrary to its own pre-trial brief in which this witness had apparently indicated he was present, that the witness was told by his younger brother that evidence was -- that arms were being distributed at the direction of the Accused.  This is not the first time that the Prosecution has elicited testimony which is in direct contradiction to those facts which it know to be true. 

Witness Mbonyunkiza testified to attending three meetings in February 1992 where the national Interahamwe committee members were present and in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse explicitly called for the extermination of Tutsis; axes were displayed and songs were introduced calling for the extermination of the Tutsi.  Immediately after that we have the testimony of Witness G, who regularly attended the same meetings and said that no such things occurred.  And the Prosecution has that same information from Witness T, another person who attended the meetings. 

The Appeals Chamber has said that, "In exercising its powers, the prosecution counsel must adhere to professional standards, even those set out in its own regulation, number 2.  And its own regulation, number 2, says that the prosecution must be, and appear to be, consistent, objective, and independent."  That's paragraph 2(C).  

In paragraph 2(E), "They must demonstrate respect and candour before the tribunal, and not knowingly make an incorrect statement of material fact to the tribunal, or offer evidence which prosecution counsel knows to be incorrect or false."  

I suggest to you, given the two directly opposite versions that the two witnesses of the Prosecution have given, now for the second time in this trial, the Prosecution has to know that one of those is incorrect or false. 

The Appeals Chamber also has said that, as staff members of the United Nations, the prosecutors have a duty to act in accordance with the charter of the United Nations, and as staff rules and regulations, which include a duty to act with integrity and honesty, and that's the Niyitegeka appeals judgement of 9 July 2004 at paragraphs 15 and 16. 

Judge Shahabudeen, sitting in the Barayagwiza case on the Appeals Chamber, said that, "The prosecutor is not supposed to be a partisan, and that prosecution counsel ought to bear themselves rather in the character of ministers of justice assisting in the administration of justice." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, could you spell Judge Shahabudeen and the name of the case in which he was appearing?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  It's S-H-A-H-A-B-U-V-D-E-E-N (sic), and the Barayagwiza case is B-A-R-A-Y-A-G-W-I-Z-A, and that was a separate opinion of 31 March 2000.  

The Appeals Chamber said in the Kajelijeli case -- K-A-J-E-L-I-J-E-L-I -- in its judgement on the 23rd of May 2005 that, "A chamber should consider there being an abuse of process when there has been a serious and egregious violation of the accused's right that would prove detrimental to the court's integrity."  

And in the Akayesu judgement on appeal, on the 1st of June 2001, the Appeals Chamber said that "Abuse of process is something so unfair and wrong that the court should not allow the prosecutor to proceed."  And "Akayesu" is A-K-A-Y-E-S-U.  

And they also say in the Nyiramasuhuko case, in the decision on stay of proceedings and abuse of process on the 24th of February -- 20th of February 2004, that, "The abuse of process may be a doctrine, may be relied on in two distinct situations:  One, where there is delay, and the second, where the circumstances of a particular case proceeding with the trial of an accused would contravene the court's sense of justice due to impropriety or misconduct."  

And I suggest, Mr. President, that by eliciting evidence which is in direct contradiction to evidence elicited from other witnesses, the Prosecutor is engaging in an abuse of process, is violating his own ethical standards, and is causing a black mark upon the integrity of these proceedings, and as a result of that I would ask that the Court declare a mistrial so that we can begin these proceedings anew with a consistent, honest theory of the case against my client; and, in the alternative, that the Court exclude the testimony that we have just heard concerning the events of 10 April at the Diplomat Hotel from this witness.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Does anybody else want to have a go?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, my question is prompted solely by the comments made by Mr. Morley, and also by my observations of your stance during your latest rhetorical contribution to the trial:  Were you reading from an appropriate document?
MR. ROBINSON:
Good question.  I was reading from an outline.  But in response to Mr. Morley, until I saw that he led this evidence, although I expected him to do so, the matter was not ripe as far as I was concerned.  I feel under no obligation to give him professional advice as to what kind of evidence he should lead.  So I don't think it is appropriate for me to raise issues with him until they are ripe, and I am not going to do that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But is this evidence in the statement?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, this evidence is in the statement.
JUDGE SHORT:
You must have known he was going to lead this evidence. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I didn't, and until he led this evidence, I was not in a position to complain until you heard exactly what the evidence was that now directly contradicts evidence that has been led earlier. 
JUDGE SHORT:
If this evidence is in his statement, you could have indicated to Mr. Morley that, "If the witness goes ahead and testified about this particular incident, which is in the statement, we would make a motion for exclusion." 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't know of any rule that requires me to tell Mr. Morley what I am going to object to in advance.  If he --
JUDGE SHORT:
We are not talking about rules; we are talking about courtesy of the bar. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, at least from my own perspective, I don't think that that's in the best interests of my client, to be tipping off to the Prosecutor what is concerning me and what I am going to object to. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay. 
MR. MORLEY:
Before I reply, I simply make the enquiry -- this is a motion for a mistrial no less -- does any of the other Defence counsel want to make a contribution before I reply?  Observing the silence -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, it is five minutes past four. 
MR. MORLEY:
I can take this point very quickly, unless Your Honours feel the need for caffeine. 
(Pages 33 to 48 by Jennifer Spring)

1604H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can survive if it's just a few minutes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  This is perhaps a very good reason why my learned friend might have benefitted, to the benefit of his client.  Had this interesting and colourful motion been something I was on notice of, we could have discussed it in advance, in the best traditions of the robing room, and it may be that, in light of what I'm about to say, the motion wouldn't have been made.  

The motion is premised on the argument that my learned friend has demonstrated a flat inconsistency between the Prosecution case as elicited by G and the Prosecution case as elicited by UB.  If he can't demonstrate that, then the motion falls.  I respectfully submit it is patently demonstrable that there is no contradiction between the two witnesses.  

G refers to being at a meeting with Nzirorera, Karemera, and Ngirumpatse, and I believe Mugenzi, in which there's a discussion of what's popularly been termed now the "bogus pacification tour."  The Witness UB describes how his younger brother told him of how his younger brother was addressed by the minister of youth, in which the minister of youth said that the distribution of weapons had been approved by, among others, Karemera, Ngirumpatse, and Nzirorera.  The younger brother is not, according to UB, saying that he, the younger brother, was in attendance on Karemera, Ngirumpatse, and Nzirorera.  The younger brother was describing what the younger brother heard from the minister of youth.  

So it is patently obvious, I hope I don't overstate it, to say that G's meeting with the three Accused can have taken place at the Hotel Diplomat whilst there can also have been a report to young members of the Interahamwe -- whilst receiving weapons from the minister of youth -- that the weapons were being distributed with the authority of Ngirumpatse, Nzirorera, and Karemera.  There is no contradiction.  There is no moment of dénouement on the Prosecution's case created by the evidence.  And if my learned friend and I had had an opportunity to discuss it, it may well be, although perhaps he can't admit it now, that this is not a motion which should have been brought.  

It is a dramatic motion.  It suggests impropriety and unethical conduct on the part of the Crown -- I'm sorry, the Prosecution, and a moment's reflection and discussion may well have put my learned friend's mind at rest.  On the facts, the motion is completely misplaced, and that's the answer to it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you want to delay our break by your reply? 

MR. ROBINSON:
No, I can reply after the break.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the mid-afternoon recess now. 
(Court recessed from 1606H to 1703H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you are about to reply. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Mr. President, before I do, I think my colleagues would like to be heard.  So maybe perhaps they can be heard and then I can reply.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, you prefer my invitation to Mr. Morley's?  
MR. SOW:
I would rather take up your invitation, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, I took advantage of the break to cross-check the preliminary brief by the Prosecutor.  As you know, the preliminary brief attached a summary of testimonies presented.  In fact, as you read the summary, at item 13 you will see that in the pre-trial brief Witness UB said that between the -- there was a meeting at the Hotel Diplomat on the 10th of April between the executive bureau and Colonel Bagosora, where weapons were ordered to be distributed.  

In the Prosecutor's pre-trial brief, and items 89 and 105, the same theory was confirmed.  So Mr. Robinson is perfectly right in saying that these are not just mere contradictions because I believe that there's a difference between recognising that he participated in a meeting and saying that he did not participate in the meeting but that he, rather, obtained information about it from his brother.  And, therefore, it is clear that, besides the abuse of procedure, as indicated by Mr. Robinson, there is also the issue of false testimony that has been presented.  And for this reason, I quite support Mr. Robinson's motion, and I would like you to rule in its favour.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I do not want to stay out of this debate.  You must imagine, earlier on I wanted to intervene, but my learned friend quickly took the floor.  It is not because we did not rise to point out the glaring contradictions in this witness's testimony through the various testimonies he has presented that we would merely leave it to Mr. Robinson to make a motion and not support the motion, which we do, indeed, support.  

And to add to the previous speakers' interventions, there is also the testimony of Witness UJ on the meeting at the Diplomat Hotel, which completely contradicts the testimony by the present witness.  And there should be no question of bringing in witnesses who are giving contradictory evidence to that theory which the Prosecution seeks to tender.  So we do support Mr. Robinson's motion.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'll be very brief in reply.  It's our position that the testimony of Witness G and the testimony of Witness UB as to what happened on the 10th of April 1994 are completely irreconcilable.  And we can show that by the fact that Witness G testified that in the morning of the 10th of April he was picked up by Bernard Maniragaba and taken to the Diplomat Hotel where he met with the Accused.  And they instructed them to stop the killing, and they thereafter immediately, all of them, with Mr. Maniragaba included, went around to all of the secteurs and told the people to stop the killing, and that was the message of the government. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  It's M-A-R -- M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A. 

Witness UB has testified that this same Mr. Maniragaba, who was in the continuous presence of Witness G on the 10th of April, was in front of the Hotel Diplomat, handing out weapons at the instructions of the Accused.  Those testimonies are completely irreconcilable, and the Prosecutor is not so obtuse is -- as to know that.  I suggest to you that the Prosecution is not acting in the highest traditions of these international tribunals.  

At Nuremberg, Justice Jackson said that we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record on which history will judge us tomorrow.  And to pass these defendants a poisoned chalice is to put it to our own lips as well.  And I suggest to you the Prosecution has simply advocated a win-at-all-costs strategy here.  They don't care what's the truth.  They just want to throw up any testimony of any witness who can accuse my client and hope that it'll stick.  And that is not in the best traditions of international criminal justice, and I'd ask that you take some action to put a stop to it.  

Thank you.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, and the rest of the Defence, are you suggesting that anytime you think that two Prosecution witnesses have given testimony that is contradictory or inconsistent we must review the transcripts and make a finding that the testimony of these two witnesses are inconsistent or irreconcilable and then proceed to declare the trial -- that's a mistrial?  

And, furthermore, where the Prosecution disagrees with your evaluation of the testimony, are you suggesting that in the middle of the trial we should stop and make a finding of fact that these Prosecution witnesses have given inconsistent or irreconcilable testimony and then declare that there is a mistrial?  Is that really the principle of law you are inviting us to apply?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Judge Short, not -- and the reason is that you -- when -- when it's called to your attention by way of motion that the Prosecution is leading evidence which it knows or should know is false, you have an obligation to step in at that point, if called to your attention, and declare, if found to be true, that there is an abuse of process going on in this courtroom and to take -- and to take action to remedy that, not simply to sit and wait until the end of the trial and weigh evidence.  You can do that when there's conflicting or inconsistent evidence, but when it's irreconcilable, when the Prosecution is leading two absolutely inconsistent versions of the same event, whereas one has to be true and one has to be false, it's my position that that's an abuse of process, for which, when called to your attention, you are obligated to, yes, go look at the transcript, make sure I'm correct and it is irreconcilable, and, if it is, to take -- give us some remedy.  And that's my position, yes.  
MR. MORLEY:
Do Your Honours need to hear further from me?  

The only thought I have at this stage is that, cunningly, my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, has actually shifted the argument from the irreconcilability between the pacification tour and what was announced by the minister to the narrow point of whether Bernard was at the meeting and could have been present at the distribution of arms.  And there are various things that can be said about that, and none of them amount to inconsistency.  There are a variety of different findings of fact available to the Tribunal, and the suggestion that the irreconcilability amounts to a falsehood on the part of a witness is nonsense.  

Do I really need to develop this?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, before you made your last contribution to the debate, I was about to tell you -- when you requested if we needed to hear further from you, I was going to simply say no, but you went ahead anyway, and we heard you. 
MR. MORLEY:
That is, unhappily, my trademark.  My apologies. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose in the interests of our being careful with the spoken word, we had better reserve our ruling until tomorrow morning.  But in the meantime we think you should proceed with your witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  

Mr. Issa, with your assistance, the Witness UB again and the curtains.  
MR. WEBSTER:
While the witness is coming in, Your Honours, there is something that I can clarify with the Court so we can perhaps save five minutes.  I received an email -- actually, it was directed to Mr. Hometowu in the court management section and copied to me.  It was from Professor André Guichaoua, who's spent the last four or five days here in Arusha working on his expert report.  His communication was that his report was being dispatched today by DHL and that we should receive it here in Arusha, as long as it -- you know, in the time that it takes DHL to transfer it from France to Arusha.  So I do not have it in my possession today.  I don't think I will receive it by the end of business today, so I simply wanted to apprise the -- the Trial Chamber and the parties that Mr. Guichaoua has undertaken to send his report.  He's dispatched it, but we have not yet received it.  So it cannot be filed today, the 28th of February, which is the date that the Court had asked us to provide it.  

I don't have copies of his email -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Today is not the 28th of February. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Today is, what, the 27th?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  Well, I'm on better ground, then.  In any case, I inform the Trial Chamber, and it will be fined -- filed as soon as I receive it from DHL, which I expect will be sometime tomorrow or thereafter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. (inaudible). 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, you were telling us what had been told to you by your younger brother.  That happened at the Hotel Diplomat on the 10th of April.  You told us that the minister for youth had spoken to your younger brother and other members of the Interahamwe.  First of all, can I ask you, what was the name of the minister for youth? 
A.	His name is Nzabonimana, Callixte. 
MR. MORLEY:
For the assistance of the translators, the spelling there, Callixte, C-A-L-L-I-X-T-E, and Nzabonimana is N-Z-A-B-O-N-I-M-A-N-A. 

Now, can I mention, Your Honour, that the spelling list which was prepared has been distributed and I have a further copy of it, but it doesn't help enormously as not all the names are on it.

BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	What was it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I don't know if it would help.  Do the -- the -- the court reporters have a copy? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  And Mr. Robinson is now armed with it, with which to make his next motion, no doubt. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I was wondering, would be -- would it be sufficient if you gave the number of their name?  I'm looking at the court reporters to find out if that would be satisfactory. 

Yes, that will be satisfactory.  Instead of actually spelling the name, you just give the number on the list. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'll do my best.  Unfortunately, the list is not alphabetical.  It will involve reading the list and taking a moment to find the name.  And for your assistance, Your Honour, the name I've just dealt with does not appear on the list, but there we are.  

If I may return to the witness?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What was it that the minister for youth was saying about the MRND leadership and the distribution of guns?  
MR. MORLEY:
I see Mr. Robinson is up and at it again. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Mr. President, I don't want to disappoint Mr. Morley.  I'm not going to quarrel with the spelling list.  This is an objection based on Rule 89(C) and the double hearsay that we're about to hear.  I think that, obviously, hearsay is admissible in this Tribunal, but what is offered -- being offered here now is what this witness's brother -- 

And excuse me.  Mr. Witness UB, would you mind taking off your headset for a moment?  Murakoze. 

We're hearing now what this witness's brother -- 

Mr. President, what's being -- the evidence that's being offered now is a statement to this witness by his brother -- who I represent to you is deceased, and the witness can confirm that -- of what was said by Mr. Nzabonimana, who is a fugitive of this Tribunal, is indicted but has never been apprehended, and so you're being asked to admit double hearsay of two people who are unavailable.  And I think that that goes too far under Rule 89(C) for reliable evidence for which this Trial Chamber should hear and should admit.  So my motion is to object to this -- my request is to object to this question on the grounds of double hearsay and not being reliable enough to be admitted under Rule 89(C).  

Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's admissible.  It's a matter of weight. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley -- thank you, Mr. Morley.  That -- that is enough.  

Now, that's the view that we also have, Mr. Robinson.  

You may proceed. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, if I might return to the question, what was it that the minister for youth was saying about the MRND leadership in connection with the distribution of weapons at the Hotel Diplomat? 
A.	My brother told me that when they were waiting to meet MRND leaders the minister had told them that the leaders had agreed with the army command on the issue and that afterwards they had been provided firearms and that they would then go and work with the soldiers.  This is what my brother told me.  Another piece of information was that the weapons had come from Camp Kigali and that each one had been given a weapon.  
Q.	Who did you understand was the military leader who had authorised the weapons to come from Camp Kigali?  His name, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object.  I think we have the "who did you understand" problem.  I think he should be asked what he was told, and if it was by his brother, fine, but what did his brother tell him, not what did he understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley -- I think we do agree that the formulation of the question, "Who do you understand," leaves something to be desired. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  I'll correct that. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Who organised the release of weapons from Camp Kigali as a senior figure in the military, please? 

MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  That doesn't solve the problem.  What did his brother tell him that -- who is the person, not -- he's -- the same question that he's asked is the same as "Who do you understand."  It gives the witness the liberty to say what his general understanding is.  He has this information from his brother, so what did his brother tell him as to who was the individual who authorised the distribution of weapons.  
MR. MORLEY:
If it pleases the Court, I'll put it in that way. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, who did your brother tell you had been the military official who had authorised the distribution of weapons from Camp Kigali? 
A.	I cannot answer that question because, you know, a lieutenant may come, give instructions, and not necessarily give his rank.  The top command were based in Camp Kigali, and you asked me to give the name of the high-ranking officer who gave the instruction.  But I would be lying if I were to give a name.  He told me -- and the Interahamwe leaders were at the Diplomat Hotel.  

For instance, I went to the ministry, and it is not the minister who gave me the weapons, but it was a lieutenant who was present who gave us the weapons in compliance with orders by a hierarchical superior.  
Q.	Who was in charge of the military? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, calls for speculation. 
MR. MORLEY:
How can that call for speculation?  It's a straight question about a factual issue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, Mr. President, if you would like a reply, how does this witness know who was in charge of the military?  He was certainly not at Camp Kigali, so any information he has on this is -- is speculation, unless he has spoken with someone who could have informed him of that, in which case that foundation should be laid.  
MR. MORLEY:
I do wonder whether we'll ever get to the end of this case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 

The -- Mr. Witness, you are permitted to answer the question. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the question was -- we're on the 10th of April 1994 -- who was in charge of the military? 
A.	On the 10th of April, the chief of staff was Marcel Gatsinzi. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Spelling requested, please. 
MR. MORLEY:
Gatsinzi is G-A-T-S-I-N-Z-I. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Is there any other high-ranking officer within the military whose name you know? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Please, Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, that's a very broad question. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps only because I didn't put the date in.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On the 10th of April of 1994, was there any other high-ranking officer in the military whose name you then knew? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  That's a question that's appropriate for a game show and not for court.  We don't have -- that's of no relevance that he knew the name of some other high-ranking official.  What Mr. Morley's trying to do is suggest -- he didn't like the last answer he received, so he's trying to suggest another name.  That's inappropriate.  
MR. MORLEY:
To put Mr. Robinson's mind at rest, I was quite happy with the last answer I received.  But there is another name I am looking for, and the means which I'm adopting to see whether I can get the other name is the question I've just asked.  

If I may proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may ask the question. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 10th of April of 1994, was there any other high-ranking military officer whose name you knew? 
A.	There was, among others, General Ndindiliyimana, who was in charge of the gendarmerie.  There was also Théoneste Bagosora, who was directeur de cabinet at the ministry of defence.  There was Tharcisse Renzaho, Colonel Tharcisse Renzaho, who was préfet for Kigali préfecture -- Kigali city préfecture, as well as many other high-ranking military officers. 
(Pages 49 to 57 by Ann Burum)


1730H 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you.  Concentrating on the name Bagosora, what was the relationship between Bagosora and the ministry of defence on the 10th of April 1994? 
A.	As I have already said, Bagosora was the director of the cabinet at the ministry of defence.  That means that in the ministry of defence he was the minister's deputy or assistant. 
Q.	Which ministry authorised the distribution of weapons at the Hotel Diplomat on the 10th of April? 
A.	The ministry of defence, which was in charge of public safety, security, and it was the ministry of defence that held the arms.  So it was that ministry, the ministry of the army, the ministry that was responsible for the army.  
Q.	Did Bagosora have anything to do with the distribution of arms from Camp Kigali on behalf of the ministry of defence to the Interahamwe? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I object.  He's asking the witness for his opinion.  If he wants to ask him what his brother told him about Bagosora's role, he should do that. 
MR. MORLEY:
I haven't asked for an opinion, I've asked for a factual observation.  And we'll find out where the factual observation arises, depending on the answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Question permitted, Mr. Morley.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Again, please, Mr. Witness, did Bagosora have anything to do with the distribution of weapons to the Interahamwe at the Hotel Diplomat, weapons obtained from Camp Kigali on behalf of the ministry of defence?  
A.	If I said he had nothing to do with it, I would be lying.  It is he who represented the minister.  And on another time, we went to the minister of defence and received weapons.  That means the Interahamwe received the arms on the decision of the minister of defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I think we are getting a bit confused.  You are starting to advance testimony concerning information provided by the witness's brother.  Now, this question suggests that you have abandoned that and you are doing something else.  If you are really trying to find out what his brother told him, you can supplement it with other tidbits of information at this stage.  So we are not quite certain exactly what is happening now when you phrase the questions in this manner.  Is this a continuation of a report of what his brother told him, or have you moved on to something else?  
MR. MORLEY:
It ought to be a continuation of the report.  The reason why I compartmentalise my questions in this way is in order to control the witness better, for experience has shown me that open questions which simply ask, "What did your brother tell you?" can lead to a circumstance as "How long is a piece of string?"  We can wander all along the subject and never get to the point.  So, having established what I had sought to establish, the next question is, "How did you know that?"  With Your Honour's permission -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Morley, it would be much easier if you asked the witness, "Did your brother tell you whether Bagosora had anything to do with the distribution of weapons to the Interahamwe?"  Then we would not have any objections coming from Mr. Robinson. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, I suspect we might have an objection and I see Your Honour's Brother Judge turning to the right -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Or, alternatively, "Did your brother tell you whether Bagosora had any role in the distribution of weapons?"  I don't perceive how that could be objected to. 
MR. MORLEY:
It might be objected to on the grounds that I am leading on what the brother may have said about Bagosora. 
JUDGE SHORT:
But at the moment we are discussing what the brother told him, and, therefore, what I'm saying is that if you preface your question in such a way that everybody understands we are still dealing with what the brother told him, then it would be much easier and we would avoid a lot of objections from the Defence.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'll do my best, Your Honour, but I'm not sure we're going to avoid all that many objections from the Defence.  

Turning to the witness, if I may.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You've told us about the role of Bagosora.  How do you know that?  What is your source of information?  
A.	I did not meet Bagosora, so I did not speak to you of his role.  I am talking of the part of the top officers that I know of, whom I mentioned, and I told you that we received weapons, and we received them from the ministry of defence, where he was in charge.  So his role was -- the ministry of defence issued firearms.  The population received them, but it was, of course, illegal.  
Q.	What did your brother tell you about the origin of the weapons from Camp Kigali?  
A.	I explained what he told me on that subject.  He told me that they had been issued weapons, and he showed me his very own weapon, but I was not present when that took place.  He also told me that the Tutsis' fate was sealed.  It was over for them.  It was already decided.  I told him, if that was the case, he'd better start off by killing his own wife.  That's what my brother told me of, informed me about, in respect of those events.  
Q.	Can you help us, please, with specifically what your brother said about how the weapons had been organised for distribution at the Hotel Diplomat?  What did your brother say about who had organised those weapons?  
A.	I was not present on the spot and I couldn't go on asking him who -- which soldiers were present here.  And he told me, "I received -- got a weapon."  "Where did you get it?"  "It was issued to me at the Hotel Diplomat, and other people were also issued weapons."  

So I didn't ask him who transported the weapons there, who was the soldier that brought them there in specific terms.  I cannot give you such information.  He did not speak to me thereof.  The fact is that I saw him with a firearm and he told me the circumstances in which he had received the weapon.  And I saw people, that they were beginning to kill people with those weapons. 
Q.	Before we started talking about the military being associated with the guns being distributed, you had told us that there had been a speech made by the minister for youth.  And I want to ask you, please, who were the individuals reported to you by your brother had been said by the minister for youth within the MRND to have approved of weapons distribution?  
A.	I think we're backtracking.  All right, then.  I had said that he had reported to me what the ministry of youth had said.  And I will sum it up as follows:  The top people in the MRND, that is to say, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera -- when I say the "top people", I mean those people that occupy the highest posts.  And he told me that those people had agreed with the high command to distribute weapons, and those top people didn't have the chance to come and talk to the young people.  So what we were doing between the 7th and the 10th, we were killing Tutsi non-stop, and the idea was to distribute more weapons in the secteurs.  This was the situation.  I couldn't ask for more information.  

I didn't expect that such questions would be put to me, I mean, the sort of questions being put to me today.  I could see what was going on.  The government agreed with what was going on.  The party representatives agreed with what was going on.  As far as I was concerned, I couldn't question those events any further.  In fact, when a person was in possession of a firearm, he was proud of it.  Everyone wanted to have a firearm, a weapon.  And, moreover, my brother was a member of the Interahamwe, but he wasn't the -- the member of any hierarchical superior body in the Interahamwe.  He was proud to have a gun and he was proud to use it, just as everybody else was.  And I don't see whatever information I could provide you.  He reported to me what I told you.  And I saw that he had a gun, a firearm.  He told me how he had obtained it.  
Q.	And the firearm, was it a pistol or a rifle?  
A.	It was a long thing, not a pistol, a long gun.  Only the top people had pistols, but other Interahamwe had long guns.  
Q.	Is your brother living or is he someone who has passed away?  
A.	He went into exile with other Interahamwe, so I still don't know if he's still alive.  I don't know if he's still alive or not.  
Q.	What did your brother do with the gun which had been given to him at the Hotel Diplomat?  
A.	He used it, as so many others used theirs.  I did not move around with him.  I was a civil servant.  But I think he used his gun, just as so many others did, just as so many others did.  He did just as all the others did with their guns. 
Q.	Spell it out, please.  What is it that he did just as all the others did with the guns distributed at the Hotel Diplomat?  
A.	The guns issued to the Interahamwe, distributed to the Interahamwe, were used to kill Tutsi.  The guns came from the ministry of defence, the military camps, but everywhere.  He wasn't a soldier off to the front.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm looking at the time.  I know not what the Court's mind is.  I'm conscious of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Continue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you have any communication with Mathieu Ngirumpatse at around this time? 
A.	I told you that I didn't talk much with Ngirumpatse during the war.  But before the war, as he was from Kigali just like me, and in the MRND party just like me, we would talk. 
Q.	Do you have a telephone? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I think that's a totally irrelevant question to ask, being asked in the present tense. 
MR. MORLEY:
That may be right, if I may respectfully agree.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I had a telephone at home and at the sectoral office.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	At any point after the death of the president, did you have any telephone conversation with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	On the 11th of April, I telephoned to him.  I called him.  He was at the Hotel Diplomat, and I told him of a problem with the Interahamwe, the Interahamwe problem.  Even at the Meridien hotel in Gisenyi in June, I called him and we talked of the Interahamwe problem also. 
Q.	Turning to the 11th of April of 1994, who rang who?  Did you ring him or did he ring you?  
A.	He couldn't phone me.  He was an authority.  He was my superior.  I don't see why he would telephone me.  I personally called him to put to him the problem of the Interahamwe.  He answered me that the Interahamwe know full well what they are doing, and he is busy with other matters. 
Q.	What was the problem with the Interahamwe that you were telling Ngirumpatse about?  
A.	I wanted to inform him that the Interahamwe were killing people and arbitrarily, in cooperation with members of other parties.  But when I say "people", I mean Tutsi because it was Tutsi who were targeted then. 
Q.	How long was this telephone conversation? 
A.	About five minutes, not more.  He told me he was busy with other matters, but that the Interahamwe knew full well what they were doing.  I'd also called the préfet, the prefect, or other people, and they'd give me various answers, and I'd have to be satisfied with what they told me.  
Q.	Was this call in the morning or the afternoon or the evening of the 11th of April? 
A.	I called him in the morning -- in the forenoon, excuse me, in the forenoon. 
Q.	Where was he located? 
A.	He was at Hôtel des Diplomates.  
Q.	Why were you ringing Ngirumpatse to ask -- or to discuss a problem with the Interahamwe?  What was it you expected Ngirumpatse could do? 
A.	I called him because I knew that he was the top person in MRND.  He came from Kigali, and I knew that I could count on him as being someone from Kigali.  I expected him to order the Interahamwe to stop the massacres.  So I called him because he was someone I knew.  We knew each other for some time before, when we would discuss MRND party problems. 
Q.	On the 10th -- the 11th of April of 1994, who was the person in overall control of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't know how to explain, but the Interahamwe are -- come from the MRND party.  Now, the MRND was an officially recognised political party which was a civil entity, a legal entity.  So the MRND spoke for the Interahamwe, which means that those in charge of the Interahamwe -- for example, in those days the president was Kajuga, Robert, with Georges Rutaganda as vice-president.  I don't remember who the other second vice-president was.  But they led the Interahamwe on the part of the MRND because they received their orders from the executive bureau of the MRND party. 
Q.	I know it's late.  I'm simply looking for a name.  Who was the person in overall control of the MRND -
MR. MORLEY:
	Mr. Robinson's on his feet.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I'm going to object to this as asked and answered.  This is simply rhetorical on Mr. Morley's behalf.  It doesn't advance anything, especially at this hour. 
MR. MORLEY:
It's the hour which I suspect is confusing the witness.  Your Honour knows the answer I'm looking for, and it should simply be two words. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If the answer is the result of evidence that's already adduced, then you don't need to ask the question.  
MR. MORLEY:
I do, for reasons which follow from the question which will -- I'll start that again.  I do because of the question I want to ask next.  So if I may be permitted, Your Honour.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, looking at the time, I think only two more questions today.  Please give us the single name of the person on the 11th of April who was in overall control of the Interahamwe.  I'm not looking for its structure.  I'm not looking for all the different characters who were at various levels.  
A.	The MRND person in charge -- whoever is in charge of the MRND is responsible for the acts committed by the Interahamwe, and under the circumstances, the person in charge of the MRND was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I know it's really late.  I don't think that translation was faithful at all to what the witness said.  I heard him say "Robert Kajuga". 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, I interpreted what I have heard from the other booth. 
MR. MORLEY:
In fairness to Mr. Robinson, I agree.  I heard the name "Kajuga" in there. 
JUDGE SHORT:
I think that was earlier on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps, Mr. Witness, could you just repeat your answer so it can be translated again?  
THE WITNESS:
I have just said that the person in charge of the Interahamwe was Kajuga, Robert, but the real person responsible for the MRND party was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  It is he, therefore, who is answerable for the acts committed by the Interahamwe because the Interahamwe belonged to the MRND party, and they were not a legal entity.  It was the MRND that had -- that was a legal entity, a legal person.  The Interahamwe reported to Ngirumpatse, and they told him everything they did.  All the activities of the Interahamwe would be reported upon to Mathieu Ngirumpatse.
MR. MORLEY:  
The last question of the day.  I hope it meets with Your Honour's approval.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When Ngirumpatse told you on the phone that the Interahamwe knew what they were doing, did he at any stage suggest that he, Ngirumpatse, had no control over the Interahamwe, or that he had lost control of the Interahamwe, or anything like that?  
A.	No, he did not say any such thing.  I told you what he told me.  And I repeat:  He said the Interahamwe knew full well what they were doing.  He was the president of the party.  I couldn't discuss with him; it wasn't up to me to argue with him, discuss with him this answer that he gave me. 
MR. MORLEY:
A convenient moment, I hope. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  We have to take the adjournment now, until tomorrow morning.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I have done on a number of occasions already, that during this adjournment you remain a witness and you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody, nor to discuss with any legal person connected with the trial, or with advocacy of the trial.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We resume at the normal time tomorrow.  We resume our normal scheduling.  We commence at 8:45.  
(Court adjourned at 1800H)
