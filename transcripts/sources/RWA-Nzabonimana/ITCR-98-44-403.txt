AUGUSTIN BIZIMUNGU, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning, General Bizimungu.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	General Bizimungu, on Monday when we left off, you had just been appointed chief of staff on the 
	16th of April 1994.  Can you tell us when you arrived in Kigali to take up that post.
A.	I arrived Kigali on the 18th of April in the afternoon, and I took over duties on the 19th. 
Q.	Now, at the same time that you were appointed chief of staff, did you also receive an increase in your rank?  Were you promoted as well?
A.	Yes.  On the 16th of April when government decided to appoint me chief of staff of the Rwandan army, I was also promoted to the rank of general, major general.  And until the 16th of April I was just a colonel. 
Q.	And what about General Gatsinzi?  What was his fate on the 16th of April?
A.	A similar decision was taken in his favour.  He was also appointed brigadier general. 
Q.	And what were the respective duties between you and he starting after the 16th of April?
A.	I became chief of staff of the Rwandan army, and Brigadier General Gatsinzi was entrusted a mission to negotiate, to mediate, as part of a government delegation within the framework of attempts to negotiate with the RPF.  
Q.	Now, did you have a meeting at some point with Prime Minister Kambanda in which he explained to you why the government had appointed you and why they had given that role to General Gatsinzi?
A.	Well, he was under no -- the government was under no obligation to explain to me why they appointed him.  But when I met government members, particularly the prime minister, I met the minister of national defence -- may I state that it was after the 22nd because I don't have the exact date in mind anyway.  

But after I met him and after the -- after I took office of the general army of Rwanda, there was a situation.  There was fighting in Kigali town.  And so I devoted my attention to that situation.  And it was only much later that I met the prime minister and met defence minister at Gitarama.

Now, when I met these officials, they told me why I was appointed to that office and why government had entrusted this responsibility to me as general army chief of staff.  They explained that they had two situations on hand, two critical major situations, the war situation and their desire to do as much as possible to ensure that negotiations are put in place and so that that war is brought to an end thanks to those negotiations.

And that was why they decided to appoint two officers who had been sent on mission abroad, particularly General -- namely, General Gatsinzi and Colonel Ntiwiragabo, Aloys.  Both of them left for these negotiations with the RPF.   

As a matter of fact, on the one hand, there was a priority to face the RPF on the war front.  And on the other hand, the second priority was how to engage negotiations with the RPF.  And so they told me that these two-pronged missions could not be handled by one individual.  And that was why they deemed it wise to release General Gatsinzi to handle one component of the duty while I was entrusted the duty or responsibility of defending the national territory and, particularly, do all I could to make sure that the capital does not fall into the hands of the enemy. 
Q.	And what was the military situation when you arrived in Kigali in April?
A.	The situation was catastrophic.  And why do I say this.  Kigali town was on the point of being surrounded.  And if we went from left towards the right with regards -- with respect to the north, we have the Ruhengeri operational sector, which was a sector that I mastered because I came from there, which was facing repeated assaults by the enemy which was still holding its own at that time.  And on the 18th of April -- that was in the evening -- in my discussion with General Gatsinzi, he briefed me on the situation orally without any map to back what he was saying.

That was only done the day after when events resumed on the operational map of the chief of staff.  But on the 18th in the evening, he painted the entire picture to me, and he told me, "We have already issued instructions to the operational sector for Byumba to back down and set up quarters on the hats of the Rulindo operational sector."

So Byumba was already surrounded, and they are trying to organise a manoeuvre to break this surrounding that had been done.  As for the operational sector of Mutara, it was in the throes of war since the 8th of April, and practically the RPF is running after persons, fugitives, in that sector that we really could not bring together.  And at that time the RPF had already gotten as far as the junction of Rwamagana, and fighting was unfolding between the Kibungo camp and Rwamagana.   

And so on that side the situation was not encouraging at all, and the (inaudible) sector which had succumbed and a few which were still in the hands of the commander, they were trying to resist or not putting up any resistance at all.

And so from the periphery of Kigali, that was the situation.  But in the Kigali town itself, the situation had already evolved in favour of the RPF which had conquered and was covering some hills around Kigali, particularly Mount Jali and Mount Gisozi.  Camp Kacyiru was besieged.  The gendarmerie camp of Camp Kacyiru was already under siege.

The Presidential Guard camp was besieged.  The Remera plateau, Kicukiro, was virtually on the point of being overrun by RPF.  Kanombe was taken in a vice by the RPF which was facing it and also by elements who were coming from Rwamagana and who were heading towards the capital.

In the meantime, the enemy had succeeded in setting up its quarters in Mount Rebero, and we have Nyanza which had also been taken over by the enemy.  Virtually in Kigali regarding the dominant strategy points, we only had control over Mount Kigali.  That was the situation. 
Q.	And what was the situation with respect to attacks against civilians that you found when you arrived in Kigali? 
A.	That's a rather complex question which I may not be able to answer easily.  But when I arrived Kigali, to begin with, there were many camps of displaced persons, particularly I can mention the 
	Sainte Famille site, Saint Paul, the ladies -- Our Lady of Lourdes, Hôtel Mille Collines.  All these are areas where displaced persons had sought refuge.  And there were displaced persons in this area controlled by the RPF, namely, at Amahoro hotel, at the Amahoro stadium, and at King Faisal hospital and so on and so forth.  

So there were a number of points, a number of areas, where the refugees had found refuge.  But the area -- maybe I should mention, and this one was very, very, very catastrophic.  It was just the movement of the populations.  The people were moving up and down as the RPF was encroaching.

I learnt that the -- about the serious case of displaced persons who were at Nyaconga.  They had been dispersed because of the firing of mortars, of missiles, and these persons were now heading towards Gitarama.  And so with the encroachment of the RPF as they came on and on closer and closer, you had these populations which were being pushed back, and they were being spread.  

Each time as we lost ground, the people had to move.  And it was not just going in an Indian file, in all directions.  They were going helter-skelter.  But they were moving massively, and we -- moving towards the northeast, the populations of Byumba and Kibungo who are pushed and continuously being pushed towards Rusumo.  They have not yet gone across the borders, but they are heading definitely towards the borders.  And eventually, on the 30th or even on the 29th of April, they will cross into Tanzania already.

And so, as the RPF progressed, there was a mass movement, an uncontrollable mass movement because people were going left, right, and centre.  They were on the hills.  They are not following any indicated routes.  It was just a chaotic situation on hand.  And it was a rather frightening situation. 
Q.	Who were the perpetrators of the killing of civilians in Kigali? 
A.	Well, I'm not talking about killings.  I'm talking about people fleeing.  Now, if the population is fleeing, they are fleeing danger.  Because when I got to Kigali, it is true -- the Prosecutor may want to prove the contrary.  It is true that there were no longer killings of the kind.  In fact, the first killings took place on the first days after the crash.

So a few days after I got to Kigali, there were virtually no killings again of the population.  And so that which was happening at the time was the people fleeing the encroachment of the RPF.  And as they are fleeing, they meet -- they come across miseries.  They run into difficulties.  They come, and they are, therefore, victims.  They are being killed by the RPF combatants and soldiers. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the hunting down of Tutsi or people suspected of being accomplices, was that being continuing in April 1994 in Kigali? 
A.	Well, I'm not saying that things had stabilised and that the situation was under control, but you certainly have read the communiqué published by Gatsinzi.  And it was not only that communiqué because government as well had put -- the government that was put in place on the 9th is also issuing press releases, and they were following up the facts.  

And -- well, that did not stop some killings from taking place here and there.  That was unavoidable.  But to say that there was a hunting of particular people, well, I believe at the time in principle, most of the Tutsis had found refuge in some areas of assembly or conglomeration. 
Q.	Was the army in favour of the killing of civilians or against it?
A.	You have exploited the press release of the 10th of April published by Colonel Gatsinzi at the time.  It is clear that there had been the reaction of some isolated soldiers, elements, following the bringing down of the president's flight.  But as I said, the situation was we are fighting the RPF.  The soldiers are caught up in the fight against this invading army.  And so I don't think -- no, no.  They were not in support of the killings.  They did not involve themselves in the killings.

But that did not necessarily stop others who were dressed in military uniforms from doing what they did.  Maybe I can address this later.  This did not stop some other persons from indulging in criminal offences. 
Q.	Was the killing of civilians helping or hurting the cause of the government and the army in the war? 
A.	No killing -- well, now, this is my personal conviction.  No killing could help the cause of the army, first of all.  Secondly, no killing could help the cause of government, firstly because the RPF, which is killing but whose killing is not being discussed, had taken as its priority sowing chaos foiled by the war against government tide.

And so they are saying, "Well, we are fighting because government is not stopping the killings."  And so I do not believe that a government -- a government that is worth its salt would expose its flank to its enemy in that manner more so because, diplomatically speaking and in terms of the press, this was a flank being exposed.  This was a fissure that could be exploited.  

No.  We could not expose our flank to the enemy that was fueling this chaotic situation and which wanted to take advantage of these killings, killings which were even done by the enemies to be able to accuse the enemy.  So as for the killings, these killings could not in any case help government or help the army.

That aside, this is my personal conviction.  Every killing is unnecessary and should be condemned. 
Q.	Why didn't the army stop the killing of civilians? 
A.	Now, when you talk about the army, to develop this would take some time because in my trial, which began in 2004 and which ended in 2009 -- that was all that was discussed in my trial.  First of all, we need to establish a difference between the missions of the army.  And when you are referring to the army, what do you mean?  Because we had armed forces, and there were people who abusively would say, for example, because Augustin Bizimungu became the joint chief of staff of the Rwandan army.  No.  I became chief of staff of the Rwandan army because the Rwandan armed forces was the Rwandan army and the national gendarmerie.  And each force had clear missions assigned to it.  

The main mission of the Rwandan army was to defend the national territory while the mission of the gendarmerie principally was maintenance and restoration of peace and order.  So according to the decree of 23rd January 19- -- well, I can't remember the exact date.  I think it should be 1975, if I'm not mistaken, or 1974 -- stipulated how both forces were to work and how both forces could come together.  When -- when would the army go into peace and order restoration and when the gendarmerie can engage in fighting.

All of these were enshrined in the law.  It was the minister of national defence who decides the movement of one force into the other's territory.  It was not the joint chief of staff.  That is where people inadvertently make the mistake, and it would be unfortunate if they deliberately went into saying that the army had to go into pacifying the country.  

Yes, they could go to do that in that situation.  And in fact, they had to do so under the circumstances but in compliance with the law in force.  That was it, but what was it that exactly happened.  Together we have not gone over the development of things since the 7th of April.

Now, from the 7th of April when the RPF resumed hostilities, on that same day we got to know exactly what the situation was.  There was effervescence.  There was violence that was rife.  But when the -- on the 7th of April the RPF attacked from the CMD and from the north -- it just means that the 
Rwandan armed forces -- in fact, I am talking about the Rwandan army units -- were facing the aggression launched by the RPF.

But on that very 7th of April, one of the units that was attacked and one of the most important camps -- in addition to the presidential guard, there was the major case of the Kacyiru gendarmerie that was attacked.  And so as a matter of fact, as from the 7th of April -- well, how do we put it -- the nerve centre of the gendarme which was paralysed.  

So the Rwandan general staff -- or what I mean is at that time the gendarmerie and the army, that is, both army chief of staff Gatsinzi and Ndindiliyimana.  And although Gatsinzi arrived in Kigali on the evening of the 7th, the contacts -- the first contacts that they would have to ask General Dallaire, "We have a situation of an uprising which we are trying to manage.  And in addition to that, we have a war situation."

If the gendarmerie, which has to be available to the authorities in view of maintaining order and restoring peace -- what should we do.  Let us ask the RPF to stop the fighting because these issues are not going to be sorted out by fighting.  Rwanda's problems are not going to be sorted out by fighting.  This has been well documented by General Dallaire.

But the RPF, its plan -- as a matter of fact, chaos was part of the RPF weapon.  And by planning to assassinate President Habyarimana, they knew that the chaos would ensue and that they would come as a knight in shining armour to save the people.  And at the time when the Rwandan army was clamouring for the war to be stopped, for the fighting to be stopped, for the country to be pacified, rather, the RPF was fueling the fires at all the war fronts.  

And this is clearly noticeable in the SITREP of 24th April 1994 which General Dallaire sent to New York. When General Dallaire went to visit Kagame in Mulindi for the first time after the resumption of hostilities, they were meeting on the 23rd of April.

So in that SITREP as mentioned in Dallaire's book, Kagame explains his war plan to Dallaire.  He tells him that "From the start, this is what we did.  Our programme --"

My English, Your Honour, is not that well.  But he uses -- the word he uses is to tie down, that is, to 
tie down some of the units.  And that was effectively the strategy of the RPF.  At the time when they were pushing the population, he was maintaining some form of chaos as he had infiltrated people and who were causing trouble within that population.

So that is going to immobilise the maximum amount of members of the armed forces.  And so we -- and as a matter of fact, the international community -- there are documents which show the -- attest to 
this -- are going to say there is absolute need for a ceasefire for the country to be pacified.  So how -- even if the forces of law and order were available, how could you pacify.  I don't know if there are pacification specialists.  How are you going to pacify people who are running all over, who are being drowned in rivers because they are fleeing, who are doing all sorts of things?

How -- furthermore, the Rwandan army that we were and the gendarmerie which was fighting -- how could we turn our back to the RPF to go and follow that population that was fleeing and stop it.  Where are we going to stop them?  We can stop them on one day in a specific place, and in a few hours they will be bombed by the RPF.  Then the population would flee, and then we cannot go back to face the RPF, and then we have to run with the population.  That is, indeed -- as a matter of fact, we are at a crossroads.  
Q.	So what you're saying in essence is that the RPF -- is that the government forces were unable to provide security for the population and at the same time conduct the war against the RPF; is that correct?
A.	Well, to provide security to the population as we would have wished because you need to say, when you have some locations that are guarded by the army, when you have certain actions that are being made, those are measures in the interest of the population.  

But the situation that prevailed, considering those measures which I would describe as -- those measures because there is another situation that is overflowing which is the immediate outcome, not from the reactions because of the attack on Habyarimana's plane, but a situation resulting from war.  That is a situation that would be the most difficult to manage. 
Q.	What was the Interahamwe in Rwanda after 6 April 1994?  Was it the youth wing of the MRND?
A.	Well, I did not know the situation of the Interahamwe prior to 1994.  So I didn't know the situation of the Interahamwe prior to 1994, and it would be either ill-advised of me to have known it when I arrived Kigali.  But the word -- the term "Interahamwe" -- the term "Interahamwe" at that time -- I mean who does it refer to at that time?  For the RPF -- for the RPF, Interahamwe were people who were not in its camp, on its side.

So people who were opposing it, are against it, are Interahamwe.  Now, they used this -- and this is very significant.  Because in its war for a long time -- firstly, when there hadn't yet been 
MRND Interahamwe under the multipartyism, when the RPF attacked in 1990, its objective was to fight Habyarimana and the MRND.

Subsequently, they would change what they were saying.  They are saying they are fighting against Habyarimana, the MRND, and the Interahamwe.  And in April 1994, they would continue with that same language but using Interahamwe.  And after they have shot down Habyarimana, they are no longer fighting Habyarimana, they are going to change and use the language -- they are going to say, "We are now fighting the Interahamwe." 

So the entire population, as a matter of fact, those fleeing people have now been described as Interahamwe.  Everyone is described as Interahamwe.  Let me overlap a little bit.  During my trial, some witnesses, most of them, as a matter of fact, if not all of them, who would appear for the Prosecution -- they were asked when they were attacked by the Interahamwe.

There was one who told us, "I became Interahamwe after the 7th of April."

"Why did you become Interahamwe?"  He told the Chamber -- and you can find that in the records.  He said, "I became Interahamwe because I participated in killings. " 

That is one of the understandings of Interahamwe after the death of President Habyarimana.  There is another witness who stated, "The Interahamwe attacked us."  When we asked that witness to tell the Chamber who these Interahamwe were, he said that the Interahamwe were Hutu.

"Are you telling the Chamber that all the Hutus are Interahamwes?" 

He stated, "Except the one who was not abroad."  That is another notion of Interahamwe.

There is another one who said all Hutus, even a five-year-old Hutu, is Interahamwe.

Now, in Kigali before the 6th of April, as you have heard and you will still hear, you had many political parties with various names for their youth wings.  But after the 6th of April, that was no longer the case.  All of those people were one and the same.  Yes, you certainly had some Interahamwe from the MRND whose president was Kajuga, but you have other groups.

You also have groups of -- self-defence groups.  And all of those groups have been generally described as Interahamwe.  So ultimately, I don't quite understand.  I am in -- I can't say Interahamwe.  Of course, Interahamwe would be used to refer to people, those people in the neighbourhood who -- who are defending their neighbourhood irrespective of their political parties.

As a matter of fact, in a document which General Dallaire sent to the UN headquarters on the 5th of May 1994, he stated -- he describes those groups.  He stated that these are people who obey no law, no structure, no organisation, and that even if -- even if there were a ceasefire, it would be difficult to control them. 
Q.	Did the MRND leaders have control over the people who were doing the killings? 
MR. SENDZE: 
Excuse me.  Speculation.  Is he an MRND leader?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, he doesn't have to be an MRND leader to answer the question.  He was 
	chief of staff of the Rwandan army.  He was in a good position to advise the Chamber, at least from his perspective, what the answer to that question is.  And it would be helpful for the Chamber to know that.  
MR. SENDZE: 
The witness does not even seem to know what particular group of people he's talking about.  So if you want to be more specific about who the MRND was controlling, then you can ask him that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We permit the witness to answer the question.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Could he at least -- or could the question at least break it down into time and space.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I think the witness is capable of giving a good answer, and if it seems to be vague, I'll do my best to follow up.  But I'm sure the Prosecution can do so also on cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think the witness can answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
Would you be so kind as to repeat your question so I would attempt an answer if I can. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes.  Thank you.  

Did the MRND leaders have control over those who were killing? 
A.	Now, when you are talking -- telling me that the people who were committing the killings were controlled by the MRND, and I've already told you my position on the killings, I am a bit bothered.  Well, that said, that said, I believe -- I believe that considering the situation that developed in Kigali on the 
	12th of April in which the government, along with many people including, of course, MRND leaders, left Kigali and the situation that prevailed in Kigali -- Kigali was not under control.  

I -- Kigali was not -- neither under the control of the préfet nor -- you know, in any case, in our various cause -- because people talk about Interahamwe.  They talk -- you know, we were saying that anyone who can contribute, who can contribute in assisting us so that people should not commit violence and crimes should be sought to bring their contribution, but I don't believe that the government -- the government which, in principle, has to control, that is to say, to ensure, enforce security and order -- I don't believe that any political party whatsoever at that time was in a position to do so, especially as the prevailing situation in Kigali was untenable.

As a matter of fact, it was the same all over the country.  The authority of the government -- people had fled.  People who had remained in Kigali were called the résistance.  As a matter of fact, the situation was difficult to control.  So how can I claim that a political party whatsoever could have controlled what was happening there.  To be candid, it was very difficult.

Firstly, you had the language.  When people were saying that the government had fled, the people in charge had fled, that they used to ride in cars when things were -- when going was good, but now that times are tough, they have abandoned us.  You could hear that everywhere.  
Q.	Now, you've told us that, from the army's perspective, you were completely occupied at the front and it was necessary to try to end the war before order could be brought to the country.  

What efforts did the government make and the army to stop the war? 
A.	What was the cause of that chaos.  I told you that it was a war, and that war was not caused by us, the army.  It wasn't the army that started it.  It was initiated by the one on the other side who prepared it, who took advantage of the Arusha Accords to prepare in order to reattain its ultimate objective, namely, take power.

It was the RPF that took the initiative.  And so if they are on the warpath, I mean, then they would not be fighting them self.  They would be fighting their adversary, and their adversary was the army.  That was my job.  Unfortunately, in my job description, I have my brothers in the gendarmerie who ordinarily ought to be in charge with restoring and maintaining peace and order.

I don't have any other source or forces to go and -- for example, to go and occupy the town Kacyiru barracks or to remove the gendarmerie.  I am not going to repeat the long response I gave when that situation started.  We absolutely -- absolutely forces of law and order have to be available to go and assist the authorities in pacifying.  

Now, that is what it is.  From the 8th of April to the 9th of April the communiqué -- the communiqué from the -- the communiqué of -- in fact, on the 12th of April when we go for negotiations, the first negotiations which took place between the RPF and the Rwandan armed forces on the 15th of April, when we saw the conditions given by the Rwandan armed forces on the 17th of April, when we look at the communiqué from the interim army chief of staff on the 19th of April, we want to see what was said by the new army chief of staff on the 22nd of April.  

When we see the various things that were said, what you can see clearly by the government is that we are asking for a ceasefire.  One can see the initiatives that were taken at regional level in Kinshasa, in Kampala, here in Tanzania, in the presence of the organisation of African Unity.

When we see the report the UN Secretary General sent to the UN Security Council on the 28th of April, you can see there is need for a ceasefire for there.  Let's say, "Stop this Rwandan calamity."  But there is one side -- there is the person who started it who doesn't want to hear anything about it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be shown number 11 in my packet of documents.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, what's been placed in front of you starts off with a report from -- a code cable from UNAMIR, but I'd like to direct your attention to about the fifth page of that document where there's a letter signed by you.

Do you recognise that?
A.	Yes.  With respect to the letter that I signed, it is indeed mine. 
Q.	And it's dated the 21st of April 1994, and it's addressed to the special representative of the 
	Secretary General, Mr. Booh-Booh.

Can you tell us why you sent that letter and what was the initiative being taken at that time.
A.	Now, I would like to remind you that at this time the government is in Gitarama, and let me say the communication that I had with that government at that time was done through the liaison officer.  From Gitarama I had received, as you can see on the second page and the other pages that follow -- these are documents that were brought to me by my liaison officer, and it is -- it had been sent through him by the minister of defence in which I was asked to forward it to his excellency, the special representative of the secretary of the United Nations in Rwanda, Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, which is what I did.  

The government was answering a telegram which had been sent by the 
Rwandan ambassador -- embassy in Kampala with respect to the initiative taken by 
President Museveni, the president of Uganda, to bring together both belligerents along 
with -- around ambassadors who had been monitoring the Rwandan situation.  These were the ambassadors of the United States, of Belgium, of France, and I believe of Great Britain, Tanzania, 
and so on and so forth, the diplomatic corps in Kigali which had closely monitored the Rwandan situation.  

Mr. Museveni, therefore, took the initiative of bringing them together in Kampala to see what could be done to salvage the situation.  So meetings held in Kampala resulted in the drafting of a document which had to be discussed somewhere between both belligerents if they were to reach an agreement.  But in the interim, the Tanzania president and the two delegations, that of the RPF and that of the Rwandan government, normally had to meet in Tanzania.

So that is a document from Kampala which was talking about -- which was dealing about what had to be done to salvage the Rwandan situation. 
Q.	And was the Rwandan government and the Rwandan army in favour of a ceasefire at this time? 
A.	Yes.  That can be found on the second page, that is to say, the page following the document on which you have my signature. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that the letter of General Bizimungu as well as the letter of Jean Kambanda, the prime minister, and then the pages that follow in this exhibit be admitted as 
	Exhibit D. NZ736.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ736 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, that letter was on the 21st of April.  I want to now ask if you could be shown document number 4 in my bundle which is an address you made on the radio on the 22nd of April .  

General Bizimungu, do you recognise the transcript of that broadcast? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I do as this has already been used during my trial. 
Q.	And does it reflect what you said on Radio Rwanda on the 22nd of April?
A.	Exactly. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ737.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ737 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us, General Bizimungu, what was your purpose in addressing the nation on the 
	22nd of April?
A.	As you can see, I'm not addressing the nation.  I am addressing the Rwandan armed forces, and I'm seizing the opportunity, let me say, to say a word or two to the Rwandan people because I feel -- I felt that I had to contribute as new army chief of staff.  And so what I said was that I have come and I understand that the situation in the country is not enviable, but I would like to call on all soldiers to do their duty, but I'm also condemning, scolding -- scolding the soldier who does not do his duty.

And I would like to state that the enemy we have is the RPF which is attacking us, and when it attacks us, it is attacking the entire Rwandan people, as a matter of fact, without distinction as to ethnic group.  So I was, therefore, on the side -- I was asking the soldiers to do what they had to do.  I was scolding -- reprimanding them for poor behaviour, and I was also seizing the opportunity to call on the people to live in harmony as they had done in the past.

I was calling -- so it is a request.  It's a request because in principle I am in no -- I am in no position to address them because considering the situation in which we found ourself, I was saying that anybody who could contribute in calming down the situation should be encouraged.  I was saying that the bourgmestre or the conseiller, the cellule de responsable of the cellule should tell the people in their jurisdiction that people should not kill each other.

So let me say that is -- that is the gist of my message. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And I'd like you to look specifically at page 6, and there's two paragraphs at the very bottom.  The second-to-the-last paragraph beginning with the words "J'en appelle" -- I wonder if you
could just read that paragraph and the paragraph that follows and that spills on to the first two lines of page 7 so we can understand exactly what you said.
A.	"And I call upon the members of the population to cease all ethnic conflicts.  When the enemy which has attacked us sends missiles, it does not choose any targets between the Hutus or the Twas or the Tutsis.  We are supposed to live in harmony as in the past.  You must put an end to all killings and so as not to give any fissure to the enemy.  Bring in your contribution, and the security organs will also assist you.  

"I call upon all the authorities at the cellules, the secteurs, communes, and préfectures to lend greater attention to the security issues.  The said authorities must instruct their subordinates to put an end to all the killings.  The said killings do not only flout human rights, they tarnish the image of our country abroad.  

"Dear members of the Rwandan armed forces, dear members of the population, together we must mobilise in a spirit of discipline.  We will conquer -- the truth of the majority will conquer, and I call for the collaboration of all for the construction of our nation.  Thank you very much."  
Q.	Now, General Bizimungu, you're charged with being part of a joint criminal enterprise to exterminate Tutsis.  And here you're on the national radio asking people not to harm members of other ethnic groups.  Were you using some kind of double language?  Was there some kind of code in there?
A.	Well, are you -- Counsel, can you tell me -- can you show me maybe another speech which maybe I delivered which goes against the grain of what is contained in this one.  Well, I arrived Kigali on the 18th.  When I take office on the 20th and the 21st, a war situation is on my hands, and I tell myself at least I must make my presence felt, and people have to know exactly who is this new 
	general army chief of staff.

And so I'm taking the floor for the first time on a very solemn note over the radio, and I convey this message.  And let me tell you, when I sent out this message, it is uniquely to people that I have already met.  It is to the general army headquarters and to General Dallaire that I am not speaking.  And so, please, I can assure you even the RPF jury, Madam Des Forges at the time, could not attack this, even in her book.

They tried because -- she tried.  For her I am among the people -- in her book, well, I'm supposed to be in the camp of the evil ones, and no witness should survive.  She says that it was simply to polish the image, polish the reputation.  And so Des Forges at the time is intoxicating the White House just so that Augustin Bizimungu should be held responsible for all that is happening in the country.

And so that is my conviction; that is my conception.  And I stand by it.  I assume the consequences of that conception.  
Q.	And when you uttered these words on the radio on the 22nd of April 1992, did you indeed want the population to stop killing each other?
A.	Not only did I wish that the population should stop the killings, not only did I not want anybody to be killed, but it was also my desire that the nation, Rwanda, our country, should return to peace.  And that was why I think in my speech I also invite the RPF.  And I'm saying, "Please, together, let us sit down.  Let us come to peace."

And when I say it, I am also aware -- I am conscious -- of the situation, of the military situation.  But deep down inside me, I'm saying that it is unthinkable that we continue in this situation.  And that was the language I held from April to July 1994, and that is what I stood by all along.  
Q.	I want to ask you now about the attitude toward some refugees, people who had taken refuge in places like the Mille Collines hotel.

Did you have any role in an attempt to evacuate or to save those who were being evacuated from the Mille Collines hotel at the beginning of May 1994?
A.	Yes.  Thank you very much, Counsel.  The first meeting I had with General Dallaire -- during that meeting he raised the issue of refugees in the various camps and centres.  But for him the main preoccupation was those at Hôtel des Mille Collines.

And so I told him, "Well, there is no problem.  But I also need to put the matter to the authorities for them to say exactly that which was going to happen."  And so it happened that I think on the 
2nd of May.  Because in the meantime, General Dallaire continued insisting, and also I kept on reporting back to my superiors asking for a solution to be found.  And finally, on the 2nd in my meeting, the meeting of 1st of May with General Dallaire, I told him, "Well, you can evacuate Hôtel des Mille Collines," but he told me that he needed a sauf-conduit.  And I did not see its importance, but since he was asking me so that the operation would go on well, I told him that I had understood and that I agreed that I was going to sign it, but I could not find the document anymore.

But there is the document.  The document exists.  He got the documents.  He was very happy.  He went and evacuated all the persons that had gathered there at the Hôtel des Mille Collines.  Unfortunately, on the way -- and that was in the afternoon of the 3rd.  In the afternoon, at least in the late afternoon, his troops and the MINUAR troops ran into a group -- a group of civilians who had erected a roadblock at Kanogo.  And that was where they were stopped around 4 o'clock, 4:30.

I got news of this situation, and I went out there and at great risk to myself, and that was also opposite the position of the RPF.  I made it clear that with the problems which I had -- the issues I had faced in Ruhengeri, the situation where people had been -- had gotten themselves killed at the appeals court, I told them, "Well, look.  Something bad can happen."  

So I go out there, and I find the préfet of Kigali who was talking to the population that was 
very, very angry.  And they were complaining and saying, "You want to evacuate the Mille Collines, and yet our own people are dying at the Amahoro stadium."

And so there was terrible effervescence, and I cannot remember exactly what I did at that time.  But thanks to my intervention, the préfet was there, members of the MINUAR were there, and maybe there were many more other people.  We finally succeeded in getting the convoy to go back towards the Mille Collines.

I told them, "Well, what is happening here is that if we allow them to continue going on, we don't know exactly what's going to happen to them further down the road."  And so a decision was taken for them to go back right to Hôtel des Mille Collines.  Therefore, I recall very clearly that on the 
5th General Dallaire sent a letter to me, which unfortunately I cannot find.  He wrote a letter to me in which he praised my efforts.

Well, I did not read that letter because what I was doing I was doing on the basis of my own personal convictions.  I did not need that letter particularly that he wrote to me.  And I mention it because later in the propaganda that he carried out he was going to narrate other things.  But after that, after that failure in the evacuation of the people who were at Mille Collines, General Dallaire and myself -- we -- we drew a number of lessons from the situation.  

And this time our teams sat down to study the modalities of how things went, why did that operation fail and what exactly we can do to ensure that the next operations succeed.  And so we put together our technical teams which were together going to work hand in hand.  And what he's doing on my part he was essentially going to do it on the side of the RPF.  And that was what was being done in the background.  On the 7th we made proposals to him and submitted the documents which were signed to him -- signed and given on the 7th.   

We put forward clear, concrete proposals how these operations could be carried out because at that time we had learnt of some grievances and some claims.  And I can assure you it is with a lot of pain and shame that I tell the story here, because if I signed the document and people were not allowed to pass, then we find -- we realise the situation in which we find ourselves.  
Q.	On the 3rd of May when the attempt was made to evacuate the refugees from the Mille Collines, were the members of the population insisting that there be no evacuation of one group of refugees without Hutus who were being held in places like Amahoro also being evacuated to the government side? 
MR. SENDZE: 
Excuse me.  Is counsel telling the witness what to say, or is he asking him a question?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can put that in a better way, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Why don't we look at your document number 6 in my bundle of exhibits.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have not intervened because we thought the witness had already raised that issue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I did that.  I was sort of summarising.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we weren't sure that the question was necessary anyway.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
You're probably right.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, do you recognise the document that's just been handed to you? 
A.	Counsel, I do recognise the document, and I authored it. 
Q.	And is this the document that you were speaking of dated the 7th of March in which you were working with General Dallaire to try to establish conditions for evacuation? 
A.	I wrote some of the maps, but that was a mistake.  It was, rather, the 7th of May to be more exact. 
Q.	And what is the -- what is the position that's set forth in this document? 
A.	In broad strokes, we are suggesting to the commander of MINUAR to transfer refugees in a simultaneous manner.  In other words, on the same day the transfer is supposed to take place, there are refugees that are found on the government side and who prefer to go to the RPF side and 
	vice versa so that that transfer -- these transfers should be simultaneously done.  And so we are talking about how the list should be drafted.  And we are demanding -- we are requiring that this be done in the presence of the media with some media coverage and that the population be informed ahead of time.  Broadly speaking, that is what the document is about.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would ask that this be admitted as D. NZ738. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ738 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now I also would like to show you a broadcast that was on the same day, the 7th of May 1994.  It's Exhibit No. 12 in my bundle.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And perhaps, Mr. President, we could take our recess at this time while the document is being shown around, and then I can resume when we come back with asking him about the substance of this document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Management issues.  How are you doing for time?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I expect to finish in about 30 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We take our midmorning recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 1 to 18 by Kelly Surina)





(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	General Bizimungu, do you have the radio broadcast of the 7th of May 1994 in front of you? 
A.	Yes, I received it.  But there are some remarks to make.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, first of all, can you tell us whether or not, in fact, it's a transcript of an interview that was done with you on that day. 
A.	Yes, it's a transcript, but I am not so certain that it was faithfully taken down as I said.  However, 
	pages 7, 8 and 9 and -- whatever the case, there's an error on pages 7, 8 and 9.  
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that this be admitted D. NZ739. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ739 admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, you can tell us, where is the error?  
A.	Yes.  On page 7, the case of 0149551, there's someone else who is interviewed.  And when we get to the 23rd minute, my name is mentioned.  And yet it was the same person -- or, whatever the case -- it was some other person who is speaking.  It is not Bizimungu, Augustin, who is continuing.  

And so I can see on page 11 or page 8 as well, it is noted Bizimungu, Augustin, as the author, but that was not me, and the same goes as far as page 9.  And so I believe that all three pages have this mistake.  Those who put Bizimungu, Augustin, made a mistake.  They absolutely made a mistake, and I think it may be necessary to revisit the cassette -- the audio cassette because you will certainly feel -- you'll certainly know that this was not my voice.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much for pointing that out.  I want to turn to page 12 of that transcript.  And you were asked a question on -- right after 9.5 minutes by the journalist whether you have a particular message to address to the soldiers of the FAR, and I wonder if you could read that paragraph in which you answered that question beginning with, "les militaires".
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I hesitate to interrupt, but I'm a bit curious about the last question and response from the witness because the passages that the witness has mentioned are all in Kinyarwanda, and, apparently, he's denying authorship of what's written there, but nobody knows what it says besides he.  So could we, at least, find out from him what was being said that he's not taken responsibility for?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'll leave that for cross-examination because I want to try to finish my examination in the allotted time.  So if we could just go ahead to page 12 and have him read the part that I'm interested in, and, then, if the Prosecution is interested in other parts of this broadcast, they're free to ask about that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, General Bizimunguu, turning to page 12, I'd like you to read the paragraph where you begin by saying, "les militaires".  
A.	Thank you.  "Bizimungu, Augustin.  The soldiers of the Rwandan armed forces should, first of all, be thanked for their audacity, for their determination without which you will recall that expatriates left Kigali.  

"When the expatriates left Kigali, they said that they would need to leave Kigali because the RPF has besieged the town of Kigali, and that was three weeks ago.  It was thanks to the firmness of the Rwandan armed forces and thanks to their determination that we still have the situation under control.  

"But we are in control simply because we are in solidarity with our government as with the Rwandan people.  The Rwandan people standing behind the Rwandan armed forces, the armed forces must not disappoint these people.  So together, in collaboration with the government and with the united people of Rwanda, we will conquer.  

"Consequently, the soldiers must do all to avoid all that may jeopardise this solidarity, this unity, particularly by avoiding any situations of rape, looting and theft.  Such cases are very rare and will be sanctioned with the greatest strength.  

"We have begun pursuing this and the results can be seen.  You, who live here in Kigali, you are aware of this.  We will make sure that all those who want to tarnish the image of the Rwandan army must remedy their behaviour or must take sides with the enemy."
Q.	Thank you, General Bizimungu.  Now, getting back to the situation with the refugees at the Mille Collines hotel, did there come a time when you had to rush to the Mille Collines hotel -- or, you did rush to the Mille Collines hotel in response to a situation that was occurring there? 
A.	Yes.  In the interim, there was and from the moment -- from the -- the failure or the reversals of the 
3rd of May things had changed.  The tables had turned such that I cannot recall the date exactly, but the first evacuations had taken place and that -- and that was around the 27th, I think the 27th of May.  
And so, at this time, it was something we thought had been neatly negotiated between -- among all three parties; namely, MINUAR, the RPF and the Rwandan armed forces.  

But in the meantime, Rwanda luckily was visited by a special envoy of the United Nations in the person of Iqbal Riza accompanied by General Baril, who was in charge of the DPKO, the department at the UN headquarters.  

Now, when they came to Rwanda, they put two parties together, the RPF and we on our side, so that we -- brought us to the table so that we could begin negotiations between the warring parties, and that was how the negotiations began per se on the 30th of May and at the time when the evacuation operations were already underway.  Of course, the evacuation process went in a see-saw progression because for -- from time to time it was attacked by the RPF.  But there was a special event that occurred on the 17th of June.  

On that 17th of June, following the signature of the ceasefire agreement among the politicians, which took place in Tunis on the 10th of July 1994 during the OAU summit, the RPF decided to boycott the ceasefire -- the ceasefire which had been signed at the highest level -- at summit level.  

And so they began launching attacks around that date.  And on the night of the 16th breaking 
the 17th, stating that they were going to -- to save the refugees who were at the Saint Paul and Saint Famille sites, they mounted an attack and launched -- and took some refugees with them.  But on the spot, they left many dead, including some gendarmes who were protecting that site.  

Unfortunately, in the very tense situation that we were witnessing in Kigali, of course, those groups -- that group, which is commonly referred to as Interahamwe, started launching -- retaliating and attempted to attack Hôtel des Mille Collines, for example.  

And I got wind of this while at the l'état-major contrary to what is written for reasons which, of course, 
I -- I do not understand.  When the information got to me, I am ready to go personally to 
Hôtel des Mille Collines, but at the same time we had a delegation that was negotiating -- that is, the military delegation which was led by General Gatsinzi and which comprised, if I'm not mistaken, 
four officers, including Lieutenant Colonel Rwabalinda, Ephrem, who was my assistant.  

And while they're at the headquarters of UNAMIR at Hôtel Amahoro, where these negotiations were taking place under the guidance of Commander Sogo (sic) of the UNAMIR -- the Ghanaian,
General Anyidoho, I then received a communiqué at the time I was getting ready to go Mille Collines.  
I got information from the Hôtel des Mille Collines from my communication officer, "Apparently, 
Hôtel des Mille Collines had been attacked, and we are witnessing a very bad situation since the RPF has taken us hostage."  I said, "Well, listen, I'm on my way.  I will tell you exactly about what -- happens."  

And that was how I left for the Hôtel des Mille Collines, which was guarded.  And I must point this 
out -- it was protected by UNAMIR elements and gendarmerie elements.  

When I got -- when I got to the entrance of UNAMIR at Hôtel des Mille Collines, I was greeted by a bomb from the RPF which, unfortunately, did not hit me.  When I got opposite the hotel, that is, at the hotel itself, I saw -- at the time he was a lieutenant colonel -- at the time, I think Munyakazi who became later a general from within the ranks of the RPF, he was right there very, very agitated with 
Colonel Moigny who I also knew very well.  He was Congolese from Congo-Brazzaville who had come some time before within the framework of Goma.  I had known him in Ruhengeri, and this time he was there at UNAMIR, and he had benefitted from the protection given by Hôtel des Mille Collines.  

I saw him there very, very excited, and I asked him, "What's happening?"  He said, "Well, they're right inside already."  And since I had taken care of coming along with all my escorts, which was made up of about 8 to 12 persons, I instructed my escorts to enter the hotel and -- and to -- and to save those that could be saved.  

I told myself, "There we are again."  And -- this is a second appeal court, and people get in -- into the building, but I -- I'm not at ease.  Well, I go in, and I go in -- to virtually all the floors, and there I felt that the -- the -- the threats, and I saw the threats.  It -- you were coming out of fire.  

The assailants had weapons; they had knives -- very, very new knives, and they had everything in their hands, and the danger was there.  And they were in -- in very bad shape.  We succeeded in taking these assailants out of the hotel, and what happened for us -- not to have any victim at all.  It's simply because they were still taking care of the -- they were still looting those who had taken up residence at the hotel, jewellery, money and -- before killing them.  

And so that is what happened, that the operation was going on where I was -- I got myself insulted by that gang and -- who were telling me, "Can you not see it is the Inkotanyi who are here."

The hotel -- at the other hotel you had Hutus, you had Tutsis, and if there was Inkotanyi, we would know if there was Inkotanyi there or not.  It's not for them to say there's Inkotanyi here or things like that.  

And so I did -- I made that speech and again exposing myself, because I remember in the evening when Gatsinzi came back, he and Rwabalinda came to see me and said, "Well, this is a second time that you are putting -- you're putting yourself in the line of fire.  The first time -- and you should send people and let them -- let them step in."  And yet I -- I tell them, "Well, you see, I send people."

But it is not the first time that that was happening there in Kigali.  I had noticed at certain times colonels who had come into the joint staff -- the headquarters and they'd reported that they had been chased away by Interahamwe.  

And so really having seen previously two colonels who come -- who came up to me to report that they had been chased by Interahamwe, I told myself, "Well, I have to go there myself, and let me see them chase me away."  If not, these people at the Hôtel des Mille Collines will be killed.  I don't want that.  

And that was how I went there, and unfortunately against all logic, there are some who -- manipulating this intervention who -- to say that, "Well, you went there because you had authority over the Interahamwe."  No.  I went there because if I had to die, I had to die there and simply because I wanted to save the situation. 

I did not care about the manipulation that has been done about this story, and that -- that does not make me proud because it is very, very base -- it's very, very mean.  And, for me, it was a duty to be carried out.  A duty that some, who have received awards, medals for work down at Mille Collines -- and there are some who are bent on me being sentenced and killed, while others are receiving medals and awards.  Well -- well and good for them.  I'm not asking for any award or any medal.  All I'm asking for is that justice be done. 
Q.	Were the refugees eventually evacuated from the Mille Collines, including its manager, 
Paul Rusesabagina?  
A.	Yes.  I think that on the 18th -- because on the 17th, it was not possible, but I think that on the 18th they were all evacuated.  But operations had to continue.  We are now in the second half of June.  Yes, we are in the second part of June, and, unfortunately, in all of this, you just asked me if the evacuations had taken place, but one could be tempted to believe that the job that I had -- no, that was not it.  

There were those fighting.  The RPF was exercising pressure and each day they'd win one victory and the -- Kigali town is on the brink of falling into the hands of the enemy.  And so even if we carried out these operations -- well, let's say -- I would not say, "Let's do this."  I am not doing it all by myself.  I am not alone.  There are others.  

And as in every operation, I am assisted by a G3 and some officers.  But the fighting is going on fiercely because on the 18th -- on -- or even on the same 17th, the RPF attempted to launch an attack on -- from the Kigali plateau where we had settled.  We decided to break this attack, and it did not take long because two or three weeks after, the capital had to fall into the hands of the enemy.  We were compelled to give in. 
Q.	When did you leave Kigali? 
A.	Personally, I left Kigali on the 1st of July, and at that time I went to Muramba to inform the government that, "Well, you appointed me chief of staff.  You gave me the duty of protecting the capital, but I am at the end of myself.  We had to evacuate the capital for the simple reason that for some time now, we do not have any ammunition."
Q.	When did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	On the 18th of July 1994 to go to Zaire, current, Congo, current, Democratic Republic of Congo, erstwhile Zaire. 
Q.	From the 6th of April until the time you went into exile, did you have any contact with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Before crossing over into Zaire, I arrived in Gisenyi around the 10th of July, which means that I spent about a week in Gisenyi.  I learnt that he was in Gisenyi at his residence, and I went there, and I greeted him.  I stayed at Gisenyi because at a certain point in time my family moved to Mukamira just to flee.  So I went on to Gisenyi where he was living at a friend's home, a time-honoured friend, known as Kabutura, Félix.  
Q.	Did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse between the 6th of April and the time you went into exile? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you see Édouard Karemera between the 6th of April and the time you went into exile? 
A.	I saw Édouard Karemera I think on the 5th or the 6th of June because he accompanied Prime Minister Kambanda on that date.  And on that date, Prime Minister Kambanda had visited the Rwandan armed forces and he had met officers of the two joint staff, that is, the general in charge of the gendarmerie and this officer for the army.  He met them at the army headquarters.  

And so I recall that he was accompanied by Édouard Karemera; that was where I saw him.  And another time that I saw Karemera which I -- when I greeted him was on the 2nd of June, I believe, on the 2nd of June when the government was leaving Gitarama.  But I had gone to Gitarama so as to be able to monitor the war operations because the enemy, which had crossed the bridge -- the -- on the 25th of May and which had gotten to Nyanza on the 9th of May and -- had taken two directions, 
one towards Butare and the other towards Gitarama.  

And so since on the 2nd it had gotten to Kabgayi, the government, which was found at Murambi, was leaving for Muramba.  I don't know exactly who was leaving and who was not leaving.  But as for me, when I arrived to see -- to contact the fighting units which were there on the ground and to, maybe, get know -- to know the problems they had in their hands, that was when I met Karemera.  He told me that he was on the way -- they were leaving.  And I also left.  And it seems it -- this was -- must have been the 2nd or the 3rd that I met him -- or around those dates.  That is it.  
Q.	Thank you.  Were you a member of a joint criminal enterprise to exterminate the Tutsis along with Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera? 
A.	I don't know.  I -- I don't -- there are things which have been written.  Firstly, legally, I don't know why it is a joint criminal enterprise; secondly, in no way have -- was I associated with any of those people you just referred to to hurt anyone.  

Now, my answer would be no.  If I hear the word criminal in that enterprise, then my answer is no, no.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Do any other Defence teams wish to examine this witness? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, with your allowance, I would like to put two questions to Mr. Bizimungu.  

Mr. President, with your leave, I would like to seek the assistance of the registrar for the distribution of a document to all parties.  Mr. Issa, please.  

Mr. Issa, could you be so kind as to hand the document to the witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, my name is Counsel Moussa Félix Sow; I'm co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Before you, you have a map where the "RPF advanced into Rwanda" is written.  Do you recognise that map? 
A.	Yes, I do recognise that document.  It is a document that was entered in my trial by the Prosecutor.  
Q.	Tell me, General, how did the military front evolve as from the month of May 1994 based on that map? 
A.	The month of May is pretty vast, but I will attempt to compress my answer.  In the month of May, especially around after the 22nd, the -- after the -- the Kanombe airport and the mili -- the 
Kanombe military camp were taken, Kigali was -- the pressure was felt more and more on Kigali.  

In May, that is the month when, indeed, I had just referred to this in my precede -- referred to this in my preceding answer, I just stated that the enemy, that is, the RPF, was -- we are forbidden to call it the enemy -- well, the RPF which was exerting pressure on the capital, but also was marching forward from the east to the south and west going through Kibungo, Bugesera, heading towards, let's say, Butare and Gitarama.  
Now, as from the 25th, the Gitarama and Butare communes were under attacks such -- such that on the 29th, Nyanza was taken and on the 2nd, Kabgayi was taken.  As a matter of fact, the onslaught was meant to surround Kigali.  So we're still stationed at the -- in the Ruhengeri operational sector and the Rulindo ops sector is also stationary, but the other one is -- we still have a little outlet, at that time -- which -- is Kigali -- and -- quasi -- are -- completely surrounded.  Did I answer your question? 
Q.	Thank you, General.  Quite simply if you can, based on what you just described to tell the Chamber, what at that time was the percentage of occupation of the national territory by the RPF? 
A.	Physically on the field, you could say almost half.  
Q.	Another last question, Witness.  You told the Chamber in response to a question by Peter Robinson that when you arrived in Kigali, the situation was chaotic both from a military point of view and with respect to the displacements of people.  Now, could you tell the Chamber what the situation was with respect to displaced persons around late May 1994.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I thought I had already covered that part of the question because when I -- I explained that every time the RPF advanced, there was a flow of people who were pushed away.  

As a matter of fact, you can take the image of a steamroller.  Every time it comes forward, those who are not smashed flee.  And now I know, especially since I often went about to go and see the situation at the war front where, you know, I talked to you about the Mutara operational sector which, practically, no longer existed and we had to make our judgements.  And I would -- I had to move about, and other people moved about as well.  We did this to control the situation.  

Now, especially with regard to the fall of the airport and Kanombe -- and Kanombe -- and military -- Kanombe airport and military camp, you see a mass of people who had been moving towards Gitarama.  Those people, I believe, had not yet reached Gitarama when Gitarama fell.  

So what we see are people who -- and it is a horrible -- and very painful, and I'm sure you've seen images of this which you can look.  People who have -- just keep on walking to flee both the bombings and, maybe, direct attacks from the RPF.  Of course, I am not referring here to -- to the government which had also fled Kigali of course -- and which would continue to flee.  

I should remind the Chamber that when the going was good, the headquarters of the government was in Kacyiru.  But I believe when they fled, they did not take anything with them, but I think they'll have a chance of explaining what happened.  So in the case of the population, it was suffering, suffering and more suffering.  
Q.	Your answer has led to a last question.  What about the internally -- the displaced-persons camps in the area? 
A.	I don't know if you have displaced-persons camp.  I was told that in Kabgayi, there were more than 40,000 displaced persons.  There were cases of displaced persons who were scattered here and there on the road between Gitarama and Kigali.  So those camps for displaced persons were temporary in nature because -- they're very temporary in nature because those people are moving as the front line advances.  

For example, when they state that the RPF was arriving in Bugesera and that they freed the Bugesera communes, those who did not flee towards Burundi, who crossed and reached Gitarama, reached Gitarama.  The people of Gitarama would be -- would prepare to carry on walking with the people who were arriving.  So it was a snowball.  I can't say -- I mean, I can't see how I can answer your question.  
Q.	Thank you, General.  I think you answered my questions, and I would like to thank you for having agreed to answer my questions.  
MR. SOW:  
Mr. President, before I end, I would like to apply for the document I handed to be admitted into evidence, the document concerning the RPF advance into Rwanda.  So that is the document I would like to have admitted into evidence. 

And I'd also apply, if you so agree, Mr. President, and as the witness recognises and it was used during his trial that the -- the registrar should tell us what number should be attributed to it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We have no objection to the admission of the document.  But I would like to place on the record where it comes from, because I don't think this witness actually drew up this map.  It obviously comes from a book.  

Does Mr. Sow know what book it comes from so that we can just identify it for the record? 
MR. SOW:
Mr. Prosecutor, I -- I can assure you that I didn't claim that it was made by the witness.  It is a document which was used by the Prosecutor himself during the trial of the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That I understand, but I'm just trying to find out who drew up the map and where it was published previously if -- if the Defence knows.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. Prosecutor, I do not know.  I know that the Prosecutor used it during the trial of the witness.  So I believe that should not be an issue as it comes from the other side of the aisle.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe the witness himself knows.  Perhaps Mr. Sow can enquire from the witness.  

MR. SOW:
Mr. -- Your Honour, is -- is this useful, as this comes from the Prosecutor who had used it?  Now, if the Chamber wants that piece of information, they can put it to the witness.  But I don't think it is useful, especially as the Prosecutor does not oppose that document being admitted as it comes from him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit the document.  
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The document will be D. K3158 (sic).  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. D. K138 admitted)
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I am on my feet to state that I have questions for General Bizimungu, but the manner in which my colleague Counsel Robinson has led his examination-in-chief, I would rather drop those questions so that the general does not repeat the same things he has already said.  That is what I wanted to have entered into the records.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you're now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. HOMETOWU:
The entire examination-in-chief lasted 5 hours 59 minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. SENDZE:
Yes.  Good morning to the Court, and good morning to the parties. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Good morning to you, General.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution Sendze.  
Q.	Oh, I see you already know my name.  That's good.  Now, you've been testifying before this Trial Chamber for 5 hours and 59 minutes.  That's a pretty long time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sendze, we can generously equate it to six hours.  
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I note your generosity.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	So you've really been on the stand for quite a while, and you've helpfully given evidence before this Trial Chamber which is going to be useful.  But, you know, we've all been hearing you for this while and for some strange reason last night I could hear your voice in my dreams.  

So I would like to request of you during this cross-examination to listen to the questions that I will put to you and try to answer them in a very precise manner so that we don't take too much time in cross-examination.  Are you with me on that? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for the offer.  I also will desire that this does not last long.  As a matter of fact, I would rather you didn't cross-examine at all.  
Q.	I'm sorry, General.  I will have to ask you a few questions.  

Now, you testified that in October 1990, Rwanda was attacked by the RPF; correct? 
A.	Exact.  
Q.	And there was another attack in January of 1991; true? 
A.	Well, the 1990 attack up until the signing of the Dar es Salaam ceasefire agreement in March 1993 -- as a matter of fact, we are in war -- we're at war.  You have attacks which are increasing in magnitude.  In 1991, maybe you (sic) had been attacked.  You have to be specific.  
Q.	Was there an attack in January of 1991? 
A.	Well, Counsel, I -- I am a little bothered, but let me attempt an answer to your question.  When Rwanda was attacked -- was invaded in 1990, you had several other attacks subsequent to that attack.  So the attack that begins with the invasion.  Then you have all the -- many attacks at many other places.  So tell me specifically in 1991 what place do you want -- are you referring to with respect to the attack?  
Q.	You agree with me that the RPF was predominantly Tutsi, if not exclusively Tutsi.  
A.	Yes, by and large, yes.  From the onset it was exclusively Tutsi; but subsequently it was able to recruit maybe other members, but it was exclusively Tutsi.  And I am happy to agree with you on that, Counsel.  
Q.	And this Tutsi-dominated force, the RPF, attacked the Republic of Rwanda at the time which was predominantly Hutu; is that correct? 
A.	No.  The -- the Rwandan republic in 1990 was solely the Rwandan republic -- the Republic of Rwanda with three ethnic groups, and each ethnic group had a proportion, let me say, with respect to the size of the population.  But no one said that Rwanda -- the Republic of Rwanda was a -- a -- a republic which was maj -- in majority Hutu.  No, that was not said.  
Q.	So the Hutu were not the majority in Rwanda? 
A.	I agree 95 per cent.  
Q.	You testified that when the Tutsi-RPF force would attack the republic, this would open up scars.  Were you referring to scars of ethnic tension within Rwanda? 
A.	Beginning from the colonial times that I know because -- you know, I was born in 1952, starting from the bloody events that led to the overthrow of the monarchy and talking about the -- the Inyenzi incursions, which I developed here, and the 1972-1973 ethnic tensions that took place.  Yes, that's it.  
Q.	And this -- because the scars had been opened, there were reprisals within Rwanda.  That is what you testified to on the 8th of February. 

Now, I want to ask you, is it not the case that these reprisals constituted of the Hutus attacking the Tutsis who lived within Rwanda? 
A.	In some spots but not everywhere.  It -- it wasn't generalised.  You should not generalise it.  
Q.	Okay.  But that is what happened specifically to the Bagogwe.  Wasn't that the case? 
A.	Yes, I agree, but also people shouldn't take what was exaggerated because a minister of the interior at the time conducted an investigation, and it was found that there were exaggerated reports in the media and that you even had names of people who were alive and who were said to have died.  
MR. SENDZE:
My apologies to the Court and the parties for omitting to distribute my bundle.  Please, may I do that at this time, Issa.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	While that is being done, Witness, I think we can continue. 

I want to put it to you that the -- the attacks on the Bagogwe as a result of the RPF attack in Rwanda was sanctioned and actually condoned by the authorities of that locality.  Do you have any comment? 
A.	Now, Counsel, if I understand what I heard, that the attacks were condemned by the authorities of that area -- that's what I heard in my headsets.  I don't -- I don't think that's what you meant to say, but if that is what you did, well, thank you.  
Q.	The word I used was not condemned.  Let me use the word "support".  
A.	Yes, that is the first time that I hear that they may have been supported by the authorities.  Maybe you have your sources, but what I know is that -- that from the -- from the top of the -- from the -- the 
highest-ranking authorities of the state condemned that action.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. Issa, could you please put before the witness Exhibit P. 375.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Anyway, Witness, as Mr. Issa tries to do that, I want to inform you that it is evidence in this trial, Exhibit P. 375, which is a note from Dr. Charles Nzabagerageza who was the préfet of Ruhengeri in 1992.  And in reporting what transpired at the security meeting, they had the opportunity to discuss what had happened to the Bagogwe.  And in the opinion of those who attended that meeting, investigating what had happened to the Bagogwe was not necessary.  They said that participants at the meeting noted that the Tutsi were not the only victims because Hutu had also been killed and continued to be killed.  

Now you say that the authorities even at the highest level condemned what had happened to the Bagogwe.  Does this sound to you like an act of condemnation from the préfet and his colleagues? 
A.	Can I answer your question now?  Yes, I know the document; it was dated around May 1992, and it was a sequel to a meeting of the préfectoral council of the Ruhengeri secteur extended to the bourgmestre.  And you will find that I did not attend that meeting -- that was one.  But that was not -- no reason for which I should not be in a position to comment on that document.  

Let me make this remark to begin with.  I do not know whether you contacted Nzabagerageza to ask him exactly what he means, because he's still alive.  I do not know whether you contacted him to ask him because he's the author of this document and you know where he is found.  You want to -- if you've asked him exactly what he meant, what he was heading at.  

Secondly, I asked myself whether you've contacted all participants at that meeting because there are some of them who are actually in high positions in Rwanda and who attended that meeting.  

Thirdly, the mere fact of saying that investigations at a certain point in time -- because, to me, limiting this doesn't mean that we are opposed to the investigations on the death of the Bagogwes, but we're saying that if investigations had been commenced -- now, in this situation, we are in the month of May and concern -- as a soldier we'd described to you the situation that was prevailing -- the situation in Ruhengeri at the time, at the time when we're under pressure from the RPF.  At the time when this pressure was unrelenting because they continued killing people.  

And so I do not know which authority considers that that was the time to carry out investigations -- was it ideal to carry out investigations at that time, and I am sure and I am convinced that you have that document.  It is the document of -- by the minister of the interior towards the end of 1991 in which the minister of the interior and the minister -- the minister at the presidency in charge of security went to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi where the problem of the Bagogwes was prevailing.  And I'm saying that in 1992 the problem of the Bagogwes at the time, they -- they were not threatened at all.  

The Bagogwes were threatened only -- well, Mr. Prosecutor, I'm -- I'm rounding this up.  I see you're losing your patience, Mr. Prosecutor.  But in 1991 -- in fact, it was early 1991.  So if at the time the RPF was bringing pressure to bear on the population and the authorities are saying that may not be the ideal time to do anything, I certainly had some facts in -- keeping.  And you will find that in that document, he's inviting the minister of justice, the minister of defence, the minister of the interior to go through Ruhengeri so that they should be able to discuss this matter.  

And, therefore, I believe that it was not an opposition as such.  It was, instead, an invitation to chart out a better approach for adoption. 
Q.	General, we -- we agreed in the beginning that we'll try to listen to the questions and answer them, you know, precisely.  So, please, let's continue to remind ourselves of that commitment.  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  Thank you.  I thought I was even more precise.  Well, what about the case -- now, I'll really, really respect your instructions, Mr. Prosecutor, I will.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, from the document that I've put before you, would you say yes or no as to whether the préfet and his colleagues investigated what had happened to the Bagogwe?  Yes or no.  
A.	I will not be able to answer by a yes or by a no, but I know that there were committees nationwide.  The court -- there was a court at Ruhengeri.  There was a -- well, I -- I don't know.  
Q.	Thank you.  Still as part of the record in this case, we have Exhibit P. 393, which is a report of a commission that was set up to investigate what had happened to the Bagogwe.  And I will inform you that in the pertinent parts of that report, the commission reported -- and I will read, "That the RPF took Ruhengeri, the most important city in the north-west, in late January 1991.  They held it for only a few hours, but during that time they managed to free all prisoners from jail.  The local Bagogwe and Tutsi" -- sorry.  "Their success, though short lived, was a shock to the Rwandan authorities who sought to account for it by accusing local Bagogwe and Tutsi for helping the RPF.  

"In Mukingo, Bourgmestre Juvénal Kajelijeli sent communal police and forest guards, armed with guns to protect the forces and the national parks, to collect local Bagogwe in the communal pickup truck, together with teachers and the director of a local school."  

And it goes on:  "A communal conseiller and other ordinary citizens, they then killed the Bagogwes with stones, spears, sticks and guns."

That is a report of an independently commissioned group as to what happened to the Bagogwe.  
Do you have any reason to dispute what this report states? 
A.	Well, Counsel Sendze, I -- how do I put this.  I did not go -- do an in-depth study of the situation on what happened.  But if you want to analyse the document profoundly, I think the -- you do an appraisal of the identity -- you do a perusal of the identity or the authority.  Well, but maybe you -- you trust the committee.  But, really, I do not know this committee.  I don't know what motivated this committee.  Those are first remarks that I want to set as a precedent.  

Now, I am very happy that the Prosecutor is using this document and I will ask you, do you find my name in this document?  And if you inform me that my name is mentioned -- it's here in this document, I'll be very, very grateful. 
Q.	Your name is not on the document, General.  My question was simply whether you have any reason to disbelieve the conclusions of this committee.  If you do, say yes.  If you don't, it's okay.  
A.	Well, each word is loaded with meaning and has its importance.  Is this the only investigation that was done?  Who carried it out?  What were the reasons for carrying it out? 

Secondly, I thank you because my name is not in that document, given that for hours, for days -- that end, I -- I've done the best I could to show that I did not hold any meeting on the 25th of January 1991 at the Mukingo communal office to instruct the killing of the Bagogwes.  And it is the Prosecutor that's attacking me -- accusing me of this.  It took me a long time to prove that, and I made progress on that, and I am very proud about it.  Thank you very much.  

Now, I really cannot make any pronouncement on the purport of a document whose author I do not know and whose aim I cannot say.  
Q.	Thank you.  But before we move on from this, I want you to understand that in your testimony in chief you agreed to every fact -- most of the facts that are contained in the paragraph that I just read, that the RPF had attacked, they had opened up the prisons, and the retaliation was that the Bagogwe were attacked.  You agreed to all of that in your direct evidence.  Your difficulty now is because the authorities have been linked to these attacks.  Is that a fair assessment?  
A.	Yes.  I really would not like to throw responsibility on anyone when I have not carried out any investigations personally; and secondly, there are competent authorities that have carried out investigations.  Now, you have these documents.  Is that the only one you have?  That is what you know, and I will limit my response to that.  As for other details, I am consistent with my testimony.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, we're going to talk about the civil defence programme.  When you testified in chief on the 8th of February 2010, it was unfortunately not clear to me what your evidence was in respect of the civil defence programme.  You seemed to allege in some parts of your evidence that people did not understand what the civil defence was all about.  You made allusions to civil defence in Belgium and France and in some other jurisdictions.  

So to clarify the record, I want to ask you, General Bizimungu, to tell us what you understand in your capacity as a military officer to be a civil defence programme as it obtained in Rwanda.  
A.	With Counsel Robinson, we devoted a lot of time to this issue of civil defence, and I gave a historical background and said that people who go on rounds -- persons who patrol equipped with sticks and spears nocturnally, this practice was called civil defence.  And this was current nationwide after the invasion of the RPF in 1990.  

But I noted that once things had been clarified, only préfectures of some communes, those of Byumba and Ruhengeri, remained under the threat, and so there were measures to strengthen these nocturnal rounds by the population.  And that is what people referred to as civil defence.  That was it, and that was what obtained.  

Apart from that, I also talked to you about some initiatives which were taken here and there.  I noted the Butare university group which thought -- and in its reflection -- as for the training of all men who are apt, capable of protecting the nation and that they should be given weapons so that they be able to put a stop to the RPF and by going to war.  

And so this is another civil defence which never took place in Rwanda.  It never took place in Rwanda.  And this civil defence, which the Kambanda government wanted to institute in May 1994 but which was never put in place, and so you needed to say this is one thing.  This is the civil defence that we want and not hang on small measures taken by the population for self-protection.  

I am -- well, I know I'm not answering your question directly, because I'll not tell you that civil defence is this or it is that.  First of all, punctually, that which existed in Byumba and Ruhengeri communes never existed nationwide with respect to Rwanda.  
(Pages 19 to 34 by Jean Baigent)



















1215H
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Okay.  Now, if I understand you properly, you're saying that in 1992 there was an initiative from a 
group of people at some university requesting that people be given weapons to boost the ability of those who had been carrying out patrols with sticks.  And you're saying that their request was never complied with.  Clarify that for me, please, without explaining for a long time.
A.	No, that's where the difficulty lies.  But I understand you, Counsel.  I know the difficulty of facing -- I hope you understand the difficulties I am grappling with, and with that we will be able to unravel the situation.  

When the RPF attacked -- 
Q.	Sorry for cutting you short.  Let me help us go through this in a better way.
A.	That's okay. 
Q.	In 1992 there was some sort of civil defence programme in Rwanda.  Yes or no.
A.	That form of programme limited within the territory of some communes that were attacked (inaudible) by the war, yes. 
Q.	Do you agree that pursuant to the civil defence programme in these particular areas where you have described, non-military personnel were given weapons by the government? 
A.	I will not say non-military personnel.  I will just say some communes received weapons under the guidelines of the communal police and the population which was supposed to participate in the rounds which had to be trained, had to be guided by the communal police.  And so there never was such a thing.  And I remember that during the examination-in-chief I gave an example that these weapons were not given to Bizimungu, Augustin, nor to the other general.  These were weapons which were given to communes in the interest of the population.  And it's understood that the people who were chosen according to some criteria came from those two populations.  But the weapons were not distributed to them individually.  

There was a modus operandi put in place as to when the population, organised by secteur after secteur, cellule after cellule, which was supposed to do the nocturnal rounds, were going to get those weapons and do the work and when they were supposed to go back to refund these weapons at the said locations within their communes. 
Q.	General, I must say you are making things a little bit difficult.  Weapons were given -- weapons were given to the commune or préfectoral authorities by the government in 1992 as part of the 
civil defence programme.  Are you aware or are you not aware of this? 
A.	To the authorities, yes.  To the préfectoral and to the communal authorities which were supposed to manage these weapons, yes, they were given weapons.  But really I did not want that the media should make a scoop of this.  You are hindering me from pointing out this very clearly.  
Now, the media will broadcast that in 1992 the Rwandan government gave weapons to the entire Rwandan population and to the entire Hutu population.  No, please, let this be very clear.  It was the communes -- a few communes, the communes of Ruhengeri and a few in Byumba, and on this I want to insist.  I don't want that that propaganda should start off from here. 
Q.	General, you have testified -- you have given your evidence in-chief.  You have explained yourself 
very well.  And I will plead that you desist from trying to defend yourself.  This is not your trial.  I'm not trying to make you look guilty of anything.  So, please, when I ask the questions, please answer.  And if there is need for further explanation, Counsel Robinson will give you an opportunity to do that when I'm finished.
A.	Well, Counsel, I'm sorry.  Really, I fully apologise for having been carried away.  You certainly understand that sometimes one can be carried away by his feelings or through some interpretations.  And, as I said to Counsel Robinson when he brought me to order, I thanked him.  And to you as well, Counsel, I also thank you.  I will do the best I can, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you, General.  Now, you agree that these weapons were given to the communal and 
	préfectoral authorities.  Were these individuals military officers? 
A.	You're asking whether the communal and préfectoral officers, whether they were soldiers?  For me to answer a question -- is that what you are asking, that were they soldiers?  Is that your question, Counsel?
Q.	Exactly. 
A.	No.  The authorities, the préfectoral and communal authorities, were civilians. 
Q.	So I was not wrong when I initially suggested that weapons were given to non-military personnel within the communes and the préfecture.
A.	Well, let us not engage in polemics, Mr. Prosecutor.  I myself took upon myself to tell you that they 
had -- those who were supposed to use those weapons -- even though I didn't use the word -- but I said that these weapons were to be used by the population.  But these weapons were not given or handed over individually. 
Q.	Okay.  As a military general, if you gave me weapons or a gun to go and man a night patrol, would you expect that I, a civilian, would be able to use that gun properly and responsibly? 
A.	Well, listen.  Perfection is not of this world, and you certainly will find this in the documents in your keeping in which insistence is laid on candidates and on the persons and that their commitment to 
civil responsibility is clear.  

Well, even without these weapons, Counsel, if you go on rounds with sticks, should we expect that they use these sticks rightly?  So, well, I'm not -- I'm not saying that perfection was at these quarters, but what about the case -- you tell me -- if you tell me, for example, that in 1992 -- in 1992, since we are referring to early 1992 when this operation took place, if you tell me, "Well, we have proof that this system -- this system put in place was guilty of criminal offences using these weapons," then I will have solid arguments, solid facts to engage in a discussion with you. 
Q.	I see the time, and it's time for our lunch break.  But before we disperse, please, General, I don't know how to say this, but please, forget about the big picture.  When I ask you questions, focus on the questions and answer them.  The big picture will come together some other time.  But we cannot state all the facts here, everything that is in your head.  I know that you get carried away, but to move this process forward I would really, really request that during the break you think about addressing your mind to the questions that I put to you.
MR. SENDZE:  
Mr. President, we can take the break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the luncheon recess now.
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1405H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. SENDZE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Good afternoon to everybody.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General Bizimungu, I hope you enjoyed your lunch.  

Now, when we left off we were discussing weapons given to préfectoral authorities and 
commune authorities.  I want to draw your attention and the Court's attention to Exhibit D. NZ732.  
MR. SENDZE:
Could the witness be given 732, please.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	This is a letter that you looked at in your direct examination, a letter from Faustin Munyazesa dated the 20th of January 1992.  

You recognise this document, don't you, General?  
A.	I do. 
Q.	And this is the document that discusses the distribution of 300 weapons meant for the population; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it does, but I have indeed explained the actual situation. 
Q.	I would kindly request of you to read paragraph 3 of that document.  It starts with "the reception".
A.	"Upon receiving the president's message, kindly contact commanders of local operations and bourgmestres concerned.  Study practical modalities to share and distribute weapons.  
"The Rwandan army general staff headquarters will provide assistance with respect to maintenance and use.  The commander of the local operations shall ensure the training and -- tactical training and coordination."  

May I carry on?  
Q.	Thank you.  Who is Munyazesa referring to as the operational commander? 
A.	Well, Munyazesa is the minister of the interior.  Maybe -- there was something that was not properly interpreted.  What did you mean?  Because I didn't quite understand your question.  
Q.	You were commander of local operations in -- on the 20th of January 1992, were you not? 
A.	Yes, I was the commander of operations in this Ruhengeri secteur. 
Q.	So it is you Munyazesa is referring to as being in charge of organising the use and training in respect of the weapons that were to be distributed to Ruhengeri; isn't that the case? 
A.	So the use of weapons.  I heard the word "use".  
Q.	General Bizimungu, the document is in evidence.  All I want you to confirm -- or all I want you to agree is that you're the person being referred to in the document when they talk about the operational commander.  Do you agree with me? 
A.	As far as I am concerned, yes.  But you have to add the fact that at some point in time in the Ruhengeri préfecture there were two operational secteur commanders:  The one for Ruhengeri and the one for Kirambo, who was also in the Ruhengeri préfecture. 
Q.	All right.  Let's go back to the weapons, as we agreed before we broke for lunch, that weapons were given to members of the population.  And I asked you if you thought it was but proper that if you gave weapons to civilians you would have to train them in the use of those weapons.  Don't you agree with me? 
A.	That was simply legitimate.  It wasn't only Rwanda that did it.  If you were to listen to what has happened the world over, that's what is done.  So it was legitimate.  

However, I would like to say I didn't talk about the distribution of weapons to the population.  I said, "Providing some weapons to communes to strengthen the security of the people." 
Q.	Who were those who were going to use these weapons to strengthen the security situation in the communes? 
A.	Those were people who were chosen among the members of the population. 
Q.	So there we are.  The weapons were to be given to chosen people amongst the 
members of the population who were civilians.
A.	I am opposed to the terminology "distribution of weapons to the population".  I have explained how things happened.  Things were -- weapons were stocked somewhere.  And when the turn of the users and the need for the use occurred, they went and took them and returned them there.  Then when another time arrived, they would be given to them again.  
So you cannot say that these weapons were distributed to X persons.  Those weapons are there.  They are available for the members of the population.  Of course, the users are members of the population.  But you cannot say that these weapons were distributed to the members of the population.  My understanding is we -- that is what I understand.  If you have a divergent understanding, you can also say it, but that is my own understanding of the situation. 
Q.	Yes or no:  The people who received weapons were trained in how to use these weapons.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Where did these trainings take place? 
A.	The training sessions, I believe part in the Kirambo sous-préfecture, the other part at the Nyakinama bureau communal. 
Q.	Did you attend these training sessions? 
A.	No.  You know, a secteur commander cannot go to those sessions -- those sessions. 
Q.	Are you absolute that -- 
A.	I am absolute. 
Q.	I have not finished my question.  You named two places where this training occurred.  Are you absolute that these are the only two locations where people had been trained to use these weapons? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So if I suggest to you that people had been trained in the use of arms in front of the 
Mukingo commune office, you would say I am stating an untruth? 
A.	At what time, Counsel?  Because I can answer your suggestion.  I am talking about 1992 up till 
May -- June.  If you go beyond that and that you suggest Mukingo to me, firstly, I'll say no.  Then, secondly, I hope what you are referring to -- I think those are testimonies that came from that commune referring to the setting up of a so-said Interahamwe battalion, which allegedly was set up in the end of December 1992 whereas others referred to after the second attack of the RPF in the Ruhengeri city, meaning that it was after the month of February.  

Everybody says what they like.  But I state categorically you have to delete Mukingo from, let me say, your mind and from your documentation. 
Q.	Just one follow-up on that question.  You testified that the army was busy recruiting people after the RPF attack.  Am I correct in stating that? 
A.	I would have loved to answer you by yes or by no, but I would like to specify that after the RPF attack on 1 October 1990, there were lots of volunteers.  Indeed, that is how the Rwandan army moved from 5,000 men and gradually to reach 30,000 men.  This was not in one group.  You had several different groups.  And I don't know the ways and means used to recruit these people, but there were lots of recruitment. 
Q.	There was recruitment in Ruhengeri in 1992, was there? 
A.	To be candid, I am in no position to say yes or no.  But, in any event, the archives can enlighten us on that.  Unfortunately, I do not have those.  Every time there was recruitment at national level, of course, the Ruhengeri préfecture was also involved.  There was no reason to exclude it. 
Q.	I draw, therefore, that since you were not aware of who had been recruited and when they had been recruited, you're not in a position to tell this Chamber whether or not the recruits were trained at the Mukingo commune office, correct? 
A.	Oh, no, no, no.  That is actually deforming -- actually you are stepping hard.  The recruitment of the people who had to go either to the gendarmerie or to the army had clear modalities to be followed.  And I would like to crave your indulgence as well as that of the Chamber so that maybe I should say a few words on how recruitment was done. 
Q.	That's okay.  I thought you testified that you did not know how recruitments were done, and now you want to tell us about how they were done.  That is okay.  We are going to move on.  

Now, you also testified in-chief, when you were asked whether the civil defence programme continued after 1993, your answer was that that programme did not continue in Rwanda.  Do you stand by that answer? 
A.	I don't know if that is the exact answer I gave.  I said that after the 8th February 1993 attack -- as a matter of fact, I was showed a document and a petition written by political parties I think on the 
12th or 13th, which was requesting the government to train the people for vigilante -- into 
vigilante groups.  

But that did not happen.  That did not mean that the communes which had to face the RPF did not continue to carry out patrols.  That is not excluded.  Where there was no training, the missions that were taken at the commune levels carried on in night patrols, maybe with a certain reduction in intensity because things were getting calm.  

But I never stated that in that region the bourgmestres went and slept and that the conseillers went and slept, especially as -- after the Dar es Salaam ceasefire, there was a DMZ, that is to say, a 
demilitarized zone, which was constantly occupied by the RPF in spite of the fact that they were supposed to have left it.  

So the vigilantes, which were never set up, were asking at national level for all Rwandans. 
Q.	Thank you for the clarification.  And I gather that you are saying after 1993 the civil defence programme was not put to rest.  

So I want to ask you if you are aware of the civil defence programme which was widely discussed by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.
A.	Yes, I know that around May that issue was discussed, because -- the situation in which I was met, I was not involved with that, not because I was not -- I could not have been involved, but considering the concerns I had to worry about in the capital, I knew it existed.  And I know there is a document which actually attributes one of the roles to the army chief of staff.  But if you have the documents we can examine them together in order to enlighten the Chamber.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you.  I appreciate your lack of knowledge of the preciseness probably of the programme that Kambanda was discussing.  But would you agree with me that as part of this programme, youths of political parties were supposed to be recruited to form part of this civil defence programme and weapons were also meant to be distributed to these youths to enable this civil defence programme to function properly? 
A.	Yes, but I wouldn't like to agree in toto to your suggestion.  That document by 
Prime Minister Kambanda, when was it dated?  What does it suggest?  Is it proposing political parties or youth thereof?  I believe that it would have concerned all Rwandans, meaning -- and, as a 
matter of fact, if people talk about all Rwandans, even more so youth, of necessity those youth would have some form of political membership to a party.  

So unless they are in a position to state that youth from political parties which -- or youth who were in youth organisations, Interahamwe, Abakombozi youth, the MRND youth and youth from -- I can't say how -- how those from the CDR and PL were called, if they think that those are the youth who instead of -- maybe that's a way of calling them, of taking care of them.  But saying that the basis was a 
political party, no.  The basis was Rwandans, all Rwandans.
MR. SENDZE:
To specifically identify the source of my information, I would refer the Court to Exhibit P. 91 -- I'm sorry, P. 96.  And the discussion of youths of political parties will be found at page 6 of that exhibit in English.
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Now, General Bizimungu, do you have any reason to deny that, as a result of this civil defence programme propagated by the government, youths actually received weapons?  Let's talk about Ruhengeri where you were stationed.
A.	No, no, no, no, no, Counsel.  To be candid, on the 25th of May, I believe -- that is why I said that we had to be more systematical -- the Kambanda government, when that government thought about this civil defence programme, this was in the month of May 1994, yet -- whereas I was in Kigali since the 18th.  I was no longer in Kigali.  

Furthermore, at some point in time I had learnt that Kambanda, in that sensitisation programme of his, had gone somewhere and had made a demonstration to the effect that the farmers had to hold both a gun and a hoe as required and defend themselves as required.  That is the story I heard about.  But I wasn't with him, and that is something I heard.  

With respect to weapons, which allegedly were distributed, I can't tell.  Maybe Kambanda, who had decided to collaborate with youth, enlightened youth more on that distribution, how many guns he distributed and to whom he distributed.  If you have that information, that may be useful to me as well, in view of the exact reconstitution of what happened in our country. 
Q.	Just so the record is clear, in all what you have said it boils down to you don't know whether weapons were eventually distributed as part of the civil defence programme, correct?  Yes or no, please.
A.	Well, my answer will be the following:  I will tell you the manner in which I obtained the information.  

	There was information that came to me directly while I was in Kigali.  But there is also information that I received subsequently, particularly when I got to Arusha and came into contact with certain documents.  When I contacted Colonel Gasake, Athanase, and asked him to come testify in my case, he required that -- 
Q.	Sorry.  Please do not explain the source of your information.  If you do have information that the weapons were distributed, say so.  We don't need to know the source.  If you do not have that information, say so, please.
A.	What I'm saying is that there is information that I became aware of later.  When the colonel says something -- maybe we need to find the document which states that I gave 40 guns to the bourgmestre.  That, you must understand, comes from the boss of the civil defence movement across the country.  When he says 60 guns were given in Butare, I was not aware of that.  Now I know it.  And that must be stated for the record.  

Now, if you look at my various interventions, in May and in June, journalists were putting questions to me and indicated that the population was calling for weapons and arms.  And my answer was we did not have the weapons.  And so I am not in a position to tell you what may or may not have been distributed within the civil defence programme. 
Q.	Thank you.  So since you were not able -- you are not able to tell the Court whether or not these weapons were distributed, if I were to put before you information from somebody who purports to have known whether weapons were distributed, would you think his information would be more superior to yours? 
A.	If someone stated that 30 to 40 guns were distributed in some part of the country, well, I will be very cautious about that kind of information in stating whether it is true or not.  But if somebody says that 2,000 guns were distributed in Rwanda, I will clearly say that such information is false because no such information could have obtained in Rwanda without my being aware of it or without it being communicated to me somehow.
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. Issa, please avail the witness of Prosecution Exhibit 199.  

BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General, that is an exhibit in the trial, and it is a mission report signed by Mr. Édouard Karemera, who was on mission in Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  

If you look at point number 2.3, Karemera says, "In Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures, it seems to appeal" -- "it seems the appeal to organise civilian resistance was immediately followed by concrete actions.  Thousands of young people are currently training in Bigogwe and Ruhengeri."  

He goes on at point 2.4, the last paragraph.  "Without delay, communal authorities and unit commanders in the préfectures must be specifically instructed to select the young volunteers who will receive the training so decisions can be made about how to begin their weapons handling training as soon as possible."  

With that information before you, would you at least agree that weapons were distributed to the youths following the civil defence programme of Prime Minister Jean Kambanda? 
A.	Counsel, with all due respect and with all my apologies, the document is very clear, and I have already read the document.  

The report -- rather, in fact, the author of the report is rather concerned about the fact that government should find all source weapons.  So finding weapons and distributing weapons are two distinct different transactions.  

Maybe you want to read the document again very carefully so that we may understand the letter of the document and the spirit as well, because the spirit is not as intended and the letter -- should I say the letter and the spirit of the document are not that which you purport. 
(Pages 35 to 43 by Claudette Ask)












1445H 
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	Thank you.  Before we conclude on this, I just want to inform you that there has been evidence before this Trial Chamber of certain youths, especially in Mukingo, who perpetrated attacks against innocent civilians using firearms.  In your opinion, where do you think they obtained these weapons from? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, because you give me an opportunity through that question to provide some information to the Trial Chamber.  This may take some time.  

Would you allow me to proceed so that we can clarify this matter, given that you are raising the issue of the Mukingo youth?  

Now, when you look at General Dallaire's reconnaissance mission report, I do not recall the exact paragraph, but it clearly states that there is a proliferation of weapons in Rwanda.  And even in Kigali one can find weapons on the open market, grenades going for less than $2.  

Yes, indeed, I do acknowledge that the problem of weapons proliferation was one that existed in Rwanda during the war.  Weapons were available everywhere.  You have referred to information for Mukingo.  Maybe you also were aware of the fact that in Kigali grenades were exploding on a daily basis.  Weapons could be obtained at the battle front.  Weapons were being sought by deserters.  Weapons are available here and there.  That would be my first concern.  

Secondly, weapons were also available, should I say, in other services, such as guards in our national parks and guards in the finance services and also private security companies.  And even before then, there was the ordinary weapon distribution system and its various channels.  

We also had 144 communes -- or, should I say, was it 147?  I no longer recall.  But you may want to know that in each commune there were at least ten weapons times 140.  That would be a total of 
1,400 weapons in the country.  

And the issue of weapons proliferation is clearly raised in the reconnaissance mission report submitted by Dallaire, something or other, a document which I could make available to you tomorrow, maybe.

Now you've talked about these people in Mukingo.  They are the same people who may have come to testify in my case.  They included a number of deserters and that was the problem that the country was facing at that time, particularly, through the administration of the country.  

So it would not be surprising to find a group of bandits or attackers, or any manner of group here and there, being in possession of some weapons.  The problem became even more compounded, even more complex, with the expansion of the war.  

I thank you for your patience and for giving me the opportunity to provide this answer.  

Thank you very much, Lawyer Sendze.  
Q.	You're welcome.

Now, you have talked about the clandestine obtention of weapons from the market.  Are you in a position to tell us whether this was also the case in relation to the training of members of the Amahindure force or the Virunga Force? 
A.	Well, I thought you were not going to revisit that Amahindure issue.  What I can say is that I personally became aware of the existence of the name Amahindure somewhere in Ruhengeri.  

Only when I got to Arusha, and when I read some exhibits and also saw some witness statements here, I have challenged that accusation.  The matter is now being deliberated upon and I have provided my own evidence in that matter.  

In my life I have not been aware of the Amahindure.  But later on I learnt that these were functionaries from Mukingo who met sometime in June in reaction to a situation that had obtained.  And that is how the Amahindure was manipulated, and manipulated over and over again.

Well, Counsel Webster had the opportunity to visit Ruhengeri on several occasions, particularly at the beginning of the Kajelijeli case.  He knows that this word did not exist.  He knows how the word came into existence and how it evolved to involve persons to be arrested and charged.  

So this is what we need to know about the general context of this idea of Amahindure.  I did not know about the Amahindure in June.  I never knew about the Amahindure.  
Q.	Okay.  I follow up.  I appreciate your lack of knowledge of what the Amahindure was.  But you would not venture to testify before this Trial Chamber that you can say with certainty that this group did not exist, can you? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that I was accused of creating or setting up the Amahindure group.  So I was forced to -- 
Q.	I'm sorry.  You are not on trial.  You're not being trialled (sic).  So don't worry about the accusations that were made against you in your trial.  I'm sure you have adequately defended yourself.  I'm just asking you in spite of the fact that you don't -- you're not aware of the Amahindure.  I'm not accusing you for creating the group.  You would agree with me that you cannot say with any degree of certainty that this group did exist.  If you think the Amahindure did not exist, say so to the Trial Chamber.  But if you cannot say it did not exist, say so as well.  That's all I'm asking.  
A.	The question is very specific and I will attempt to provide a specific answer.  

When I was commander of the Ruhengeri operational sector, I can say clearly that -- unless Amahindure was a clandestine organisation, I can say with certainty that I did not know Amahindure in Ruhengeri up until the 18th of April 1994 when I left Ruhengeri.

But when I got to Arusha in 2002, at that time I learned about Amahindure and a number of other issues, which I'm not going to delve into because you've asked me not to.  

So I learnt of this information, unavoidable information, pointing to the existence of the Amahindure in June 1994 or thereabouts.  There was, for example, a press release from a journalist on the 
10th of June from Ruhengeri stating that a group of people had been found in an organisation known as Amahindure.  Well, in my case, I had opportunity to look at Karorero's testimony.

Well, thank you very much.  I hope you have -- I hope that you're satisfied with my answer.  If you're satisfied with my answer, I thank you.  Well, if you are not satisfied, please put the question again and I will try to satisfy you, Counsel 
Q.	Okay.  You -- you were not aware of this group when you were in Ruhengeri and you later on got information that the group existed.  

Now, there's some evidence in this case that some of the youths in Mukingo were trained in 
Mukamira camp pursuant to the civil defence programme.  Were you aware of such training?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	No, that did not take place.  It didn't take place.  It's just a matter of being aware.  It did not take place.  You are talking about youth, youth training in Mukamira camp.  No. 
Q.	Thank you.  Okay.  Let's move on.  And, please, General, please, you have made a commitment to myself and to the Chamber.  Let's keep the answers short, so we can all be out of here soon enough.

Let's discuss the Interahamwe.  And we are focussing on Ruhengeri, Ruhengeri alone.  We are not talking about Kigali.

Now, when you were asked in direct examination whether this group of youths called the Interahamwe existed in Ruhengeri, in the long answer that you gave my understanding was that you said that you were not aware of this group.  Am I correct to say so?  
A.	That is correct.  In the lengthy answer provided I said that. 
Q.	Okay.  It is not necessary to give another lengthy answer to explain the other one.  

So in your opinion what political party was the majority party in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Are you going to ask me to answer by yes or no again?  
Q.	Do you know the political party that was the majority party in Ruhengeri?  If you do, say yes, and then tell us the party.  If you don't, say no, and I'll move on.  
A.	I cannot only say no, because I do not want to put my credibility on the line by simply saying no.  There was a budding multiparty politics in place.  Those who created political parties were moving away from the formal MRND to the new parties which were growing.  

So if I were to give you an answer, it must be within a time frame.  If you were to look at the period of the beginning of the multiparty advent, you may ask which party was dominant.  But when the 
MDR party takes root and attracts an increasing number of members, when the CDR comes into existence, then we can see that it is true that the MRND remains a strong party.  But as time goes by the other parties also begin to grow.  

So I am not aware of any head count of the membership of the political parties.  I do not know the membership of various political parties.  And if I were to give a vague answer based simply on speculation, then I would simply say that the MRND, up to a certain time, had a greater number of members.  But that is not empirical.  It is not scientific and I might end up providing -- okay.  
Q.	General Bizimungu, you were not involved in politics, were you? 
A.	I am not involved with politics.  But you know, I mean I'm sure you understand certain things that happen in your country, although you're here in Arusha cross-examining a poor general. 
Q.	Now, when you testified on Monday about the Interahamwe, you were very clear that you did not concern yourself with what the political parties called themselves or their youth wing; did I hear you correctly? 
A.	Yes, that was the least of my worries. 
Q.	So what bothers me therefore -- first of all, let me ask you this:  When you say you are not aware of the youth organisation called the Interahamwe, do you mean to the best of your knowledge you did not know if they existed or are you trying to convince the Trial Chamber that as a matter of fact this group never existed?  Which one? 
A.	Regrettably, I am poorly placed.  I'm in a bad position which is going to refer to my trial.  

While I was in Ruhengeri I said that the activities of political parties were of no concern to me.  They weren't at all.  But having been inducted before the ICTR and charged with being the founder of the Interahamwe in Mukingo -- so I searched for information to be better informed about what it was.

Now, when you asked me -- when you ask me -- Counsel, Counsel, give me a minute, please.

I -- had you put that question to me in 1994, I would have answered you that the Interahamwe issue, political parties, was of no concern to me.  But now when you ask me this question after five years of trial where I was meddled with this issue I know nothing about and because of which I've had to conduct research, then I answer this is what I now know. 
Q.	General, what is it that you now know?  Is it that the Interahamwe never existed as a matter of fact?  You can say yes.  We will accept your answer.  I'm not trying to put you into a difficult position.  I just want to know what your testimony is.  It never existed as a matter of fact or you're simply saying to the best of your knowledge you weren't aware of it, which is fair. 
A.	Let me answer you, but you have to give me some time.

On the 15th of November 1992, I was in Ruhengeri.  There was a meeting -- there was a rally, rather, of the MRND party.  Many people had come from Kigali and from many other areas in Ruhengeri.  And I was not attending that meeting, contrary to what has been said in other testimonies.  

I was in Ruhengeri while I was in my sector.  And although I was fully alert as to the arrival of all these people, an officer from the Presidential Guard told me that the president would come to the -- would attend the rally.  But I was not in the meeting but I was on the alert.  

I was aware that the president would come.  I was aware that there were lots of people and there was a spectacular attendance of Interahamwe from Kigali and that is when speeches were made.  Indeed, that is the first time that I saw the Interahamwe, the MRND Interahamwe, because I believe that 
was -- that rally had been organised by their political parties -- party.  Speeches were made. 
Q.	Please, please, please.  Let's -- let's forget about that question.
MR. SENDZE:
Would the registrar please put before the witness P. 370.  Three-seven-zero.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	General Bizimungu, you do know who Dr. Bizimungu is? 
A.	Are you talking about Dr. Bizimungu, Casimir?  Yes, I know him very well. 
Q.	It's a matter of record that he was the president of the MRND party in Ruhengeri.  And I'm going to show you a letter that he wrote in 1992.

Now, since you testified that you were not very concerned about the appearance of political parties, you would agree that it is not the same position with a man like Dr. Casimir Bizimungu, who was a president of the MRND in Ruhengeri, correct?  He would have been concerned with what was going on within his own political party. 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Now, if you look at the letter that I have put before you, at the bottom of the letter do you see that he has copied the letter to the Interahamwe of all the communes of Ruhengeri? 
A.	Answering based on this document, yes. 
Q.	Do you think Dr. Bizimungu would reasonably send a letter to a group of people who did not exist? 
A.	Well, that is an administrative problem, and let me explain.  Let me explain.  

In this letter here, does Casimir Bizimungu -- do you see a copy which may have, for example, been sent to the president of the Interahamwe in the Ruhengeri préfecture?  Because, yes, he has copied Interahamwe presidents in all communes.  Okay.  

The copy that you have here -- I don't know where you copied from Nyakinama.  The copy that I have is the copy that was sent to the Nyakinama bourgmestre.  In the same place where you took this document from, why is it not stated:  President of Interahamwe of the Nyakinama commune?  

It is possible that an organisation that is being set up would -- set up a body, even if that body has not yet been set up, that they should use stereotyped letters and have bodies which are about to be set up but which have not yet set up.  And when you tick the letter where the letter has to go, then you put Nyakinama.  And if that body is not -- is not yet functional, then you put nothing.  

So it is difficult for me to understand, Counsel Sendze, because it is hard for me to understand because I was dragged into this Interahamwe matter, and it forced me -- 
Q.	Please, I have pleaded with you not to take this to relate to your case.  It has nothing to do with your case.  I simply put a letter to you and the author is copying certain individuals.  I'm sure you as a reasonable man would not copy letters to people who do not exist.  Would you do that?  Just say yes or no, and then we'll move on.  
A.	Having worked in the administration, at times the Rwandan army -- in the Rwandan army we would envisage the setting up, for example, the Huye battalion, for example.  But at the time, so long as the Huye battalion had not yet been set up and when there were no staff in it yet, every time in letters we would put something on the Huye battalion, but the letter would not be sent there.  But it would always be included in the following.  So what was the practice in the army could also have been a practice elsewhere.  

But that all said and done, I believe that Casimir is better placed to talk about this than I am. 
Q.	Thank you for your answer.

Let's discuss the attacks at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri on the 14th of April 1994.  You testified 
in chief that you were aware that Tutsi refugees had been brought to the court of appeal and the 
court of appeal was guarded by gendarmes.  
A.	Exact. 
Q.	You also testified that the court of appeal was eventually attacked on the 14th of April.  

Now I want to ask you if you have any information as to who attacked the court of appeal on the 14th and killed the Tutsi refugees. 
A.	Yes, in the evening I was informed.  The group commander told us it was a group from Mukingo, and as a matter of fact some had been arrested and that they were at the brigade.  That was it. 
Q.	A group consisting of who?  Or what kind of people? 
A.	Assailants from all walks of life.  Ultimately I would know, a posteriori, that these were youth deserters, youth from Mukingo, who indeed had carried out -- done things in Busogo.  

In any case, I would learn about it a posteriori.  Remember that I was appointed army chief of staff on the 16th and I went to Kigali.  But before leaving Ruhengeri, I was aware that they were assailants coming from Mukingo who had attacked the court of appeal in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Were you informed that the gendarmes that were protecting the court of appeal were armed? 
A.	Of course.  You would imagine it would be -- that in this type of mission and considering the area where we were, those people would be armed. 
Q.	And if those gendarmes, armed as they were, were faced with an attack from a group of assailants from Mukingo, youths from Mukingo, is it conceivable to you that these youths would have been able to breach the perimeter of the gendarmes and be able to kill as many Tutsis as they did without the gendarmes conceding to this attack? 
A.	It's not a matter of conceding, Counsel.  When we finished the examination-in-chief, we finished with the matter of the Mille Collines.  Munyakazi, who had become a member of the RPF and who was at the Mille Collines with a UNAMIR colonel where there was an armoured car -- to be frank, unfortunately, I need to emphasise, with a lot of pain, I already saw assailants at the 
	Hôtel Mille Collines.  It's a similar case.  It is a regrettable thing.  It is not something that one can justify.  I know this.  I cannot justify this, but that is what the situation was indeed.  And that is -- that's it.  
Q.	Did you have information that the assailants were carrying weapons?  Did the gendarmerie officer tell you that? 
A.	Yes, he did, especially as my S3, Marcel, went there.  It was total shock.  And I believe there is an expatriate from Austria known as Schuman, who had a project and with whom we were in touch came to see me.  You know, to be candid, information that these assailants were armed reached me. 
Q.	How many gendarmes were killed at the court of appeal by these armed assailants? 
A.	The group commander talked about two commanders, mentioned two commanders -- two gendarmes to me. 
Q.	And how many of the assailants were killed? 
A.	None.  He didn't give me any figure about the assailants who may have been killed. 
Q.	So apparently the gendarmes saw the assailants, did not fire a shot and took off, abandoning the refugees they were supposed to be protecting at the court of appeal? 
A.	Now, under examination-in-chief I've always expressed my regret and when you talk about this case with respect to that of the Mille Collines where you have the UNAMIR officers and a colonel of the RPF who'd become a colonel, I say this with a lot of regret, this situation, unfortunately.  

That is why in order to nip this sort of situation in the bud, we needed some form of truth -- of calm for authority to be exerted in full.  People, after the death of the president of the republic, after what -- it was total shock and desolation and it was difficult to get hold of things -- a hold on things. 
Q.	Okay.  A few clarifications on this before we adjourn for the day.

Did you by any chance meet any of the assailants in Mukingo on the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	In Mukingo?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	No.  On the 15th of April I was not in Mukingo, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you meet any of the assailants in Ruhengeri on the 15th of April? 
A.	On the 14th of April, after that unmentionable event, I stated with -- how with total disapproval I talked to the S3 and group commander.  I stated that this was an unacceptable and intolerable situation to have arrived.  

The first thing was to take measures so that the areas that are vulnerable where there are Tutsis -- yes, yes, I'm going to answer your questions.  

Now, we circled the city.  And on the 15th at a point of time I went to Nyakinama to see the administrative director and to see if there were no problems there.  And while I was there, there was a little truck full of people which arrived.  And my bodyguards told me that those are the same assailants.  And I said:  "If those are the same assailants, be ready to open fire on them."  

I moved towards their pickup truck and asked them where they were going to.  They were in no position to answer me and I told them:  "Listen.  You have the volcanoes.  And in the volcanoes you have the RPF.  If you want to fight, go and fight the RPF, which is found on the volcanoes.  Stop attacking the population."  

And I have already given instruction to the fact that whosoever would dare to come and attack someone would be shut down immediately.  I no longer remember to whom I spoke, but it was to the group that was found in the pickup truck and that group left.
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, it is 3:30 by my watch and I'll be moving on to something else.  So I think it's a good time to take the adjournment.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we'll take our -- 
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  I have a little request.  I apologise, Your Honour.

During lunch break I was informed by the person in charge of security that my lead counsel had some constraints which would cause him to leave this evening.  So I'd like to --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Your lead counsel should be able to speak for himself. 
THE WITNESS:
My lead counsel.  The issue is that I heard that piece of information and it is -- it is the contrary, rather.  I'm the one who is talking on behalf of my counsel.  I'm sorry, Mr. President. 
MR. ST-LAURENT:
I go back tomorrow night.  But I'm quite sure this is not a request my client wants to make to you.  I'm quite sure he wants to help me meeting with him.  Still I leave tomorrow.  This is, I guess, what he wants to ask you, the authorisation for him and me to meet together. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Witness.

If I interrupted you before you got to your point, you may make it now.  
THE WITNESS:
The motion was that we would want to just meet.  Any piece of information is -- I got -- is that he is going to leave this evening and I would have loved to meet him before he leaves, because I don't know when my testimony is going to end.  And as I'm forbidden to speak with someone before finishing my testimony, I therefore pray you to grant me the authorisation to meet him before he leaves, be it today or tomorrow.  It would -- depending on his availability and the directions of the Chamber.

Thank you, Mr. President 
MR. SENDZE:
If I'm not mistaken, I believe the information I'm aware of is that counsel will be travelling tomorrow evening.  Is that correct?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
That's what he said.  
MR. SENDZE: 
Okay.  Not today.  
BY MR. SENDZE:
Q.	So now, General, I would not want you to meet with your counsel while you are on the stand.  But I can commit that if we work together we will finish your cross-examination in time for you to be able to meet counsel before he departs.  So you would have to contribute in this process and be brief, as I have always requested, so that we'd get enough time to meet your counsel after you testify.  
A.	What do you mean, Counsel?  That I should answer the way I just did this afternoon?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  I don't think it is necessary to continue this discussion.  I think everybody's got the point.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.

I would like to be dealing with the Kajelijeli exhibits after a brief recess this afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, how long do you envisage your presentation will be?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think between 15 and 30 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, how long would you be?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Robinson is the one objecting, so 30 minutes should be fair.  I think realistically 30 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
So you need an hour session?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, no, no.  My assumption was 30 minutes altogether as we go item by item. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is also what I meant, 30 minutes in total for the hearing.  

So perhaps we could do it tomorrow afternoon when this testimony is completed before the 
end of -- before 3 o'clock or 2:30 we could pick it up tomorrow afternoon. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We don't mind working.  The problem is that I am really clinched for time.  And I -- we have two other commitments that have been made for the afternoon. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
I think we could do it tomorrow afternoon after this witness has finished. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we can fix it for tomorrow afternoon.

Mr. Sendze, how long do you think you're going to be tomorrow?  Are you going to finish early enough to start another witness or do you think it's not going to be likely?  
MR. SENDZE:
That's -- finishing very early is the plan.  I had actually hoped by the mid-morning break tomorrow, I would be done. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
MR. SENDZE:
I want -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You don't have to explain more than that. 
MR. SENDZE:
All right. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, in that instance you may wish to start another witness and we will commence to hear the application tomorrow afternoon. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well, we'll do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  We'll take our adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1533H)
