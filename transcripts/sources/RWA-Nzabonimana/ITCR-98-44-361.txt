P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 23rd of June 2009, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Once again, good morning to the Court, to the parties, the registry.  The Prosecution is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Saidou N'dow, Arif Virani.  We have a new member of our team, which the Court can welcome today.  He is Eric Husketh from the United States.  And also with us is Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh, Takeh Sendze and our investigator, Bagel Upendra. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  And welcome to your new team member.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to all parties 
present in the courtroom and to all present here.  I am Papa Moussa Félix Sow, co-counsel for Édouard Karemera.  I am assisted by Fatou Ndour -- Ms. Fatou Ndour, our legal assistant, and 
Mr. Bernard Munyaziza, our investigator.  Thank you. 
MR. WEYL: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I rise on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  My name is Frédéric Weyl, co-counsel, and I am assisted by Marina Yetongnon, our legal assistant, and Jean-Paul Simbizi, our investigator. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, good morning.  I also rise on behalf of Joseph Nzirorera, representing him.  My name is Patrick Nimy Mayidika Ngimbi.  And we are assisted today by Léopold Nsengiyumva, our usual legal assistant.  And I am also pleased to introduce to you two new interns on our team,  
Ms. Amy Paden from the United States of America and Ms. Nicole Rangel, also from the 
United States of America.  Needless to introduce Lucas Rasmussen, who has already been introduced to the Chamber.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy, and we welcome the interns to the Tribunal.  

On the 30th of March 2009, the Chamber granted a Prosecution motion to severe Mathieu Ngirumpatse from this case.  On the 19th of June 2009, the Appeals Chamber reversed the Chamber's 
decision to severe Ngirumpatse and remanded the matter to the Chamber for further consideration.

The Appeals Chamber found that the Trial Chamber reached its conclusions on the prejudice which could be caused to the co-Accused, Édouard Karemera and Joseph Nzirorera, as a result of further delays occasioned by Mr. Ngirumpatse's illness, without having assessed all relevant factors.  In particular, the Appeals Chamber found that the Chamber should not have made its decision on severance by relying exclusively on the medical assessment that was provisional, lacking in detail, and disputed by the parties, and in circumstances where it had no specific information concerning the nature of Mr. Ngirumpatse's medical problem.  

The Chamber also notes that there have been a number of material developments since its decision on continuation of trial, including changes in Mr. Ngirumpatse's medical condition and a decision by the President varying his condition of detention.  

Due to the importance of the issues raised by the Appeal Chamber's decision and the developments that have arisen since the Chamber's decision on continuation of trial, the Chamber considers that the parties and the registrar should be heard on this matter.  In particular, the Chamber wishes to hear the parties on the following issues:  

One, Mathieu Ngirumpatse's consent for the proceedings to continue in his absence pending the resolution of the decision on remand; 

Two, the disclosure of information concerning the nature of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's medical problem; 
Three, the need for and modalities of soliciting an alternative medical assessment of 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse's medical condition and prognosis; 

Four, other issues raised by subsequent developments since the Chamber's decision on 
continuation of trial or by the Appeals Chamber's decision on appeal concerning the severance of Mathieu Ngirumpatse;  

Would today -- would this morning be an appropriate time to hear the parties on these issues?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I see no reason why we can't deal with it orally today, Your Honour.  I note that Peter Robinson has already filed something in writing, and I think the questions that the Court raises are straightforward enough for us to deal with it right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I would have thought so myself.  Does the Defence have anything to say on this?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, am I authorised to speak now?  Do I have the floor?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl, you do, and you are.
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President, but I was somewhat surprised to see Mr. Webster rise first on an issue which ordinarily would have been reacted to initially by Mathieu Ngirumpatse's Defence team, because I believe the first question to the parties relates to what would be the starting point of our discussions.  But before delving into these matters and providing some explicit answers to questions raised by 
the -- to the four questions raised by the Chamber, I would like to make some general comments.  

One thing I believe is certain: Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not well.  And that is not a question for debate.  For some time, we wondered whether he would get treatment.  Fortunately, things have changed and Mathieu Ngirumpatse is now receiving treatment which appears to be appropriate treatment and we no longer have to fight for treatment for him.  This is an achievement and I believe that we no longer need to revisit that issue.  

There's a third point of certainty, namely that from the month of August, Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not only dealing with his illness but he has to deal with the situation whereby in spite of his ill-health, there's a desire to move forward with a joint trial at all cost, and where, if he does not waive his rights, he will simply be shoved aside.  

From the month of August, Mathieu Ngirumpatse has been under serious constraint and under extreme pressure.  But things have only changed since yesterday when at 1:30, we brought to his attention a decision of the Appeals Chamber which terminates the situation where he was bound either to waive his right or simply to be shoved aside while waiting for another possible trial.  

Therefore, Mr. President, I do not believe that we need to err further by seeking at all costs to proceed with the trial, by placing Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse in a constraining and strenuous situation which does not allow him enough room to recover physically and mentally to be able to again fully be part and parcel of the organisation of his defence.  

But there's a fourth point, Mr. President, namely that from October until May, we tried to be heard but it seemed that we were not being listened to, when we said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse would more likely have regained his physical and mental health if he were in a different context.  We had to wait until May for the President of this Tribunal to come to a decision on the need for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be detained in humane and dignified detention facilities without having to deal with a 24-hour guard in his hospital room and with some measure of privacy and respect for his human rights.  It is therefore a good thing that finally Mathieu Ngirumpatse is able to now rest and has an opportunity to reconstruct while enjoying humane conditions of detention.

Well, this is not a matter that can be ascribed to Mathieu Ngirumpatse because he has continually brought to the attention of the Trial Chamber what his situation has been in the hospital room which he occupied.  

Now, Mr. President, we are somehow worried about one aspect.  We understand the urgency with which the Trial Chamber wants to address procedural issues, particularly in respect of the difficulty that arose on the 9th of February because on the 6th of February, before hearing resumed, Mr. Ngirumpatse was informed while in hospital that all his applications to the Court had been dismissed.  

Now what bothers us is the scheduling which calls for such urgent solutions in response to questions from the Chamber.  Two-and-a- half months following the Appeals Chamber's decision quashing the provisional release of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, we are still faced with a Trial Chamber which remains silent to the extent that no answer has been given to date to a very crucial question which is directly linked to the unfolding of these proceedings under appropriate conditions.  Two-and-a- half months after the decision of the Appeals Chamber, in respect of a decision in November, we are not in a position to have a clear answer on an essential, on a critical, on a humanitarian question.  

The Appeals Chamber called on the Trial Chamber to reconsider issues of provisional release on humanitarian grounds as requested by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And he indicated that this would enable him to be part of the trial in better conditions, given that he would have regained his strength.  That is why, Mr. President, we apply to the Trial Chamber to organise its scheduling bearing in mind clearly the urgency that comes with this session but more generally speaking within the context of an understanding of the order in which decisions should be taken.  

Two-and-a-half months ago there was an Appeals Chamber decision calling on the Trial Chamber to reconsider, and we believe that the Trial Chamber should do so.  

Today there are issues arising from the Appeals Chamber's decision, and I believe that most naturally the decision places us exactly in the same situation in which we were on the 2nd of March.  On the 
3rd of March, you dismissed a request for suspension and ordered proceedings to continue in the absence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That decision was quashed by the Appeals Chamber on the 
19th of June, and so we go back to the decision post-3 March.  And, therefore, it is for you to determine whether there are enough reasons for the Trial to be suspended as requested by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I don't think the question even arises because, Mr. President, you have already addressed that issue several times.  Over and over.  We do not need to wonder about neglecting Mathieu Ngirumpatse's inability to be in this Trial Chamber.  So, once again, the Trial Chamber is faced with the only option of suspending, because we have no other alternative if we look at severance that is an issue that may also be raised.  But it would require a serene consideration of the prevailing circumstances which I have just described.  

It is therefore for the Trial Chamber to determine, as requested by Mathieu Ngirumpatse through yours truly, to reconsider alternative solutions.  And we believe that the only reasonable solution is, one for a reasonable suspension bearing in mind the fact that he is sick.  He is receiving treatment.  He is affected by his treatment; he is affected by his illness.  And these things, doctors have said, will, in principle, go on until the end of the month of October.  This is the position of the doctors.  Therefore, I believe that the June-July session to my mind is impossible to hold if we leave time to take its course and grant Mathieu Ngirumpatse the opportunity to rebuild his energy and to regain all lost time.  That would lead us only to the pragmatic solution that our session should resume in October when he would have received full treatment and would have been strong enough.  

Now, Mr. President, that would also be an option.  And the other consideration would be to rule on the request for provisional release which is before you.  I believe, Mr. President, that he will clearly be in a position to appear before you but we have to deal with this health issue.  

Common sense therefore leads us to propose, Mr. President, that we adjourn until the month of October when his treatment would have been over and then we can resume sitting three to four half days per week thereafter, in which case Mathieu Ngirumpatse will be able to attend the proceedings as much as possible or we could involve him as significantly as possible in the proceedings even if he is outside of the courtroom by enabling him to follow as closely as possible the proceedings as they unfold in this Court. 

Therefore, Mr. President, we propose that we resume in October.  But that was our suggestion in February and I do not want to recall once again what the situation was in February and why we are facing more or less the same situation today.  To our mind this would appear to be the reasonable solution.  It is a practical and pragmatic solution which is underpinned by Mathieu Ngirumpatse's good faith which has been demonstrated throughout these proceedings, although unfortunately he has been somewhat alone in this effort.  There have been problems in communications, there have been problems in the delivery of DVDs and we have tried to reach him because he is surrounded by guards 24 hours in his hospital room, and therefore unable to rest properly.  

Therefore, Mr. President, this practical solution does not offend any interest, and makes it necessary for us to proceed without engaging in procedural matters or a quarrel among experts or looking at issues that may lead to questioning Mathieu Ngirumpatse's good faith, whereas it is certain that he is acting in all good faith.  

Our proposal, therefore, addresses the concerns that we believe have been raised by the 
Trial Chamber seeking a healthy and serene administration of justice which is not simply seeking to expedite without being mindful of all these considerations.  

Therefore, I would say that in answer to your four questions, it is true that we got the email after we had met Mathieu Ngirumpatse and we were not able to put the four questions directly to him.  However, I don't think that we need to adjourn so that I go seek questions from -- answers from him, but I will give you the four answers that we have for the Court.  

The first answer is that under the circumstances, he does not grant his consent for proceedings to continue in his absence.  That I believe is clear enough.  I couldn't be any clearer than that.  It is a position in principle which we may review in October when Mathieu Ngirumpatse might be in a position to grant consent for proceedings to continue in his absence at a certain agreed rhythm with all attendant solutions in place to enable him to be effective even if he were unwell and unable to effectively follow the proceedings to the extent that there would be nothing prejudicial to him being absent from Court.  

Mathieu Ngirumpatse has the right to be present at his own trial.  If there's no prejudice against him when he is absent from court, he may review this position, but again we go back to the problem of his ability to follow proceedings, the issues of communications and the issue of witnesses.  And, therefore, the Prosecutor has an advantage of dealing with witnesses against Ngirumpatse in his absence.  And again I can only refer to what we experienced here some three weeks ago when Mathieu Ngirumpatse would have agreed that witnesses be heard in his absence when they don't have a direct bearing on him.  But again you see in his absence the Prosecutor could attempt to produce documents that directly targeted Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  And I am referring to the testimony of Mr. Karemera.  And that is unacceptable.  It is therefore unacceptable as well for the Prosecutor to try to avail himself of the testimony of Karemera's wife - rather, to the opportunity of Karemera's wife's testimony to impute matters against Ngirumpatse.  And that is disloyal, Mr. President, if I may say.  

And under those circumstances therefore, Mr. President, Mr. Ngirumpatse would not waive his rights, except in cases where there are witnesses who appear and do not have any direct bearing or who are not likely to have a prejudicial effect directly on Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Under those circumstances therefore things can proceed, but we need to share responsibility.  And this matter does not only depend on Mathieu Ngirumpatse, but it has to do with the Prosecutor as well who would then need to know how they deal with Prosecutors, and we are with -- with witnesses, rather.  And we saw this some 
three-and-a-half weeks ago.  

Now, relating to his medical situation, we shall not vary anything on the basis of our principle.  We do not think that it is proper for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be brought to this courtroom for his private health issues to be discussed in public.  There's no ground on which matters that concern him and his lawyers alone should be discussed here.  We shall not waver on this point because we have said it consistently since October.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse has no secret from the Chamber and from the registry to some extent, because this might also have a bearing on the consideration of his release, on his place of detention, and on the possible treatment that he may obtain in another country.  So we have no -- we are not keeping any secrets away from the Bench -- from the Trial Chamber.  We have done all the 
ex parte disclosures and the Trial Chamber does recall how we struggled to have disclosure of the medical file.  And this is not something that has been inclusive because there are always difficulties in obtaining medical records.  We get them late and sometimes unfortunately we don't have the assistance of the Trial Chamber in dealing with these matters.  So documents come in late.  Some are said to have been disclosed but those which had been disclosed two months before are not available to us.  So this is a difficulty, Mr. President.  

The Trial Chamber knows that we are not keeping anything away from the Trial Chamber.  But as far as the parties are concerned, we have and we continue to insist that the disclosures should be between doctors -- from doctor to doctor, and therefore each party should have access to a doctor that provides the legal and medical information that is acceptably disclosed and which therefore can be used in the adversarial procedures before this Trial Chamber.  It is, therefore, only the doctors who are authorised to appear before this Court to testify on such matters, on the condition that the medical doctor in possession of any information should guarantee the medical secrecy.  And this is a position on which we are very clear and I believe that the Trial Chamber does understand our stance.  

Third point:  Do we need an alternate or another medical opinion?  I have a two-prong answer to that question.  First, another medical opinion can only obtain when you first and foremost have a medical opinion in place.  I have just been talking about the humanitarian aspect of this case.  And if the 
Trial Chamber believes that this is not sufficient, then I believe that the Trial Chamber should 
start by first seeking a medical opinion before looking for another medical opinion.  And such a medical -- another medical opinion or doctor's opinion would only matter if there's an initial doctor's opinion.  And that is why we don't want Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be placed in the witness box and 
X-rayed.  Therefore, I do not believe that it is necessary for doctors from all parties to be called before this Trial Chamber to expose Mr. Ngirumpatse in such a manner.  That is why we believe that the best option would be to call in a neutral doctor, but at the same time allow Mathieu Ngirumpatse the right to have a debate on these issues and grant him the right to freely choose an expert in these matters, to be paid for by the registry.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, to answer the question as to what conclusions are to be drawn, that for a year virtually, Mathieu Ngirumpatse is cut off from his case.  It has been very difficult for him to make the intellectual effort to go through his case -- the transcripts.  He is far from here.  It is necessary for him to catch up to get back on board.  But for the past ten months his counsels have also invested some efforts in an exercise which goes beyond the duties of a counsel.  For ten months we have had too much to do which was not strictly within the limits of the duties of counsel for Ngirumpatse.  From that standpoint we require the assistance of the Court for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be able to catch up on his case when he will have -- when he has all the capacity to do so.  

I have said this, that since August we have been concerned on a daily basis to get him the cadre he deserves.  We have been concerned and the Chamber has criticised us on that as to account -- make account to the Chamber on the security that he requires.  We deployed efforts to ensure that materials are communicated.  We made effort in -- we attempted to get him provisional release.  We tried to resist the constraints imposed on him.  We deployed a lot of energy into areas which, strictly speaking, are not part of the defence of Ngirumpatse.  

We need the time necessary to get back on board, and by putting Mathieu back in a driving seat to drive and to take care of his case in this regard we need the assistance of the Court.  And this relates to a case -- into this particular case, we need the assistance of the Court so that Mathieu Ngirumpatse can very quickly, and that to the extent that his situation would allow him to be back into the case together with his co-Accused in a defence that has always been joined, bound together and which should not be set -- be divided.  And this has to be in the presence -- whether this be in the presence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse or a Defence team that can play its full role even if Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not physically among us.

I am requesting the Chamber to take this into account and to take care of the questions that are being put before you.  And we believe that these issues will be looked at from a humanitarian standpoint and not strictly from -- not only from the standpoint of the judicial calendar. 
 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  

Mr. Sow.
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to make some comments following the Chamber -- the 
Appeal Chamber's decision rendered on 19th June 2009, and following the four questions that the Chamber has put before the parties.

Regarding the first question, it is obvious that following the decision of the Appeals Chamber, it is difficult if not impossible for us to hold this session.  But as you have stated, Mr. President, this session should enable us to look at how things should unfold.  So I am of the opinion, indeed, the 
Édouard Karemera team is of the opinion that this session cannot hold on account of the fact that the Appeals Chamber has reversed the decision that you took.  And we respect the principle for a fair trial which requires that the Accused be present.  

Secondly, on the disclosure of the state of health of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, my colleague, Mr. Weyl, is of the opinion that we should protect the medical -- we should ensure the medical secrecy of the Accused.  In light of the decision of the Appeals Chamber, we should try to find the best solution which will enable us to move forward on this issue because, as you do know, in the decision that was rendered in its paragraph 19, the Appeals Chamber criticised the Chamber for taking a decision without 
seeking various professional opinion on the issue and that in paragraph 22, in fine, that it was 
stated that we could not move ahead on the issue without a prior evaluation of the state of health of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Mr. Weyl said a while ago that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's treatment should be ending in October 2009.  If that be the case, in my opinion it would be important, as we used to do in the past, to have a status report on his state of health.  

It is, however, obvious -- and that relates to the third question -- that it will be necessary to have the opinion of an expert, an independent expert, who would give his opinion outside the opinion to be given 
by the Tribunal's medical officer.  And that is going to create a problem for the parties because for that medical doctor will need to review his profile.  What kind of medical doctor shall we require to carry out a medical-legal examination which will enable us to address a certain number of issues that would be put to him?  And for that reason it is obvious that we -- as parties it would be very difficult for us to be able to come up with a profile if the issue of medical secrecy is being raised.  For that reason we cannot just go and look for any independent medical officer but a person that would be selected to have the necessary profile to be able to assess the state of health and even to determine to what extent the treatment being given is an adequate or appropriate treatment, to determine if the patient would be able to participate in his trial and in what time frame.  And if he has to participate in his trial, in what condition?  And should he not be in a situation to participate in his trial, what are the possible alternatives?

So these are questions that lead me to bring up these issues as to how far can we go when it comes to gaining access to some information to be able to contribute and make suggestions that will enable the Chamber to select this expert that is required with the required profile to be able to undertake a mission assigned to him.  And even here I am wondering if it would just be one expert or several experts, because if you go back to paragraph 19 of the decision, there are various -- there's reference to various professional opinions.  And I believe that we can only make -- bring our opinion in writing.  

Now, regarding the last question, I believe that the time for adjournment should enable us to resolve the pending motions.  Mr. Weyl made reference to a motion on provisional release of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Let me take this opportunity to remind the Chamber that Mr. Édouard Karemera, in the course of the last session, filed a motion which raised the issue of violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable 
time frame -- within a reasonable time frame.  We hope that the Chamber will be able to take a decision on these issues so that we can move ahead. 
 
Mr. President, these are some comments and suggestions that I would like to bring to the attention of the Chamber.  Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, just in relation to the -- I thought I should just take one question of your agenda because in relation to the very last point raised by Mr. Sow, the decision has been signed and it will probably be filed through in the course of today.  

Yes, Mr. Nimy, go ahead.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President. Your Honours.  I believe my task is going to be easier because first of all you have received a submission of interlocutory on this issue and that basically it conforms to what my colleagues have said a while ago.  

Indeed, it's our opinion that in light of the decision of the Appeals Chamber, it is no longer possible to proceed with this session particularly since counsel for Ngirumpatse, Mr. Weyl, has just told us that the trial cannot proceed in the absence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and that, therefore, the authority or the mandate he has to proceed with the defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse is revoked, one.  

Two, and this relates to the issue that he raised on how to ensure a better subsequent medical report, I think in Peter Robinson's submissions, he proposed to you that you appoint a qualified, competent and neutral medical officer who would be able to make determinations on issues like what should be 
done for Mathieu Ngirumpatse to be able to recover all his capacities.  And secondly, when will 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse be in a position to participate in the proceedings?  And thirdly, within what time frame or how long -- how many hours?  How many days may be allowed to Mathieu Ngirumpatse to participate in the proceedings when he recovers?  

And as soon as the report of this expert that you would have appointed obviously on the basis of his qualification and also taking into account the elements in the medical file which is available to you, then we the parties will decide if we will be able to come up with a counter-expertise.  And if that be the case, are we going to be given the opportunity, and if that is not the case, then we will accept that medical report and make our submissions on how we envisage the continuation of the proceedings in light of that report.  

And in the interim, since we consider that everything will be suspended from today, we could use that time -- and as my colleagues, Mr. Weyl and particularly Mr. Sow, said, that this time could be used to deal with pending motions and the questions -- and the issues that you have raised and to which we have given our opinion so that when we come back on a date that Your Honours will determine, the pending motions would have been dealt with.  

In summary, Mr. President, this is the position of the Nzirorera team in this case following this decision rendered by the Appeals Chamber.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, do I get equal time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Equal to him?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Equal to the three Defence teams that are cumulative.  

Well, we are in a regrettable situation but there's a way forward and I would hope that we all work together towards that end since it's in everyone's interest that the trial be accomplished expeditiously.  But with respect to the first of the Court's enquiry, clearly the ball is in Mr. Ngirumpatse's court.  He is the one who can either give his consent or withhold it.  But I do have some enquiries in relation to 
Mr. Weyl's presentation because it comes as news to me that the Court had been privy to Mr. Ngirumpatse's medical condition.  Perhaps I misheard, but my understanding of Mr. Weyl's submission is that they had never opposed disclosure of Mr. Ngirumpatse's medical files to the Court or to the registry, and if indeed that is the case then maybe what we need is a reconsideration of the Appeal's Chamber's decision, because it was premised on the assumption that the Court did not know what was ailing Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So, I don't know, it's only Mr. Weyl and the Court that can respond to that particular enquiry.  But it did strike me I was a bit odd because my understanding all along was that the Ngirumpatse Defence team insisted that no one be privy to the details of his medical file.  

Mr. Weyl also implied that we are back to square one, going back to our status conference of the 
9th February 2009, and that what is pending before the Chamber now is an application for a stay of proceedings.  But I have just checked the minutes of the proceedings for that status conference, and the application at that time from the Ngirumpatse team was for a stay of three months, not for a stay until October.  And those months have passed, as the Appeal Chamber noted in paragraph 24 of its decision.  So I don't think we are back with an application for a stay of proceedings.  Perhaps Mr. Weyl wants to make a new application but that issue has elapsed with time.  

Moving on to the next issue which is the disclosure, I would think that as set forth in the 
Appeals Chamber's decision and Rule 74 bis, this Chamber has the power to order an independent medical examination and inform itself of the Accused's medical condition.  But I do agree with 
Mr. Robinson's written submission that all parties have an interest in knowing what else 
Mr. Ngirumpatse is suffering so that we can make informed submissions about how we move forward.  

Now, that does not mean that the Chamber needs to disclose the entire contents of Mr. Ngirumpatse's medical file.  But if the Chamber orders an independent report under Rule 74 bis and receives it, then the Chamber should be in a position to decide what information needs to be disclosed to the other parties so that they can make an informed submission on how we move forward.  And that would be my application.

I do not support paragraph 5 of Mr. Robinson's written submission.  I don't think that all the parties have a right or need to get independent medical examinations if we are not pleased with the medical report that the registry would have obtained for the Court.  So clearly there's a need for updated independent medical information.  The Chamber needs to have that.  The Chamber has a right to have access to it.  But I would suggest to the Chamber that the parties need some information in order to make reasonable submissions on the issue of how we deal with going forward.  

I don't think there's much more that the Prosecution can -- excuse me one second -- can offer at this point.  It seems a practical impossibility to move forward with the session.  Clearly, waiting until October is unreasonable and unnecessary.  And I would think that if expeditious steps were taken immediately, we should be able to get all the information that we need in order to make submissions and have a decision from this Chamber by the 24th of August, which is when we would reconvene for the next scheduled session.  

I think the intervening time provides excellent opportunity for the Chamber to catch up on all outstanding motions, which would include the pending motion on remand on provisional release and the remand of the decision on severance.  But I do come back to the point where I opened the discussion, which is if the Chamber knows what's wrong with Mr. Ngirumpatse, then one way of going forward is simply informing the Appeals Chamber somehow that it was aware of Mr. Ngirumpatse's condition when it made its decision back in March of this year.  

So that's our submission.  I don't think I need the 40 or 50 minutes that we have taken so far.  But again I reiterate that there are a number of paragraphs -- pending motions that are of concern to the Prosecution.  The time that we have ahead of us need not be wasted.  I am particularly impatient for a decision on the 92 bis applications that are outstanding.  But I believe that there are a dozen motions that await a decision that we can -- they can be addressed very effectively over the next two months or the time that remains until the 24th of August when we all had intended to come back here.  

There's one or two pending matters independent of this issue -- the submissions that I would like to address the Court on.  It simply has to do with numbering of exhibits that are outstanding, which is just a matter of housekeeping but I would like to get to that today and do it all as opposed to having to submit something in writing.  So that's our submission and I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  At this point in the proceedings, there's just two remarks I think that we would like to make in relation to the enquiry made by Mr. Webster.  We had respected the requests of the Ngirumpatse team for the privacy of his medical reports.  And so we are not aware of any details of his medical condition other than that which has been disclosed to the parties.  That's one.  

We think that we have already explained the reason why the application for provisional release was not addressed as we thought it would have been appropriate to await the decision on the appeal of severance.  Now that it has come down, there will be a resolution to that application shortly.  

We had also invited the registrar to make submissions and I notice that Mr. Besnier is present.  Do you wish to contribute to the discussion of this status, Mr. Besnier?  
MR. BESNIER:
Yes, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, the registry obviously supports all solutions that will enable the proceedings to proceed quickly and fairly in a manner that favours justice on the issue raised.  It is normal that Defence asserts its right.  And as they have just done, it is normal that they protect their client and ask that -- and request that Mr. Ngirumpatse not be tried in his absence.  It is less normal for the Defence to use this to hold a Chamber -- to hold a Chamber hostage by deciding on fixing dates or deciding on what the Chamber should do in the course of the few weeks.  It is the opinion of the registry that these decisions fall within the purview of the Bench.  

It is obvious for the registry that a normal trial would depend on an exact assessment of the 
health -- state of health of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So it's on the basis of this assessment that conclusions may be drawn as to how to proceed with the trial.  Therefore we think that it is appropriate to obtain an evaluation which would be as precise and accurate as possible on the state of health of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

The registry, however, disagree with the opinion which seems to prevail on the side of the Defence that an independent expert be appointed to assess his state of health.  We think that Dr. Épee has all the necessary qualification to be able to carry out this task.  Thus far she has not formed her opinion alone.  So far all the response has been done in a collegial manner with doctors that work with the Tribunal.  She did not carry on her shoulders all by herself the evaluation of the state of health of 
Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So this is the result of several opinions.  These opinions were given.  She signed the report alone.  She summarised the report.  But this medical report is a fruit of several opinions.  We therefore suggest, Mr. President, that this issue should be dealt with quickly and efficiently.  And suggest that Dr. Épee be requested to submit a report, a detailed report before the end of this month on, one, the assessment of the state of health of Mr. Ngirumpatse, and, secondly, a projection on his health and the resumption of -- in restoration to the resumption of the trial.  We also suggest that Dr. Épee be able to have access to the opinion of any other medical officer that she might find necessary.  When I hear the Defence counsel talk about counter-expertise on the expertise of the medical doctor, I don't think we will ever get out of this.  I think so many months down the road we will still be discussing the qualification of medical experts.  

The registry think that we should not lose time on this issue.  Dr. Épee is competent and has handled Mr. Ngirumpatse's case so far with competency.  Let us leave it to her to submit a detailed report and leave her the possibility of bringing in various specialist medical officers that she might find necessary.  

Mr. President, on the issue of the disclosure of information relating to Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's state of health, here we have in the balance the supreme interest of the trial and also the rights of the accused person, his privacy and security.  The registry's opinion is akin to that of Mr. Weyl that this issue needs to be resolved by the expert.  And it falls to the Chamber and the Chamber alone to take judicial administrative decisions.  But the state of health and the nature of the condition of Mr. Ngirumpatse is not a necessary component of the discussions and its publication will not help in the manifestation of the truth.  So we think this should be communicated to the Chamber but using the expert procedure that is limited to the Judges on the Bench handling this case.  

Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the floor. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I rise again to make two comments to the Court for the record following Mr. Besnier's statement.  What I would like to say is that I cannot allow that it be put on the record in this Court that Mathieu Ngirumpatse is using his health for administrative considerations, nor that he is holding the Court hostage for these reasons.  The Tribunal knows Mathieu Ngirumpatse's position since August.  His behaviour is such as to prohibit anyone from claiming in any manner whatsoever that he held anybody whosoever hostage.  And if there's any evidence -- any substantive evidence, it is the fact that since March 2009 -- since 23 March 2009, he granted this Court the possibility to proceed in his absence with a view to facilitating expeditious administration of justice, in spite of any prejudice that may arise against him.  That has enabled the Court to continue because he gave his consent.  

If his own party had not given you that consent on the 23rd of March that proceedings should continue while awaiting the decision of the Appeals Chamber, things could have been entirely different today, because otherwise all the proceedings since the 23rd of March would have been irregular.  Therefore I cannot stand here and hear it being mentioned that Mathieu Ngirumpatse in one way or another used his health to impact procedural matters.  And I cannot stand here and accept that he held anyone whosoever hostage.  

Secondly, I believe that Mr. Besnier did not hear me fully because I told this Court that if my suggestion was not acceptable to the Court, a suggestion which is grounded in common sense and in the interest of a proper administration of justice, then the first thing that would need to be done would be to 
seek an opinion.  I did not talk about expertise or what have you.  Now, this opinion may come from 
Dr. Épee or from someone else.  But if we do not agree on that opinion, then we would need to seek other solutions.  That is what I said.  

And I would like to say two more things very briefly, Mr. President.  Let us be clear on this matter.  I do not see the contradiction between medical secrecy and lack of 
medical secrecy.  I do not understand what the issue is.  I don't understand the pseudo-contradiction here.  We have offered a very simple solution to this issue of medical secrecy; namely, that those who wish to know the situation of Mathieu Ngirumpatse should give us the name of our (sic) doctor and the information will be forwarded to that doctor, simply.  

Lastly, Mr. President, we do not question the manner in which Mathieu Ngirumpatse has been assisted in his treatment by the doctors in Nairobi since the 8th of October.  But there's a period preceding the 8th of October.  But in spite of all that, we cannot say that we are satisfied that things were handled properly even since 2003, when all the information was available for any necessary action to be taken.  If that had been done, today we would not be talking about the impact of his illness on the proceedings.  

In 2003 everything was clear but maybe somebody wasn't looking.  But you know since 2003 things were clear.  In 2007 the flags were up, the warning signs were up, but Mathieu Ngirumpatse was left unattended.  So let us not expect any satisfactory report from our side because it is out of all of these things that in August 2008 things went to the level in which we are today.  Yet from 2003, Mr. Ngirumpatse was not given the necessary medical assistance.  Thank you, Mr. President. 

MR. NIMY: 
Very briefly, Mr. President, I simply want to say that Mr. Besnier's position can lead to a situation where you will be spinning in circles and making no progress.  You see, the Appeals Chamber decision took into consideration the existence of Mrs. Épee and her very good friends from Nairobi and all those whom she consulted in the discharge of her duty.  If the Appeals Chamber came to the decision that 
in spite of all that there's need to explore further and elsewhere in order to obtain a more coherent medical report, it is clearly because the Appeals Chamber did not want us to revisit the initial starting point, which is Dr.  Épee.  That is why, with all due respect for Dr. Épee, I believe that we must take the full measure of the Appeals Chamber decision.  Otherwise it would be meaningless.  If we started with Dr. Épee and her Nairobi friends, why is it that we need to go back to them?  I think we need to take one step further and seek other opinions.  Let us not be afraid of scientific contradictions, so to speak.  And let us not only seek successful treatment for Mr. Ngirumpatse but also seek an opportunity for the Trial Chamber to see things from a brighter and clearer angle in order to be able to come to judicious decisions.  I therefore do not see what value there must be in Mr. Besnier's position because he is preaching on behalf of his own church.  And therefore I believe that we should move forward.  
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
     Mr. President, Mr. Nimy has taken the wind out of my sail and I will simply sit down, and I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Can I go on to something else, Your Honour?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would just like to say that now that this matter has been exhausted, and I think it has been, we have heard submissions from everybody, the Chamber will take some time to consider its decision, and we will let you know in due course what our ruling is on this matter.

So you can now move on to other matters that you want to address, Mr. Webster.
(Pages 1 to 17 by Judith Kapatamoyo)  





1025H
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  When we -- when we came to the end of our business during the last session, there was an issue of outstanding exhibits to be admitted, and the Chamber requested the Prosecution to make submission in writing, which we did.  But there were three exhibits that were uncontested, and I have them here in front of me.  And if I could ask that the registry assign numbers to them.  

It is the letter from Mr. Karemera to Ndindiliyimana dated the 26th of April 1994, which was not contested by the -- by the Defence; the report from the international commission of enquiry from January of 1993, which also was not contested; and then the third item was a document that Mr. Karemera himself provided to the Chamber, which we have submitted to Z-FIND and now have an appropriate number for it, a stamp for it.  So there are three separate documents, and they did not figure in any of the written submissions because they were not opposed when we were dealing with this issue several weeks ago.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Nimy?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, maybe you should tell Mr. Webster that what he is referring to is totally outdated, in view of what we have just discussed.  We are not in the course of any proceeding.  We are not -- the trial is not on.  So he has to wait for the trial to resume in the context of all, what we have discussed, before raising any issues pertaining to those documents.  We can only do so when the trial is actually going on.  We cannot do so in the absence of Mathieu.  How does he intend to do this?  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. Nimy has simply taken the wind out of my sail again, because he rose before me.  And what I really wanted to say was the same thing that has been said but go even further to state that our mandate from Mathieu Ngirumpatse was in relation to proceedings pending the Appeals Chamber decision.  That decision has been rendered, and I, therefore, no longer have any mandate to proceed.  

When Mr. Webster spoke, I was wondering whether I should continue to sit down and listen to him.  What am I doing here?  I have no mandate to proceed on his behalf.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse is not here, so let us stop talking about anything that may have a bearing on Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Secondly, Mr. President, we have a pending motion on this issue relating to the fact that any admission into evidence of materials through Karemera may be prejudicial to Ngirumpatse.  How are we going to address these matters and proceed as if all these pending issues had no bearing whatsoever?  I don't think this should be entertained in the absence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. -- Mr. Weyl, do you expect that the pending motion should be adjudicated upon?  
MR. WEYL:
No.  No, Mr. President.  But if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your submission is that a pending motion should not been adjudicated upon.  Is that what you're suggesting?
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I probably have not understood the interpretation.  What is the question of the Trial Chamber?  What is the real question of the Chamber?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was very simple.  I was asking whether your submission should be interpreted as proposing that pending motions should not be adjudicated upon. 
MR. WEYL: 
Not at all, Mr. President.  What I am suggesting is that if there are any oral arguments to be made in this Trial Chamber, those cannot be made at this time, in the absence of a mandate from Mathieu Ngirumpatse to represent him before the Court.  That is what I don't understand.  

And secondly, Mr. Webster is raising an issue about which we have already filed a motion yesterday relating to the difficulties that surround the admission of this material.  So we are telling him that this is not possible.  There was a written communication in this respect.  Why is he bringing up this matter orally; whereas, the Trial Chamber is already seized on this matter by written submissions?  

The submissions have been made.  The Prosecutor has responded in English, and we also replied indicating that -- we replied in French, our working language.  But the Tribunal would come to a decision on these written submissions.  And that is why a debate of this nature here in court is irrelevant, as far as we see it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, quite frankly, I thought I was facilitating matters.  These are -- there were six documents that we attempted to move into evidence.  Three did not face any opposition from any of the Defence teams.  But we did not give them numbers when we were here the last time around.  And then three documents were contested, and those were the three documents that were the subject of our written submissions.  

So all I'm requesting is the Chamber to give us numbers for the three documents that Ms. Dior Diagne addressed and consented to their admission when we were here three weeks ago -- or, four weeks ago.  If it's a problematic issue for the Chamber, we can do this at another time.  But to me it seems like a good opportunity to simply do some housekeeping.  So that was my application, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 

The document Mr. Weyl suggests that he filed yesterday or last night has not come to our attention as yet.  We will include this in our written decision when we come to address it.  

I think that concludes everything on our agenda.  Unless there's any other business, I think it's time for us to adjourn the proceedings.  Is there anything else that requires to be addressed this morning?  

The registrar will keep you informed as to whether we will give our decision in writing or we will resume an oral sitting to deliver it.  But we do need some time to consider the issues that shall be discussed.  So we take our adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1033H)
