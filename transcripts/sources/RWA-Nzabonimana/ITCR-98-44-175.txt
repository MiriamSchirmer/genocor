P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding; Judge Short; and Judge Kam, absent, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 29th of September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Yes, yesterday afternoon, just before we adjourned, counsel for Nzirorera made a motion for the cessation for the session until the return of Judge Kam or the appointment of a substitute Judge.  We have considered the application and are satisfied that it is without any merit.  Using the powers provided by Rule 15 bis, the remaining Judges, Judge Short and myself, have information that Judge Kam is away for a short duration, for a period that is likely to be of short duration.  We have made enquiries.  We are satisfied of that.  And we are also satisfied that it is in the interest of justice to continue sitting for the period of five days, which is provided by the Rules.  So the application is dismissed.  

Mr. Witness, your testimony is going to continue.  I remind you that you're still under the same oath to tell the truth that you took at the time your evidence began.  Your examination by counsel for Mr. Nzirorera will continue.  

Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  Before Mr. Robinson continues, can I place one thing on the record?  Yesterday the Court asked me for an update on a -- my communication with Alison Des Forges in regard to her expert report.  Unfortunately, I've not been able to contact Dr. Des Forges.  I've left two messages on her answering machine, and I've sent her an e-mail.  I'm waiting for a response to that e-mail.  I think I've communicated that information to the Trial Chamber coordinator, but as I speak now, I don't have any further information from her.  

I can file the correspondence that I've already generated with respect to Dr. Des Forges, but I was hoping to wait for a response to my most recent e-mail.  So the Court can direct me to file what I have, which is three separate e-mails that date from last week, or I can wait until I get a response to the most recent message, and then file everything at one time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we want to adjudicate in this matter, and basically I think that what would be happening -- yes, we would expect you to continue trying to contact her, but you must file what you have by the end of today because we need to make an adjudication on this matter.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, just on this matter, speaking with Mr. Webster, he informed me that he intended to make his filing ex parte, and I object to that, and I'm asking the Trial Chamber to direct that that filing be made in public.  This is a motion that's contested by the parties.  We shouldn't be having -- I think whenever a Prosecutor makes an ex parte filing, it puts the Trial Chamber in a very compromised position with respect to the fairness of the trial, especially in the perception of the Defence when there's communications between the Trial Chamber and the Prosecution.  We're very, very concerned about that, and I would ask the Trial Chamber to direct the Prosecutor to make his filing intraparties.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think it's necessary for us to say anything at this stage.  We've made our position very clear in written decision on this matter, and I think that we -- it's not necessary at this stage to take pre-emptive action.
AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	Mr. Robinson, good morning.  I greet you this morning.  
Q.	Thank you.  First we're going to look at the June 1991 constitution, which is found in tab 100 of the Prosecution exhibits.
MR. ROBINSON:
And I would ask that the witness, if it hasn't already been done, have that document placed in front of him.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness - 

MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Judge Byron, do you have your copies?  Are you ready for me to proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we're ready.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you recognise what's in front of you?  
A.	I know that it's the official journal, or the official gazette of the state, but this is the first time that I -- in public, officially that I see the documents myself.  
Q.	Does it appear to you to be the constitution of June 1991 that you spoke about earlier?  
A.	Yes, absolutely.  But this is the final document.  It was -- doesn't reflect the process which led to it, that is, its promulgation.  
Q.	I understand that.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I will offer the constitution of Rwanda, the document contained in tab number 100, as Exhibit D. NZ1.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted Exhibit D. NZ1.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ1 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you could direct your attention to article 7 of the constitution.  Can you read that paragraph for us.  
A.	I will say that when I answer questions, I forgot to say so, but I was going to answer in Kinyarwanda.  And he's interested in Kinyarwanda, as I see, so that I shall read it in Kinyarwanda.  "The political parties fulfilling the conditions will participate in the election.  They will conduct activities freely on condition that they respect the democratic principles and not to attack the security, the territory, integrity of the states."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, if I may enquire whether the interpreters have tab 100. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is exactly the enquiry I was going to launch myself.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, we do.  

MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, just one other request, if you could look at article 16 and read that to us, please.  
A.	"All citizens are equal before the law, without any discrimination, especially in terms of race, colour, origin, ethnic origin -- origin, ethnic clan, and sex, opinion, religion, or social status."  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, was it your understanding that this constitution came about through proposals made by a commission that had been appointed by President Habyarimana?  
A.	Could you kindly repeat your question, sir?  I didn't hear it properly.  
Q.	Was it your understanding that this constitution came about as a result of a commission appointed by President Habyarimana?  
A.	It was precisely the commission that was shared by Édouard Karemera, but that commission was responsible -- was charged with collecting opinions, the ideas, at grassroots level, so that they contacted the people, students, and school-going population, the various strata of the population for their opinion, to be collated and for the constitution to be drafted on that basis.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would like to have the witness be shown another document and copies be distributed.  I have the copies here.  

Mr. President, while these are being distributed, I'll advise the Chamber that I did not find an English version of this, so I don't have that available.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, what's been placed before you, does this appear to be the law that was promulgated on the 18th of June 1991?  
A.	Do you mean the law that elicited political ethics to the first political parties?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I was not able to read this document because it was only available to members of the politburo of the parties, so that I was not able to get access to this document.  But since you've given me a copy, I could probably read it now.  If not, I was not able to read it at the time, because it was only available to members of the politburos of the various political parties concerned.
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, perhaps I didn't explain myself clearly.  After the constitution was adopted in which multiparties were allowed in Rwanda, there was a law promulgated, that was published in the official gazette, that established the rules for multiple political parties.  And I'm asking you if you were aware of that law, and also I would like you to take the time necessary to look at the document I've placed in front of you and tell me if this appears to be the law that was enacted in June 1991.  
A.	As I have already tried to explain, even if you give me time to read the document, that may be useful, but I know that the politburos were broadcast over the radio.  And following the enactment of the constitution, the population was informed that the political leaders met and adopted a law on governing political parties, and that law was supposed to be published in the official gazette.  This is what was said.  

The fact that you're giving me this document, whereas I was not at the meeting of the political leaders, to be able to compare the content of the document and what was said at that meeting, this will not be a very useful exercise to me.  But, personally, if I -- I should believe what you say, this -- this was what was published in the official gazette.  I can only go along with you.  If not, I didn't participate in the meeting of the political leaders at which that law was drafted.  I can only testify about facts that I was witness to.  
Q.	Yes, I understand and I appreciate that, and I don't want you to go along with me on anything, because I can't give evidence in these proceedings.  But I thought maybe since you had been working at the MRND offices for several months, you would have come across this document.  So maybe if you could just tell me from looking at it and studying its contents, does it appear to be the law on political parties that was promulgated in June of 1991, or are you unable to say?  
A.	All that I can say, Mr. Robinson, is that I cannot make any comments on this document because the MRND office that I used to go to was not the national office.  It was the préfectoral office.  And as I said, I did not remain for a long time in that office because I was offered a job at the ministry of justice subsequently.  I, therefore, did not have access to the national office of the MRND to be able to consult the documents there.  I used to go to the regional office, and this document was not available at that level.  Because I didn't have access to this document, I cannot make any comments thereon.  I know that at that time, a document entitled "Political Ethics," or rules that governed the (unintelligible) of all political parties, was published.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that the document that I distributed, the law which is entitled "Partis politiques" be marked as Exhibit ID. NZ1, and I will attempt to have it admitted through another witness who has a better foundation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.  
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, I would like to ask Mr. Webster if he could give the document back to me that he borrowed earlier this morning, which is the next document I want to have shown to the witness, the MRND programme and manifesto.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  The document is being copied.  An assistant in my office is bringing it down.  She was just here and told me she'd be back in a few minutes with copies.  This is the same document that we had asked to make copies of yesterday, and I thought we would have had it by now.  I'm sorry.  But from what I understand -- or my understanding of how both you, yourself, Mr. -- how counsel, Nzirorera, and Karemera have articulated it, the text is the same with three of the documents that were served on the parties.  So in terms of moving ahead with the questioning, I would assume that any of those other documents would provide a basis for your next question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if we could have the registrar assist me, we'll work with copies in the meantime.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do you recognise the document that's been placed before you?  
A.	Yes, I recognise the document.  This is the document that you showed us yesterday.  Isn't it the same document whose original you showed to us yesterday?  
Q.	I believe you saw a different document yesterday.  Yesterday, at least from me, I showed you the report of the committee on synthesis that was from March 1991.  What I'm showing you now is entitled "Manifest" or programme "of the MRND."  So it's a different document, and when the original arrives, I think you can see the colours are even different.  
A.	You're quite right.  It's not the same document you showed me yesterday, but it's a document I've seen earlier.  I think that you'd given it to the registrar.  It's not the same -- isn't that the same document, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes, you're quite right.  And I believe the original has now arrived, so you can take a look at that and work from that.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I passed out also yesterday, or maybe the day before yesterday, an English translation of this document, which is also -- this translation includes the statutes of the MRND.  So there's one -- in English, you have one document, but in French/Kinyarwandan, we have two documents.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do you recognise this document?  Do you know what it is?  
A.	Yes, I know this document.  It's a document belonging to the MRND.  I do recognise the document, Counsel.  
Q.	And was this a document that was published by MRND in 1991, when it began operating as a -- one party in a multiparty system?  
A.	Yes, quite right.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, at this time, I will offer the MRND programme and manifesto as Exhibit D. NZ2, and I would offer the English translation of the programme manifesto and statutes as D. NZ2B, and with the statutes -- the French could be 2A. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm a little concerned about the documents.  The reason that I had requested the original that counsel for Karemera had is because the two documents are not the same.  Now, what I understand is that what the witness has identified is the photocopy that was recently distributed.  As I look at that photocopy, I notice that there are two pages missing at the end.  It goes from page 31 directly to page 34 in the photocopy that I've received, both the one that was filed earlier this week and the one that was just circulated a moment ago.  

And as for the English translation -- I'm just trying to confirm that the English translation is a translation of this document and not the other.  Because even though there are similarities in the text, the numbering is different, and there are actually two different documents.  So could we clarify that before this is admitted into evidence?

Just to clarify further, the document that was just circulated in photocopy, which is a bilingual text in French and Kinyarwanda, is one portion of the manifest programme (French spoken), but what we have as one document in the English translation actually includes other documents.  So it's not simply an English translation of the exhibit that was circulated.  I believe there is another document that is included in what was served on us as the English translation.  So all that needs to be sorted out.  

And my recommendation is that we proceed with the testimony of the witness, and these administrative matters could be dealt with at the end of his testimony.  So if we focus on the substance of his cross-examination, then sorting out translations and the documentation can be done at a later time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I appreciate that sometimes there might be a bonafide difference, controversy, about what is being tendered.  I'm not certain if that's the case now, and on many occasions, it's not the case.  I would not like to take up trial time discussing administrative arrangements of that nature.  So I don't know if it's possible.  In fact, when I say "I don't know," I'm actually recommending that the non-controversial issues be got out of the way by some brief consultation with counsel, and we can tender the exhibits in a swift and efficient manner.  If there are matters where there is controversy, where there's a difference of opinion, obviously that will have to be resolved by a judicial order.  But in cases where that is not required, it will be much easier if we could move forward and have an efficient and agreed tendering of the exhibits.  I think that's similar to what Mr. Webster was recommending, and I would certainly prefer that as a way of efficiently administering the trial.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't see any problem with that, Mr. President.  I think this is a non-controversial administrative issue.  So I would offer, as Exhibit D. NZ2A, the French/Kinyarwandan version -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you see, there seems to be an administrative hiccup as to what is the authentic document.  That I don't -- I doubt that that is really controversial.  Couldn't you and Mr. Webster solve those issues so that when the tendering is made, either at a break or after lunch, it's done smoothly and without objection?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, turning to the manifest and programme that's before you, if you could turn to page 14, and you'll see item number 1, which in French reads "Domaine politique."  And then underneath that there's a number 2.  Can you read for us the paragraph in number 2, please.  And this is on page 8 of the English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)  
MR. ROBINSON:
We're talking about the mani- -- the English translation that you have the document --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The manifesto?
MR. ROBINSON:
And it's on page 8.  The heading is "The Political Sphere."  
THE WITNESS:
"The movement shall recognise, as fundamental components of the Rwandan society, three ethnic groups -- the Batwa, the Bahutu, and the Batutsi.  It shall militate in order to ensure that the different ethnic groups constitute a source of complementarity and reciprocal enrichment between the citizens and for nation-building."

But when we look at paragraph 1, it says, "The movement shall reaffirm the democratic character of the republic of the Rwandan state, arising from the 1959 social revolution."  

I realise you asked me to read paragraph 2, but you didn't ask me to read paragraph 1, whereas we should read paragraph 2, taking due account of what is said in paragraph 1, because in 1959, there were many killings.  This is why I would wish that we also consider paragraph 1.  We know what happened in the revolution -- the social revolution of 1959, which was somewhat a prelude to what happened in the genocide of 1994.  Let me stop there.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I don't think you're appreciating your role here adequately, which is to answer my questions, not to debate me.  Otherwise, we're going to be spending too much time.  I know what you want to say.  In fact, I thought this was one of the documents for which you had a great appreciation, and that was one of the reasons why you enjoyed the MRND in 1991.  But nevertheless, I think we'll move a lot smoother if you follow -- if you simply answer my questions.  And if you could read paragraph 2 in its entirety, I'd be grateful.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm going to object to Mr. Robinson's statement.  The witness's answer was responsive.  He was looking at the paragraphs in context -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not necessary, Mr. Webster.  As I mentioned before, we -- we are dealing with the evidence from the witness.  It's not necessary to (inaudible).  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm trying to avoid any future repartee, Your Honour.  That's why I'm making my statement now, because it's not Mr. Robinson's responsibility to control the witness.  That's the responsibility of the Court.  So if the witness is going to be directed on how to answer the question, I'm asking that the Court assert itself in that respect and not rely on Mr. Robinson to curtail the witness's response.  I make that statement now so I don't have to repeat myself every time Mr. Robinson -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I can assure you the Court knows what its role is.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, can you please read paragraph 2.  
A.	"The movement recognises the following three ethnic groups as the fundamental components of Rwandan society:  Batwa, Bahutu, and Batutsi.  The movement campaigns to make ethnic differences a source of reciprocal complementarity and enrichment among citizens and works to advance national edification."  Let me stop there, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	Now, can you please look at page 15 and read paragraph 4.  
A.	"The movement encourages the popular masses to mobilise and be aware, to defend their interests in national development.  The movement is working to definitively cast aside the systems in which individuals exploit others.  It is waging a determined battle against all forms of discrimination, particularly those based on race, colour, origin, ethnicity, gender, opinion, religion, or social status."  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May the witness now be shown what has been previously admitted as Exhibit D. NG2, which are the statutes of the MRND in French and Kinyarwanda, and the Trial Chamber has the statutes in the same document, which I've tendered as D. NZ2B.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, directing your attention to what's been admitted into evidence as Exhibit D. NG2, and identified as the MRND statutes, can you please look at article 5, which is on page 20 of the English version.  And if you look at article 5, I'm going to ask you if it reads that "The movement shall work principally to achieve the following objectives"; and then going down to small letter C, "to achieve a union which excludes all form of discrimination."  Do you find that there in the statutes?  
A.	We were talking about this article, but before we get there, I would request that we read the preceding paragraphs.  You are reading paragraph C.  What I'm asking is that we should, first of all, read what's written under paragraph A and B before coming to C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are not a lawyer in the case.  The Prosecutor will make legal representations when necessary.  Please just answer the question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I was asking you if article 5 begins with the language, "The movement shall work principally to achieve the following objectives"; and under C, "achieve a union which excludes all forms of discrimination."  Do you find that in article 5?  
A.	Yes.  I have, indeed, seen the text.  But I wish to apologise to the presiding Judge.  I realise that he is not happy with my conduct.  I do apologise, Your Honour.  You are orienting me towards articles which is showing what good actions the movement should take, and that's all you're doing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, in a trial, you have the prosecution side, and you have the defence side.  It is the duty of the defence lawyer to put the case of his client to the best of his ability.  As a witness, it's your obligation to give evidence.  If it's necessary, the prosecutor will make legal arguments and introduce other evidence.  You do not help anybody by trying to be a lawyer and argue the case for the prosecution.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I wasn't aware of the procedure.  I sincerely apologise.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just answer the questions and trust the system to work properly.  
JUDGE SHORT:
And, Witness, let me also add that you should not try to anticipate counsel's questions.  Counsel has asked you whether you see what is written under article 5.  Either you see it, or you don't see it.  After that, he may ask you a question.  If in response to that question you think you need to refer to something else, then you may do so.  But at this stage, you're just being asked whether you can see what is in article 5.  It's either yes or no.  Okay?  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  It is, indeed, true.  I can see paragraph C under article 5, and it states the following:  "The movement shall work principally to achieve union, which excludes all forms of discrimination, to intensify efforts of movement members, to achieve the development of the Rwandan people overall, with peace, unity, dialogue, and democracy, consistent with the programme defined by the movement's manifestos."  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  Now, if we could turn to article 60 -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
And the Trial Chamber will find that on page 36 of the English.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you look on page 978 of your text, just above article 59, this is in a chapter called "Discipline," and article 60 appears to deal with disciplinary measures that can be taken by the party against its members.  And I'd like you to read that to yourself at first, and I want to ask you a question after you've done that.  
A.	I've finished it, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you.  Is it your understanding that the most that a party official could do to punish a member of the MRND who had done something wrong was to expel that member, after the disciplinary measures provided for in numbers 1 through 5 of article 60 had failed to produce the desired effect?  
A.	Truthfully, with regard to the activities of the members of the MRND, including the Interahamwe of that party, if they had followed the provisions of this article, everything would have gone well.  But what I'm saying to you is that they were not following or complying with the provisions of the various rules and regulations.  

In fact, a moment ago, the Judges were telling me that, if need be, you will refer me to other articles.  But I presume that that will be the case, especially in reference to article 1, which deals with the drafting of the statutes of the MRND.  I think that's another document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please wait until you're asked the question, and then answer it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, is it your understanding, under article 60 of the MRND statute, that the most that could be done by a national officer to punish a member of the MRND would be to expel that member from the party only after the disciplinary measures provided for in paragraphs 1 and 5 had failed to produce the desired effect?  
A.	No.  I've explained this clearly.  That was not the case.  If one had complied to the letter with the articles that we are looking at now, and given also the reprehensible acts committed by the Interahamwe, even the promoters of the Interahamwe would have been excluded if these laws had been followed, but that wasn't the case.  This means, therefore, that the various positions of these articles were not complied with.  This is what makes me say that you're always referring me to the articles which speak of the MRND positively, but I'm telling you that that was not the case in reality.  That's how the situation was, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I know you're anxious to tell us how bad the MRND was, and you'll have plenty of opportunity, I can tell you that.  But right now I'm asking you about the statute itself, a statute for which you testified you had a great appreciation when you volunteered at the MRND.  And so I'm simply asking you whether --  looking at the statute, in particular, article 60, whether it's true that the most that a MRND national official could do, in disciplining a member, would be to expel that member after the disciplinary measures provided for in numbers 1 through 5 had failed to produce the desired effect.
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, hold on.  

Mr. Robinson, that is obvious from the text.  That is what the text says.  So I'm not quite -- I don't quite understand the purpose of your question.  The text itself says that a member shall be expelled only after disciplinary measures provided for in the previous paragraphs, that is, 1 to 5, have failed to produce the desired effect.  Are you drawing his attention to it, or are you asking him to interpret this document -- this article?  I don't understand the purpose of your question.  I don't follow you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Your Honour, I'm trying to have the witness confirm that this is, indeed, the text within the MRND statutes.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Well, draw his attention to that, the last paragraph, and then you can then ask him the question that -- as a result of his attention being drawn to that paragraph.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I want to direct your attention to the last paragraph of article 60 and ask you if, indeed, it provides that a member shall be expelled only after the disciplinary measure provided for in paragraphs 1 through 5 of this article has failed to produce the desired effect.  
A.	You are speaking about expulsion as a sanction.  Expulsion can only be effected -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, have you seen (inaudible) the last paragraph?
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.  I didn't hear the question from the Judge because there was overlapping responses from the translation booth.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, counsel is drawing your attention to the last paragraph of article 60, and he has read it to you.  Have you seen it, or have you not seen it?  Can you see it?  Have you read it?  Just answer yes or no.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I've read that paragraph, Your Honour, but the question is not clear.  
JUDGE SHORT:
(Inaudible) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'd like us to now turn to article 61 and 62, under part 5, which is entitled "Integrated and Affiliate Organisations."  And are you familiar with these two articles?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the document we have is missing that page.  Page 37 is missing.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Oh, I'm sorry.  Is that the case for everyone?  It's registry page 5814.  You don't have it?  I'm sorry.  I'll make my copy available to the Trial Chamber.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters also do not have that page, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar will make a couple of copies -- photocopies. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  These articles are very short.  I think we could probably proceed by having them read in French and translated.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you could assist us by reading article 61, please.  
A.	"Integrated organisations could be formed or established within the movement for the purpose of carrying out a given programme.  Their status shall be approved by the national committee."  That was article 61.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  I just want to ask you a question about article 61 now.  And that question is, was the JMRND ever integrated into the MRND, pursuant to article 61?  
A.	I did not understand the question.  Could you kindly repeat it, sir?  
Q.	Was the JMRND an integrated organisation within the MRND, under article 61, at any time?  
A.	If you refer to the provision of the article we've just read, from the legal point of view, yes, there were laws, but the laws were not respected.  At the creation of the JMRND, it was realised that JMRND was not ready -- was not prepared to implement -- to carry out activities for the attainment of the objectives of the MRND.  This is why it is being said that integrated organisations may be established or set up within the movement for the purpose of implementing a specific programme.  And this is the reason why the Interahamwe movement was created, for the purpose of attaining a specific MRND programme.  That is my answer to your question, sir.  

	And it was thus that JMRND was going to be called Interahamwe because it was realised that the JMRND had members that were young people who were not properly equipped.  This was why on the 25th of February 1992, Mathieu Ngirumpatse declared that the JMRND was officially called or named Interahamwe.  Just before the national congress that was called, that was -- that was at that time that Mathieu Ngirumpatse introduced the plans for the creation of the Interahamwe at the congress and called upon the congress to approve that plan.  I think that was article 4 in the document.  This is the explanation I have so far as the article under consideration is concerned.  
Q.	My question was whether the JMRND was ever an integrated organisation under article 61, and I take it from your answer that your answer is no?  
A.	You are doing this purposely, Mr. Robinson.  I've just told you -- and I shall repeat what I said -- sorry, I apologise to the President.  I believe that this is going to waste a lot of time, and I'm sorry about that.  I should probably apologise before I repeat what I said, my answer, which you did not understand, was given.  I have no other choice.  I'm rather disturbed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are entitled to repeat what you said for the purpose of clarifying it, so please continue.  

Mr. Witness, you may clarify your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
Initially, I was asked to explain my answer --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  You were asked a very specific question.  The question was whether JMRND was established pursuant to article 61.  You gave an answer.  Counsel paraphrased your answer by saying it meant "no."  You said that "no" was not a fair characterisation of what you said, and you seemed to express an interest in clarifying your answer to explain it.  And I got the impression that you thought that comments that I had made earlier prevented you from doing that.  So I was trying to give you the assurance that you are entitled to clarify the answer you made so that it's clear what your answer was.  Do you understand?  So the question is, was the JMRND created pursuant to article 61?  
THE WITNESS:
Absolutely, yes, Mr. President.

1015H 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, were the statutes of the JMRND ever approved by the national committee?  
A.	Mr. Robinson, the statutes governing all of the bodies of the MRND, and this is the document before us; unless you are talking about CESTRAR or Urama, but here we are talking about the JMRND.  It is the same statutes that governed the JMRND.  I will stop here because the president has asked me not to expatiate too much or make comments. 
Q.	Were the statutes of the JMRND approved by the national committee, ever? 
A.	Do you mean the statutes before us, that these statutes have been approved by the national committee, sir?  That would mean that you do not agree with the statutes that we have before us that we have been discussing. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm speaking of the JMRND.  In Article 61 it talks about integrated organisations.  And it says that, "Integrated organisations may be established or set up within the MRND for purposes of implementing a specific programme."  And then it goes on to say that, "Their statute," meaning the statutes of the integrated organisation, "shall be approved by the national committee.  

Now, speaking of the JMRND, were their statutes ever approved by the national committee? 
A.	To back-pedal, Mr. Robinson, on account of what was happening at the time, as compared to the provisions of the various laws, I am telling you frankly there were statutes; just as we were talking about the MRND as a booth in which we were all in together, the same could be said about the statutes, with the exception of Urama and CESTRAR, that is, the central trade unions of Rwanda.  And that is reason why when they realised that the JMRND, which was established, was not implementing the various activities for the achievement of the objectives of the MRND, Mathieu decided to create the Interahamwe.  That is what happened.  

Now, from the point of view of (inaudible) we probably should look into how he addressed the national congress, or how it was seen by the national congress in conjunction with, for example, with Article 4, and in conjunction with the agenda of that national congress, which was held in 1992.  The congress might be recalled for its approval by the congress.  And in terms of what he said, he said that he no longer wanted to hear talk about the JMRND; and that instead of the JMRND, one should talk about the Interahamwe because the Interahamwe was the youth movement which was integrated within the MRND.  

So, that -- probably you should ask Mathieu where the statutes of the Interahamwe's organisation are, because I resigned from that party about ten days following that event.  That is a natural fact.  The statutes that you are talking about should have been approved by the national congress at the time.  He can answer that question, but on account of the context, it was only provisional what the other youth parties had done -- was done.  We should look at this within the proper context.  

Mr. Robinson, if you were aware of the context of -- at the time, you will certainly not have asked the questions you are asking.  But you are a man of law, and you can only raise questions on the basis of the documents and the law; that is quite acceptable.  But don't forget what happened in practice and in the field.  Even if we had prepared statutes, one would have thought that we were creating our own party within the MRND, because as a matter of course, the objectives would have been totally different.

And this is why, Mr. Robinson, I urge you to understand the point I am trying to make; that is the explanation that I had as far as Article 61 is concerned.  
Q.	Can we agree then, that the statutes of the JMRND were never approved by the national committee, as far as you know? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we have a problem in the Kinyarwanda booth because the witness starts answering even before counsel finishes his question. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wait a minute.  You are talking too much.  Now, the interpreters have complained that you are starting to answer before the question is completed, so they are not able to translate the question and the answer properly.  As I have explained to you, you must wait until you have a question and then answer the question.  Do not make a speech.  Do not enter into an argument with what you think is the point the lawyer is trying to make.  Just answer the question.  Everything will work out properly at the end; but don't try to sort of argue because you don't understand exactly what the lawyer is getting at.  And you are just creating more problems for yourself and the whole process by trying to be too argumentative.  So what you must do is wait until you get a question and answer the question that you are asked.  Can you do that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Let me ask you my question again:  Can we agree that the statutes of the JMRND were never approved by the national committee, as far as you know? 
A.	I don't agree with you, because there was only one document consisting of the statutes.  And the JMRND was the youth wing of the MRND, and the MRND created statutes, unless you don't recognise the statutes that the MRND had written. 
Q.	And can you tell us approximately when the MRND national committee approved the statutes of the JMRND? 
A.	Look at the law in front of you or the official Gazette, Number 16 of the 15th of August 1991, you will find your answer there. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm asking you when the statutes of the JMRND, the youth of the MRND that you were president of in Kigali préfecture, that organisation, when were those statutes approved by the MRND national committee? 
A.	I will still give you the same answer, unless you reject it, I am not going to add anything to my answer.  You have before you the statutes that were officially notified on the 15th of -- announced on the 15th of August 1991.  That is my answer, unless you have another question concerning the JMRND. 
Q.	Did the JMRND have its own statutes, separate from those of the MRND? 
A.	You should have asked the question -- you should have asked the question in that manner earlier on.  I did answer that the JMRND statutes were the same as the MRND, because the JMRND is the youth wing of the MRND. 
Q.	And so there were no separate --  
A.	Let me add something for you:  At the beginning, the president -- the chairman was Robert A. Simba, that is child of Simba, Aloys.  And as vice chairman, we had Habyarimana, Bernard, and                 Leon Habyarimana, that is of the president of the Rwanda republic at the time.  And                   Johanita Ngirumpatse, who is the child of Mathieu Ngirumpatse; and the wife of Simba, that is, the wife of Simba, Harvary (phonetic), who was the treasurer, just to show you -- sorry, I'm not using the right word, the disciplines, as such.  I'm saying all of this to show you that what was established beforehand, that is what our parents had set up, our parents -- I'm saying "our parents" because I used to respect them.  I still respect them, even if genocide has occurred or they didn't follow what was established.  This is why the JMRND were the youth of those who signed the statutes.  And the youth were supposed to abide by the prescriptions of the MRND statutes.  And this is how it was organised, the JMRND abided by the MRND statutes, Mr. Robinson.  That is all. 
Q.	So, the JMRND did not have its own statutes, correct? 
A.	The JMRND followed the MRND statutes and none other. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, the Interahamwe, were they ever an integrated organisation within the MRND as described in Article 61? 
A.	Thank you very much.  You are leading me directly where I wanted to go.  Look at the speech that Ngirumpatse made, he was at the national congress.  He asked them for support for that organisation; that was in April 1992.  I had not come here to lie.  There are tangible events that demonstrate what I am saying.  For example, if there is information that you have on the Defence side, or the Prosecution has on their side, we can use that to confirm what I am saying.

The MRND -- or Ngirumpatse, pure and simple, talked about that organisation in the MRND congress so that it could be approved.  Ngirumpatse himself did this.  If there are statutes or anything else to that effect, I am not aware of that.  Shortly after the congress and after the demonstration of the 28th of May I resigned.  So that question is for them to answer.  Ask Ngirumpatse, he was the one who came up with the project and talked about it at the congress.  You just have to ask him.  
Q.	So can we agree then, that to your knowledge the Interahamwe did not have their own statutes, nor were any such statutes approved by the national committee? 
A.	Don't try to confuse or trick me or try to get me to lie.  I told you that the Interahamwe did not have a statute and I wasn't aware of it.  I didn't work with them.  I left at the time Ngirumpatse was trying to make that organisation official.  So, like I said before, it is up to you and your client and Mathieu Ngirumpatse to find an answer, help the Tribunal to find the statutes that govern the Interahamwe; but as far as I am concerned, I wasn't part of the Interahamwe and so I am not aware if they had statutes or not.  

As I told you, the people -- there are people, and I won't give you all of their names, who can give you that information. 
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Mbonyunkiza, now I want to turn to Article 26, which is entitled, "Affiliated Organisations."  And you have that in the document that is in front of you.  And it appears to read that, "Independent organisations may be affiliated to the movement; they shall be designated as affiliate organisations.  Any autonomous associations whose objectives are not contrary to the goals of the movement may request to be affiliated to the movement in order to cooperate with it.  The status of affiliate organisation of the movement shall be granted by the national committee." That is what Article 62 appears to say.  And I'm going to ask you, then if the JMRND ever requested to be affiliated to the MRND under Article 62 of the statute? 
A.	I'm not a lawyer, Mr. Robinson.  I will nevertheless thank you for moving on to Article 62 of the MRND statutes that Article of quite clear.  You yourself can read that independent organisations are mentioned.  Look at that term, "independent."  Doesn't that mean something to you, Counsel?  As a lawyer, you should understand.  This is why you should look at the content of Article 62, the other organisations that wanted to affiliate with the MRND had to make a request to the MRND party.  But we were not an independent organisation, so no such request had to be made.  We fell under the MRND.  We were not an independent organisation. 
Q.	Okay, fair enough.  And would the same be true for the Interahamwe? 
A.	I have no idea.  Don't ask me questions about the organisation of the Interahamwe, I'm not familiar with it.  But you can ask me questions about the JMRND and I can answer them, like I just have.  But if you want more information about the Interahamwe, ask Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	So, would it be fair to say that to your knowledge the Interahamwe was never an affiliate organisation of the MRND? 

MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm objecting to the question.  The witness has already answered the question.  I have exhausted this area.  Mr. Robinson has asked at least 10 questions on the very issue.  And the witness has already stated that he is not a lawyer.  He cannot do the statutory analysis.  And this questioning should come to an end at some point, this line of questioning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I think you can answer the question. 
THE WITNESS:
I have already answered, Mr. President.  I said that I am not aware of how the Interahamwe and the MRND cooperated or worked together; and that I know nothing about their statutes.  I said that there was an MRND congress in April.  During that congress, Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself submitted a proposal for the Interahamwe, seeking approval for that proposal.  It was the fourth item on that congress's agenda.  That is all the information that I have.  

With regard, however, to the statutes, I know nothing about them.  I only know members of the Interahamwe whose names I have already mentioned.  They were involved in the creation of the organisation.  That is all the information that I have.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, thank you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  I'm going to move away from the statutes now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'm wondering, Mr. President, if you would like to take the morning recess, or should I go to the next exhibit? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we -- if you are going to be longer than five minutes, then we should take a recess now. 
 (Court recessed from 1041H to 1120H)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, while we are waiting for the witness, if we could return to Exhibit 2 -- D. NZ2A              Mr. Webster and I have resolved the issue.  We have added one page that was missing, and it has been distributed.  So I now move the Exhibit 2[NDZ], which is the Kinyarwanda version of the manifesto of the MRND. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar -- the registrar has copies?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ2A admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And with respect to the English version, Mr. Webster has suggested that we separate the document that was distributed to you yesterday, which contained both the manifesto and the statute.  The first 17 pages are the manifesto and that should become D. NZ2B, and the rest of it which is the copy of the statutes, would become D. NG2B, being the companion to Ngirumpatse's exhibit introduced yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, do you have those?  

Yes, well admitted accordingly.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ2B admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NG2B admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness enters the courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, is everything okay with you now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then your evidence will continue.  You will continue to answer the questions put by Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like to ask for the assistance of the registrar to show the witness a document; and it is one that was distributed on Friday entitled, "National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development, Objectives, Programme and Projects and Priorities of Action," dated August of 1991. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I don't mean to rush you when you are looking at the document, but when you are ready to answer the question, the question I wanted to ask you is, if you recognise this document?  
A.	Absolutely, I do, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Is it an MRND document that you are familiar with as a result of your work at the office of MRND? 
A.	There were many documents.  I don't remember all of the books published by the MRND at the time.  There were many documents that I saw, and I can acknowledge that I have seen this one before; that I can confirm for you now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you very much.

Mr. President, at this time I would offer the MRND Objective Programme and Priorities of Action as Exhibit D. NZ3. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ3 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, this is a document that has both English and French, so that you will find the English in the back. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But it is one document, so it will have one exhibit number. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if could you look in this document under the first introduction, it is entitled -- you will see the word "History" is Number 1.  And if you could look further along to Section 2, you will see the Context of Reforms -- Political Reforms in Rwanda.  And then on Number 2, sub 1,
National Debate on the Political Reforms, that is on page 10.  And then on page 12, you will see the third heading, regarding the Mouvement Revolutionaires National pour Developpement.  And underneath that third heading, if you could look on page 13 of the French, and page 33 of the English, there is a paragraph for the French, it is fourth paragraph from the top, and for the English it is the first full paragraph.  And it starts with (French spoken), do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay, and the following paragraph after that, it is (French spoken), I won't butcher the French any more than that, but do you see the paragraph after that starts with (French spoken).  Do you see that paragraph, it is actually the fifth paragraph from the top on page 13 of the French.  Are you with me? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  And is it true that that paragraph says that, "The movement is a party which has its roots in the deepest strata of the Rwandan population.  It very strongly rejects separatist tendencies of any kind.  It`s aim is development for all in national independence warrenter (phonetic) of solidarity among the people."  Is that what is contained in that paragraph? 
A.	Yes, absolutely. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you and then turning to under number 4, the objectives of the MRND, which you will find on page 14, and under that subsection C, which is on page 34 of the English.  Is it also indicated there that, "The movement notably pursues the following aim," and under C it says, "Union, excluding discrimination of any kind intensification of the efforts of the members of the movement in order to achieve the development of the whole Rwandan people, in peace, unity, conservation (phonetic) and democracy in conformity with the programme which is outlined in the manifesto of the movement."  Is that what is stated there? 
A.	Yes, that is exactly what it says. 
Q.	And then, if could you go to page 18, actually it starts for you on the bottom of page 17, and for the English is on page 37, under item Number 6 "Political Domain."  And on page 18, at the very top, does it not indicate that, "Their seeking consolidation of unity among the ethnic groups and the regions of the country and rejection of the exploitation of man by man and of discrimination of any kind."  Do you see that there?
A.	Where are you at?  I can see the heading, but I'm not sure which bullet you are referring to. 
Q.	I'm referring to the second bullet, so it would be at the top of page 18 for you, at the very top of the page.  It is the first bullet on the page, but it is second bullet under --  
A.	Okay, okay. 
Q.	So, do you see where it says, "They are seeking consolidation of unity among the ethnic groups and the regions of the country, and the rejection of the exploitation of man by man, and of discrimination of any kind"? 
A.	Yes, that is correct; that is what it written here.  You are correct.
Q.	Thank you very much.  And then turning to page 20 of the French, under paragraph 7, 1; this is on page 31 of the English, under "Political Domain," and the very last bullet under paragraph 7, number 1, is it true that "Their priorities include the definitive settlement of the problems of the Rwandan refugees"?  
A.	Yes, definitively deal with the refugee problem.  That is what you are referring to?  
Q.	Yes, thank you.  And then finally under conclusion on page 21 of the French, and page 41 of the English, in the second paragraph, does it indicate that "Even if the political changes in Rwanda took place during the war, the MRND will continue to preach national concord and unity among the ethnic groups and the regions and that since the war has somewhat exhausted this unity.  The MRND intends to help the government in the task of heart, reunification and sincere and definitive national reconciliation." Do you see that there in the conclusion? 
A.	Yes, I see it.  I can see what is written here. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, we can turn away from this document.  And I want to ask you about the implementation of the multi-party system, as you observed it, in Rwanda in 1992.  I believe you testified that the MRND initially gave the impression that it was ready to collaborate with the opposition parties; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to be shown a document that is contained in tab 101 of the Prosecutor's books of exhibits? Do you recognise this document? 
A.	This is the first time I am seeing it, but at the time I heard mention made of a memorandum of understanding between the political parties.  I have heard mention made of this, and even within the parties; but this is first time I am seeing the document itself. 
Q.	And can you confirm that there was, in fact, an agreement signed among the political parties in Rwanda in March of 1992 that provided for the division of ministries and for participation of all of the political parties in Rwanda government? 
A.	Yes, I'm confirming this, unless you have the original for us to make a final confirmation, but what I can say now is that there was a protocol agreement between the MRND and the opposition parties, yes.  The MRND agreed to participate in multipartyism.  So I can confirm that a protocol agreement was signed between the parties, but I don't know whether this is the document or not. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Mbonyunkiza. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I will offer this exhibit as D. NZ4. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
With respect to D. NZ4, Your Honours, I'm going to object.  There were actually four different protocols, and I think we are going to get confused on this issue if we simply go ahead and admit what               Mr. Robinson has identified, because this was -- the March document was not the document that became the legal document.  And rather than go into that with this witness, I would object for lack of foundation, and I would prefer that we deal with the document that became of a legal effect, and this, certainly, was not that document.  Perhaps, Mr. Robinson would want to --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This document came from the document that you intend to -- that you gave notice that you intend to be tendered; is that correct?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you undertake to tender it?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  All -- in fact, we can tender all four of them.  But the document that was placed before this witness, and what I would like to suggest to Mr. Robinson, is that if he tenders the document under tab 102, I would have no objection, but I think I have an objection to 101. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, does it matter who tenders the document?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we have an undertaking from Mr. Webster that he would be tendering them; would that be sufficient for your purposes at this stage?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would it be?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Mr. Webster, do we have your undertaking?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Of course, Your Honour, all four documents will be tendered. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm a little bit at a loss.  If the documents are going to be tendered why they can't be admitted now so that we can work with them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, they could be admitted now, but he was saying that the label under which they were being tendered would be confusing.  That is what I understood his comment to mean; that there are four documents and that this one was not properly described.  And the witness doesn't seem to be in the position to clarify the definition.  

But I don't mind it being admitted for -- if we can agree on what the title and the (inaudible), it would be admitted now.  But it is just, in my opinion, a method of being more clear, and not duplicating efforts. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I'm actually planning on going through each of the protocol, so maybe it would be a better time if I offered this exhibit as DNZ --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, could all four protocols be put in by consent at this stage?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, we can put all four in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
At this stage?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, the problem I had was that the document Mr. Robinson identified was not one of the protocols, it was a draft.  And the protocol that was first signed by the parties is dated the 7th of April 1992, which is a document which appears at 102.  This witness has already stated that he has heard talk of the protocol, but he has never seen it, so he is not in a position to know what document was actually signed and entered into legal affect.  So, that was what was my concern. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, does this witness -- this witness really doesn't have sufficient knowledge to clarify this issue.  I don't see any harm -- the documents have an identifying number, so you can question him about them; and in due course, they will be put into evidence.  But what you can use is the K number, so that it will be clear which document you're questioning him about.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I understand, Mr. President.

Actually, Mr. President, my purpose in showing -- I was intending to show all four of these documents to the witness for the purpose of identifying and having them admitted into evidence.  I realise that perhaps this witness -- there is not sufficient foundation through this witness to admit these documents.  But I thought because they were already documents that the Prosecution indicated that they would like to have admitted, that we could admit the documents without all of the foundation that is required.  

So, what I would prefer to do is at this time offer each of the four documents as exhibits and to have them given the designations, because the Prosecution's numbering of tabs is not going to correspond to the documents which are admitted, because some will be admitted and some won't.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the problem -- why I intervened is the Prosecution objected to the document you are tendering on the basis that it was a draft document.  He said that there were other documents which were, in fact, the protocol.  This witness is not in the position to know the difference, it is quite clear.  Now, if you all can agree on what is being tendered, I have no problem with that.  So, I just wanted to make certain that the documents that were being tendered were tendered under their proper designation. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, what I would propose to do is to tender the draft of March of 1992 as D. NZ4; to tender the protocol of April 1992, which is in tab 102, as D. NZ5; to tender the protocol of April 1993, which is at tab 110, as D. NZ6; and to tender the protocol of the 8th of February 1994, as D. NZ7 which is tab 112.  So I offer those exhibits at this time. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I'm still going to object.  We have no problem whatsoever with the documents coming into evidence.  But this witness has already stated that he has heard talk of the documents.  He has never seen the document.  And it is clear from Mr. Robinson's attempt to move them into evidence that he started with a draft, which is not a document that this witness would have seen. And if we continue this line of questioning, the next thing is Mr. Robinson placing these documents in front of the witness.  And the witness already stated that he does not know the document.  It is not appropriate to bring these documents into evidence through this witness and question him on these documents. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the witness can be questioned about the documents.  And the question is not the evidence; his answer will be the evidence, whatever it is, whether it is knowledgeable or not knowledgeable.  But he can be asked questions about the document.  

I am very uncomfortable, I don't think it is proper for him to introduce them, because his knowledge is not sufficient to justify tendering the document into evidence; but I think you can ask him questions about them.  If you use the K number, it will be clear which documents you are asking about.  And we have already had the undertaking that these documents will be put into evidence.  So I think it will perform part -- be proper for the record.  But I don't think that we can go forward -- he is not in the position to tender them.  So you couldn't put them in without the consent of the Prosecutor, which is obviously not forthcoming. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, Mr. President, I'm going to move away from the protocols because my purpose was simply to offer them into evidence, and we will have to do that at some other time.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And now, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I want to ask you some questions just about the membership card of MRND.  And I know you have told us that you joined the MRNDD in September 1991, correct? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Robinson, you are correct. 
Q.	And I was just a little bit confused when you were looking at the copy -- the photocopy of the MRND membership card which was Exhibit P. 1D, so I brought an original membership card, and I would like to have this card shown to you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And if it could be shown to the Chamber and to the Prosecutor first? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Robinson was kind of enough to provide a number of copies of his -- of his reciprocal disclosure under Rule 67, but this was not among them.  And I am requesting that we are provided a copy of this and in the future, if we could have copies of all of the items that are going to be shown to the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I can do that.  This, I am not intending to offer as an exhibit, but I can certainly have copies provided, the content of the document is not particularly important. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Monyunkiza, I just want to have you look now at an original MRND card.  And can you tell me then from looking at that, whether this is a card for the MRND in the multiparty system or whether it is in the unique party system?
A.	That is right, Mr. Robinson; this card is authentic. 
Q.	And is it a card from the MRND in the multiparty system, meaning the M and then republican for democracy, as opposed to the M revolution and democracy? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm on channel 2.  I'm on channel 2. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like you to --  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Do you want I should repeat the question? 
A.	I believe so, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Is the card that is in front of you from the MRND in the multi-party system? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And, in fact, the MRND as a unique single party didn't have membership cards, did it? 
A.	I don't know about that because I was in school, as I have told you.  But with the multiparty era, and when I started being involved in political activities, the only membership card for the MRND that I knew was this one.  I didn't know of any other. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And then if the witness could be shown Prosecution Exhibit 1D, which was a copy of the MRND membership card, Prosecution Exhibit 1D, is this also a card from the multi -- from the MRND in the multi-party system? 
THE WITNESS:
	Please, could you repeat your question, Mr. Robinson? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Is the photocopy that you are looking at also from the multi-party system? 
A.	Yes, yes, except you will remember that the last time I said that the situation was a bit reversed, but it is identical. 
Q.	Okay.  I just wanted to clarify it, so I think we both understand exactly, now, the MRND membership card, and I thank you.  Now, you have told us that the opposition parties created youth movements.  And I'm asking you whether or not those youth movements were created before the youth movement of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, it was before, it was before, but it was in the same period of time, if I can put it that way.  But those who started were JDR of the PSD, GSD was the second, and GL was the third.  JDR was of the MRND, GSD -- JSD of the PSD, and JL of the PL; and then there was JMRND of the MRND.  But it was in the same -- within the same period of time.  But those who started are, as I have just mentioned. 
Q.	And is it correct that the JMRND was founded in October 1991? 
A.	Absolutely, yes, that is right. 
Q.	And it was founded because the MRND decided to imitate the other parties and have their own youth wing? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, as I have told you after having seen that there was the establishment of youth wings in the other political parties, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, since he was chairman of the MRND for the préfecture of Kigali town, he organised elections in his building.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I'm having difficulty hearing the witness, can he be asked to speak into the microphone?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, yes, please speak into your microphone.  No, I think you should speak into one or the other.  Turn one off and speak into the other, yes. 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphone not activated) -- As I recall very well, Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself organised elections at Eden Garden where there was a cafe and restaurant, his own.  And elected -- I don't know whether I can say the names.  Do you want me to mention the names again, I have already done so earlier?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I think we know the names.  It's not necessary.  So my next question though is, is it true that      President Habyarimana desired that the JMRND collaborate peacefully with other party's youth without political, ethnic or religious discrimination? 
A.	Really, I can support that even today.  I can support him in that, even today.  Mr. Juvénal Habyarimana, in his speech which he made before the Rwanda people, according to the speech, he was saying that he didn't want racial, ethnic or regional discrimination.  He was saying that at the time, and it is in the speech.  For me, I was young and I needed to follow and obey what the president of the republic was saying.  He was saying it himself.  

Furthermore, in my resignation letter, you will find this.  It was in my letter, you will be able to see, this just before the last paragraph of my letter, how I was saying that the establishment of the Interahamwe was for the extermination of people.  I'm not going to go back to the letter, but I did, indeed, write about that in my letter of resignation.  

The president wanted peaceful collaboration without racial, ethnic or regional discrimination.  That is quite clearly written.  And that is what was said at the time, but what happened after the rally of        15th November, after my resignation is quite clear, and I cannot lie. 
Q.	Yes, we are going to get to that.  Now, you told us that on December 19th, 1991 elections were held for new offices of the JMRND; is that correct? 
A.	The MRND political office, what is that?  Yes, that is correct, 15th of December 1991.  
Q.	I thought it was the 19th of December? 
A.	It is not the 15th.  It is the 19th of December. 
(Pages 15 to 29 by Donna M. Lewis)





































1200H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And can you tell us where those elections were held, in what place?  
A.	At the MRND national office located in Muhima, in Felicien Kabuga's building. 
Q.	And who called those elections? 
A.	Who called them?  As I said, they wanted to organise elections within the youth wing and 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself allowed thousands of elections to occur.  He administered the oath.  He gave us the premises to conduct the elections; he convened all of the youth wing members for the purposes of the election.  There were secteur committees that were set up.  Those committees brought together other people in the MRND youth wing and we all gathered in that building, and we began the elections.  That is how it occurred. 
Q.	And can you give me an idea of approximately how many people were present during the meeting in which the elections were held on the 19th of December? 
A.	It has been a long time.  We weren't more numerous than other parties.  There were about 80 of us, 80. 
Q.	Was Mathieu Ngirumpatse present at that meeting? 
A.	No, I can't lie.  He had delegated someone, but it has been a long time.  I don't remember.  Pardon me.  There was a delegate from the MRND who came to control the process and organise the elections.  I forget his name, though.  Someone was sent. 
Q.	And was Robert Simba present, the former -- or the incumbent president?  
A.	Absolutely, he was the one who, in fact, called the meeting.  He was there and he was angry because he was pushed out, if I can use that language, because he also was a candidate. 
Q.	And were the two sons of the President Habyarimana present at this meeting, Bernard and Leon? 
A.	Yes, they were supporting the elections.  They were also there, but they no longer wanted to participate in the leadership of the JMRND.  Really, if you would have known his children, Bernard and Leon, they were very simple, cooperative.  I don't know how to explain it.  I'm telling you the truth.  I won't hide the truth.  I'm telling you the truth, and only the truth. 
Q.	It's not necessary to insist really.  Was Uwanita (sic) Ngirumpatse present at this meeting? 
A.	Yes, Joanita Ngirumpatse was present. 
Q.	And who were the candidates for president? 
A.	Myself, Robert Simba; that was for the chairmanship.  For the vice-chair's position, 
	Joel Nsengiyumva, and I will stop there.  You simply asked me about the chairmanship.  I don't want to disturb the proceedings.
Q.	And Nsengiyumva, is that spelt N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M -- excuse me -- I-Y-U-M-V-A? 
A.	That's correct.  Now you can speak Kinyarwanda, Counsel. 
Q.	It's very difficult.  Now, when you had this election, did you -- you were -- you received more votes than Robert Simba; is that correct? 
A.	Absolutely.  That's what I said.  That's why I was elected. 
Q.	And so was there a swearing-in ceremony where you received the oath of office? 
A.	Yes, there was an oath and -- followed the statute of the MRND.  Yes, we were given an oath. 
Q.	And do you recall who administered that oath to you on that day, the 19th December 1991? 
A.	I told you before, the person who was in charge of the elections.  He was the one who administered the oath.  He was the MRND delegate sent by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  But it has been a long time and I pardon -- I beg your pardon for not remembering the name.  It's been a long time.  Pardon me. 
Q.	It's no problem, really.  Now you then, as I understand it, also became a member of the MRND committee for Nyarugenge commune; is that correct? 
A.	Absolutely, that's correct. 
Q.	And that was on the 5th of January 1992, correct? 
A.	Yes.  I am not sure about the exact date, but I do remember very well that it was in the first week of that year, beginning on that first week of the year. 
Q.	Now, I believe you told us that your father was killed by Habyarimana's army because he refused to join the MRND in 1991.  And as I see it, at the end of 1991 you had become the president of that youth movement of that very same party.  So can you explain to us why you were willing to lead the youth of a party that you attribute the death of your father to? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, I explained this yesterday.  I even told you why Robert Kajuga led the Interahamwe, although he was a Tutsi.  And that there were problems that family had with the MRND.  What I said is that personally I joined the MRND -- and what happened was not going to stop me from joining.  Even if they -- those soldiers killed my father.  And I learnt of this later, by the way.  I was shocked.  It was even after I had resigned that I learnt of this.  That would not stop me -- it didn't stop me.  I don't know how to explain it.  

My father was killed.  How?  If you want explanations, I can give them to you if it's necessary.  I told you what I thought was necessary to become a member of the MRND.  Let me tell you something, 
	Mr. Robinson.  You know, there are people in our villages, even today, we eat together.  We know very well that some of -- some among them killed members of our families.  Mr. Robinson, if we get into the details, we can cover other things that can affect us and even affect you.  I will stop here so that I don't dwell on this and talk about things you didn't ask.  But I will answer your question by saying that I took the initiative to join the MRND well before I knew who killed my father.  I only learnt of it afterwards, even after I had resigned.  That was not one of the reasons I resigned because I learnt afterwards. 
Q.	Can you tell me when you learnt that your father had been killed by Habyarimana's army because he refused to join the MRND? 
A.	It was in early 1993; that is when I learnt. 
Q.	And in early 1993, was that the time that you were in hiding from the Interahamwe and the MRND? 
A.	I'd explained this.  I can explain how we went into hiding, and I can tell you how people were chased down during the genocide for the -- because they were Tutsis, how they escaped.  And if I told you all of that it can make you cry.  What I can tell you is that the period following my resignation was horrible, Mr. Robinson.  

I can begin to explain, and I can talk about this for hours and hours, how I hid and what I did.  We may take an entire day talking about that.  It was a very difficult period, even in 1994, it continued.  People were chasing me right up until the time my brother was killed, and they said that I was the one who did it.  They said I was the killer -- they thought, rather, they thought they had killed me -- they were killing me.  

If I can tell you all of the things that happened to me, I could only say that God saved me.  I tried to see how to save myself and to save others, because this all occurred during this same period.  Even today, I can tell you what's going on at home right now as I'm testifying.  I did not want to raise this before the Tribunal.  I said that I would say these things at a different time.  That is why I'm having blood pressure problems, by the way.  I said that I must help the Tribunal, otherwise, I'd rather go and have some rest, even right now.  I will give you that information later.  I don't want to disturb the proceedings, 
	Mr. Robinson.  That is the way I have to put it. 
Q.	Okay, well let's go back to the period now in January 5th of 1992 when you became a member of the communal committee for MRND for Nyarugenge commune.  Can you tell me, who was the chairman of the MRND for that commune at that time? 
A.	At that time, it was on an interim basis.  It was Mr. Gaspard Munyanginga -- Munyandinda, Gaspard.  It was on an interim basis.  During the genocide, he was killed. 
Q.	Can you spell that name for the court reporters, please? 
A.	M-U-N-Y-A-N-D-I-N-D-A. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  And at the time you became a member of the communal committee for MRND, who was the bourgmestre of Nyarugenge commune? 
A.	François Karera was.  He was replaced by Jean Bizimana.  There was someone called Munya -- something or other.  I forget his name.  I've forgotten his name.  He became a director general at the ministry of interior.  At any rate, he did not hold the position for long.  Between Bizimana and Karera, there was another person.  Munya -- something or other, I don't remember his name.  There was someone who had the post between Bizimana and Karera, but I forgot his name. 
Q.	And Mr. -- are you sure that Mr. Karera was the bourgmestre at the time you became a member of the communal committee? 
A.	That's what I'm telling you.  It's been a long time.  There was one other person, and pardon me for not remembering the name.  I don't want to tell any lies here.  Perhaps you can assist me, help me find the name of the person who held the post between Karera and Jean Bizimana.  There was someone however in-between Bizimana and Karera. 
Q.	And was that the person who was the bourgmestre at the time that you were appointed? 
A.	That's what I'm telling you.  I am a bit confused.  I cannot be more specific, and pardon me for that. 
Q.	Now it's no problem.  Okay, so when did you start attending the weekly meetings on Wednesdays at the MRND Kigali préfecture office? 
A.	Right after all of the elections in the communal offices for the MRND were held, and préfectural elections in Kigali.  But it has been a long time and I can't be more specific.  I am not going to lie or invent anything.  However, it was after the elections.  After those elections, the weekly meetings began to take place. 
Q.	And so that would be after the 5th of January, or after the first week of January 1992, correct? 
A.	No, there were also elections in Kacyiru, Kicukiro, and in -- for the préfectural committee.  The communal committees came after the cellule.  First, there was the cellule committees, the secteur, communal and then the préfectural committees.  After all of that was concluded, we began to hold our meetings.  I told you that I cannot lie.  I told you that these began directly after the elections of the 10th of January (sic).  Otherwise, I don't remember any other specific dates.  Pardon me, it's been a long time. 
Q.	You told us about three meetings that took place in the month of February in which the Interahamwe committee attended.  Can you tell us if you attended any meetings before that? 
A.	Yes, I said that we gathered and listened to the MRND programme; how we listened to people; how we came up with MRND emblems and distributed them.  We gathered in the MRND premises in Kigali préfecture.  That is when Mathieu Ngirumpatse brought the project proposal to us and talked about the Interahamwe and Robert Kajuga, et cetera.  I don't want to continue to mention these names.  I think we can stop there. 
Q.	So about how many of these Wednesday meetings did you attend before the first meeting with the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't remember, sir.  Pardon me, Mr. Robinson.  I don't remember, honestly.  I don't remember. 
Q.	Now -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm -- I -- I'm about to start asking him about the meetings of February 1992, and I wondered if you'd like to take a luncheon recess or I should launch into that at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Unintelligible) ... in five minutes, and we can take the break now.  

Is there any chance that you are going to conclude your examination this afternoon?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we'll take the luncheon recess now until 2 o'clock.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I have done at each adjournment, that you remain a witness during the adjournment, and you will not discuss the case with anybody.

We'll take the adjournment now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think my client has just informed me that my statement was not translated correctly.  I said I would not be finished today.  I think you understood me clearly that I will not finish with this witness today, but I think in the other language it's translated as I will finish today, so I didn't want nobody to get their hopes up before we had lunch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I had understood that you had said that you are not going to finish today.  Are you saying that your client has instructed you to finish today?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, he just informed me that the translations was reversed in the French so they -- the other speakers of other languages were thinking I was going to finish today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see.  All right.
MR. ROBINSON:
So I don't want them to have a surprise.  
(Court recessed from 1227H to 1412H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Mr. Weyl, why, you were standing to make an intervention?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I simply wanted to inform the Chamber that Ms. Hounkpatin is not here this afternoon and we are requesting that she be excused.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Witness, your examination will continue.  Mr. Robinson will continue his questions.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, my friend Robinson. 
Q.	So we are going to talk about the meetings of February 1992.  And the first thing I want to try to do is to establish, as accurately as possible, the list of people who were in attendance at the first meeting.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So I will ask the registrar if he could collect an exhibit from me and distribute it to the witness and the parties. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, what I have done on this piece of paper is I've gone through your statement of January 2001, and I have listed the people that you mentioned in connection with this meeting.  And what I want to do now is to add and subtract from this list, depending on your recollection.  I did this simply to make it easier, to facilitate compiling the list, rather than starting from -- from zero.  So I'd go over with you the names that are on this list and you can tell me if your recollection is that they were present at the first meeting of the -- in which the Interahamwe was introduced in February 1992.  Do you understand me? 
A.	Yes, I understand, but there are persons whose names you've put here that were not there.
Q.	Okay, we are going to go through that and we are going to cross those out.  So that when we -- and then if there are some people who you recall who were there that are not on this list, we are going to write their names.  So at the end we have a complete list.  Do you understand? 
A.	Why didn't you just take the statement because it's an official document?  Using this list, I would rather you use the statement because it's a formal document.  It's -- it would be better that you refer to my statement directly.  I can appreciate the job you've done here, but I would rather that you give me the statement.  It's official.  I read it.  I've even read it over again.  I'm referring to my statement of the 
	11th January 2001, and signed by me on the 20th of January 2001.  

Now, if you are drawing up a list like this, it's fine but there is already something else which can supplement this list. 
Q.	Okay, well, do you have a pen there in front of you? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, are we moving ahead with the list that was provided by counsel?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't normally answer questions directly from the other party unless you intervene.  So would you like me to answer that question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I would have liked the atmosphere in the court to be as cordial as possible.  I would normally intervene if there was something controversial that I thought I should intervene in.  I don't see anything controversial with this.  It seems to be an enquiry for clarification, and I think it's in order for you to answer if you wish.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I'm happy to answer, Mr. President, but I've actually been trained that all communications go through the Bench, so I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I remember that that's the position -- that's the position we are accustomed to.  And I do want to discourage direct -- direct exchange, as far as possible, but this seems to be a simple -- a simple inquiry for clarification, which I thought reasonable that you could answer.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  So the answer is yes.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
In which case, I would object, Your Honour.  In fact, what the witness -- as the witness was formulating his question to the Defence counsel, I was thinking the same thing.  This is an issue that we addressed yesterday.  At that time -- on two occasions I asked Mr. Robinson -- I asked through the Court that      Mr. Robinson be directed to inform us where this list came from, whether it came from another case, whether he drew up this list based on the witness's in- court testimony, or whether it came from his statement of 2001.  And he declined to answer at that time, and now he's introducing his line of questioning by stating to the record that he drew up his list based on this -- the witness's statement of January 2001.

If that -- that's the case, the witness is quite correct in bringing to his attention that a more appropriate way of approaching this is taking his witness statement and going through it item by item, and looking at the names that he has put in his witness statement.  Otherwise, it's going to fall upon me to compare the witness statement to this list as Mr. Robinson is going through his direct examination (sic).  And the whole procedure can be simplified by going directly to the witness statement.  It's in evidence.  It was introduced by Counsel Hounkpatin two days ago.  I believe the number is D. NG3, if I'm not mistaken.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two matters.  Just as a matter of general courtroom decorum, I don't appreciate having two counsel on their feet at the same time.  So I would appreciate if that didn't happen any more.  

With regard to the particular issue, we don't think that what Mr. Robinson said is evidence.  What would become evidence would be what the witness says.  Now, the witness has looked at the list and he has already indicated that some of the names on this list are -- were not at the meeting.  And we think that it's a technique which could -- could shorten the testimony, if the witness looked at the list, put an "X" against names that he says were not there, or a question mark against the name that he doesn't know if they were there, and then he can add the names of anybody else he wants to add.  Now, what the witness says or does would then become his evidence on this matter.  

Would it possible for you to do something like that, Mr. Witness?  Yes, Mr. Witness, is that something that you can do?  
THE WITNESS: 
Mr. President, in the list, even if you look at the title of this list, this piece of paper I have been given, "List of People Present at Interahamwe meeting in February 1992".  Mr. President, there were many rallies at the stadium, and there is no specific stipulation as to which meeting we are referring to in February 1992.  There is no reference made to what you, yourself, said.  He didn't even say, okay, this is the first meeting, and these were the people present; and the same for the second and the third meeting.  

Now, if we have things like this and we have only one document to deal with, this is for us to go along a line which is not appropriate.  It's not going to be in line with the truth.  I do not want to say that I don't want to answer, but there were several rallies that were held at the stadium, and even if some of these meetings were for restricted people.  But someone who comes to testify cannot use a document such as this one, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the witness has a point, I think.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's no problem.  I can approach this in another way.  I really was trying to make this quicker, but I could see that it's taking longer.  So, may the registry be directed to give the witness a blank piece of paper and to take this document from him 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Mr. Mbonyunkiza , what I -- what we are going to talk about is that we are going to talk about the first meeting of the Interahamwe at the building of Vedaste Rubangura in February 1992.  Are we clear together on which meeting I'm talking about? 
A.	Yes, I understand.  But, please, I have headaches.  I have taken tablets.  I do apologise.  It's not that I want to be a hindrance.  We've already said that we are not even going to finish today.  You are asking -- please ask me questions which do not require too much of an effort on my part intellectually.  Please try and understand me, because I am unwell.  Although I'm here, yesterday it was found that my pressure was very high, that it was 90 -- that it was too low.  It was 90 by 60.  Please, at least for this afternoon, ask me questions which will not demand too much of me.  If I go and take a rest this evening I'll be ready to answer questions tomorrow, but please ask me other questions which would not require too much of me, because I am having to remember all these people who were there.  

	When I saw the list, I saw Munyandinda, Gaspard, directly and this is a reason why I told you that you had made a mistake.  But in the document that you have, this is not mentioned.  So please give me time to reflect and think about this a bit, because I'm very tired.  I'm very tired. 
Q.	Okay, I thank you for that, and I understand.  I know you've made a great effort to give your testimony, and I would want you to be at your best.  So if I ask you a question that you don't understand the answer -- you don't understand, we'll just go slowly and we will do our best here.  I want you to be very accurate.  And if it's a problem, let the presiding -- the President know.

	So let's see if we can do something very easy here.  On the blank piece of paper that's in front of you, can you please simply write down "First meeting, February 1992"? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, really, please try and be humanitarian, even if you are a man of the law, really.  I am requesting that you accept my request.  I can answer that question with no difficulty at all, but not today.  Please allow me the time for me to rest a little.  You can ask the doctor.  Despite the fact that I'm here, I decided that I must continue in spite of everything, but this would require a lot of me.  If you were to put yourself in my place, and with the illness that I'm suffering, really, I think you need to try and understand me, Mr. Robinson.  You are my friend after all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the question as to the identity of people at the meetings is a legitimate question.  You have, in fact, already given some information about who were present at those meetings.  Now, I think counsel is perfectly entitled to ask you to give as complete a list as you can, given the fact that it was some time ago.  Now, he had tried to assist that exercise by preparing a list that he thought represented what your evidence was.  You thought that the list was not very helpful.  So he is now going about it in a slightly different way.  He is allowing you to prepare the list yourself.  I don't think that is too difficult a task and I think you should go ahead.  
THE WITNESS: 
I should like to inform the Tribunal that I will answer the question, but -- but I am being denied a right.  I am not in a position -- yes, he helped me and I acknowledge that.  The list was not specific enough.  I would even ask your leave to return home, but since we want the truth to come out, I've indicated that I would continue testifying.  But since you are asking me to write down the list of persons at those three meetings, I shall try to think about it.  The question he asked me -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question he asked is only to one meeting, just the first meeting.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what he is asked now, just the first meeting.  Okay?  So try and do that.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  Could I be given a sheet of paper by the registry so that I can write it down?  It really is tasking, mentally, this exercise.  Could the registry kindly give me another piece of paper -- give me back the other piece of paper -- pardon me -- the list.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would like to make a request that we adjourn for this afternoon. I think this is a sensitive issue.  I don't want to take advantage of anybody, and I want him to be at his best.  I don't want it to later be said that he said something wrong because he wasn't feeling well.  And I think that my request is that the witness be given time to recover and to be cross-examined when he's in a position to give us his very best answers.  What I've asked of him is very simple.  It's appears that it's tasking him; it's causing him stress, and I don't think that's right.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I may comment.  Your Honour, we've been going at this for the last three or four days.  We had a tasking week last week as well.  I know, I'm not talking for hours after hours; this witness has, and I leave the courtroom at the end of the day exhausted, so I can quite understand that the witness may be tired, and may have a headache.  He complains of high blood pressure.  And, perhaps, the Court can enquire of the witness if he wants to continue this afternoon.  But on this point, I'm afraid I agree with Mr. Robinson, if the witness is uncomfortable or unwell, perhaps it would be in the interest of justice to -- to reconvene when he is feeling stronger or more able to concentrate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen, I can assure you that the Court has humanity, but we also have been here all day.  We have the disadvantage of seeing your age -- and so we appreciate the pressures that everybody has.  I don't think from what the witness said -- or what the witness was saying, I did not interpret his remarks at this stage as a statement that he could not continue.  If I feel that he cannot continue, then we will adjourn.  What we can -- what I will do is to rise for a few minutes.  But I think that the question was asked is -- that was asked was a question that he could answer.  And then it's just after lunch.  We are not going to be sitting tomorrow; he's going to have the whole weekend.  He can come -- so I think -- I am not disposed at this stage to adjourn the trial -- the trial, unless I'm satisfied that it is necessary to do so.  

Now, Mr. Witness, are you in a position to continue right now or do you want to get a ten-minute break?  
THE WITNESS: 
Ten minutes would not be sufficient, Mr. President, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, okay.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- your situation compared to mine -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE WITNESS:
-- the way I feel right now.  Mr. President, please understand.  Even yesterday, I said that I had to come to testify.  You can even ask the registry, I told them I had to continue in spite of my blood pressure.  But I feel ill.  Even as I'm talking to you now, I feel dizzy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, would half an hour be a more reasonable break?  If we broke for half an hour, would that be -- give you a fair opportunity to recover?  
THE WITNESS: 
I'm not in a position to answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, so we break for half an hour and see what happens.  
THE WITNESS: 
During that half hour, may I go to the clinic to find out what is happening?  I really feel, Mr. President, my pressure is going down.  Maybe I can bring you the exam results to show you so that you'll understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the registrar has indicated that he is able to make arrangements to have you taken to the clinic right away.  So we will allow that to take place, and depending on what happens, we will decide how to continue after the doctor has seen you and reported back to the Chamber.  

Now, we don't know how long this exercise will take, so what I would like is to just adjourn now, and I would ask the registrar -- if you can leave information with the registrar so that when we get a report from the doctor, we can then arrange to reconvene as soon as possible after that.  

We will take a short recess to enable the witness to visit -- get medical attention.  
(Court recessed at 1443H)

(Court resumed at 1548H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume.  During the break I received a certificate from the medical superintendent of the clinic who has indicated, or prescribed, that the witness is in need of repos medical, and she directed that he is not fit to continue giving testimony this afternoon.  So we -- we'll take the adjournment until Monday morning in this matter.  The Court now rises until Monday morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1549H)
