MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you start the proceedings, please?

BY MR HOOPER:
Q.	And can I please come back to the document that you looked at yesterday, and can I invite you to sign it, if the personal details on that document, being your witness identification document, are correct, as indeed you've agreed already that they are?  So can I invite you to sign that, and put your name at the bottom underneath the affirmation?  

Now, Mr. Witness, from now on, if we touch on anything that may reveal your identity, don't answer the question, and let us know.

Now, you've given us details about yourself in closed session, and it's suffice at the moment to say that you were, and are, an inhabitant of Gikomero commune.  And you were telling us of some events that overtook that commune.  I want to go back, if I may, in the history of events to the days before President Habyarimana was murdered, and I want to ask you what you noticed in the commune in respect of relationships between Tutsi residents and Hutu residents.  That's before April the 6th, of course.  How were things before April the 6th?
A.	I am talking about my area and the place where I worked.  As I saw things, people lived on good terms with each other.  Perhaps there were problems between politicians, but ordinary citizens lived peacefully; they shared everything and worked together.  I hadn't thought that the situation could deteriorate to a genocide.

In short, only political leaders, or leaders of political parties were always at loggerheads; the ordinary citizens were at peace.  
Q.	At that time, were you interested in politics sufficiently to be a member of a party, or to attend any political meetings that may have been held in the area?
A.	I believe I told you yesterday that I liked work.  Even my neighbours know that about me; they know that all I like is my work and I'm not interested in politics or anything that doesn't concern me. 
Q.	Now, as you know, this trial is concerned with the case of Dr. André Rwamakuba.  Did you know him, or know of him and, if so, what was your knowledge and what was your relationship, if any, with him?
A.	I do not know Dr Rwamakuba personally, but his family was very well known.  For example, his older brother, Alphonse Nkubana had a private school called.
ETL.  There was also Kanimba, who was an engineer, but I never personally met him.  But I know his older brother Nkubana, because my children went to the school that he had founded.  

Rwamakuba did not often come to our area.  His elder brother came very often, because he had a school that he had founded there.  I also know his mother. 
Q.	And do you know which part of the commune they came from -- where the family, his mother and father, Rwamakuba's mother and father, where they lived?
A.	I know the secteur where they lived.  They lived in Nduba, but I do not know the name of their cellule. 
Q.	It's been alleged in this case that André Rwamakuba, in the months preceding April the 6th, visited Gikomero commune, and indeed your area, to hold inflammatory meetings, where he exhorted the local community to exterminate the Tutsis.  Did you ever hear of any such meeting?  Did you hear of any such visit or any such speech made by André Rwamakuba?
A.	No, I never heard about any such rally or speech.  Even though I did not attend rallies, when you go to a drinking place or somewhere else, you will hear people talking about it, and I never heard anyone say anything about that. 
Q.	It's been alleged that there was a distribution of weapons; namely machetes, to your side of the commune and that Rwamakuba distributed or bought these machetes.  Have you ever heard of such an allegation; ever hear of local people mentioning such a thing?
A.	No, because no one in our area was expecting the war to break out.  Based on the information I have, nobody discussed this distribution in our area. 
Q.	Now, can we come then to the 6th of April, marked, as we know, by the president's death.  What happened?  How were things in your area?  What did you see yourself; what did you witness yourself in the days that followed?
A.	I think that the president died on the 6th of April.  We heard about it the next morning through an announcement on the radio asking the public to stay at home, which is what we did.  But since there are people who will always disobey, a few people moved about, but between the 6th, the 7th and the 8th, everything was quiet in our area.  We could see that there was no problem there.  I'm referring to the 6th and the 7th. 
Q.	After that, were there any particular events that you --
A.	(Microphones overlapping)  After those dates there were rumours.  People began to suspect each other.  I think this is due to a brigadier who lived in Kibenga cellule.  He lived right next to the refugees who had come from Byumba.  He began to sow discord amongst these refugees.  
Q.	And can you give us his name, please --
A.	But among the people who lived in the area there were no problems.  He was called Michel Nyarwaya. 
Q.	And when you refer to people from Byumba, how long had those people been living in the camps that you refer to?
A.	They'd been there for a long time.  You see, the war started in 1990, so they had come from Kivuye.  I think these refugees arrived at around 1992 when there was an influx of refugees from the north.  I do not remember the exact date on which they arrived, but I think it was in 1992. 
Q.	And displaced persons on your side, the eastern side of the commune, you referred to a camp.  Where was the camp or camps on your side of the commune?
A.	You're referring to the north-east of my commune?  I think there was another refugee camp in Kayanga. 
Q.	All right.  So just looking at what I call the eastern side of the commune, the side of the commune that overlooks or runs along Lake Muhazi, that is, the line of land between Gikomero secteur and Gasabo, approximately how many camps --
A.	Yes, that is where the refugee camp was. 
Q.	So where along that plateau there, or along that hill there was the camp, or if there were more than one camp, where were they, approximately; in which cellule?
A.	Are you referring to a hill?  Apart from the refugees of Kibenga, there was another camp that was located east of the hill and this is a camp that was located on the mountain above Lake Muhazi.  It was at the summit of a hill.  That was close to Lake Muhazi, and that is the only camp that I was aware of in that area, and that was therefore the Kayanga camp. 
Q.	Sorry, I didn't mean to confuse you with talk of hills and the like, but how many -- approximately how many displaced people were there in this camp, approximately?
A.	There were very many of them.  I did not make a census of them, but there were more than 1,000 war-displaced persons there.  There were very many tents that were set up on that hill. 
Q.	So you're telling us that from the 8th or 9th onwards problems were created, you thought, by Brigadier Nyarwaya.  And what happened?
A.	Maybe we should begin with events of the 8th and 9th.  When they got to a drinking spot or a bar, it was in the afternoon.  He was in the company of a group of refugees whose names I do not know.  He thought -- he fired a shot in the air, and told the population, "You don't know what war is."  Then he started compelling people to carry out killings and, as I said before, the people in my area were not concerned with the killings.  So when he shot in the air, we became scared.  We were in the Ndatemwa trading centre; we had gone there to have a drink.  From that date onwards the population became afraid, because it was very rare for the population to hear a gunshot.

Thence forward, that is, from that date onwards, the population never left their homes 
Q.	Do you know where it was that the first Tutsis were killed in your area?
A.	In my own area, ********************, that is, adjoining Gasabo and Ndatemwa centres, no Tutsis was killed apart from the Kibenga cellule where the environment was rather bad -- the environment that was created by the brigadier.  That is where there was unrest or trouble.  As a matter of fact, those are two neighbouring cellules, but when you stand in front of my house, you can see what is happening in the other cellule away from our home.  That is where, on the 13th, trouble began in that neighbouring cellule.

By the way, I think that it was on that date that people of that cellule began being killed 
Q.	And what happened to you in these days?
A.	On the 13th, at about 5 p.m., a child left that neighbouring cellule.  He went up to a sorghum field and arrived at my house.  We welcomed him and asked him about news of his cellule, and he told us all that was happening there.  He gave us the names of certain refugees who had come from the north, and who had started trouble there.

He also gave us Nyarwaya's name and who, by the way, had trained people in the use of grenades.  So that's what happened on the 13th.

On the 14th, at dawn, that is, at about 5 a.m. --
Q.	Sorry, can I just interrupt you, Mr. Witness?  I just want to stay on the 13th, just for a moment.  The boy who came to your home -- made his way to your home from Kibenga cellule, what was his name?  Are you happy to tell us?
A.	His name was Adelite (phonetic) Ndalifite. 
Q.	That's N-D-A-L-I-F-I-T-E -- Ndalifite.  I'm spelling it, I hope correctly, for the stenographers.

Was this young boy, as far as you know -- what ethnic group would you say he belonged to?
A.	He was Tutsi. 
Q.	And after that boy came and told you these things, where did that boy go, if anywhere?
A.	He went nowhere.  He remained with us at home. 
Q.	Now, before I interrupted you, you were moving from those events of the 13th, to the 14th of April.  And you were telling us early in the morning, so can you pick up your story?
A.	Very early in the morning, after 5 a.m., my children went to fetch water and, when they came back, they asked us to get up because the Inkotanyi had just attacked, had just launched an attack.  So we got up and fled, because we had just realised that the war had reached our area. 
Q.	And where -- and did you go anywhere?
A.	We went with the intention of going to the communal office, but we got further down; that is in the valley.  We were told that the Inkotanyi had already reached the communal -- the bureau communal, the communal office.  So we went to the valley that is between Gishaka and Kayanga and our area, and we went through that valley towards Kayanga, which is found in Gikomero.  We spent the night at Kayanga itself, that is, in the valley. 
Q.	We have in fact a sketch plan of the area.  And I don't need to provide you with it, but we can see what's indicated as the valley between Kayanga and Gishaka, which is the western side of Kayanga.  And you've told us how you went in that direction and were on that side of Kayanga.

Now, who were you with?
A.	There were very many of us, but each person attended to their family. 
Q.	You and your family, can you just number them for us?  Was your wife with you, and children?
A.	I was with my wife and children, so there were five of us.  We had a domestic servant and that child, Ndalifite.  There was another Tutsi boy who had come from Rutongo whose name was Murekezi (phonetic).  He had come earlier on, because people from Rutongo had come, well, earlier, around the 8th, and that is when the refugees from Rutongo got to our place. 
Q.	And so with you, your family, making five of you, a domestic servant and two Tutsi --
A.	No, there were six of us family members -- that is, if I add myself to my family, there were six of us as a family. 
Q.	You, your wife and four children; would that be correct?
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	A domestic servant and two Tutsi boys?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And on the 14th, having fled your home and gone in the direction you've indicated, what happened?  Where did you spend the night?
A.	We spent the night in the valley in somebody's house who was living there and who hadn't fled. 
Q.	Were there any killings in -- where you were there in Kayanga?
A.	At that location where we were housed, there were no killings.  We had been housed by a Tutsi widow, and if there had been killings in the area we would have been aware of that.  I would like to add that the husband of that lady was Hutu. 
Q.	And how long did you spend there?
A.	We spent the night there and stayed there for about four days.  There were very many of us, and I thought that this would bring her problems, especially as she herself had quite a sizeable family.  So one morning I told my domestic servant to accompany me and we left with our livestock and got to the valley.  We went to the valley with our livestock up to where my wife and children were.  I therefore told my servant that we should go and look for food for ourselves, because we were making things hard for the lady who had housed us. 
Q.	And where did you --
A.	We did not take the road that we had taken to get there, but we went by a different road and we moved towards the main road. 
Q.	And what happened?
A.	When we reached the main road, which was very close to the Kayanga school, there was a roadblock there. 
Q.	So just pausing there, you've gone back up towards the centre of Kayanga, would that be right, and arrived at the centre of Kayanga?
A.	We hadn't reached the Kayanga centre yet.  We were still in the Kabarera (phonetic) cellule where that was that roadblock on the main road.  Rather, we were close to the school that was near the Kayanga centre you're referring to. 
Q.	And what happened?
A.	There we found many people.  The brigadier I talked to you about was also there, and so were communal policemen and Interahamwe.  I could recognise one of the Interahamwe, because he was a native of Gikomero.  People who were passing by the roadblock were being asked why they weren't going to fight the Inkotanyi, and that those people were stupid. 
Q.	Do you know what date or day of the week this was?
A.	I remember that we left our home on a Thursday.  I think it was the 14th or the 13th, but that day was a Friday -- maybe it was the 15th.  We left the house on the 14th and what I'm telling you about took place on Friday.  That was the week following the week in which President Habyarimana had died. 
Q.	And what then happened?
A.	There were, therefore -- or he was assaulting people and formed a group of persons of about 500 people and forced these people to go and fight the Inkotanyi.  There was Inkotanyi who had come from Gasabo and Rutongo, but they hadn't reached Kayanga yet.  He therefore compelled, forced those people to go and fight against the Inkotanyi, but the cellule were not even armed and when they got to the health centre, the refugees in the camp I mentioned joined the group of people who were going to fight Inkotanyi.

He was even hitting certain people and that person, someone told him, "How are you going to fight Inkotanyi whereas there are other Inkotanyi that you left somewhere above, or you've left behind further up?"  And he asked them, "Where are they?"  The answer given to him was as follows, "There are also some of them at the dispensary."  He therefore went up with his group of policemen, and there they found a doctor -- I don't know if he -- it was his shift.  I don't know if he spent some time at the dispensary, but he was asked if there were Tutsis at the dispensary and he answered, "Yes." 

Those people were hospitalised and they were asked to get out of the dispensary and there were many of them. 
Q.	Now, you've mentioned Nyarwaya.  Was there anybody else --
A.	(No interpretation).
Q.	-- in this group that went to the dispensary that you knew and, if so, can you name --
A.	I told you that Nyarwaya was a brigadier and he had a group that he was heading.  There were people who accompanied him wherever he went.  I remember in particular a policeman whose name was Kayibanda, but I can't recall his first name.  There was a certain Ngarambe, who was also a policeman and whose first name I can't remember, either.  There was another young man who wasn't a policeman, whose name was Ngiruwonsanga.  He usually carried grenades and a bludgeon or club.  I don't know where he got the weapons.  I'm not a native of that area.  I do not know everybody there, but there was a group of many people. 
Q.	All right.  So the names you gave us there were Nyarwaya that we know,  Kayibanda,  Ngarambe, and Ngiruwonsanga.  And so what happened then?
A.	They caused the people to come out and the people were scared and he began to threaten people.  He fired a shot in the air, and this scared people to the extent that some of them started running.  I'm one of those who were running away, moving towards the school, so we backtracked and, when we got to the school, we stayed there for some time. 
Q.	Did you yourself witness, with your own eyes, what happened to the Tutsis who were taken from the centre?  Is that something you saw, or not?
A.	What I was able to see was that they were being kicked about, and that they were being dragged on the floor when they were being brought out of the health centre.  That is what I personally saw before leaving the centre.  So I saw people being kicked, people being slapped, people, you know, being booted.  That is what I saw before he fired a shot in the air and before we took flight. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to those people?
A.	When he fired a shot in the air, we went to the school and stayed there for about five minutes.  So we remained there.  My domestic servant on the spot remained at the health centre and I saw him arriving where I was, by chance.  He was with other young persons that I didn't know, and I asked him what had happened to those who were at the health centre, because I had recognised children from the neighbouring cellule, from the cellule that was neighbouring to my cellule.  These are people who had been hit before at the Ndatemwa centre and they had been taken to the hospital.

So when I asked my domestic servant what had befallen the children that I knew, his answer was that they had been taken to the other side of the road. 
Q.	Are you all right?
A.	So we were unable to go and look for victuals or food supplies, as we had earlier intended, because that brigadier stopped us from continuing on our way.  I sent a message to my wife, because I had other fields in the Gikomero commune and those fields were attended to by people working for me.  So I asked my servant, or I told my servant that we had to go to where I had fields, with the hope that probably my wife would be joining us there subsequently.  That was in the evening.  So we spent the night where I had fields.  
Q.	Again, I'm sorry just interrupting you, just for a moment, your servant told you that they had been taken over to the other side of the road.  Do you know what happened to them there, those people?
A.	I don't know what became of them, but later on we asked about the children and that when they had been taken to the other side of the road, when they were taken to the other side of the road there was a hole, a latrine that had been dug at that place.  In the preceding days owners of restaurants had been asked to build latrines, so someone had dug a latrine hole, but it was not yet covered.  The hole could be seen from the road.  I knew this latrine, *******************************, so the latrine had not been covered as yet.

When we were in the refugee camp, we learned that the children had been thrown into that latrine and that other people had been thrown in there as well. 
Q.	Were they killed before they were thrown in, or were they just thrown into it?
A.	When I saw them, they were being kicked, slapped, stepped on.  I got the feeling that they were about to die when I left, and when he fired into the air I fled. 
Q.	And how deep would this pit or latrine pit have been?
A.	A latrine had to be at least eight metres deep.  Those were the instructions given by hygiene and sanitation workers.  They said that a latrine had to be at least eight metres deep. 
Q.	Now, let's go back -- this is, you think, the Friday, the 15th of April, and you've decided, you told us a moment ago, to go with your wife, and I presume the others, to your fields in Gikomero -- that is, Gikomero secteur; is that right?
A.	Yes, Gikomero secteur.  But I would like to explain something to you.  That day I didn't go with my wife.  I sent her a message where she was.  I thought that she would come and join us, so I did not go with my wife, because she didn't come to meet me.  I only went with my domestic servant on the 15th of April. 
Q.	My misunderstanding.  When, if ever, did your wife join you?
A.	That's what I was about to tell you.  So the next morning I went to fetch my wife to tell her that she should come and join me at the place where I had farms.  These farms were looked after by someone who had been working for me 10 years or so.  So I went with the servant to fetch my wife, and my wife went then to this place where I had farms.

After that we went to the place where I had left four days hence, or four days ago, four days previously, so that is where we went. 
Q.	So where do you spend your time after that?
A.	So I went to get my wife, my children, and the two boys about whom I've told you, and immediately left with my wife for Gikomero.  I did not want to put the lives of these two children in danger.  That is why I asked them to leave immediately.  We had sweet potato, we had banana on the farm, but we did not have beans.

So after the four days we said goodbye to the woman who had given us shelter, and I set off again with my servant to go and get beans at the place where we lived.  And we stayed there until the Inkotanyi arrived. 
Q.	And when was that; when did the Inkotanyi arrive there?
A.	I do not remember the exact date, but it was between the 10th and the 20th of May. 
Q.	And when the Inkotanyi arrived there, where did you go, if anywhere?
A.	When the Inkotanyi arrived, we fled.  We went in different directions.  I went down towards Murambi, I went past through Kibuye.  I also went through Rushyantobo, and I was with my two daughters.  I was with my two daughters.  The other children were with my wife.  My wife was also with the two boys about whom I've told you.  In Rushyantobo I was with many other people.  The Inkotanyi found us there.  We were in a coffee farm and we were drinking banana wine.

The Inkotanyi gathered us in a meeting.  After that they told us that they were going to take us to a camp.  They did not tell us the name of the camp.  Afterwards they took us to this Karama camp. 
Q.	If I can just interrupt you there, I think you told us yesterday, when in fact we started your history of events at Karama camp, that in fact the RPF, the Inkotanyi soldiers there, treated you well, or as well as you'd expect; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is true.  When they found us drinking banana beer, they might well have killed us, but they didn't.  They took us to a camp and they set us up there.  We were amongst the first to be installed in the camp. 
Q.	And then later you learned of what had befallen your wife, son and daughter, and I don't go back over that.
A.	Yes, I heard the bad news afterwards.  It is people who went to our area who told me, as I told you yesterday.  Actually, the Inkotanyi didn't trust people who stayed back in their homes.  The Inkotanyi did not move about alone; they moved about with our neighbours, so at one point some people came to the camp and told me that my wife had been killed three days previously. 
Q.	Now, in respect of the events in your area, in your commune, since that time have you discussed those events with people?  Have you participated in Gacaca, for example?
A.	*******************.  We meet in our area every *************. 
Q.	Now, leaving aside Gacaca for a moment, in the 11 years since, have you ever heard of it being alleged that André Rwamakuba came to your area during the war, during the genocide, to incite the Hutus to kill the Tutsis and to participate in killing in Gikomero secteur and Kayanga health centre; have you ever heard such a thing?
A.	You're talking about the period before the Gacaca court started operating -- 
Q.	Yes.
A.	-- or after the beginning of Gacaca sessions?  
Q.	Before the Gacaca court, did you ever hear any such allegation?
A.	Look, when we met, we would talk amongst us about everything, either before or after the beginning of Gacaca courts between Tutsis or Hutus.  People talk, and they might say, "Such-and-such a person committed this or that crime."  But be it a Hutu or Tutsi who committed a crime, we talk about it.  But, to date, I have never heard anyone say that Rwamakuba committed any crime in our area. 
Q.	I'm going to hand you now, before I conclude my questions of you -- this is the last matter I'm going to ask you about -- I want to show you a list on which appears 10 names and which is the list which other parties in this court have.  It's been distributed to everyone, including the booths, I'm glad to say.

And I think that the Judges have one with further details on it.  Now, you've had the opportunity, because I've provided this list to you when I met you last week and invited you to look at the names on it, so it's not a document that's strange to you or new to you.  But running your eyes down the list of names there, is there anyone on that list who you don't know, and if there is, can you indicate it not by the person's name, but by the number that is on -- in the first column?
A.	I know all the people who appear on the list. 
Q.	Then let's go through them starting, logically of course, with the first one.  And others might ask you more general questions.  I'm going to ask you specific questions about these people.  I want to ask you this in respect of No. 1.  To your knowledge, did he participate in the killings of Hutus after the arrival of the Inkotanyi?
A.	What I can say about No. 1 is only the truth.  I think No. 1 was a gendarme or a soldier under Habyarimana's regime.  As I told you, with the advent of multi-partyism or before multi-party politics, everybody was a member of MRND.  So this person, insofar -- this person who taught Interahamwe how to use weapons and so forth in the Kayanga region, so this is the person who trained Interahamwe, even if he was a Tutsi.  Of course, he had to abandon his job when the Interahamwe came.  He collaborated **********************************, so that both of them would help train the Interahamwe.

******************** near the commune; I am not lying.  He became involved in looting, in killing.  He seized other people's property.  For example, before the war, there was a wish to extend the school.  He seized the bricks that were supposed to be used for this, and took them to his home.  He seized people's land by force.  So he committed all these crimes.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I know that further details will be required on all the lists -- on the entire lists, and I would like to know whether precise information or documentation would be available regarding all that the witness is saying here now.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, that's my information -- jotted notes, which I don't think would be much help, but these are matters that were put to certain persons at another time, and these notes are not disclosable, because they are my own personal note.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can I move to No. 2 on the list?  And, again, in a nutshell and not at length, do you know that person and what can you speak of him?
A.	I know No. 2.  He -- I know him in Ndatemwa.  He lives near the centre.  I would say that this is a person of integrity, but when you see him, you see that he's modest.  He's not very talkative, but he might tell lies, because there is one Rutabagirwa who could force him to tell lies.  Generally, however, this is a person of modesty and integrity, but the problem is Rutabagirwa who does much damage around that area. 
Q.	Thank you.  And No. 3, do you know that person?  What can you speak of him?
A.	I don't wish to tie with this, but I would like to say that No. 3 and No. 6 should be put together.  Now, regarding Nos. 3 and 6, they're brothers.  Of course, they are Tutsis.  These are people who never tell the truth.  These are uneducated persons; they've never been to school; and they go with the flow.  So they do everything that Rutabagirwa tells them to do. 
Q.	Do you know if they did any --
A.	So I've told you about No. 3 and No. 6.  I would like you to look at your list again.  Look at No. 4 and No. 5, for instance.  They're also brothers.  ***********************************.  Actually, ********************************************************************************************.  Rutabagirwa's brother is called (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  He's *******************************************. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, the witness mentioned two names there, Mr. President.
MR. HOOPER:
Just a pause.  Just a pause. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters have complained that they did not get something the witness said a bit earlier.
MR. HOOPER:
I didn't know that, but they just mentioned a name that the witness mentioned that was a name that had been placed on the list, and I had asked -- I ask that that be redacted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, I misheard that.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask that the name (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) be struck from what I've just said and from the list.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the order is made.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Of course, we heard that name in the context you told us about earlier.  I'm sorry, I may have interrupted you there.  You were telling us that No. 4 and No. 5 were related -- brothers, I think, and ********************************* a man called Rutabagirwa.  Do you know if either one of those brothers played any part in the events in your area during the war?
A.	Generally speaking, except for No. 5, even though he's the brother of No. 4 -- well, No. 4 was still very young at the time, I do not have much to say about him.  But No. 5 took part in killing people, arbitrary arrests of people, and in looting.  He caused people to be thrown into prison in an arbitrary manner.  That is all I can say about No. 5.  Do you wish me to proceed?
Q.	Yes.  Can you go to No. 8 and what do you know of No. 8?  Just pause there, Mr. Witness, because we have a break -- 
A.	You want us to skip No. 7, please?  
Q.	No, we'll come back to No. 7.  Thank you for reminding me.  But can we do that after the break.  We're going to have a break in a moment.  And this is the usual time we have it.  I'm sorry to interrupt you now.  We'll pick up from No. 7 when we come back.  Thank you, Mr. Witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper is quite right.  We will take a short recess now.
(Court recessed at 1032H)
(Pages 4 to 15 by Maureen Dunn)























(Court resumed at 1107H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can now resume, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, we were just coming to No. 7 on the list, and that's someone you've indicated is known to you.  How do you know that person?  When you say "know", do you mean know of or know personally? 	
A.	Yes, as concerns No. 7, he lives quite close to my landed property at Gikomero.  This is the property on which I don't live.  He's, therefore, in custody.  What I can say of him (sic) is that he (sic) may be somebody who does not speak the truth.  This is a person who caused members of her husband's family to disappear, including her husband himself.  After having caused her husband to disappear, she caused her father-in-law and brother-in-law to be put in prison.  From my reckoning, that person is not in a position to be called as a witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to raise an objection here.  Well, obviously, the witness has the right to give information on what he knows of the person, but he is not entitled to give an expert opinion, say as a psychoanalyst or psychologist, so I don't think that it is up to him to make any judgement concerning witnesses, even if he has information that he knows and that he is willing to give in respect of the other witnesses. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well -- excuse me, Mr. Witness, sorry.  Could you take your earphones off just for a moment, while we deal with -- I want you to take your earphones off, Mr. Witness, just for a moment, just while we're dealing with this technical point.  

Well, I submit that the evidence that's being adduced at the moment is admissible evidence and it would be ultimately for the Tribunal to attach such weight to it as it thinks appropriate.  In my own jurisdiction where the rules of evidence are far more restrictive than they are here, questions that go to general reputation are permissible, and these are questions that go to general reputation, as well as credibility, of course.  
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honour.  May it please Your Honour, my learned leader has given permission for me to offer a thought.  Mr. Hooper has mentioned that in his own jurisdiction, which Your Honour knows I share, that questions going to general reputation are admissible.  Well, I'm afraid they're not, except in very restricted circumstances, and it would be unfortunate if the Trial Chamber were to proceed on the understanding that questions relating to general reputation are generally permissible in England.  I'm not sure whether that's going to make any difference to Your Honours' considerations, but I just don't want there to be a misunderstanding about what goes on in England.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We allow the question; however, not on the ground of what happens in England.  My colleagues have asked me not to give a lecture on the procedure in either Sweden or Burkina Faso, which also have rules which are appropriate to matters of this nature. 
MR. HOOPER:
We're very well aware of them, too, on this side of the courtroom.  We've now alerted a keen interest on the part of Professor O'Shea.  You've set him off, I'm afraid.  But there we are.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I can continue to ask you questions on that, and you were telling us about Witness 7, and I think I can move from her to No. 8.  And, again, is that someone you know, No. 8? 
A.	I personally know that person.  (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal)  After the war -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, the witness mentioned the position that the person used to hold, Mr. President.  The witness has also said that (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Isn't that sufficient, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  So we can redact the -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, redact that which indicates the witness.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In respect of No. 8, do you know whether or not he participated in any wrongdoing during the events? 
A.	During the genocide, in conjunction with No. 1, they wanted to enrich themselves forcefully.  They appropriated the livestock of other persons, and when the owners of the livestock sought to file complaints, they threatened them.  If you allow me, I can give you some examples. 
Q.	I'm not going to trouble you with examples.  No. 9, do you know that person and, in particular, do you know if he participated in the events during the war? 
A.	As concerns No. 9 and No. 10, by the way, because they are brothers, what I can say of those two persons is that they are different, even though they're brothers.  Regarding No. 9, he's being accused and people have always said he didn't behave well during the war.  Although he is a brother to No. 10, the No. 9 has a bad reputation, in the sense that he did not carry himself well during the war. 
Q.	Do you know if he participated in killings, or not? 
A.	I have told you that when we are together, we discuss what happened.  He was in the Butare camp.  Even if I was in that camp, people say that he caused people who were in the same camp as himself to disappear. 
Q.	And, finally, No. 10, who you've described already as the brother of No. 9, do you know - 
A.	Yes, they are brothers, but they're different in character and even their way of thinking is different. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about Gacaca, of which we've become familiar in this Chamber, certain aspects of it.  Do you attend Gacaca?  If so, for how long, and where?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, at this stage I would like to ask if there is information arising from statements made by the witness concerning Gacaca hearings, because we haven't been informed of any statement that he might have made on that subject. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, what he told me recently, I retain in my head.  I have no note. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, yesterday when the issue was raised I had indicated that we were going to respond to the submissions you made, and we have not yet completely completed our response, but I think I should mention that we think that there are different duties on the Prosecutor and on the Defence in terms of the Rule 66 disclosures.  We think that the Court has certain discretions with regard to managing the extent of the Defence disclosures and we are intending to exercise our prerogative in that regard.  We don't think that the Defence has the same obligations under Rule 66 that the Prosecutor does.  
MR. HOOPER:
By the by on that, can we just say that we thought, in fact, that there was to be a written motion in respect of that, to which we'd respond.  And I only mention that because I know Andreas O'Shea has certain authorities which will assist in a resolution, but we were biding our time, pending the written motion that we were told was going to be submitted in respect of that particular issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Hooper, in fact, we have commenced deliberations on that matter.  We thought that what was said in court yesterday represented an application, and we were in the process of responding to it.  Now, if in fact there's a particular submission that you wish to make, we could allow you to do it, but it should be done within 24 hours. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Would you prefer any submission to be, in our case, in writing, or would you be content for an oral argument to be -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if an oral argument is going to be made, it would have to be limited in time. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
And we could give you time to do it this afternoon because, as I said, we are in the process of our deliberations at the moment. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. O'Shea says 10 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, we'll -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Perhaps at 20 past 12 or quarter past 12, would that be an appropriate moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We need to stop today at 25 past 12. 
MR. HOOPER:
In that case, can I continue, and perhaps we should continue until about five past so that we ensure that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are more interested in getting to the evidence.  We will see. 
MR. HOOPER:
We will raise it a bit later, if we could just be reminded.  Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Witness, in respect of that interruption.  I was asking you about Gacaca and do you attend Gacaca and when, if you do, and where?  Being cautious of course, as to where because I don't want to reveal your identity.  
A.	Yes, I attend Gacaca sessions every **********.  According to the law we begin at 8 o'clock and end at 12 o'clock.  I'm referring to Gacaca sessions in our cellule.  
Q.	All right.  We can remind ourselves of your cellule and your secteur from your witness identification document, so I don't speak it out loud.  And how long have those meetings been going on for? 
A.	I do not remember the month or date, but I know that the Gacaca sessions began at the beginning of this year and that is when the collection of information began in each cellule.  All the members of the population of the cellule came together, in order to collect and put together information.  People exchanged information on the events that took place in 1994, be it concerning looting, killings, or other offences or crimes that were committed during that period.  The jury is availed of a register and all the information collected is recorded in a register.  We have written down the names of people who died.  We've written down the crimes that were committed, so those responsible for recording the information know what they have to enter in the register. 
Q.	Has anyone ever mentioned the name of André Rwamakuba in the course of Gacaca hearings that you've attended, or heard about? 
A.	I have already told you that usually we discuss what happened in our area.  In neighbouring cellules or secteurs, that is Kayanga, Gikomero and Rutongo, what I can tell you is that nobody has mentioned Rwamakuba's name.  In my cellule -- in my cellule in September, or probably in October -- I can't recall whether it was in August, September or October -- and this was at the end of the information-gathering exercise that we got to the stage where information that is collected had to be confirmed, and as part of the confirmation exercise in respect of the information, we heard people mention Rwamakuba, and people were rather astounded or rather surprised, and wondered from where the name Rwamakuba came.  And the president of the Gacaca jury or panel of judges told us that we needed to preserve that information that had just been given because that is how things should be.  
      
So towards the end of September or in early October, that is when I heard mention of the name of Rwamakuba as part of the information-confirmation exercise 
Q.	And do you know who mentioned that name? 
A.	Yes, I know.  I know him.  I am not -- 
Q.	Don't mention the name out loud - 
A.	-- telling any untruths here. 
Q.	Just look at the list that you were given a moment ago. 
A.	The name does not appear on the list.  The person who mentioned Rwamakuba's name in September/October, when the information was being confirmed, is on the list.  That is No. 7.  He did that, along with No. 3, as well as with their younger sister, who was present. 
Q.	Can we just go back to those numbers, please?  Which numbers on the list, please? 
A.	I mentioned No. 7 -- No. 6, No. 3.  That is No. 6, No. 3 and their sister, not No. 7.  
Q.	Three, 6 and their sister.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in what place in Gikomero commune, as far as you can recall, was Rwamakuba's name mentioned?  In reference to what place in Gikomero commune; can you remember? 
A.	I was in my cellule and these people were talking about what had happened in that cellule; that is in respect to the Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	And does Ndatemwa -- is that in your cellule; yes or no, please? 
A.	Ndatemwa is a centre.  This centre covers three cellules:  Gasabo, Rutunga and Kayanga cellules.  So Ndatemwa centre covers three cellules, and you must note that these cellules are all in different secteurs.  
Q.	Can you speak at all of what general reaction there was to this mentioning of Rwamakuba by people at Gacaca?  What was the reaction to that? 
A.	It was observed that people were not pleased.  They wondered who this person was, and the president of the jury ended the discussion and he said that when information is given, it should be taken as such and wait for a trial to be organised to determine whether the information is correct or not.  
Q.	And prior to the mention by 3 and 6 of Rwamakuba in the Gacaca hearing of August, September or early October, prior to then, had you ever heard any mention of him at all by anybody in the context of the events in your commune? 
A.	We were also surprised because this information had not been given during the information-collection phase.  It was given instead when we got to the stage where information was confirmed.  And we thought that with the information-collection stage we had done with information on what exactly had happened in our cellule. 
Q.	Do you believe this allegation made by 3 and 6 to be true, or untrue? 
MS. FALL:
A leading question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's cross-examination and leading questions can be asked, but I was wondering, are you going to be producing the witness in view of his status?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I hope to invoke an honest reply to a question that provides him with clear -- two clear and alternative options.  I can ask him another question, though, inevitably, it will be diminished by the previous one.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But I'll ask you in general terms, if I'm permitted, Mr. Witness:  What is your view of that allegation made by 3 and 6? 
A.	I think No. 3 and No. 6 may have received information that caused them to mention Rwamakuba's name.  It is their right to provide new information in Gacaca sessions.  Perhaps they received information that they didn't have before, and it is their right to reveal such information to Gacaca courts. 
Q.	Has anyone put André Rwamakuba at the Ndatemwa business centre in Gacaca hearings? 
A.	As I have said, the people who live in our area do not know Rwamakuba.  What I can say is that on Radio Rwanda we hear news about the trials in Arusha.  Perhaps there are people who are interested in his trial and who may have provided this information.  His name was only mentioned when his trial in Arusha started; nobody ever said anything about him before that. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And can you wait there for some questions from my friend?  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, under the rules of our Tribunal you now have to be questioned and cross-examined by the lawyer for the Prosecutor.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you will now answer questions from the Prosecutor.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness said, "I understand."  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to request a closed session to start with.  I'd like to put some questions to the witness.  I shan't take long, and I shall try to gather all questions that might reveal his identity so that they can be dealt with in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  For the benefit of the public, do you have an estimate of the duration of this part of your examination?  
MS. FALL:
I think I will be finished in five to ten minutes; less than ten, in any case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We now take a closed session.  For the benefit of the public, we estimate it to be between five to ten minutes.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 23 to 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera) 
(Pages 16 to 22 by Karen Holm)















MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, Your Honour, thank you.  I will keep my promise and keep to ten minutes.  

Essentially, the Prosecutor is asking that Mr. Hooper's personal notes that he takes during proofing sessions be disclosed to the Prosecution.  It is our submission that these are not disclosable.  The basic rule that he would rely upon is Rule 70(A) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which provides that the memoranda or internal notes used for the preparation and investigations are not disclosable.  

We've heard in this Trial Chamber before about the definition of witness statements but, in my respectful submission, that's a separate matter.  There is a distinction, in our submission, between investigators' notes and counsel's notes in proofing sessions.  Investigators' notes, in principle, constitute disclosable witness statements.  I see my learned friend is on his feet. 
MR. MORLEY:
I hesitate to interrupt and, I hope, assist Mr. O'Shea.  The Prosecution's position with regard to disclosure in this argument is not -- I repeat, not -- a request for Mr. Hooper's personal notes as a lawyer conducting an interview.  I recognise that there is a sensitivity associated with the taking of lawyer's notes.  What the argument is about is about how, there having been some sort of interview of the witness, if a matter of significance arises which is going to be relevant to the Tribunal, plainly so, then there should be some form of advance notice given to the Prosecution.  

Now, the Prosecution has a system -- how well it works is a matter for Your Honour to judge -- of producing will-say statements which are not a complete replication of everything that has been noted and scribbled about, but it is a summary, a distillation, of the relevant material that would be of interest to the Tribunal, and therefore to the opposite party as a matter of notice and disclosure.  What our complaint is, is that in respect of the witness we've heard from today, there has been a body of evidence offered to Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues which my learned friends have been aware about which is significant evidence and yet there has been no notice whatsoever that it was going to be given.  And I can summarise that evidence in two sentences.  The witness has given evidence about the absence of evidence at Gacaca proceedings which the witness says he attended regularly, and secondly, the witness has suggested that names 3 and 6 on Your Honour's helpful list of names are liars who offered the name Rwamakuba, to the general disbelief of the local population.  

Now, Your Honour may feel that that is relevant material.  It is interesting material.  It goes to the heart of what Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues are trying, and the concern on the part of the Prosecution is we've had no notice of it.  We could have been given notice in the form of the two sentences which I've just uttered to Your Honour.  We're not asking for the lawyer's notes; we're asking for a short note, a distillation, of what is relevant and coming.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, I'm grateful to Mr. Morley for that indication.  He may not be aware that this issue was raised once before and that Your Honours have indicated that you are deliberating on a matter which was raised once before, but I'm grateful for the clarification from the Prosecution that there's no dispute about lawyer's notes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me just clarify that.  Ms. Fall, what Mr. Morley said was slightly different to what had been raised yesterday.  Is the Prosecutor's position now modified to this position?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, after -- we said we held a discussion; we did not indeed say that we -- that all the defence notes be disclosed to us.  All we said was that such notes as mentioned by -- Mr. Morley said should be disclosed to you.  I'm talking about notes that are relevant, that concern questions that were put to the witness and the answers provided.  That's exactly what we said. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's slightly different from what Mr. Morley says.  What Mr. Morley said was that what they ask for is notice of the testimony that is to be given, not the notes taken by the lawyer.  What you have raised suggested that you wanted to see the notes that were taken.  So that was a subtle difference between the two positions.  So if the issue is -- it may very well be from Mr. O'Shea's submission, comment, just now that if the issue is as Mr. Morley suggested, that what you require is notice, it may be that there is no controversy.  I would rather suspect that there would be no controversy if that is what the position is. 
MS. FALL:
Yes.  Yes, Mr. President, I may say that that is our position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  Does that take the controversy out of the issue?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Does it take the controversy out of the issue?  With regard to the lawyer's notes, my understanding is that's not an issue.  Am I correct in saying that?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
That's right.  What the Prosecutor is asking for is notice of what the witness will say, and don't you agree to give that?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, in principle.  I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact that -- and the Trial Chamber has already alluded to this, that there is a qualitative difference between the notice obligations -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, yes, yes.  The Defence is not bound by Rule 66, that's quite clear.  But the Chamber has a discretion -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in ensuring that there's fairness on both sides. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we would be interested -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- in seeing that notice of the testimony of the Defence witnesses -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- is given to the Prosecutor. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, I note that there has already been notice given in relation to the witnesses. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the issue is that what happens when there is additional material which is not already disclosed which comes to your attention subsequently. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And I think that the request that's been raised has to do -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- with such material.
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And does the -- and the question is:  Does the Defence agree -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that notice should be given to the Prosecutor?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, we agree that notice should be given to the Prosecutor.  We do, however, note that the obligations in relation to will-say statements are not quite the same, and I think that Your Honour will accept that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think the Prosecutor -- even the Prosecutor is claiming that.  I would be surprised if they are.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, to the extent that we entirely agree with what is referred to as a notice, if we agree on what is a notice -- I think we can reach an agreement here -- that is, the statements are signed.  So the problem is what we mean by "statement".  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't think that we are going to try to define notice right now.  Well, at the same time, don't you all talk to each other?  I mean, this is such a simple matter, it may very well be that our intervention is not really needed.  
MR. O'SHEA:
In relation to what happened today, I don't think the opportunity has arisen yet, Your Honour, to discuss it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I appreciate that, but you see, look, we have moved forward.  We were, in fact, having -- going to write a decision.  As it turned out, that the way we were proposing to dispose of the matter is entirely consistent with the agreement that has emerged as soon as you all had spoken.  So it may very well be that a lot of this does not need our intervention. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, I think we can take a wait-and-see attitude on this.
MR. MORLEY:
As there is the spirit of cooperation, it seems, reigning at the moment, I wonder if Mr. O'Shea might agree that in respect of the last witness, we really ought to have been given the two-sentence notice that he was going to talk of Gacaca hearings at which Rwamakuba's name was not mentioned and he was going to talk of how the two people who did introduce Rwamakuba were widely regarded as liars and they were widely disbelieved by of the local population. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I don't think it's fair to ask them to agree to that at this stage.  
MR. MORLEY:
I think he's about to agree to it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that we can draw certain inferences, but I don't think that we should put that on the record. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have we resolved the matter at this stage?  Do you still -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, we have.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In that case, could we say that what has been said has been our decision in the matter which you raised yesterday, Ms. Fall?  You don't require a written -- anything further from the Bench?  
MR. O'SHEA:
I would suggest no decision, Your Honour, at this stage. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't want to have a pending motion, you see.  We would like to have this matter closed now and basically, as far as I understand, that the result of the Prosecutor's application is that we have denied the motion for the production of Defence notes of interviews, and that in the exercise of our discretion and with the consent of the parties, that the Defence will provide notice of information that they have concerning what the witness will say in evidence.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we can take our adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning.  Yes, we take the adjournment now.
