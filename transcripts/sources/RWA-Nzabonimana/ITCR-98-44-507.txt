MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 29th of September 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

The appearances are the same. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everyone.  My colleague, Frédéric Weyl, is absent this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Before you begin your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now assist you to do that.
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.

Witness, kindly stand up.  Raise your right hand.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
He speaks neither French nor English.  He speaks Kinyarwanda.
(Declaration made by André Nzabanterura in Kinyarwanda) 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by Counsel Hounkpatin on behalf of Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
THE WITNESS:
I understand. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everyone.  I wish to inform the Chamber that this witness would like to testify in his own name.  

And, Mr. President, I would wish you to confirm that with him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, at the request of the Defence, the Chamber made an order for your protection, one element of which was that your identity should not be revealed to the public.  Defence counsel has been informing me that protection is not necessary, and I'd be grateful for your confirmation of that fact and that you're willing to testify publicly. 
THE WITNESS:
Since I have come here to tell the truth the way it is known by all Rwandans who followed events in Rwanda, I think it is normal that I testify in public so that those who knew what happened in Rwanda can also follow my account. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The order -- have you testified in any other cases at the Tribunal before?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  This -- this is the first time I'm testifying in this Tribunal. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We make the order rescinding the protection order we made in your favour. 
ANDRÉ NZABANTERURA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Nzabanterura, before I begin with my questions, there are a few rules we need observe so as to ensure the efficient -- to ensure that our work is done efficiently.  You speak Kinyarwanda, and I speak French.  There are in this courtroom people who speak only English.  So there are three levels of translation.  So after my question I will pause.  And you also pause before you start answering my question.  This will avoid overlaps.  And then you speak slowly.  Do you understand me? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Witness, please tell the Court what was the political regime in place in Rwanda in 1994 (sic).  
A.	Prior to 1991 there was a one-party system.  And after 1991 mult -- the multiparty system was approved. 
Q.	From 1991 there were several political parties.  Are you able to mention some of them? 
A.	Among the many political parties that were established, there was the new MRND, the MDR, which was also known -- at the time it was renewed.  There was the PSD, PL, and PDC. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you, in particular, join any political party?  And if yes, which one? 
A.	I joined the -- the new MRND, which, in fact, was my party previously.  Since I realised that the MRND had brought development to the country, I thought it was proper to -- to stay there. 
Q.	To your knowledge, what were the objectives of the MRND?  Can you -- can you tell the Chamber.  
A.	The new -- the motto of the new MRND was peace, justice, and development.  
Q.	And as a member of the MRND, did you observe that these principles were implemented? 
A.	Yes.  Because in our country we were independent, the economic power was quite interesting within the context of the time.  
Q.	Prior to the multiparty system, when the party -- when the country was under the rule of MRND as a one-party system, did you have political responsibilities? 
A.	Before the advent of the multiparty system, I was a member of cellule and that since 1973.  And up until when the multiparty system was accepted, I was still a member of -- membre de cellule. 
Q.	And after the multiparty system, did you have some functions? 
A.	With the advent of the multiparty system, one Isaac Nkubito, who had been appointed as 
	MRND responsable in the Kacyikiro (sic) commune with Conseiller Zacharie of Kacyiro (sic), requested me to represent MRND in the Rugando cellule.  Since I liked the MRND and I had served the MRND previously, I accepted to represented (sic) the MRND party in the Rugando cellule. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Chamber if there was an election for this position that you are referring to and if, apart from you, there were other candidates?
A.	First, there was a transitional period.  But in 1992 the MRND president in Kacyiru organised elections in all secteurs of the Kacyiru commune.  But I cannot recall the exact dates.  

All local residents met in the secteur -- bureau des secteurs to elect les membres de cellule, the cellule members.  Since three persons were to be elected for each cellule, I was elected together with one ************and François Muberuka.  

And the three persons who were elected met to elect the president.  I was elected president or chairman.  And Muberaka (sic) was appointed secretary, and *********was elected *************** in the **************** cellule.  

I don't know what happened in other cellules.  But I know that at that time there were elections in all the cellules.  And in the Kacyiru, Gisozi, Kagugu, and Remera secteurs, the same elections were organised.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth, the interpreters would like counsel to advise witness to speak slowly and particularly when it comes to names. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, the booth has requested that you ask the witness to speak slowly, particularly when he's mentioning names. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Nzabanterura, you heard what the booth said.  Please speak slowly, particularly when it comes to names.  Do we agree? 
A.	Yes.  I understand you.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Before we continue, I would like to spell some names that have just been mentioned very fast.  In fact, Rugando, R-U-J-A-N-D-O (sic).  Nkubito, N-K-U-D-B-I-T-O (sic).  Zakaliya, Z-A-K-A-L-I-Y-A.  ******** **************.  Muberuka, M-U-B-E-R-U-K-A.  Kacyiru, K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  Gisozi, G-I-S-O-Z-I.  Kagugu, K-A-G-U-G-U.  Remera, R-E-M-E-R-A.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, please tell the Chamber what are the functions of the MRND cellule chairman.  What were your functions? 
A.	In a cellule my duty was to sensitise members of MRND to like the party and to sensitise people who were not members of the MRND for them to join the party by telling them all the good that the MRND has done for the country and the level of development of the country due to MRND activities.  
Q.	Are you able to tell the Chamber approximately how many people were living in the 
	Rugando commune (sic)? 
A.	In that cellule, in the Rugando cellule, there were between 500 and 700 persons. 
Q.	And are you also able to say if in the Rugando cellule -- or let me put it this way:  Which was the majority party in the Rugando cellule? 
A.	The party that had the largest number of members in Rugando cellule was the MRND, followed by the MDR. 
Q.	And are you also able to say if, among the members of the MRND, there were members from all origins:  Hutu, Tutsi, Twa, people with mixed parentage? 
A.	In the Rugando cellule there were ris -- residents from all the ethnic group -- from Hutu, Tutsi ethnic groups.  But there were no Twas.  And there were residents from other parts of Rwanda, natives of other parts of Rwanda.  But among the local residents, there were only Hutus and Tutsis.  There were no Twas.  
Q.	In the MRND party the -- was the membership just as varied? 
A.	Yes.  There were members from various ethnic groups.  In MDR there were Hutus and some Tutsi.  But the majority of the Tutsi were in the MRND.  And there were many Hutus as well.  But in our cellule there were a lot of Tutsis who were members of the MRND party. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Court who the chairman of the MRND was in the Kacyiru commune? 
A.	The president of the MRND in the Kacyiru commune was Isaac Nkubito. 
Q.	How did he become president?  Was he elected?  Was he appointed?  Can you confirm that? 
A.	I don't know under what circumstances he became president of the MRND party.  What we do know is that it is the préfecture authorities who decided that he be president of the MRND at the Kacyiru -- in the Kacyiru commune.  So it was the préfecture bodies of the MRND that took the decision. 
Q.	In your capacity as chairman of the MRND at cellule level, were you answerable to the 
	national secretariat to the presidency, or did you receive instructions from the MRND at the PVK level, that is, at the préfectoral level? 
A.	In general terms instructions did not come from -- in fact, members of the population were organised at the cellule level, and they conveyed their decisions to the communal authorities, who would in turn refer them to the national authorities.  

It would be at préfectoral level meetings that decisions would be taken.  And at such meetings each commune would table its own decisions that it had arrived at at the cellule level. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to give us the names of the chairmen of the MRND party at the secteur level, if you are aware of such names?  
A.	I do remember the presidents or chairmen of neighbouring secteurs.  In Kimihurura it was Boniface Bagoyi.  In Kakiru (sic) secteur the chairman was -- I have forgotten his name.  His first name was Augustin.  Habinshuti, I think.  Augustin Habinshuti.  Yes.  That must be the name.  

The other secteurs were further away from ours, and I do not know the names of the chairmen of the MRND party in those secteurs. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I will spell out two names.  Bagoyi, B-A-G-O-Y-I.  Boniface Bagoyi.  And Habinshuti, H-A-B-I-N-S-H-U-T-I. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us the names of the cellules in Kimihurura secteur at the time.  
A.	The -- these are the cellules in the secteur:  Rugando -- Rugando cellule, Kimihurura, Rugarama, Kimicanga, and Kamukina cellule. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
We have already spelled out Kimihurura.  Rugarama is spelt R-U-G-A-R-A-M-A.  Kimicanga, K-I-M-I-C-A-N-G-A.  Kamukina, K-A-M-U-K-I-N-A.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, Witness, let us talk about the Interahamwe.  Do you know Désiré Murenzi? 
A.	No.  No.  I don't know that person. 
Q.	Do you know Anastase Gasana? 
A.	I knew Anastase Gasan -- Gasana when he was minister of foreign affairs and member of the MDR party.  But I learnt that previously he had been a member of the MRND party and that when the Interahamwe were being created Anastase Gasana was in charge of that commission, and he was in the company of one **************and one other person whose name I forget.  

They had been promised positions, and Gasana was hoping to be appointed minister.  But when he -- when this did not happen, he left the MRND party and joined the MDR.  And that -- in that case *************was also forced to resign, and he was*********************************************************.  The third person was appointed a secretary at one of the ministries.  So these are the circumstances in which I got to know Gasana, although I never met him. 
Q.	Witness, were you personally involved in the creation of the MRND youth wing, which would later be known as the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  When plans were underway for the creation of the Interahamwe, I was not there, and I'm not aware of the circumstances in which that youth wing was created.  But before then proposals had been made for the creation of the GLMND (sic).  But that group, which was the youth wing of the Interahamwe, became transformed into the Interahamwe by Kajuga.  

And by the way, all political parties had their own youth wings.  So when I was appointed, the Interahamwe were already in existence, and I do not know how they were created. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you attend any meetings of the youth wing of the MRND party? 
A.	We heard an announcement.  And our cellule had a youth wing of the party.  So when a meeting was called of the youth wing of that party, I wanted to attend that meeting.  

So I went to the Technoserve office where the MRND offices were located.  And upon arrival I realised that it was Kajuga, the chairman, who was actually chairing the meeting.  The first vice-president, Phénéas, was also in attendance as well as the second vice-president, whose name was**********, and the treasurer.  Let me cross-check that treasurer's name.  I'm sorry. 
Q.	Well, you're not giving a lecture here, Mr. Witness.  There -- there's no problem if you can't remember that name.  
A.	So we learnt that this was a MRND party meeting and Kajuga was chairing it.  And as I have already said, there was a youth wing already in our Rugando commune.  And so we wanted our youth wing to be recognised within the MRND.  

And that is how I got to attend that meeting.  And it is the only meeting I attended and at which I introduced the youth wing of our party in Rugando commune.  It is the only meeting I attended. 
Q.	What was your impression at that meeting, and who was chairing it? 
A.	It is Kajuga who was chairing that meeting.  And he told us about the -- the objectives of that youth wing -- of the youth wing.  He told us that the objectives of the youth wing were to provide entertainment, animation, and to sing in order to popularise the party.  So the youth wing was supposed to provide songs about the political party, that is, the MRND, and its good works and the benefits accruing to the country because of the MRND -- the MRND new formula.  

So he told us to work mindful of those objectives.  Upon leaving the meeting, we were -- decided to implement what we had just been told. 
Q.	Witness, at the level -- at your level what happened after this meeting?  Did you decide to fully commit and to fully participate in the activities of the youth wing of the MRND and to become a member thereof? 
A.	There was no representative of the Interahamwe in Rugando cellule as such.  Because I owned a vehicle and it was possible for these people to move about without having to pay anything, the Interahamwe then decided that I should be their representative and that I should continue to make sacrifices for the political party as I had always done.  

So I was not elected into that position as may have been the case elsewhere.  I was simply propelled to that position by the youth because I was able to provide them with some assistance and because they felt and they knew that with me it was possible for them to move about without any difficulty and to attend political meetings and rallies without any problems.  So because of those interests, they decided to select me as their chairman. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court at what date or at what point in time these events took place.  Which month of which year? 
A.	All these things happened between July and October 1992.  
Q.	So you became chairman of the Interahamwe in Rugando cellule.  When did that take place?  Was it in July or in October?
A.	It was after the meeting at which I told them that there was need to select a president.  And they simply said that no one else was in a position to provide them with the services that I had been providing.  So they refused to elect anyone else and simply appointed me to that position sometime between July and October.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you started telling the Court your functions and the role that you played for these youth.  In addition to providing transportation for them, did you also, should I say, animate the entertainment fact -- factor or section of these -- of the youth wing?  And how did the whole idea of entertainment and animation unfold within the youth wing at that time? 
A.	Well, at the cellule level the youth wing was expected to compose songs and to rehearse dance moves and what have you.  So whenever we went for meetings, we gave the youth an opportunity to sing.  There were those encouraged to create, innovate, and compose songs.  

And so I made available my vehicle for use by the party.  And in return we received some sound equipment.  So the Inyemeramihigo troupe and the songs of the Interahamwe were performed using this sound system to provide that music and those songs at various rallies at the préfectoral level.  So when it came to political sensitisation, I provided that type of assistance at the préfectoral level. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Two words you have used which I would like to spell out:  Ilindiro, IL -- I-L-I-N-D-I-R-O.  Ilindiro.  And there was another word, Inyemeramihigo, I-N-Y-E-M-E-R-A-M-I-H-I-G-O.  

Did the Interahamwe youth wing include youths from all backgrounds, from all origins?  Can you tell the Court the make-up of the Interahamwe. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me for interrupting, but I've been noticing that the witness has been referring to some notes before him, and no exhibits have been given to him by counsel.  So I'm wondering if he could clarify for us what those are.  And if they're not appropriate, then they should be removed. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have heard the question from the Prosecutor.  What is your answer to that question? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I was looking at notes.  I had jotted down the name of somebody who -- or the person who was involved in the creation of the Interahamwe with Gasana.  So I was looking at this name, because I tend to forget a number of things.  

I had jotted down a few points as I prepared for this testimony, expecting questions that would be put to me.  So I had written down a few notes about the names of some youths of the MRND.  So I -- I was just looking at those notes which do not necessarily relate to the questions that are being put to me. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, that is not authorised.  But maybe we would have to do with your memory problem.  And that is why you have to set aside that question -- that piece of paper and not have to refer to it, Mr. Witness, please.  
A.	Yes.  Thank you.  I will abstain from consulting those notes. 
Q.	Now, Witness, if you have forgotten something -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the circumstances it might be appropriate for him to hand them over to the registrar while he remains in the witness box. 

Mr. Witness, is that the entire note that you've handed to the registry?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should hand all your notes to the registrar, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  These other sheets are blank.  There's nothing on them. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

Now, if you need some notepaper to assist you during your examination, the registrar will give you some paper and a pen, if you need to make notes while questions are being put to you.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay?  

Mr. Registrar, maybe you should just give him a sheet of paper, in any event.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, let me remind you of the question that I had put to you, a very simple question.  Was the Interahamwe at your cellule level made up of members from all ethnic groups? 
A.	In our cellule the Interahamwe was made up of persons from all ethnic groups.  The 18 recognised members of the Interahamwe included nine Tutsis and nine Interahamwe (sic) who could attend the -- all the meetings.  And, in fact, they were very conscientious and could give up all other activities to attend the Interahamwe meetings. 
Q.	Witness, when you talked about the meeting you attended at Technoserve, was Mathieu Ngirumpatse present at that meeting? 
A.	No.  No, not at all.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not there.  In fact, I did not see him. 
Q.	Were there any Interahamwe, as far as you know, at the préfectoral level? 
A.	There was a préfectoral Interahamwe committee.  But the préfecture itself did not have any Interahamwe.  In fact, it was the Interahamwe from the various cellules who would come to meet at the various venues where rallies and such meetings were organised.  

But there were no Interahamwe identified as such to belong to the préfecture.  In fact, it was during meetings when the goals of the party were explained that various Interahamwe would come from various cellules to meet at the préfectoral office. 
Q.	A short while ago I forgot to follow up a question about Mathieu Ngirumpatse with you.  Let me do so now.  At that meeting which you attended, you have already testified that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not present.  My question is, was there any other MRND leader in a -- in attendance at that meeting, as far as you can recall? 
A.	No.  There was no MRND leader in attendance.  And by the way, that meeting was not a MRND meeting as such.  It was a meeting of the youth wing of the MRND.  So no authority of the MRND was present at that meeting. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court whether there were any other youth wings.  And if so, were they created before or after the MRND youth wing?  
A.	From information I was able to obtain, and after I was appointed upon the creation of the MRND youth, I learnt that the PL and the MDR also had their own youth -- and -- and the MDR also had their own youth wings.  So the youth of the MRND were organised in order to represent the interests of their party and to promote the ideals of their party at our level and also to show the world that they also loved their own political party.  

Therefore, the MRND youth wing was created after the creation of the MDR and the PL youth wings.  It was after those two youth wings had been created that the MRND youth wing was formed. 
Q.	Do you know the names of these two youth wings that you've referred to, the youth week of --
	youth wing of the MDR and the PL? 
A.	The MDR youth wing was called JDR.  And the youth wing of the PSD was called Abakombozi and that of PL, JL.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Are you able to tell the Chamber if there were some -- if there was some friction among these various youth wings or rivalry among them?  
A.	Since people were used to the one-party system, the MRND, the other political parties used their youth wings to recruit members of the MRND into their own parties.  Prior to that everybody was used to the MRND.  So the youth wing -- the youth wings were set up to entice members of MRND to join their own parties.  And the MRND formed its own youth wing to maintain their members by telling them that the MRND was the best party. 
Q.	This rival -- rivalry or this method of recruiting members to the detriment of other parties, was it done in a violent manner? 
A.	Some persons went about it the wrong way.  There are some people who had -- who did not have a good upbringing and, therefore, would use violent methods.  But some of the parties tried to rein in these people who -- who haven't been brought up properly.  
Q.	What was the consequence of that?  Were they able to rein them in?  Did the -- did things become more peaceful, or was it still violent? 
A.	Use of songs -- the various political parties used songs to sensitise their members.  And those parties that used those songs -- the situation became calmer.  But there were some people who with -- which -- there were some people who used violence from time to time.  

And the authorities got interested in those various cases and discouraged those young persons.  And the leaders of the political parties also punished these young persons who used violence.  And some of them were dismissed from the parties. 
Q.	More specifically about the Interahamwe of the MRND, were they engaged in some excesses, and were those acts punished by the leadership of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  The leaders of the Interahamwe would punish people who did not observe the rules.  When -- whenever some young persons used the cover of the youth wing to commit acts of violence, the leadership of the Interahamwe would punish them and -- as well as the administrative and judicial authorities did their work.  

Some persons were arrested because of the acts of violence that they had committed.  And people who committed minor acts of violence were reprimanded during rallies.  And discord -- and that discouraged these persons who then accepted not to repeat those acts. 
Q.	Are you able to tell the Chamber if Mathieu Ngirumpatse organised meetings for the Interahamwe in his house? 
A.	He did not organise a meeting for them in his house.  And besides, he has nothing -- he had nothing to do with the MRND youth wing, the Interahamwe.  You meet this youth wing at the regional stadium, at the national stadium in Kigali.  

When there were meetings at the préfectoral level, MRND authorities would come and sensitise the participants to the ideals of the MRND.  And that is when the MRND youth wing would perform.  They would sing, dance, and report on their membership drive for the MRND.  

The MRND authorities would take the opportunity -- or respond to the -- to the young persons to continue the membership drive for the party and ask them not to use violent means because MRND does not accept violence as a method of operation. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Please tell the Chamber if the songs that the Interahamwe youth wing used to sing -- whether there were statements intended to incite to the extermination of the Tutsi.
A.	No, not at all.  Statements intended to encourage people -- to urge people to exterminate the Tutsi did not appear in Interahamwe songs.  If there were such statements in their songs, the Tutsi, who were MRND members and members of the Interahamwe, would have left the Interahamwe and the MRND.  But from what I understood, at least in Kigali town, the Tutsi were majority in the MRND membership, because the Hutu were more members of the MDR, which was presented as the preferred party of the Hutus.

1015H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, a while ago you said that among the youth wing -- the Interahamwe youth wing in your 
	cellule -- there were as many Tutsis as Hutus.  Are you able to give us some Tutsi names, and some Hutu names?  You can use the document that you -- the paper that you received from the registry a while ago to assist you. 
A.	May I request you to repeat your question.
Q.	My question was as follows:  Give the Chamber some names of -- of Tutsi members of the Interahamwe in Rugando. 
A.	Among my Interahamwe there was Rutabingwa, **********, the ******************in my cellule.  He was ************************-- *****************when I was elected chairman.  There's another person, who was fairly elderly, called Sista.  There was Xavier Sebinyavanga, Charles Sendegeya, Félix Ntuyahaga.  

We had eight persons in the Interahamwe committee.  And among the local residents there were Tutsis such as Bisengarurema, and Sebinyavanga, that I referred to earlier on. 

So there were Tutsis who were members of the MRND, who were just waiting for elections to be organised so they can vote for the MRND party. 
Q.	Witness, let's go back to the songs.  There are Prosecution witnesses who came to testify that there was a song that was sang at the beginning and the end of the performances.  

I'm going to -- my pronunciation is not the best, but I think the Kinyarwanda booth will give us the best pronunciation. 

The song was Tuba Tsemba Tsembe.  Can you tell the Chamber what those words mean?  
Tuba Tsemba Tsembe. 
A.	On an occasion there were some bandits who used this song, and we chased them out of the party.  And we told other people who had similar ideas that they had no place in our party, because that was not part of the motto of our party.  This was at the beginning of the multiparty system when people were with -- who people -- not -- who don't have a good upbringing used the opportunity to spread such a message. 
Q.	Witness, I would like you to translate the words I used.  And I have a -- I have a question -- I have a follow-up question, and that's why I want you to translate. 
A.	We -- we also did not understand those words.  And that is why we chased them out of the party.  These were people who wanted to drag our party's name into -- in the mud.  These were not people who were asking us -- who were helping us to recruit more members.  They had come to create confusion by pitting members of our party against the leadership.  
So even we did not understand what they meant.  Our understanding was that these people wanted to create conflict between us and our membership.  But then they understood that we were not -- our membership understood that we were not -- we did not agree with those persons. 

When we corrected the situation by chasing out those persons, the situation came back to normal. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for the -- 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, a Prosecution witness claimed that Kigali town had been divided into three security zones and entrusted to the Interahamwe. 

Did you -- were you entrusted with any mission to ensure security in any part of Kigali? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  These are persons who wanted to drag the party's name in the mud.  

In the country, there are people in charge of security; soldiers, gendarmes.  That was the responsibility of the government, and the MRND had its own responsibilities.  And the MRND youth wing was not involved in security activities.  If any such thing had happened, the government would have taken a decision. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I'm afraid that that is a -- a fire drill.  And we're required to use the security procedures to exit the building as soon as possible. 

The Court is in recess. 
(Court recessed from 1022H to 1111H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Registrar, was there a safe and satisfactory conclusion to the evacuation? 
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Yes, indeed.  And thank you all for your cooperation.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Ms. Hounkpatin, you may continue. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  And I can -- I may even add that we were treated to the rain. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, we will proceed. 

A Prosecution witness claimed that the Interahamwe, the mission of the Interahamwe was to establish a list of Tutsis to be eliminated.  Is that true?  And is that an activity that you undertook? 
A.	Thank you.  We never drew up a list of Tutsis to be killed.  In the cellule, under me, my deputy was a Tutsi.  He was not going to remain a member of the MRND if we had drawn up such a list.  I think those who said that just wanted to discredit our party and the Interahamwe.  That never happened. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you hear that military training was given to the Interahamwe prior to the 
	6th of April 1994? 
A.	I heard that from opposition party members, but those who were saying that just wanted to discredit our party and the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Did you send young persons from your commune in your capacity as a chairman of the Interahamwe? 
A.	To undergo such training, I did not send anyone.  And no official ever request -- requested me to send young persons for training. 
Q.	Prosecution witnesses came to explain -- to tell this Chamber that in the Kabuga building there were -- there were military training sessions. 

My first question is:  Do you know where the MRND offices are located, more specifically, in the Kabuga building.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you give an indication of the location of the building to the Chamber.  Is it located downtown, outskirts of town? 
A.	That building is located in a place call Muhima.  It was built in the middle of other residential houses.  It is not far from the market, and it is called Muhima. 
Q.	Now that you have located the building -- weapon handling training could -- were they able to organise weapon handling training sessions in that building? 
A.	No.  It was not possible.  That building is located in the midst of residential houses and that could not have been done; otherwise, the local population would have complained.  But that never took place. 
Q.	Witness, still about the military training.  Do you know the meaning of Dami -- Dami. 
A.	This is the first time I'm hearing this word. 
Q.	Yet, a Prosecution witness claimed, in this courtroom, that you, in particular, were trained -- that you were trained by soldiers belonging to that detachment, military detachment. 
A.	I don't know anything about that soldier.  I never underwent any military training. 
Q.	Prior to the 6th of April 1994, as was said by the Prosecution witness, did you -- did you hold the title of colonel?
A.	No.  Nobody gave me that nickname.  The youth in our cellule used to call me chairman, but that was not a nickname.  But it's -- it was my position.  I have given you my name and I don't have any other name besides that. 
Q.	I'm going to continue with the same line of questioning. 
Do you know someone called Nshimiye?  N-S-H-I-M-Y-E (sic). 
A.	Yes, I know Nshimiye.  He was the Interahamwe chairman in one of the Kacyiru cellules. 
Q.	And do you know one Emmanuel Segacondo?  S-E-G-A -- 
A.	No, I don't know Segacondo. 
Q.	Thank you.  Let me finish spelling.  S-E-G-A-C-O-N-D-O.  

Do you know one**********************?
A.	I know *************************He was a****************************, and was also *******************of the préfecture -- ************************************* in the préfecture. 
Q.	To the best of your recollections, are you able to tell the Chamber if you met these three persons at a point in time in 1993, and that you took a drink -- you had a drink together? 
A.	No, that never happened.  I did not know Nshimiye previously, and I did not know*************.  I only got to know them within the party.  Besides, ****************************that did not make it possible for me to get close to him. 
Q.	When you say -- you say he held -- he ******************for which -- as a result of which you could not get close to him, does it mean you did not have any opportunity to have a drink with him, or he's not part of your milieu?  I just want to understand.  
A.	We did not have any particular relationship for us to be able to invite each other to have a drink.  He was a*****************************************. 

He was not my friend.  We did not know each other.  And there were no opportunities for us to be able to meet and drink -- have a drink together.  We met within the party context.  And I used to see him when, during party rallies, they give him the floor on account of the *********************at the préfecture level. 
Q.	He, nonetheless, explained to the Chamber that on that occasion when you had a drink with those 
	two persons, you told them that you were coming back from a training session where they taught you how to use military -- how to use military ropes and that -- that you had a training in the utilisation of military ropes, loops.  
A.	I do not know where these people got this information.  I never used any military ropes.  I was an ordinary driver and I never took part in Interahamwe activities.  Some people were saying that the Interahamwe were using those military ropes.  I never had one and I never used it.  This is the first time I'm hearing this.  I never discussed this issue with him. 
Q.	Did you ever hear about military training in Gako? 
A.	No.  I never heard that. 
Q.	Witness, do you know one Sebitabi?  S-E-B-I-T-A-B-I.  
A.	I know one Sebitabi, who was a member of parliament, native of Kibuye. 
Q.	And one Miyaya?  M-I-Y-A-Y-A. 
A.	I don't know Miyaya. 
Q.	Yet, Prosecution witnesses made claims here that these persons were the instructors at the military training of the Interahamwe.  Did you meet them in your capacity as a chairman of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't know them. 
Q.	Witness, you told the Court that in your capacity as chairman of the Interahamwe you attended rallies organised by the MRND party. 

In that capacity of chairman of the Rugando commune, did you attend rallies?  And please tell the Chamber which ones. 
A.	In my capacity as a chairman of the Rugando commune, I had to represent the commune at the préfecture level.  For example, there was a rally at Kiyaya, and that was in 1992.  In 1992 there was another meeting in the secteur.  That was when Nkubito was elected as a -- a leader of the MRND in the Kacyiru secteur. 

There was another rally which took place when we were celebrating democracy day. 
Q.	The rally that took place in '72 (sic), was it at the national level, communal level? 
A.	The 1992 meeting was organised by Nkubito.  He wanted to introduce himself to us because he wanted to -- he had been appointed a member of parliament and he wanted to introduce himself to us at the secteur.  It was not at the communal level, it was at the level of his secteur. 
Q.	Very well.  You also stated that you attended a rally -- you attended a rally in 1993.  Can you tell us about that meeting and are you able to give the date and venue of the rally?  You said it was on democracy day.  
A.	Yes, this rally that was organised on democracy day was organised by Nkubito at the secteur level. 
He invited members of the MRND party to celebrate democracy day and took the opportunity to recall the ideals of MRND and reminded members how to conduct themselves within the party. 

I was invited to that rally to represent my cellule. 
Q.	Do you remember the important personalities who were invited to that meeting?  And if you do, tell the Chamber. 
A.	The truth is that the -- the person invited people living in Kigali.  For example, Mathieu, was invited to the party.  I don't know -- to the rally.  I don't know if he was invited as an -- as a resident of Kigali or a member of the MRND. 

There were also other residents who lived in Kigali. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you remember any other national figure or personality who attended that meeting? 
A.	No, I don't remember any other.  But maybe I did not know all of them at the time, because I was not very, very familiar with the activities of political parties at the time.  But I was able to recognise Mathieu.  All the others persons present were just ordinary citizens. 
Q.	At what time did you notice that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present at that rally? 
A.	I saw him seated.  And also when he took the floor to thank the members of the MRND, he encouraged them to love their party, to avoid divisions, because the MRND was a party of unity, peace, and development.  A party open to all Rwandans, and that all Rwandans should feel comfortable within the MRND as it was a party that welcomed all Rwandans.  He said that the MRND was not a party that stood for ethnic politics. 

In brief, he talked about the party, about the goals of the party, and indicated that it was not a regional or ethnic party, and that all Rwandans were welcome to feel comfortable within the MRND.  That is the context in which I learned about and actually took note of his presence at that rally. 
Q.	Witness, earlier -- Nkubito has told this Court that you arrived early to that rally.  And I'm going to mention the names of other persons who arrived at the same time as you did, that is, early in the meeting, and I would like you to confirm whether such was the case. 

He said that Musirakare, Jean-Népomuscène -- Musirakare, I will spell it.  M-U-S-I-R-A-K-A-R-E.  ********************.  Nkundakozera, Anastase.  Let me spell the surname, N-K-U-N-D-A-K-O-Z-E-R-A. 

Mathieu Ngirumpatse, according to him, also arrived earlier.  And while waiting, he had an open discussion with him and -- that is, between the four of you, he had stated that, "If the RPF resumed hostilities, we will kill Tutsis." 

Now, were you part of that conversation?  Did you hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse say any such thing prior to delivering his official speech which you referred to a short while ago? 
A.	Thank you.  I do not know Musirakare, but I know*****************.  I also know Nkundakozera.  
Now, even if Nkunda were a member of the MRND, I must say that he never attended the MRND rallies.  

Now, as for Nkubito's statement, I -- I think that we must simply note that I noticed Mathieu's presence when he got up to deliver his speech.  I did not have any discussion or conversation with him before or after the rally.  I did not know him very well.  And, by the way, given his rank and position, I had no business discussing anything with him. 
Q.	Witness, apart from that speech delivered by Mathieu Ngirumpatse on the 28th of January 1994, did you hear him deliver any other speech?  
A.	Whenever there was a rally of the MRND at the national level, Mathieu Ngirumpatse always began by thanking members of the party and condemning any acts of division.  He never held or made any statements that would cause division or frighten members of the MRND.  His statements were always words of encouragement and reassurance in which he encouraged members to feel comfortable within the party. 
Q.	Did you hear him call for the elimination of Tutsis and for hatred against the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  He could not have made any such pronouncement.  I think that those thoughts never even crossed his mind, because he is someone who always worked to rally Rwandans together, and he never stood for division among Rwandans. 
Q.	Now, within the MRND itself -- you see, we have been talking so far about your cellule and about your commune.  Now, within the MRND, the party at the national level, were there any Tutsi members of the party at the national level? 
A.	I have not understood your question. 
Q.	What I wanted you to tell the Court is whether the MRND party had Tutsi members at the national level. 
A.	Yes, there were Tutsi members of the party at the national level.  Even if they did not live in Kimihurura, where I was, I still knew a number of Tutsis of the party.  For example, Kabagema, vice-president of the MRND at the national level was Tutsi.  Kajuga, leader of the Interahamwe at the national level was Tutsi.  His first vice-president was also a Tutsi.  And I forget his name, the name of the first vice-president. 

If any misplaced statements had been made, these Tutsis would have had to leave the MRND. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President...(no interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the registrar investigated it.  I think he will just make a brief statement to explain what the position is. 
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Mr. President, it was a false alarm.  They are now resetting the alarm.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

1145H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, I have understood your testimony before this Court.  But let me point out to you that a Prosecution witness has alleged here that Mathieu Ngirumpatse made the same statement.  And contrary to what the previous witness we talked about stated, this particular witness says that Mathieu Ngirumpatse made those statements in your presence, and in the presence of three or four other people, as confidential material which he had received to the extent -- or, whereby Mathieu Ngirumpatse had said that, "If the war were to resume, we would kill the Tutsis."  

As far as you can recall, did you share any such confidential discussion with anybody at any time whatsoever during that meeting relating to the alleged statement by Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	No, those kinds of statements were never made.  I never heard any such statement.  

By the way, after the rally, the attacks resumed in -- in Byumba, for example, where people fled towards Nyacyonga.  Members of the population fled the attacks and fighting was ongoing in Byumba and elsewhere.  But, in other parts of the country, members of the population lived harmoniously.  

But Mathieu could never have said any such thing.  Let me give you some examples:  Militants or members of the MRND who were present at the Gisenyi rally of the MRND -- during that rally, a Tutsi member of the MRND, one of the national leaders of the party gave us 300 francs so that we could hire a vehicle.  And that Tutsi left the leadership of the MRND because of the nature of his -- his work.  So if any such thing were to have been the position of the MRND against the Tutsis, then that Tutsi would simply have left the -- the party.  

I think anybody who made any such allegations was simply aiming at tarnishing the image of the MRND.  No such statements were ever made.  
Q.	Did you say that he gave 300 francs, or was it more?  Maybe there's a translation problem.  
A.	It was 300,000 francs, 300,000 francs.  It was the owner of a factory called Ameki-Color who gave us 300,000 francs.  His name is Rusirare.  I had forgotten it before, but now I remember it, Rusirare.  He was a member of the MRND and vice-president at the préfectoral level.  At some point he said, however, that because of the nature of his business, or his work, he had to leave the leadership of the MRND to become an ordinary member of the party.  

In any event, he gave us 300,000 francs, which enabled us to hire a bus and transport MRND members to the Gisenyi rally.  Now, if Mr. Rusirare had felt that such a statement had been made, he would never have given out that amount of money to transport members to that rally.  Nobody brought any pressure to bear on him to release those 300,000 francs.  He did it as a voluntary personal gesture.  
Q.	Two follow-up questions, Witness:  Can you tell the Court at what time the Gisenyi rally took place?  
A.	The Gisenyi rally was organised in early March 1993, following the fighting that had driven out inhabitants from Byumba to Nyacyonga.  So at that time, if Mathieu had made any such statements at a rally, Mr. Rusirare would thus have been considered as one of those to be tracked down and would therefore not have made such a contribution, given that he would have been considered to be one of the targeted persons.  
Q.	Who did Mr. Rusirare give the 300,000 francs you are referring to?  
A.	He handed the amount of money to me in person.  When he arrived I noticed that there was no vehicle to transport party members to the Gisenyi rally.  He gave me the money so that I could go hire a bus at ONATRACOM, which I did, and that bus transported our members, and I followed in my own vehicle.  

By the way, we arrived when the meeting or the rally had already begun.  
Q.	Now, Witness, let us deal with another phase of your testimony.  And we have been looking at the situation before the 6th of April 1994.  Let us now turn to what transpired after the 6th of April 1994, up until July 1994.  Can you tell the Court where you were on the 6th of April 1994?  
A.	On the 6th of April, at 6 p.m., I was having a drink at a Zairean lady's place.  Her name was Salinga.  I was having a drink at that place.  So at about 10 p.m. I went home to watch the news on television.  I had planned to go to Remera.  So it is when I was getting ready to go to Remera that I heard gunshots at SONATUBE, a place not far away from my home.  I heard a succession of explosions and gunfire.  

We thought initially that some bandits may have been exploding grenades here and there, so that was my first impression.  But I began to wonder, with the people around me, as to what was happening and wondered whether the bandits were now exploding their grenades so -- so early in the evening.  

But within 30 minutes or so I called one of my house servants to take me to Remera.  And then I saw the vehicle of a captain, a gendarmerie captain whose name I forgot -- I have forgotten.  He came to my home and told me the Inkotanyi have launched the attacks.  

Then, very quickly, one Désiré, my neighbour with Captain Haguma stopped at my place in a vehicle.  They asked me if I was aware of what had happened.  And so I said I did not know, and I wondered what had happened.  They told me that the head of state had been killed, that his plane had been brought down.  They asked me whether I had a phone, and I said yes.  So we went into the house.  And the captain had a Motorola transmitter radio, and he was unable to use it but he also used my telephone and the Motorola transmission device to communicate and to find out what was happening.  

Then we heard sustained gun firing near my home.  And I don't know whether it was the Inkotanyi or members of the Presidential Guard who was shooting or who were firing.  
Then later on the gendarme used his Motorola to call the Gikondo brigade, and to tell them that he was not able to move because the Presidential Guard had blocked the road.  So the Gikondo brigade called the Presidential Guard and asked them how their captain would be able to return.  So the Presidential Guard promised to open a corridor through which he would be monitored until he went back.  

So the captain left by road below my house, and he left -- 
Q.	Let me put questions to you, Witness, because you are lumping all the information together.  It might be more efficient to proceed by question and answer.  Is that okay?  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	You said that you went back to your home.  Where was your home located?  
A.	I lived in Rugando, just below the buildings of the Presidential Guard.  
Q.	At about what time did the two gendarmes you referred to come to your house, if you do recall?  
A.	The gendarmes arrived at my home at about 9:30 or 10 p.m.  
Q.	When did they leave your home? 
A.	They left my home at around 11 p.m. when they received confirmation over their Motorola and my phone that the presidential plane had been brought down.  
Q.	When they left your home, did you step out?  Did you go out with them or did you leave after them?  
A.	No, I did not move out of my home; I cancelled my programme.  I did not go anywhere because I no longer felt like going out, because things had changed. 
Q.	That evening of the 6th of April did you gather Interahamwe youths at your residence?  
A.	No, the Interahamwe did not come to my home.  I only had my driver with me, because he is the one with whom I was supposed to go to Remera.  Apart from him, only my children were at home. 
Q.	So you did not go out of your home on the 6th of April.  When did you go to bed?  
A.	It was after 11 p.m. when those who were at my place had left.  
Q.	Did you have any other visitors that evening, or were those the last people to go by your home that evening?  
A.	After those people, no one else came to my house.  After they left I, my children, and my houseworkers, we all went to bed.  
Q.	The next day, on the 7th of April, what did you do?  
A.	The next day in the morning on the 7th of April, well, around 3 a.m. we heard sustained firing and so when we got up in the morning we noticed that many Tutsis and some Hutus had been killed.  We noticed that those who were criticising the party had been killed.  But, generally speaking, other members of the population had not been bothered.  
Q.	So what did you do, personally, on the 6th of April -- or, rather, the 7th of April?  We are already on the 7th of April.  
A.	I didn't do anything particular.  Our state of mind was not one that allowed us to engage in anything.  Most of the people who -- or, the ladies who left the surroundings of the CND came fleeing, saying they were fleeing from the soldiers.  Others were fleeing from the Inkotanyi.  And many people came to my home, and we were there until about 2 p.m. when I called the camp commander to inform him that the wives of soldiers were at my place, because they were the people who lived around the military camp.  So he -- he told me that he was going to provide transportation, and so those ladies and my wife were able to be taken away in those vehicles.  

Then on the 8th a corridor was opened for these women to -- for the ladies to be taken to the military camp.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like a document which I have distributed to be placed before the -- the witness, a document prepared by the witness himself.  I was hoping that we would examine him yesterday, so I distributed this document yesterday.  It is the only document I intend to use, apart from the personal identification sheet.  It is the following document -- 

Mr. Registrar, would you -- are you in possession of that document?  I think you have the original.  Please kindly show it to the parties.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I don't recall having received a copy of this document.  If the registrar could make a copy for me now I would appreciate it.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Prosecutor, this document was left on your desk yesterday.  Maybe it got mixed up with the other documents.  Well, I don't know, it may be missing somewhere.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I didn't receive it.  It may have been left here, but it wasn't here when I got here this morning and I didn't get a copy yesterday.  But Mr. Issa's just brought a copy so the problem is solved now.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, you have the original document.  Have you handed it to the witness?  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, Witness, you have that document before you.  Would you like to make a comment on the document?  You can see your residence on the document.  I am not very versed with these matters, but maybe this could be placed on the overhead projector so that we can all see it on our screens.  

On that document which is available to everybody now, I suppose, we have several places indicated by the witness.  To the top left-hand corner, the GP -- the office of the GP camp.  I don't know if you can all see that.  And then it indicates the canteen of the soldiers.  There are several indications in Kinyarwanda.  So I'm going to ask the witness to tell us, because I don't want to make mistakes in the pronunciation.  

So, Witness, I have indicated Camp GP.  Can you point out your house so that we can locate it in relation to Camp GP?  
A.	If I take as a reference point the Camp GP, it's about 300 metres away.  The third street from the bar.  There is a red indication there.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...couldn't we just put it on the screen and have the witness testify from right next to the screen, and he can just walk us through the whole document.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
That was my suggestion a while ago, but I thought it was not accepted.  
THE WITNESS:
You see here, I've already pointed out Camp GP to you.  My house is here.  You can see a red cross; that is my house.  And there is this street, that goes all the way to join another street.  And then there is a path that goes towards Camp GP.  And this road that goes from my house can take you all the way to the canteen, if you continue through the -- the path.  And then there is the marshy area.  Now, when you leave my house to go to Nkubito you take this street that takes you to the main road, you turn right, and then that takes you to Nkubito.  And I have indicated his house with a cross.  

Now, if you wanted a further clarification, you can ask me questions on the basis of the indications that I have given you.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  

What prevented the families that took refuge in your house from getting to Camp GP?  
A.	All those persons who sought refuge in my house were living in the combat zone which is beyond the sketch.  There were gunshots coming from Camp GP and also from Camp CMD (sic).  So these people were caught in the crossfire and took refuge in my house.  So I asked permission from the camp commander to allow the women to have access to Camp GP, and that is what he did.  
Q.	Now, on the sketch, where is CND on the sketch?  
A.	There, that is the old building, that is the old CND on the other side of the road.  But there's a new building, a new CND building on the other side of the building, not far from the old one.  But I was not able to indicate that on the sketch because the paper was too small.  
Q.	So it is to the right-hand side of the -- of the paper, and there is an arrow pointing upwards; CND is in that area?  
A.	Yes, the CND building is located to the right-hand side of Camp GP, but outside this paper.  But Inkotanyi troops were attempting to attack Camp GP from the CND building.  
Q.	On the sketch, you see the first combat zone, the second block, and the third block where you can see names, and then people.  Can you explain what you wanted to reflect on this sketch?  
A.	Where you have "the people", "the people" means that there were residence houses for the local residents.  I was not able to draw each house located in this area.  That is why I wrote "the people" to indicate that there were houses of the local residents in those areas.  
Q.	Did you indicate on this sketch the houses of persons that you referred to in your testimony a few minutes back?  Those persons that you said were killed in the night of the 6th.  
A.	Yes, for example, there is Désiré.  Désiré was killed here.  Bazuneza (sic) was also killed that night.  And those persons I have referred to have their houses on the sketch who were killed.  There were others that survived.  For example, this elderly man who lived here was killed.  But the others were not killed.  In fact, they targeted certain persons who opposed them.  These were people who used to insult -- who were insulting the president, saying that when he would no longer be president, they will celebrate.  

For example Gatabazi was a Hutu and he was killed that night.  And yet he was a leader of the MRND (sic), and he used to say that when Habyarimana will no longer be president he was going to celebrate.  And he's somebody who said negative things about the president, and that's why he was targeted.  For example Mutaga was killed, Muteraheyu (sic) was a Hutu, a member of the PSD, he was killed.  Mutwatwa (sic), he was also a member of the PSD.  But since he spoke against the president, the GP targeted him.  

So they came to avenge -- to target those persons because they used to insult the president and the party.  But persons who were not in contact with the GP was not bothered.  There were some other persons who were killed because they had individual conflicts with those GP, and the GP took advantage of the crisis to avenge.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I want you to -- to say -- to confirm, while you are talking about Gatabazi's house, whether you said he was MRND -- a member of the MRND or of another party.  
A.	He was a member of the MDR.  He was in the Rugando cellule.  
Q.	Those who were killed in the night of the 6th to the 7th -- and you did not take part in the killing?  
A.	No, I did not take part in the killings.  It was not until the morning that we saw the dead bodies.  Nobody witnessed their killings.  It was the following morning that we realised that there had been killings, and the other persons who survived the killings.  
Q.	Witness, thank you for your explanations on your sketch.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
At this stage, Mr. President, I would like to move the document into evidence.  And I believe it should be marked -- I stand corrected by Mr. Issa, it should be marked D. NG133.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG133 admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, at what time did you see Mr. Nkubito between the 6th and the following days?  
A.	On the 7th Nkubito came to my house between ten and eleven. 
Q.	Please tell the Chamber what he came to do in your house.  
A.	He came to my house, but I don't know why he came.  On that day, after the GP had killed some local residents, they took the young persons -- all the young persons, be they Interahamwe or not, and told them that the Inkotanyi were going to attack the military camp, and that those young persons should come and learn weapon handling and that they will be part of the defence of the camp.  And it was Sergeant Ulimubenshi who was in charge of their training.  And this was done inside the military camp.  

After the military training they were given weapons.  And around eleven -- between ten and eleven I saw one carrying a weapon who said that the MRND chairman within the commune, who was a mediator between civilians and soldiers, that it is unfortunate that he did not help him to get a weapon.  So I told him, "Why don't you go to the military camp and ask the commander?"  And he came back with a weapon.  He came back with a weapon.  In the evening I saw him.  

That evening he asked me to evacuate his brother who works with Cobra Security.  When I left, the place was not yet -- had not yet been overrun by Inkotanyi.  So I managed to accompany Nkubito.  It was on the third day that I saw him in Anastase Nkundakozera house.  That was where he had taken his family.  This was before he asked for a means of transportation so that his family could be evacuated from Kigali to Gitarama.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
	I'm going to spell a name, Ulimubenshi:  U-L-I-M-U-B-E-N-S-H-I.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, you stated that young Interahamwes received weapons at the military camp.  What was your role with these young Interahamwe?  Was it you who introduced them to the military camp, or it was the gendarme who went for these young persons?  And I believe you also indicated that there were other young persons from other parties, if I recall your testimony correctly.  
A.	It was not the gendarmes nor the soldiers who went to fetch these young persons.  The soldiers told the young persons to come for weapons and to undergo a training, such that they can assist the soldiers in the fight.  The young persons from all political parties were happy, and they left from all parties to the military camp.  They taught them weapon -- they taught them how to fire without even teaching them other tactics, and they gave them these weapons and asked them -- posted them on military positions.  
There were some who would leave their weapon and desert.  In the beginning they were excited to have the weapons and participate in the fighting, but when one of them was killed by a shell, they -- most of them left.  There were very few that stayed behind.  In the beginning they were excited about participating in the killings.  But since they -- when the war was raging on, most of these young persons fled, did not remain in the army.  
Q.	If I understood your testimony, as chairman of the Interahamwe during that period, that period of crisis, you did not recruit for the army so that those young persons could be -- could undergo rapid training, as you said.  
A.	No, I did not play any role.  The soldiers came and contacted the young persons directly, and the young persons went on their own volition -- there were many -- to join the army.  But when the war intensified, most of those young persons fled.  They therefore went of their own volition, and they fled without any pressure.  
Q.	A Prosecution witness said that that night gendarmes or soldiers, I don't know which, gave you between 20 and 30 weapons which you distributed to Interahamwes living in your house.  
A.	How -- do you know why he said that?  On that day there was no Interahamwe in my house.  They met the soldiers and the soldiers took them to the camp.  In any event, there were no more than two persons in my house.  There was no Interahamwe that came there.  
Q.	Are you able to describe the security situation in that area that you have sketched to the Chamber?  We've already heard what happened on the 7th/8th, but the subsequent days, 8/9/10th April.  And, before you answer this question, tell the Chamber if you yourself had a weapon.  
A.	Thank you.  Yes, I had a weapon.  It's a -- a weapon that I obtained in an illicit manner.  Because the war was raging on, I was trying to get an official document covering my -- to -- covering a weapon.  But I knew nobody was going to worry me, so I continued carrying it.  And it was not until I was fleeing that it was taken from me.  I bought it -- I used to buy ammunitions.  But up 'til when it was taken from me I had not used the ammunitions.  I bought it before the war.  
Q.	Please tell the Chamber, why did you buy this -- this weapon?  
A.	I bought this weapon because there were a lot of thieves in this -- this neighbourhood I have sketched here.  Once they came, took a night watchman in their car and took him away.  They stole a weapon -- no, rather, a car.  They stole a vehicle.  The owner and the night watchman were also taken away.  They left them somewhere.  They used the weapons to steal in Kibungo.  They stole another vehicle which they used to steal and abandoned at Mount Kigali.  They came to ask me if the vehicle belonged to me.  And they stole yet another vehicle which they used to steal in Kabuga and abandon it in Kabusunzu.  I saw -- I sent a telegram for search, and the Nyamirambo gendarme came to ask me if the vehicle found at Kabusunzu was mine.  I went to see, and I realised that one of the glasses (sic) had been broken and a tyre had been stolen.  

Once they came to attack me.  They wanted to kill me.  It was through God's mercy that I managed to save my life.  They loaded a vehicle with my own -- my own items, trading -- trading items and left it at Nyakabanda (sic).  We went in search of the bandits and we found the vehicle, but my belongings were no longer there.  

So there were these thieves who were stealing vehicles, hide them, and sell them again.  It was for that reason that, following those attacks, I bought the rifle to be able to defend myself.  But I obtained it in an illicit manner.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm going to spell the names.  Nyandugu:  N-Y-A-N-D-U-G-U.  Kabusunzu:  K-A-B-U-S-U-N-Z-U.  Nyarutarama:  N-Y-A-R-U-T-A-R-A-M-A.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, how much longer do you anticipate with this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I did not hear your question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are trying to find out whether it's likely that this witness's testimony can be completed today.  So I want to know how much longer you were anticipating needing him in chief.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I can reassure you in that regard.  I am -- I am -- I still need less than an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Prosecutor, have you got an idea what the cross-examination might look like for this witness, in terms of duration?  
MR. WEBSTER:
If we come back this afternoon and Ms. Hounkpatin finishes at 3, I don't think I'm going to finish by 3:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time are you -- I am trying to find out -- as you all know, the parties have been informed, we intend to end the session at 12:30 tomorrow.  And in that context, I was wondering if just a little extra sitting this afternoon would be sufficient, if you could complete the witness as planned.  About how much time you thought you would need overall?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe around two hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if we sat until 4 this afternoon, that might be a -- 4, 4:30.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll do my best, I'm optimistic, but I'm not -- I can't guarantee it, but it's feasible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Ms. Hounkpatin, we are going to -- we are going to complete the session at 12:30 tomorrow, whatever is the state of play.  And I was just wondering to what extent we could assist in making certain that the -- you will complete the testimony of the witnesses that you have for this session.  So if it's possible, if sitting for an extra hour this afternoon will assist, then I'm just putting it on the table so we can consider whether that will be a suitable option to do.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Since you are proposing that I complete by 12:30 tomorrow, I'm going to accept 30 minutes today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  I thought this had been published to all the trial teams.  The trial session concludes at 12:30 tomorrow.  So the -- the only question on my mind was whether we could assist in preventing your witness -- one of your witnesses having the cross-examination spread over the two-week break, and then she's continued after we resume at the end of our recess.  So it's a question of seeing whether an extra hour this afternoon could have achieved the goal of completing the testimony, if that was what was programmed.  

But perhaps you can discuss it with Mr. Webster during the break and see how we can schedule.  If an extra hour this afternoon would help, we are willing to do that.  

So, we could take the recess now.  
(Court recessed at 1239H)

(Court resumed at 1405H) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Merci, Monsieur le Président --  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, it seems to me that in your estimates a moment ago, you completely forgot me.  So I said to myself that since I had -- had decided that I'll be taking an hour -- but since you have forgotten about me, I'm going to take due note of that.  And I would believe that I would not have any 
examination -- in order to assist the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, I hope that you also think that in assisting the Chamber, you'll be assisting justice. 
MR. SOW:
Of course, Mr. President.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Good afternoon, everyone.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Nzabanterura.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	We are going to continue with what we were doing.  This morning, we left off when you were providing explanations to the Chamber regarding the weapon that you were forced to obtain illegally.  Can you please explain to the Chamber whether you remained in Kigali from the 6th of April to the month of July 1994?  
A.	Thank you.  Yes, from the 6th of April up to the 3rd of July 1994, I was in Kigali in the area of 
Serugando (sic), which I had indicated.  Part of it was occupied by the Inkotanyi, but the remaining part of the zone was outside the control of the Inkotanyi because members the Presidential Guard continued to attack them.  So we remained there, right up until we left the country.  
Q.	On what date did you leave Rugando? 
A.	I left on the 3rd of July 1994, at about 3 p.m.  It was at that moment that we had received the order to depart.  And we had told the local inhabitants to go -- some of them to the holy family and the others to PVK.  And the others were going to continue with us to Rukondo (sic) and -- we would be obtaining other information.  So we went with the remaining part of the population to Muhondo, and from there we continued on up to Gisenyi.  
Q.	Witness, could you please tell the Chamber whether between the 6th of April and the 3rd of July when you -- when you left Kigali, did -- did you have to move about within the confines of Kigali itself between those two dates or did you remain specifically and only in your area of residence? 
A.	Between the 6th of April and the 3rd of July -- since I had sent my family to Kibilira commune in Gisenyi, I needed to go and find provisions at Gitikinyoni.  That was the only place where one could buy skewered meat or other food.  I would go to Gitikinyoni on a daily basis and come back to 
Ruhondo (sic).  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Rather, the place was "Rugando", says the Kinyarwanda booth, as a correction.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Yes.  Could you please tell the Chamber whether you noticed the presence of any roadblocks and, if so, where did you see them? 
A.	There was a roadblock at Gitikinyoni, and another at the red lights at Nyabugogo, and another still 
a little bit beyond the building nearby Kabuga's place.  Those are the three roadblocks that I noticed.  
Q.	Witness, would you be able to tell the Chamber who was manning those roadblocks?  Was it -- was it civilians or was it soldiers who manned those roadblocks? 
A.	I didn't know their names.  These were people unknown to me, but I realised that these roadblocks were being manned by civilians.  
Q.	Witness, in your area of residence in Kacyiru, Rugando, were there any roadblocks there? 
A.	No.  There -- there had never been any roadblocks.  After the attack on the presidential plane, fighting immediately began and the Inkotanyi wanted to take the Presidential Guard camp, and the local inhabitants began to flee.  So there was never any roadblock set up in our area.  
Q.	Witness, can you please tell us about the phenomenon of the infiltrators. 
A.	You want me to talk to you about the infiltrators, do you? 
Q.	Yes, the infiltrators.  These were people who were found at the roadblocks and were referred to as infiltrators.  Does that say -- mean anything to you? 
A.	Yes, it does.  There were all kinds of people at the roadblocks.  And after the attack on the presidential plane, all the youths of -- of the political parties acquired the name Interahamwe.  And they would set up roadblocks just any old where.  And they were saying that they wanted to avenge the death of President Habyarimana, but, in fact -- it was, in fact, to tarnish the name of the MRND.  

And it's these youths -- all these youths from all political parties throughout the country became to be known as Interahamwe.  For instance, in Kibuye and Butare there were no MRND party members.  There were very few members of that party, in fact.  Some people wanted to install the political party in Butare, but they were unable to do so.  

There were many people who were killed in Butare and in Kibuye.  So we were asking, who killed these people in Butare and in Kibuye?  Who set up these roadblocks?  It was said that these roadblocks had been set up by the Interahamwe.  

So these opposition parties -- these infiltrators -- gave themselves the name Interahamwe and they committed massacres and acts of violence in the name of the Interahamwe; whereas, they were not members of the Interahamwe youth movement.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  What I wanted to say -- maybe I forgot some of my words to enable you to respond more completely.  I had wanted to refer to the RPF infiltrators.  Does that mean anything to you? 
A.	Yes.  These infiltrators coming from the RPF were working in close collaboration with the youths of the opposition party -- parties, so they would mix in with the youths.  And they were using the conventional signs and it was very difficult for us to identify them, but they were working in very close collaboration with the youth wings of the opposition parties.  
Q.	Witness, so you said you left Rwanda on the 3rd of July.  Where did you go? 
A.	We left Kigali and we immediately went to Gisenyi, where we spent three days, before we went to the Congo.  
Q.	Were you alone or did you leave together with members of your family? 
A.	On the 3rd of July, I left Kimihurura and we spent the night at Gitikinyoni.  And on the 4th, we left again and spent the night in Gisenyi.  And on the 5th, I came back to Kazabo in Kibilira commune where I had left my family.  So we left again for Gisenyi, where we spent three days.  Part of the local inhabitants crossed through Gisenyi, but since there was a great deal of disorder, we went to Kibuye and we crossed the border at Cyangugu in order to get to the Congo.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Before I move into your personal particulars, I would like to obtain from you some clarifications on issues we dealt with this morning.  Was there an Interahamwe structure in Kigali préfecture? 
A.	There were Interahamwe structures in Kigali préfecture, but we were unable to see them as such.  One could see them, rather, at the national level and at the préfectoral level, but one wouldn't see them at the commune level.  There weren't any either at the secteur level.  It was, rather, at the cellule level that these structures could be seen.  

So the Interahamwe were working -- or operating from the cellules.  And those responsible for making the Interahamwe known at the commune level would target the membership of a large number of people, and if those people were to be recognised as members, they would be able to recruit other newer members into the party.  

So at the commune level, there were demonstrations which were organised, games were organised, and at the cellule level with respect to the MRND, it prepared the youths and asked that the youths organise festivities, demonstrations.  And when the youth were ready, they would refer to the cellules, and the cellules would refer to the commune.  

So the commune would bring together all the elements from the various cellules.  And songs were selected such that each cellule would present its own songs.  So we would come together and when a commune was to present what it had prepared, each cellule would present its games, its songs, and each commune in the préfecture would present what they had prepared at the level of the commune. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness please be requested to slow down so that a better interpretation of his testimony can be ensured. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  We shall remind him.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, please remember to speak slowly so that we can be able to correctly interpret what you're saying.  

Witness, when did you come back to Rwanda, and under what circumstances? 
A.	I returned to Rwanda on the 25th of May 1997.  And I had to cross a whole forest.  I had practically lost all members of my family; I no longer was with anyone.  So I decided to go back to Rwanda so that I don't die in the forest.  When I arrived back in Rwanda, I was arrested and detained up to the present moment.  
Q.	Would you please explain to the Chamber why you have been detained from then until now? 
A.	I have been accused of having committed genocide.  It is said -- and it is thought -- that I was involved in the genocide.  
Q.	Have you had any judgement rendered in your case, and, if so, in what court did that trial take place? 
A.	After having spent a lot of time in prison, about ten years in all, I wrote a letter to the Gacaca jurisdiction in Kimihurura and I requested that I be prosecuted.  My case file was at the court.  The prosecutor was not saying anything in respect of my case.  So the Gacaca juris -- court at Kimihurura prepared new charges different from those which were in the initial case file of the prosecution.  They trumped-up charges and I was summoned and tried, and that is why I'm still in prison up -- up till now.  
Q.	Could you please give the Chamber the date of your sentencing.  
A.	My sentencing was on the 10th of August 2008.  The appeal ruling or judgement -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can the witness please be asked to -- to slow down.  He's going much too fast.  And there's a date that we missed. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	You're going much too fast.  The date of the judgement was the 10th August 2008; is that right? 
A.	The 10th August 2008 was the judgement rendered at the secteur level.  On the 12th of October, the appeals chamber confirmed the sentence, which was passed by the secteur level court.  But, in fact, the decision had been arrived at a long time ago.  I had been tried in absentia.  They knew that I was there -- I was in prison, but they didn't find it necessary to call me and try me in person.  
Q.	Witness, let me ask you the questions, because otherwise we won't understand your answers.  At the Gacaca court level, were you present when the sentence was passed? 
A.	I was present.  
Q.	You lodged an appeal against the sentence rendered by the Gacaca court? 
A.	Yes.  I did lodge an appeal because some laws were flouted within the Gacaca court.  But the appeal court was not careful and did not take due note of what I said in my appeal.  So they 
confirmed -- they upheld the initial sentence.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to know whether you were present when the appeal court made its ruling. 
A.	I was present on that day.  The judgement was rendered on the same day and I was present.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you exercise any right of appeal of the appeal decision rendered on the 12th of October 2008? 
A.	Thank you.  After the judgement on appeal, given that there had been no change between the 
two rulings, I wrote to the national office of the Gacaca jurisdiction requesting a review of my judgement, because all the laws governing Gacaca courts had not been respected.  To date, the 
national Gacaca jurisdiction office has not responded to my request.  They have neither responded favourably or otherwise.  I am still awaiting this response from the office -- from the national office governing Gacaca institutions.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, during your period in detention -- are you in detention with other Interahamwe members from your cellule right now? 
A.	No.  My co-detainees who were with me were released -- some in 2003, others in 2005 -- after having been acquitted, except one boy who was asked to come and testify as a prosecution -- against me.  But he refused because he couldn't provide false witness against me.  He was tried and sentenced to life in prison for having refused to lie about me.  All the other co-detainees were acquitted and released.  
Q.	This boy you're referring to, was he a member of the Interahamwe dance troupe of your cellule?  And if you have his name, can you please give it to us.  
A.	That boy was part of the dance troupe.  He was a Tutsi who belonged to that dance troupe.  His name is Félix Ntuyahaga. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I am going to spell a certain number of words mentioned up to date:  Kazabe (sic) is spelt 
K-A-Z-A-B-E (sic); Kibilira is spelt K-I-B-I-L-I-R-A; Biniga is spelt B-I-N-I-G-A, and the last name which has just been mentioned is Ntuyahaga, spelt N-T-U-Y-A-H-A-G-A.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	The only witness -- I beg your pardon.  Mr. Witness, have you yourself been approached and asked to testify against other people, like this boy was approached and he refused? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  That happened and I suffered the consequences.  In 2004, when I was in 
Kigali central prison, there was a movement of people.  A group of people was set up, people who were supposed to testify as Prosecution witnesses against people who were in government before 1994.  
I was approached and asked to join that group because it was said that I knew many things.  I was, first of all, asked to come and testify as a Prosecution witness against Barayagwiza and this was in the year 2000 -- rather, in 2002, I was asked to come and testify against Barayagwiza.  And I said that I did not know him.  

That association of -- of liars also contacted me to come and testify for the Prosecution and then enjoy benefits from the government.  That group joined me and I turned down their sugg -- their -- their suggestion.  And since that time, I began to experience problems.  On the 21st of April, I was detained because I had refused to enter a guilty plea and I had refused to assist the government as well in so doing.  
Q.	I see that you are very passionate about this part of your testimony.  So in order to enable us to understand the depth of your passion, please proceed slowly; otherwise, we may miss out on what you really want to say.  

Please switch on your microphone, Witness.  
A.	Very well.  Thank you.  Now, let me repeat:  In 2004, I was contacted to be one of those denouncers -- those denouncing a number of issues because I knew much about some members of the government who were of the party.  They talked particularly about Mathieu, and they thought that I knew very much about Mathieu.  So I told them that in my family it is forbidden to tell lies.  

At that time, they continued to insist and to contact me on a regular basis.  I was in charge of cleanliness in my quarters in prison.  And since I had refused to collaborate with the group of -- that group of denouncers, I was then dismissed from that position.  But I continued to -- to maintain my position and I refused to collaborate with the government and with those group -- with that group of denouncers.  

Then in 2005 -- 25 May 2005, I was locked up.  I was locked up for 33 days in a special jailhouse within the prison because I had refused to collaborate.  

It is ********who was able to get me out of that jailhouse.  And he had asked why I was so -- locked up. And they told him that I had refused to enter a guilty plea because I knew too many things.  So the director, *********, asked them to tell him the things which I knew, which I had refused to disclose.  

So he -- he told them that there was nothing that I could disclose with them.  So it was in that -- in those circumstances that ********got me out of the special jailhouse within the prison.  

This happened again in 2006, when I was locked up for about one month.  So I wrote a letter to the director, ***********, requesting to be transferred to another prison -- or elsewhere where I would find peace, so that those people who were bothering me would leave me alone.  So he summoned me to his office and asked me whether I had been accused of anything and whether I had appeared before any court.  My answer was no.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Comment from the Kinyarwanda interpreter:  Please, Mr. President, would you kindly ask the witness to slow down -- from the Kinyarwanda booth -- because it is impossible for him to be interpreted.  He is rushing through so many issues that the Kinyarwanda booth is unable to keep pace with him.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, I have heard Counsel Hounkpatin on more than one occasion explain to you that it is necessary to speak more slowly.  Now, your evidence will have no value if it cannot be interpreted and recorded.  And you are speaking too fast to allow that to happen.  So please speak more slowly.  
Do you understand me? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I have understood you very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, please be guided by this direction to speak more slowly.  Okay? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, let me help you.  You were in the process of explaining that in 2006, the prison director, *******, received you in his office and asked you what was happening.  Can you proceed from that point on, slowly.  
A.	When the director, *******, received me, I explained to him that I needed to be transferred to any other prison.  I asked to be transferred so that I could have peace for myself personally, and also for those people who aggressed me on a daily basis.  That is how the director, ********, asked me whether I had ever appeared before a court or whether I was simply a common law detainee.  

I told him that I had been accused of the crime of genocide, but that I had not appeared before any court yet.  So he advised me that if I were to be transferred, that would not be to the benefit of the government, which would have to pay for that type of transfer.  So he asked me to be patient and that he would take care of my security and that no one was going to bother me henceforth.  And from that time on, indeed, he removed me from that special cell and no one else bothered me.  

***********took care of my security until he was transferred from the prison.  When a new director took over, I also contacted him and told him in writing about my grievances.  But from the point he arrived, there has not been any particular problem of security for me, up until the time when I was transferred to the Remera prison.  I was transferred to the Remera prison and, from that time on, I have moved away from that group of persons who were involved in denouncing others and I have no trouble in that connection.  I hope that I have answered your question.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell the Court whether the facts -- or the issues that that group of denouncers was bringing up with you, those issues that the group was bringing or raising with you, were they false allegations or were they genuine facts? 
A.	That group of denouncers told me that we would work together to testify as Prosecution witnesses.  But because I refused to collaborate with them, they did not go into the details about the facts that we were expected to testify on as Prosecution witnesses.  But, later on, I found out through third parties about what they were talking about.  So whenever that group of denouncers wanted to denounce any particular individual, they would look for people who were natives of the area from which the accused, against whom they would testify, hailed.  

So they would describe to the witness details about the individual against whom they would be testifying.  Then, the group would get together and develop a plan to develop charges against that person about whom they had just collected information.  

One day, ************conducted an investigation into -- on -- on me, and contacted me asking me about how the Interahamwe functioned; how they had gone to Habyarimana; how did they go to 
Mathieu's house and what have you.  So I told him not to put any such questions to me, and that they were dealing with a former leader of the party and so he should not ask those questions of me.  Because he was in a position himself to provide answers to the questions because he was in charge of a -- a -- a wing of the prison and had called me to that wing to discuss these matters.  

When he heard my answer and knew that I was not ready to answer his questions, then they began to hold it against me.  So that group started to destabilise me and to attempt to hurt me so as to bring me around to changing my mind.  Given that I had decided not to lie, I also decided to suffer until the day when the Lord brought *********along, who then provided security for me over the period I have already referred to.  

Meetings were held on a weekly basis at night using loudspeakers, so much so that people outside would -- were in a position -- or were able to hear what was being said.  And the claim was that I was the source or -- or that I was responsible.  It was said in prison that I was responsible for the impunity that was obtaining because I had refused to testify as a Prosecution witness.  So inhabitants, even those outside the prison, could hear what was being said and so people understood quickly that this -- these were all fabrications.  And so this went on until the day when **********took charge of my security.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like you to take a piece of paper and write down the names of persons belonging to that group which harassed you to testify along their own lines, contrary to your own knowledge.  

Witness, if you have several names, I would like you to number the names.  Use the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on and so forth against each of those names.  Have you understood? 
A.	Yes, I have.  
Q.	Are you done, Witness? 
A.	Not yet.  I think I have written down all the names that I can remember.  
Q.	Please, hand the document over to the registrar who is standing by you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. Issa, could you please kindly show this document to all parties and to the Judges, please.  We have seen it already.  Thank you.  

Mr. Issa, would you please kindly leave that document for now with the witness -- well, maybe we rushed him.  He might still have a few names to jot down.  And if there are any other names that he remembers, he can include them to that list.  So I will proceed and, at the end of it all, we will date that document, sign it, and, with the leave of the President, produce it into evidence.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Witness, do you know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  Are you familiar with him? 
A.	I know Mathieu very well.  
Q.	In what circumstances did you know him, and what are your relations with him? 
A.	I knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse when he was the secretary general of the MRND party.  I got to know him very well when he became president of the party.  He is someone who loved his country; he is someone whom the people loved very much.  And when I understood that he was someone who loved the country and that the people loved him, I became very interested in him.  
Q.	Apart from his great love for the country, what else do you remember about him?  How can you describe his character? 
A.	People said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was someone who loved praying, who loved singing and who owned a choir.  But I don't remember the name of his choir.  You see, many of his songs were popular within the country and almost all churches in the country sang songs that had been composed by Mathieu.  In fact, he was the leader of the choir -- or the choirmaster at the Saint Michel church.  I used to see him at Mass.  

Then, I also had an opportunity to see him when he received members of the MRND party.  And whenever he chaired the MRND rallies, many supporters would generally listen attentively to his speeches because they were very peaceful speeches.  
Now, upon listening to his speeches and monitoring what he was doing, I began to take a liking 
for him -- in fact, to love him.  But before involvement in the party activities, I did not know Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I only actually got to know him within the context of the activities of our party.

1500H 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Did you ever go to Ngirumpatse's residence? 
A.	No, never.  And there was really no reason for me to go there.  I do not know whether he loved me as much as I loved him.  But we never met and I never had the opportunity to express my feelings to him.  I didn't have the opportunity to tell him that I loved him.  His wife -- even his wife did not know me.  
	His children did not know me.  But if they knew anything about me, it must have been within the context of party activities.  But I knew him because of his actions, and I loved him for what he did. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, that would be the end of my examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.

Mr. Sow, I take note of the indications that you gave.  But are there -- anything you thought you needed to do before I allowed Mr. Webster to cross-examine? 
MR. SOW: 
I have no questions for this witness, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin, you're trying to attract my attention.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Yes, Mr. President, I simply now would like to ask Mr. Issa to withdraw that document from the witness.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	And, Witness, have you included any other names on that list, or is it the same list as previous? 
A.	No, I have not added any other names.  You see, these things happened a long time ago and I do not know whether the number of members of that group increased.  And I don't know whether that association got new members from the time I left the prison. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Thank you for your comments.
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Now, I would ask Mr. Issa to kindly take the document from the witness, and I would ask, Mr. President, that this document be admitted as D. NG134 under seal.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	So, Witness, please date and sign the document and hand it to the registrar.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, this document we would seek to produce and be placed under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted, under seal. 

THE WITNESS:
Is it the 23rd today?  What is the date of today?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Today is the 29th of September. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG134 admitted, under seal) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, as a housekeeping matter, I'd like to pass out the exhibit that we discussed yesterday that had to be corrected.  I have one for the registry, which should be given -- I think it received a number yesterday -- and copies for the Court.  

I believe the Defence has already seen it because there was some communication between my colleague and the Defence attorneys to confirm the -- the accuracy of the list.  

And then I'd also request that Mr. Issa make copies of the list that was just tendered as soon as possible, so that I can refer to it as I go through my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

	Yes, it's admitted. 

Defence Counsel, I accept the housekeeping arrangements of Mr. Webster.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I think, Mr. President, that Mr. Webster was talking about the previous document yesterday, which was disclosed in this connection. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, if you have agreed on the format for its entry into audience, so I just want to confirm that it's admitted now in that form. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
That is correct, but I would like to cross-check because there were a number of spelling mistakes and we want to apply some of our pedagogy in this matter.  Otherwise, everything else is okay in principle. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe Mr. Constant could help us while Mr. Issa's out of the room.

This is a copy for the registry, which you can show to the Defence, and these are copies for the Judges, which I'd recommend that they hold onto because they can use it to compare its contents to the exhibit that's just come in through this witness. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, you're now going to have to respond to the Prosecutor who has an opportunity to cross-examine you, so you'll have to answer his questions.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let me begin by saying good afternoon.  Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...pass out some documents that we may use during cross-examination to the booth.  And Mr. Issa's now distributing packages to the French speakers and he'll come back and get the two English packets for the two Judges.

So, Mr. Witness, you agree that you did not participate in the founding meeting of the Interahamwe, but that you became the Interahamwe chairman in Rugando cellule in Kimihurura secteur in Kigali; right?  
A.	Yes, I was chairman of the Interahamwe in the Rugando cellule. 
Q.	And this association started sometime in mid-1992? 
A.	I do not know the date of the establishment of that youth wing.  When I began to take up that office that youth wing was already in existence. 
Q.	Well, thank you.  I'm just confirming bits of your testimony from earlier today.  

And that was sometime in mid-1992 when your association began; right? 
A.	I don't know when that association began its activities, because when I began to attend its meetings it was already operational, and I attended meetings when that association had already begun its activities.  But I don't know when it began its activities nor when it was established. 
Q.	Right.  Mr. Witness, just listen carefully to my question, and if you can answer the question by saying yes or no it would make this process far simpler for everyone because I'm just trying to get confirmation of certain information from you.

So your association with the Interahamwe began sometime in mid-1992; correct? 
A.	I cannot answer yes or no all the time.  I need to explain myself.  And when I answer with a yes or a no that might make me fall into a trap.  I should be able to decide for myself whether I need to give you a yes or no answer.  If I have an explanation to provide, I should go ahead and do so. 
Q.	That's not the way we're going to be proceeding, because if I ask you a question, then I'm starting with something quite simple so we can set some ground rules.  If I answer -- I ask you a question that you can simply answer yes or no to, you start with a yes or no and then you can explain it yourself.  

For a proposition as simple as you starting your association with the Interahamwe in mid-1992, you can simply say:  Yes, that's true.  Or:  No, it's not true.  Right? 
A.	No, it's not at that time that I began. 
Q.	Was it towards the end of the year 1992? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Sometime between July and October 1992, if I recall your earlier testimony; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you come to know the following persons through your association with Interahamwe?  

And I'm going to read off six names for you:  Phenéas Ruhumuliza?
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Ephrem Nezabera? 
A.	Yes, I know him. 
Q.	Bernard Muniragaba? 
A.	I also know that person. 
Q.	Joseph Serugendo?
A.	I know him. 
Q.	Jean-Pierre Sebanetsi?
A.	I know him. 
Q.	And Sèraphin Twahira?
A.	I know him. 
Q.	These were all Interahamwe leaders at the national level; would you agree? 
A.	No, no. 
Q.	Well, how would you describe them in relation to the Interahamwe? 
A.	I would like to provide explanations for some; for instance, Sèraphin Twahira, he was never an Interahamwe leader at national level.  He was a chairman of the Interahamwe in the Karambo cellule.  Later on in 1993, he joined the préfectoral committee when Turatsinze became president of the Interahamwe.  But Sèraphin was never a national Interahamwe leader. 
Q.	Now, you mentioned the name Turatsinze a moment ago.  Can you explain a bit more about what you were trying to tell us about him? 
A.	I know Turatsinze as someone who was disorganised, who caused problems in the structures that were in place.  And he was appointed at préfectoral level -- is because of the overzealousness that he created.  It was not really well explained.  We do not know how he came to fill that position. 
Q.	Well, he was a leader at a -- at the national level or the central level; wouldn't you say?  Turatsinze.  Jean-Pierre Turatsinze.  
A.	No, no.  He was never a member of the national committee.  Previously he was a driver, then he caused problems.  And in fact he operated a coup d'état at the préfectoral level and he set up Setiba, Sèraphin and Mike, and he set up that committee.  This happened after June or July 1993.  

And right up to the time when he left the country -- when he left he stole a container belonging to Kajuga.  And he said he wanted to borrow that container in order to bring back rice from Tanzania.  He went to Tanzania with that container and he never came back.  I believe he left in January 1994 and he never came back, up to today.  So it is under those circumstances that I knew him. 
Q.	When you say "he never came back", I'd suggest that what you mean is you did not see him after 199 -- January of 1994? 
A.	Yes, that's right.  I never saw him again.  And, in fact, he never came back to Rwanda again. 
Q.	Well, I put it to you the way I did because how can you say "he never came back to Rwanda"? 
A.	This is because he was saying that he was going to Tanzania in order to buy rice.  He left with a container which belonged to Kajuga.  And from then on I never saw him and nobody else did either. 
Q.	That's what I was suggesting to you indirectly, Mr. Witness.  You never saw him again after 
	January of 1994.  
A.	No, I never saw him again. 
Q.	But didn't he work at the MRND headquarters?  Didn't he have an office there and a particular status with the MRND party? 
A.	When I knew him he was a driver.  Later on, he operated the coup d'état in the Kigali-ville préfecture, in the committee of the Interahamwe.  

After that coup d'état, I saw him but -- but that's how I knew him.  I knew him as a driver of the party and then after that he caused problems within the MRND structure and those were the conditions under which I got to know him.  
Q.	And your suggestion is that this driver was able to achieve a coup d'état against some of the persons that we -- that I just mentioned to you:  Serugendo, Maniragaba, Nezabera, these bankers and businessmen.  
A.	I don't know whether you understood me.  Ruhumuliza and others were leaders at national level, as well as Phenéas.  But he carried out this -- or operated this coup d'état at the préfecture level.  So these are two different levels.  

You were mistaken about Sèraphin.  The others were leaders at national level, but Sèraphin was a leader at the cellule level.  

Now, after that coup d'état he appointed Turatsinze as his vice-chairman.  That's what I told you.
Q.	All right.  I think I -- I understand you now.  

In any case, whatever he did, he could not have had too much of an impact after January of 1994, which is when you claim he was no longer in Rwanda; right? 
A.	He was not in Rwanda.  We don't even know under what circumstances he left the country.  It was as if he had fled. 
Q.	So I assume that the MRND party and the Interahamwe organisation was able to recover from whatever coup he may have achieved prior to January of 1994; will you agree? 
A.	I don't know what problem you want to talk about.  Can you please explain what you mean?  Because I didn't quite understand your question.

Mr. President, can you please ask counsel for the Prosecution to explain what problems he thought were in the party. 
Q.	We'll just move ahead, Mr. Witness.  You agree with me that at least Ruhumuliza, Nezabera, Munyiragaba, Serugendo, Sebanetsi -- these were all national leaders.  I think the only name that you disputed was Sèraphin Twahire?  
A.	Yes.  There were others who you mentioned who were not leaders at national level, especially Bernard.  The committee was made up of five members and you gave me more than five names.  There were some ordinary members who would be moving about with those leaders but were of -- were occupying no function or position within the committee. 
Q.	Okay.  Can you tell us how they demonstrated their leadership?  What did they do that indicated to you that they were the leaders of the Interahamwe? 
A.	What I know is that after that meeting, during which he spoke to us about the objectives of the youth of the party, they told us that they were the ones who were the leaders of that youth movement and that we were to abide by the objectives of that youth movement, and particularly our youth movement should campaign amongst the party membership so that the membership loves its party.  

So we were to teach them the objectives of the MRND -- the objectives.  And we were to tell them the advantages that they were to have if the party were to win the elections.  

So we were needing to sensitise them to love the country and their party.  And this is what we understood -- and this is why we understood that these people were the leaders of the 
youth movement. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  So I understand from your response that they told you in a meeting that they were the leaders, but what did they do?  What did you see them do and how did you interact with them that made you understand that they were the leaders of the Interahamwe? 
A.	What they did is that they spoke to us of the objectives of the party.  And we -- as the youth at the cellule level, we were to choose our own leaders and we would be responsible for organising our own meetings and decisions taken at cellule level were transmitted to the national level.  

So they did nothing in particular except what I've already said to you.  They explained to us the objectives of the youth of this party at national level. 
Q.	So, in other words, they held meetings with you -- with the Interahamwe chairpersons at the level of the cellule; is that what you're saying? 
A.	No.  They would meet amongst themselves and we would meet with them at rallies and they would explain to us what they had done.  And this was done through the dance and the songs.  

They would even give us a report of what they expected when they were touring the cellules in our region of the country.  We didn't have any other meetings except when we met them during rallies at national level, when all the youths and all local participants or local inhabitants came to attend 
party meetings. 
Q.	Your testimony is that these national leaders never met with you in the commune or in the secteurs or in the cellules.  The only time you saw them was at national party rallies.  
A.	Yes, quite so. 
Q.	So how would you communicate what you did at the cellule level among the Interahamwe to the national leadership of the party, of the MRND?  How would you send messages or get information from the national leaders of the party? 
A.	No particular messages were sent.  We would meet in the course of rallies and we would transmit our messages through song and dance, but we could not do anything without going through the commune.  And what the commune did was to ensure it did everything to have each commune represented in the dances and the songs.  So the messages were transmitted in that way.  

At national level the messages from the cellules and the communes would be transmitted to the others at national level and we wouldn't be able to know the attitude of our party.  

All that they told us at those rallies was all.  They didn't give us any instructions.  The youth organised itself and presented songs and dances and would make presentations to the leaders when they had their rallies. 
Q.	Well, can we agree that the Interahamwe was the youth wing of the MRND party? 
A.	It was the youth wing of the party, which later on became known as the Interahamwe.  But when the youth wing was established, it was in order to sensitise the local inhabitants about the objectives and the ideals of the party. 
Q.	And can we agree that the national secretary of the party, which at one time was Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and was later Joseph Nzirorera -- that the national secretary was responsible for the 
	day-to-day operations of the party, which would also include management of its youth wing; can we agree on that? 
A.	As for the operations of the party at national level, I do not know how those who were in position led the party.  You're asking me too much. 
Q.	You were a member of the MRND; right? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the party -- of the MRND party, but please do not forget that I was a member at the cellule level.  I did not occupy a higher-level function at national level. 
Q.	And you represented the MRND at the cellule level and you also were the chairperson of the Interahamwe at the cellule level; right?  That's what you told us this morning.  
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And what I'm trying to understand from you is how the national leadership, such as the 
	national secretary of the party, would be able to be in contact with a member of the party at your level, at the level of the cellule, specifically as it concerns the Interahamwe.  
A.	Within the party in respect of the cellule there was a group of Interahamwe and the chairman was the same.  The president or chairman of the party at the cellule was also the chairman of the Interahamwe, and I was the person in that position, since there was no representative of the Interahamwe at the secteur and commune levels.  

The activities of the Interahamwe at the cellule level were communicated to the commune, which was to prepare a report of all the activities of the Interahamwe at cellule level.  And when there was a rally at the préfectoral level, it was the commune which had provided the report of the activities of the Interahamwe at the cellule level, which would communicate to the party officials at the préfectoral level what the Interahamwe had done at the cellule level. 
Q.	And do you know if there was a way for information at the préfecture level to reach the national level? 
A.	All directives or instructions would be provided when rallies were held.  National officials would be present at those rallies and they would communicate to the membership of the MRND at the 
	cellule level the ideals of the party.  National officials would speak of the general policies of the party and would transmit the party's ideals to the membership at popular rallies. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, what I'd suggest to you is that there had to have been other meetings or other ways of sending information back and forth.  It's hard to believe that these large rallies at Nyamirambo or Amahoro was the only way that you would receive information from the national leadership or that you would send information forward that would reach the national level.  

Are you sure that it was only at these rallies that you were able to send information back and forth? 
A.	Personally, I know that the party ideals would be communicated to us when there were rallies.  If there were other means of information or communication, I am not aware of them. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  But with respect to these national leaders:  Ruhumuliza, Nezabera, Muniragaba and Serugendo, they all worked out of the MRND office; right, the party office or the headquarters?   
A.	Muniragaba was not a member of that committee.  The Interahamwe who worked at Gitega were not working at the party headquarters.  I think that it was Muniragaba who had given them an office.  It is possible that they had a working relationship with those who were at the party headquarters, but personally I never saw them work at the party headquarters. 
Q.	All right.  We'll move on.  Now, is it your testimony that there was military training provided for the Interahamwe prior to the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Not at all.  Never.  I'm not aware of any such training.  I know that on the 7th at my cellule the whole members of the youth -- not just the Interahamwe -- were called upon to learn how to use weapons, and this was done voluntarily.  And even those who were called upon -- the young men who were called upon to train in the handling of weapons, they abandoned that training because they saw the danger in the use of firearms. 
Q.	Didn't you tell us this morning that you had heard about military training for Interahamwe in 1993 and 1994? 
A.	No, never.  I don't think I said that.  That question was put to me and I answered -- and I answered that I did not know about those military training sessions.  

However, the opposition political parties were wont to say that the Interahamwe were receiving military training, but I know that this was being said because of -- in order to tarnish the image of the MRND.  And I did not believe in what was being said. 
Q.	So, in other words, you heard it, but you only heard it from opposition political parties in the context of propaganda; is that your evidence? 
A.	Indeed, whenever I received this information, I would understand that this was propaganda in order to sully the image of the MRND. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Do you recall being interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor for the ICTR back in 1998? 
A.	Yes, I remember having met the investigators of this Tribunal. 
Q.	And you provided information to them which was recorded in writing and you signed a statement that summarised that conversation; right? 
A.	They had a draft record.  And I asked those who took down notes to repeat it or do it again.  And I refused to sign the first draft and I asked them to do it again.  

They came back with a different interpreter who read the record of the interview.  And when he read the record of the interview, I understood that there was still the word "militia" still in the document.  And I said I could not sign that document which included the term militia, whereas I had asked for it to be amended.  So I refused to sign it.  

Since I don't understand French, they read it to me and they told me that the word militia did not mean anything bad.  I discussed with them and I asked them to change or amend some passages of that record because I was not in agreement with the content of what I heard read to me.  

So when they came back the second time, I asked them to change it again.  
And on the third occasion they made me understand once again that militia meant the youth wings of the parties.  

So you people of the Office of the Prosecutor set a trap for me because I do not understand French.  Finally, I agreed to sign, but I'm not in agreement with you.  And once again, I say I do not -- do not understand French and you said that militia meant the youth wings of the parties, and therefore I ended up signing. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, all I asked you is if you signed a statement or not.  And here you are already making excuses and trying to explain away the information that you know is contained in that document.

Did you review that document with Madam Hounkpatin...(microphones overlapping)...your testimony --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness was speaking at the same time as the Prosecutor, so I think that question may not have been complete. 
THE WITNESS:
I indeed signed my statement.  But the investigators of this Tribunal misled me because they made me understand that the term militia was equivalent to the youth wing of the party.  I never said in my -- I never used that term in my statement, so the investigators of this Tribunal misled me. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And my question to you, Mr. Witness -- or my suggestion to you is -- I asked you one simple question:  Did you a sign a statement?  And here you are already making excuses for what you know is contained in that statement.  

Did you discuss the contents of this statement with Madam Hounkpatin before starting your testimony this morning? 
A.	No.
(Pages 41 to 50 by Melissa Hook)











1545H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So the last time you reviewed the contents of this statement was back in 1998 when you signed it? 
A.	Yes.  Last time I saw my statement was in 1998, but after 1998 other people came to see me.  I don't know whether it's a Prosecution team or another team. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, in order for you -- 
A.	They questioned me, but I didn't sign any statement that second time around. 
Q.	No one coerced you into speaking with the OTP investigators and no one coerced you into signing the document; can we agree on that much?  You were not forced to speak to anyone and you were not forced to put your signature on the document.  
A.	No one forced me.  However, as I have said, I signed my statement after a third meeting with them, because I had asked them to make a correction on some of the passages.
Q.	And no one rewarded you for having made the statement?  In other words, you were not given any benefits as a result of giving this information to the investigators? 
A.	No one paid me after I provided my statement. 
Q.	And that would include the Rwandan authorities of the prison or the Prosecutor's office, they didn't reward you in any way for giving this information to the ICTR; right? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  Neither the investigators of this Tribunal nor the authorities of the prison gave me salary or any inducement. 
Q.	I would like us to turn to that document.  It's document A in the stapled bundle that I passed out.  

Mr. Witness, you have already told us that you don't read French, but you can at least acknowledge for us that this is your signature at the bottom and that this is your signature also where there is text in Kinyarwanda indicating that the statement was read back to you, which is on the last page.  And if you look through the French document, you will see all throughout it that there are things crossed out and where you had initialled for the corrections that you insisted be made before you signed it.    
MR. WEBSTER: 
So if Mr. Issa could show this document to the witness and point him to the passages I have just indicated, his signature at the bottom of the page and his signature at the last page. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, while the witness is doing that, I would just like to discuss how we proceed this afternoon.  How much -- you have gone into your cross-examination.  How much time do you think you are going to need?  I am not pressing you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I understand.  I mean, it's sort of frustrating for me because I expected to be much further along than I am right now.  I think I need a good two hours more, Your Honour.  I know that's not welcomed, but -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Whether welcomed or not, we are just trying to have an effective plan.  If you are going to need 
	two hours more, it raises a question -- another question. 

Ms. Hounkpatin, how long do you plan to be in chief with your next witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, it would be an hour for the next witness's examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question is:  Suppose we sat until 4 o'clock or 4:30, would that allow the next witness's -- at least examination-in-chief to be completed by 12:30 tomorrow?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sure the next witness could at least complete her examination-in-chief, and I will do everything I can to expedite matters so she can complete her entire testimony. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  So would 4 o'clock or 4:30 be a suitable target this afternoon?  

Ms. Hounkpatin, how is Mr. Ngirumpatse feeling?
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, he is telling me 1600 hours.  Because during the break I said to my learned friend across the way that he could probably hold out until 1630.  So maybe that is the information that Mr. Webster also has. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think what I heard was a bit confusing.  Mr. Ngirumpatse clearly said he could stay until 4 o'clock, and I was hoping that we could go until 4:30.  So we leave it to the Court's discretion.  If we stop at 4 o'clock, you know, I will do my best overnight to streamline my outline. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Shall we do Solomon and stop at 4:15 and see how it goes?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's fine. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President.  We shall try. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, just to put you at ease, let me indicate to you that all of the parties have copies of your statements.  You, unfortunately, won't be able to follow us in French, but if I misstate anything, I'm sure that Madam Hounkpatin will bring it to our attention.  But I have numbered paragraphs on the statement which is dated the 17th of February 1998, and I'm only going to touch on a few portions of it.  

And, again, your testimony to us is that you didn't discuss the contents of this statement with Madam Hounkpatin before starting your testimony this morning; right?  Can you just confirm that before we move ahead.  
A.	In 2008 I believe Ms. Hounkpatin came to see me.  She asked me questions regarding my statement, and we spoke about it.  But before my appearance before this Chamber, we did not discuss my statement. 
Q.	So you discussed it with her, which is all I was asking? 
A.	Yes.  I spoke to her of the contents of my statements, and she asked me questions on the facts that I knew, and I explained to her everything I knew. 
Q.	Looking at where I've numbered 1 in the text -- and I've made the same numbering on the French as I have on the English -- you start off by saying, "I heard that some Interahamwe received military training, but in my section no one asked me to attend this type of training.  Therefore, I cannot tell you who provided the training nor where it was taking place."  

That information is a bit different from what you've just told us, Mr. Witness.  Wouldn't you agree?  Doesn't this sound like an acknowledgement that there was training going on only you weren't able to provide the details about it? 
A.	I told you that I would hear members of the opposition parties say that the Interahamwe were undergoing military training, but I didn't tell you that I obtained that information through my own 
	political party.  It is the opposition parties that were saying that the Interahamwe were undergoing that kind of military training. 
Q.	And after revising your written statement three times with the OTP investigators, somehow that additional information doesn't appear on this document.  
A.	Personally, I told the investigators of this Tribunal that I did not know under what circumstances these military training sessions took place.  I also explained that in my cellule no one had attended those military training sessions.  Maybe the investigators of this Tribunal did not understand me well, or maybe I myself did not explain myself well enough. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Where I've numbered paragraph 2, you say, "As the Interahamwe chairperson for Rugando cellule, I received instructions from the Interahamwe chairperson for Kakiru (sic) commune" -- and then you provide the name of Mr. Nkubito.  "Of course, I did attend, with the other chairpersons, the rallies organised by the MRND party leaders" -- and then you go on to say Nyamirambo, Amahoro, et cetera.  

But in this paragraph you seem to be suggesting that there is a chain of command within the Interahamwe.  Do you wish to clarify that for us now? 
A.	I have already explained this point.  I have already told you that at the cellule level information was communicated to the commune, and that is what is written.  This is what you have just read.  It is the MRND official at the commune level who would give us instructions.  However, he was not a member of the Interahamwe.  He was a representative of the MRND at the commune level, but he was not a member of the Interahamwe.  

Maybe when I was meeting the investigators of this Tribunal, I had failed to explain this point.  The official of the MRND at the commune level would give instructions to the Interahamwe even though he was not an Interahamwe himself.  I think that there was a little misunderstanding when I was explaining this point. 
Q.	No.  Well, thank you because that clarifies matters considerably.  It was the MRND party chairperson at the level of the commune that gave you instructions as an Interahamwe leader in the cellule.  
A.	At the commune level there were no Interahamwe.  At the secteur level there were no Interahamwe either.  Since I was chairman of the MRND at the cellule level and at the same time chairman of the Interahamwe at the cellule level, I would receive instructions from the MRND officials at commune level and at secteur level. 

So in truth I wore two hats.  I was an official of the MRND at the cellule level, and I was an official of the Interahamwe at the cellule level.  This means that I would transmit information regarding the party, as well as information concerning the Interahamwe, and I would communicate that information to the secteur level and to the commune level. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much for that clarification.  

Where I've numbered number 3, you name the six persons whose names I read off to you.  I'm not going to read the entire text.  But the last line of that paragraph you say, "I cannot state with certainty that these people were part of the executive bureau of the MRND, but they all worked at the party's main office."  And here you are referring to Ruhumuliza, Nkezabera, Maniragaba, Serugendo.

Would you like to clarify that last statement, or shall I move on? 
A.	I never attended meetings at headquarters level.  If these people had an office at the party headquarters, that would not be surprising, more so because they were working for the party.  But as far as I am concerned, I do not know whether they were working at the headquarters of the party.  All I know is that they had an office at Gitega, but I do not know whether that office was at the party headquarters or not.  And I cannot talk to you about the operations of the MRND at headquarter level. 
Q.	What is this office in Gitega?  Can you explain that a bit more, please.  
A.	That office was located down below the camp, the military camp close by the Kigali hospital, opposite the Nyamirambo stadium.  That's where that little office was located. 
Q.	And was this an office of the MRND party? 
A.	No.  It was the Interahamwe office at national level.  I think it was a building that they rented, or maybe a member of the party had given it to them.  I don't have any more information.  

I would often see them in that location, but I do not know how they had acquired that office.  I don't even know whether they went to the party headquarters.  Maybe they went there in order to obtain some information.  They were operating at a very high level, and I was not in touch with them. 
Q.	Well, I'm curious about this office in Gitega.  Are you referring to a building that was owned by Bernard Maniragaba or his wife? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.  I do not know to whom the building belonged.  I would see these people there, but I don't know whether that building belonged to Maniragaba or whether it was another member of the party who had placed that building at their disposal. 
Q.	Thank you.  

If we go on to where I've numbered 4, the sentence immediately preceding that paragraph, you start to discuss the training given to youth by the Presidential Guard on the 7th of April, and there is a sentence that reads as follows:  "The able-bodied men received military training for three days after which they were given weapons.  I was present at the PG barracks when Major Mpiranya, the barracks commander, distributed the weapons to those who had been selected.  I personally received a weapon.  We were supposed to reinforce the army in their fighting against the RPF."  

So what I suggest to you, Mr. Witness, is, what you told the investigators back in 1998 is a bit different from what you told us this morning in regard to how you obtained a weapon in April 1994.  
A.	Maybe I did not explain myself properly, but that was the conditions under which I received the weapon.  And even in other case files which exist in my country, I explained how I obtained this weapon.  When I went to the military camp, when I had been with the -- ill at the Red Cross, I already had that weapon.  I didn't receive anything from the military camp.  I already had it.  I didn't receive any further weapons from the military camp.  It is only what I already had previously. 
Q.	So you're saying that the -- what was recorded in this statement is false? 
A.	I don't know whether I misexplained -- whether I explained myself poorly or whether I was misinterpreted by the interpreters.  At any rate, I have told you under what circumstances I illegally obtained that firearm and how I illegally kept it in my possession.  Even if I had received it from the soldiers, it would have still been an illegal fashion.  At any rate, I have explained it.  It was not the soldiers who gave me that weapon at the military camp. 
Q.	And there in paragraph 5 where I've numbered, you explain that you came across roadblocks that had been put up by soldiers and civilians.  "I cannot state with certainty that all the civilians were militiamen, because after the accidental death of President Habyarimana, all the parties became Interahamwe."  So I suppose this is the reference that you were making earlier about denying having used the word "militiamen".  

Is there anything you would like to say further on that point? 
A.	I have already explained that there were roadblocks everywhere, apart from Kimihurura where the fighting was ongoing.  And the Interahamwe acquired the name Interahamwe.  And everywhere in the country it was said that it was the Interahamwe who were manning the roadblocks.  

And let me repeat, all the youth wings of the political parties became known as the Interahamwe, and this was something that tarnished the good image of the Interahamwe, which was, indeed, the 
youth wing of the MRND party. 
Q.	Well, would you agree that these Interahamwe, as you are referring to them after April 6th of 1994, would man the roadblocks and check the ID cards of everyone that was passing through them? 
A.	I don't know about that.  I've never manned any roadblock, and I did not pass by any roadblock to know what would happen there.  So I don't know how they operated at the roadblocks. 
Q.	You didn't see any of this going on in April and May and June of 1994, militiamen at the roadblocks demanding everyone's ID card before they could go through? 
A.	No.  I never saw any of that, because when I passed by the roadblocks, I would notice that there were people who manned them, but I didn't take care to know what they were doing, how they were going about their business.  I didn't take time to observe how they were operating. 
Q.	So as you testify before us today, you claim that you had no knowledge that back in April of 1994 
	Tutsi civilians were being stopped at the roadblocks because of the Tutsi mention on their ID cards.  You don't know anything about that? 
A.	I didn't know anything about that, since in my area there were no roadblocks.  I did not know what was happening elsewhere where the roadblocks existed. 
Q.	Well, if I go to where I've numbered 5 in your statement from 1998, there is a sentence that reads as follows:  "The civilians and the soldiers that were monitoring the roadblocks were checking the identities of those that were fleeing" -- and then you add -- "possibly confiscating weapons."  So do you disagree with the contents of your statement on this point as well? 
A.	I was talking about soldiers who were ensuring security and who were taking away weapons from people who were operating illegally who would be able to attack others.  So they were taking away weapons from those people who were referred to as the Interahamwe.  And the people doing that were soldiers who were responsible for ensuring security and who wanted to stop acts of violence from spreading. 
Q.	All right.  Well, Mr. Witness, we have your testimony, and I will request that the Chamber admit this statement in evidence and then the Chamber can read the statement in its entirety and appreciate it in context and see how it assesses your evidence today.
MR. WEBSTER:
So, Your Honours, I'd request that the statement be moved into evidence as the next 
	Prosecution exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI:
That document will be P. 536, Your Honour.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
I have it in English and French with the numbers on it, which Mr. Issa can collect from me.  
MR. MJUI:
A for French; B for English.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 536A and P. 536B admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, can we agree that the PG, as you have been referring to them -- these were the Presidential Guards, which was an elite unit of the Rwandan armed forces; right? 
A.	I didn't quite hear.  I think the volume on my headset was a bit low.  So I didn't quite hear your question, Counsel.  I'm not hearing the interpreter well from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
Q.	I was trying to get confirmation from you that the PG -- and as you say it in French, the GP -- was an elite unit of FAR soldiers.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.  I think maybe the witness should be assisted with his headphones.  
THE WITNESS:  
I don't know much about military matters. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All you would have to know is whether they were elite soldiers or not.  You don't know that much? 
A.	I don't know much to do with military matters.  I don't know how these soldiers of the military -- Presidential Guard were trained.  All I know, that there was a Presidential Guard unit which was responsible for the president's security, but I do not know how that unit was trained -- how it received its training. 
Q.	Well, just based on what you could see and what you would overhear from their conversations, wouldn't you agree that they had better equipment, better uniforms, seemed more disciplined and more professional than the other FAR soldiers who were not in the Presidential Guard? 
A.	Do you think that a soldier can discuss matters with a civilian?  Normally, soldiers have to keep professional secrecy.  So I wouldn't be able to know all these details. 
Q.	Well, on that very point that I have -- I am curious as well, Mr. Witness, because in your direct testimony, you talk about meeting with the soldiers, going into their barracks, making arrangements with them to transport the women of your neighbourhood.  So based on your testimony this morning, it seems like you have more familiarity than one would expect a civilian to have of an elite unit in the armed forces.  
A.	I have explained to you that, for those women to be evacuated from my home, I telephoned from my house to the commander of the camp, and he said that he was going to facilitate their task and enable them to enter that camp.  I didn't do this on a face-to-face basis.  And when we got there, we didn't talk about any military issues.  We talked about those women.  

I don't think a soldier can discuss military issues with a civilian.  If ever he were to do that, it would be with a military colleague and not with a civilian. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time, and I can stop here and pick up tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think this might be an appropriate time to stop. 

Mr. Witness, we have to take the adjournment now.  During this or any other adjournment while you are a witness, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody. 
(Court adjourned at 1618H)
