         2   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the registry introduce the matter coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning. 

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.

         6        

         7        Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal 

         8        for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, 

         9        presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu, 

        10        and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open 

        11        session, today, Monday, the 18th of November 2002, for 

        12        the continuation of the Defence Case, in the matter of 

        13        the Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. 

        14        ICTR-98-44A-T.

        15        

        16        Thank you, Mr. President. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  

        18        

        19        May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with 

        20        the Prosecution, if we may, please?

        21   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        22        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Dorothée Marotine, 

        23        case manager.  Thank you.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

        25        

        26        May we also have the appearance of the Defence, please?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honour.  Lennox Hinds, 

        28        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by 

        29        Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.

          KAJELIJELI                                      18 NOVEMBER 2002



         1       Yes.  Professor Hinds, Learned Counsel for the Defence, 

         2        your next witness, please?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that we have some 

         4        pending matters that have to be dealt with before we 

         5        call our next witness.  

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: There is a preliminary matter that I want to 

         8        bring to the Court's attention.  Mr. Kajelijeli has been 

         9        ill for some time, and I think the Court is aware of 

        10        that, there was a situation where he was in extreme 

        11        pain, as you recall during the early part of this 

        12        session, and it almost resulted in me leaving the case 

        13        as you recall.  We now find out that he has a compressed 

        14        disk in his back which would require perhaps, some 

        15        surgical intervention.  This, we just found out and he 

        16        is still in pain, but I think he is having medication to 

        17        relieve that pain.  

        18        

        19        What concerned me quite frankly is that, I just arrived 

        20        from New York two days ago, and when I got here, it 

        21        seemed that everyone was aware that Kajelijeli was 

        22        perhaps scheduled to undergo surgery.  Our concern is 

        23        one of just security at this point, and we did not know 

        24        how this information concerning his health condition was 

        25        known by so many people within the Tribunal.  In fact, 

        26        someone from the Prosecutor's office met me on Saturday 

        27        and asked me about his health, and at that time, we were 

        28        still simply consulting with independent doctors in 

        29        New York before making a decision about surgical 

        30        intervention.

         1        So, if there will be some surgical intervention, where, 

         2        when, how, we want that to be strictly confidential for 

         3        his security.  This Court knows there has been evidence 

         4        that he has been targeted by the RPF through Radio 

         5        Muhabura for some time.  We are very very concerned that 

         6        no information be disclosed concerning when, where, how, 

         7        if there is going to be any further medical treatment.  

         8        I was alarmed, quite frankly, because I didn't know it 

         9        was so -- there was so much discussion within various 

        10        organs of the Tribunal on issues that even I was not 

        11        quite aware of concerning potential surgery.  So, that 

        12        is just one point that we want to bring to the Court's 

        13        attention.  We don't believe that there was any 

        14        deliberate attempt.  I think it was just general concern 

        15        that everyone felt, but there is a security concern. 

        16             

        17        The other problem, Your Honour, is that we are scheduled 

        18        to call our next witness, RGM.  When we -- the last day 

        19        of the proceedings, in the last session, the Court 

        20        recalls, we were -- the day before, we were informed by 

        21        the Prosecutor's office that a statement was taken from 

        22        RGM and we were presented with that particular 

        23        statement.  We subsequently reviewed the statement and 

        24        filed an extremely urgent motion.  The motion had two 

        25        prongs, one prong dealt with a motion for contempt, and 

        26        we think that there should be an evidentiary hearing 

        27        prior to a decision being taken, given the facts as they 

        28        are unfolding by way of affidavits and the statements of 

        29        the witness in question and also affidavits by 

        30        supposedly the investigators, who in fact, took the

          KAJELIJELI                                      18 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        statement.  

         2        

         3        The second prong dealt with -- under Rule 95, the 

         4        exclusion of the statement itself.  We are faced with a 

         5        situation where we believe that Mr. Kajelijeli's case as 

         6        it stands right now, is compromised, and I do not want 

         7        to belittle the dilemma that we face.  The witness, as a 

         8        protected witness was contacted, according to the 

         9        Prosecutor, inadvertently.  

        10        

        11        The witness himself says that he gave notice of his 

        12        prior statement to the Defence.  The Prosecutor 

        13        indicated that there was one contact made on the 23rd.  

        14        The witness has indicated that there was a prior contact 

        15        the week before, and now in his affidavit he said that 

        16        there were contacts on two specific dates by 

        17        representatives of the ICTR.  

        18        

        19        We further know that the witness was, in fact, summoned 

        20        to this meeting by the first deputy prosecutor, against 

        21        whom a contempt proceedings, at least a contempt motion 

        22        is pending.  So, there are some very serious issues 

        23        here.  We are not in a position to call RGM unless we 

        24        have a ruling with respect to whether or not the second 

        25        statement taken by the Prosecutor on September 23rd is 

        26        going to be admitted at this Tribunal for any purpose. 

        27        The Prosecutors have said --

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't follow you, Professor Hinds. You 

        29        remember the Trial Chamber had made a decision on that, 

        30        are you aware of that?

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: No.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Why, Registry?  

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know anything about that.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: There was a decision filed on these same 

         5        things on -- when was it?  What date was it?  Thursday 

         6        or Friday?

         7   MR. KIYEYEU: Indeed, My Lord.  I think they were 

         8        processing now, it should be ready.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: No, it should have been made available.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I was travelling.  I left the 

        11        United States on Thursday night, it took me all day in 

        12        Amsterdam on Friday.  I arrived here on Friday night and 

        13        I went out to the prison on Saturday, and I have been 

        14        there on Saturday and Sunday.  I don't know anything 

        15        about a decision.  The only decision that I received was 

        16        a decision on the motion in limine.  So, I don't --

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming, is the Prosecution aware of that 

        18        decision? 

        19   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours, we have it, and as I 

        20        understand it, Your Honours ruled that there was no need 

        21        for an evidentiary hearing, but the statement is 

        22        excluded from use.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, it's a pity.  Would you like to have -- in 

        24        fairness perhaps to have a chance to look at it, to be 

        25        informed, but that is the substance of the decision?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I would like just about ten or fifteen 

        27        minutes because I came prepared to argue a motion and 

        28        so, I just need ten or fifteen minutes to change my 

        29        gears.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, you are justified for that but I hope --

         1        is the Accused not informed as well?  I don't know how 

         2        the system works.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Nobody on this side of the table knows 

         4        anything about it, Your Honour. 

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, we will give you, the Defence at least 

         6        fifteen minutes to be appraised of the current position 

         7        with regard to this matter.  

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Does the registry --

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: If the registry can make a copy available to 

        10        the Defence.  

        11   MR. KIYEYEU: We will do so, My Lord.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  So, we will adjourn for 15 minutes 

        13        and resume our work at half past nine.  It is less than 

        14        15 minutes, but that should be okay, at half past nine.

        15        (Court recessed from 0917H to 0930H)

        16        

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  The proceedings are resumed. 

        18   MR. KIYEYEU: I am sorry, Mr. President.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        20   MR. KIYEYEU: I have checked with our records, the registry.  

        21        In fact, the document was processed on Friday the 15th, 

        22        the same day and it was sent to the Accused through the 

        23        security, the normal conduit pipe that we use.   

        24        Unfortunately, the Accused says that he has not received 

        25        it.  I think there is a problem, maybe it was over the 

        26        weekend, therefore, I cannot answer for that, My Lord.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right.  Anyway I think --

        28        

        29        Yes, Professor Hinds?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, we have had an opportunity

         1        to review the statement and we aren't making any 

         2        comments on it, we are prepared to proceed. 

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel, your next witness, please?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: The next witness is RGM.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Of course, with regard to your first 

         6        comment, I don't know whether the Prosecution had any 

         7        comment, if not, then the Trial Chamber takes note of 

         8        the observation regarding the postural treatment of the 

         9        accused person that you raised at the beginning of the 

        10        session. 

        11   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, the only comment we wish to make 

        12        is that, we are not interested in the details except for 

        13        the possibility that it will happen and perhaps when, 

        14        that need not be in the public record at any time, but 

        15        for our own planning purposes, if we had some 

        16        indication. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we have no problem with that.  

        19        We assume that to the extent that if the Defendant has, 

        20        for any reason would not be able to continue with the 

        21        trial, the registry would then advise all parties 

        22        accordingly.  My only concern is that someone from the 

        23        Prosecutor's office was asking me about the condition of 

        24        my client and the possible surgery, and I mean -- it was 

        25        something that I myself was not even aware of.  So, I 

        26        was a little concerned about -- not only somebody's from 

        27        the Prosecutor's office, but somebody else in the 

        28        registry had raised the question.  So, it would appear 

        29        to me that there was some general discussion out of 

        30        concern, but then also raised the security matters that

         1        I raised.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Okay, we take note of that.  This should 

         3        be Defence Witness No. --

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: It is Defence Witness identity RGM, but it 

         5        is the 12th witness.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         7        (Declaration made by Witness RGM in Kinyarwanda)

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness RGM, you have just made a solemn 

         9        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

        10        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        11        essential elements to you before you begin your 

        12        testimony.  You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by 

        13        the Defence who are seated on this side of the 

        14        courtroom.  Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        15        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        16        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        17        of you, may also put questions to you to clarify your 

        18        evidence as you continue to testify, if they have such 

        19        questions to ask you.  If a question put to you is not 

        20        clear, or you do not understand it, please say so and 

        21        such a question shall be repeated or explained.  These 

        22        are the few essential elements we wanted to bring to 

        23        your attention before you begin your evidence. 

        24   

        25        Yes, Professor Hinds, please?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, this 

        27        witness will testify for the most part in open session, 

        28        but there are some preliminary matters that we would 

        29        like to go into a closed session just for a short period 

        30        of time and I will notify the Court at the appropriate

        12   Q.   Good morning, Witness.

        13   A.   Good morning, Counsel. 

        14   Q.   Witness, we'd like to show you a document, it is in 

        15        English.  We would like you to -- the interpreter will 

        16        read for you the information contained in this, and if 

        17        it is correct, we would like you to sign it and date it.

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, we are submitting this as 

        19        Defendant Exhibit 27. 

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Are you sure that it is okay, the contents are 

        21        correct, you to have check here?

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can I have the document.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Interpreter, what does the witness say about 

        24        the contents of that document?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, I'm going to deal with it.

        26   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        27   Q.   Witness, I see that you have signed the document and you 

        28        have dated it.  Is this indicative that you agree with 

        29        the contents thereof? 

        30   A.   That is correct, Counsel.

         2        Defendant's Exhibit 27.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection from the Prosecution?

         4   MR. FLEMING: No objection.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: So let the document be admitted as Defence 

         6        Exhibit No. 27 and the same shall be kept under seal as 

         7        it contains the personal particulars of this witness who 

         8        is a protected witness.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, just a housekeeping matter.

        14        this side, but I am beginning to feel a bit warm.  Could 

        15        we have the technician see if something could be done?  

        16   MR. FLEMING: I agree with my learned friend, this side, 

        17        Your Honour, I am perspiring already.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: We have always had problems in this courtroom 

        19        with these equipments.

        20        

        21        Registry, can you please ask the technician to look into 

        22        this matter as urgently as possible, so that counsel and 

        23        all of us can work.

        24   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lord.  We have taken note of that. 

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, we would now like to go into 

        26        closed session for a few minutes just to get some 

        27        particulars.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will go into closed session to enable 

        29        Counsel to raise questions some of which might have a 

        30        bearing on the identity of the witness, as indicated by

         2        that he is careful not to mention names of people and 

         3        places which have a connection with his identity.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Witness, do you recall meeting with me last year in 

         7        Rwanda? 

         8   A.   Yes, I recall. 

         9   Q.   And, did you remember at some time you gave me a 

        10        statement and you signed that statement, do you recall 

        11        that? 

        12   A.   Yes, I remember.

        13   Q.   Do you recall what month that was? 

        14   A.   Yes, I remember the month. 

        15   Q.   What month was that?

        16   A.   It was 25th September 2001.

        17   Q.   Witness, I am going to show you a six-page document, 

        18        handwritten, and I would like you to look at the last 

        19        page and see if you recognise your signature on the last 

        20        page.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Show it to Mr. Fleming.

        22   THE WITNESS: Yes, I recognise this signature as being mine.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can I have the document back, please?

        24   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        25   Q.   Witness, the information that you gave in the statement, 

        26        is it accurate? 

        27   A.   That is correct, the information is correct. 

        28   Q.   Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli? 

        29   A.   Yes, I know him.

        30   Q.   When did you first meet Juvénal Kajelijeli for the first

         1        time? 

         2   A.   I got to know him when he became a bourgmestre in our 

         3        commune, the commune of Mukingo. 

         4   Q.   What year was that, sir? 

         5   A.   Well, I got to know him from 1988 all the way to 1993, 

         6        he was the bourgmestre of our commune. 

         7   Q.   Did you know whether at some time he was no longer 

         8        bourgmestre, did you know that? 

         9   A.   Personally, I wouldn't know the circumstances in which a 

        10        bourgmestre would replace another, but we used to hear 

        11        that this or that bourgmestre had been replaced by 

        12        another one. 

        13   Q.   Did you at some point in time learn that Juvénal 

        14        Kajelijeli was replaced as a bourgmestre, and if so, 

        15        when did that take place, if you know? 

        16   A.   I recall that in 1993, at one point in time he left his 

        17        post and somebody else replaced him.

        18   Q.   Do you know the name of the person who replaced him as 

        19        bourgmestre in 1993? 

        20   A.   He was replaced in that position by the former 

        21        conseiller of the Busogo secteur, his name was Asiel 

        22        Ndisetse.  Ndisetse is spelt N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you repeat that please, Interpreter?

        24   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        25   Q.   Was that in the early part of the year or the latter 

        26        part of the year when he was replaced? 

        27   A.   It was at the beginning of the year 1993. 

        28   Q.   Do you know who followed as bourgmestre after Asiel 

        29        Ndisetse?

        30   A.   Yes, I know him.

         1   Q.   And could you tell the Tribunal the name of this person? 

         2   A.   The person who replaced him is Emmanuel Harerimana.  I

         1        has identified the Accused, Juvénal Kajelijeli in the 

         2        courtroom well.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Now, Witness, you indicated that some time in the early 

         5        part of 1993, Mr. Kajelijeli was succeeded in office by 

         6        two individuals.  Were any of these people serving in an 

         7        acting capacity? 

         8   A.   I am unable to answer this question because we observed 

         9        that there was a bourgmestre who was appointed to that 

        10        position, but I will not be able to say if someone was 

        11        appointed as acting bourgmestre or in any other 

        12        capacity.  All I know is that somebody was appointed to 

        13        that position there was no popular consultation.  There 

        14        was no voting; somebody was just appointed.

        15   Q.   Witness, do you know whether or not multiparty system 

        16        existed in Rwanda at some point in time? 

        17   A.   Yes.

        18   Q.   Do you know when was the institution of multiparty 

        19        system in Rwanda? 

        20   A.   From the year 1991, that is when we started hearing 

        21        radio programmes on multiparty system.

        22   Q.   And prior to 1991, sir, what was the party in existence 

        23        in Rwanda, prior to 1991? 

        24   A.   It was the MRND party which was in Rwanda?

        25   Q.   And sir, do you know what political parties existed 

        26        after multiparty system was instituted in 1991?  Do you 

        27        know the names of the parties that existed? 

        28   A.   There were the following political parties:  MRND, MDR, 

        29        PSD, PDI, CDR and other parties that I cannot remember, 

        30        there were so many in the country.

        25   Q.   Now, sir, prior to 1993, were there ******* 

        26        *****that existed in the Mukingo commune or in

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I will -- there is a

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: We follow you, except that there is an issue 

         9        that perhaps might arise with regard to the position.  

        10        So, would you like to consider?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I am considering it, right now, 

        12        Your Honour. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Without any further comment, perhaps. If you 

        14        want, you can follow it up in a different forum, 

        15        perhaps.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, sure.  I didn't recall, I asked the 

        17        witness the objectives of the organisation.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: In fact, you had gone very -- we can't follow 

        19        it up, but I wish it could be --

        25        enable counsel to ask questions, some of which could 

        26        have a bearing on the identity of the witness.

         1   THE WITNESS: Very well, sir.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Sir, when did you first learn of the president's death?

         4   A.   I heard of the death of the president of the republic in 

         5        the morning of the 7th April l994.

         6   Q.   Witness, I have just recalled that I forgot to ask you a 

         7        couple of questions concerning your confession.

         8        

         9        Did you write the confession yourself, or did someone 

        10        write it for you?

        11   A.   I did not write my letter of confession myself.  

        12        ***** there are lawyers who know how to write such 

        13        letters.  So I dictated what I wanted to say and someone 

        14        else would write what I said.

        15   Q.   And did you then sign that particular letter; that is, 

        16        your confession?

        17   A.   Yes, I signed my confession.

        18   Q.   Now, you have testified that you know someone by the 

        19        name of (Name struck out on order of the Court as it may 

        20        have a link to the identity of the witness); is that 

        21        correct?

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  I hope he is not a protected witness?

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Well, Your Honour, I am not dealing with 

        24        anything concerning -- I don't want to say any more 

        25        because what I am asking is just with respect --

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, if, for example, if the case is that he 

        27        or she is a potential witness who might come here, but 

        28        protected, then, of course, the names must be respected 

        29        as well, because you never know, we are in open session

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Witness, where were you when you first heard the death 

         4        of the president?

         5   A.   I was at home.

         6   Q.   And could you tell the Chamber how you learned of the 

         7        president's death?

         8   A.   I learnt of the death of the president through the 

         9        radio.

        10   Q.   Do you recall what time of day it was?

        11   A.   Yes.

        12   Q.   What time was it?

        13   A.   It was at 6:00 in the morning.

        14   Q.   Were there any instructions given over the radio to the 

        15        citizens, what they should or should not do?

        16   A.   Yes, the radio asked the people to stay at home and not 

        17        to move.

        18   Q.   And what did you do after you learnt of the president's 

        19        death?

        20   A.   I heard noise coming from the Byangabo market, and I 

        21        wasn't able to contain myself, I was curious.  So, I 

        22        went to the place mainly to know more about the death, 

        23        of the President of the Republic.

        24   Q.   And when you went to Byangabo, can you describe what you 

        25        saw?

        26   A.   I went to Byangabo, and when we got there I realised 

        27        that at Byangabo shopping centre there were many people 

        28        of all walks of life.  There were refugees who had come 

        29        from Cyeru, spelt C-Y-E-R-U; from Butaro, spelt, 

        30        B-U-T-A-R-O; from Kidaho, spelt, K-I-D-A-H-O; and from

         1        Kinigi, spelt K-I-N-I-G-I.  But let me specify that 

         2        these individuals were living beside the main road, but 

         3        they had come there much earlier, fleeing from RPF 

         4        attacks.  There were also members -- the resident 

         5        population, or people who lived close to Byangabo.

         6   Q.   How did you know that these people were refugees and 

         7        from those various areas like Kinigi and Butaro?

         8   A.   One couldn't ignore refugees because they had certain 

         9        characteristics, and on the radio, we had heard it said 

        10        that the RPF had attacked these places.  There were also 

        11        people who informed us about the attacks and these 

        12        refugees.

        13   Q.   Can you tell the Trial Chamber around what time you got 

        14        to the Byangabo market -- when you made these 

        15        observation?

        16   A.   I got to Byangabo at 7 o'clock exactly.

        17   Q.   And could you tell the Tribunal what happened after you 

        18        got there?

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Could you, please, interpret slowly?  That is 

        20        a long answer, Interpreter.

        21   THE WITNESS: When I reached Byangabo market, I found many 

        22        people there who were a bit rowdy and agitated.  I found 

        23        the conseiller of Busogo secteur.  After a few moments, 

        24        Lieutenant Mburuburungero, spelt, 

        25        M-B-U-R-U-B-U-R-E-N-G-E-R-O -- Lieutenant Mburuburengero 

        26        arrived at the place and he informed us that the 

        27        president's plane had been shot down and that Tutsis had 

        28        a role in that killing.  And he asked us where was the 

        29        Tutsi who responded to the name Rukara.  The Tutsi known 

        30        as Rukara made things at the Mukamira camp -- the

         1        Lieutenant asked us where his residence was and asked us 

         2        at the same time to go and fetch him.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Just a moment.

         4   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: The Tutsis were -- the person named 

         5        Rukara was making breezeblocks at the camp mentioned.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you read back the entire question, if you 

         7        have it?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: The question or the answer?

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: I am sorry -- the answer.  Thank you, Counsel.  

        10        Yes, do it slowly, please.  Tell the witness to hold on 

        11        a bit.

        12   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: "When I arrived at the Byangabo 

        13        market, I found many people there who were a bit crazy 

        14        and were a bit agitated, there was also the conseiller 

        15        of the Busogo secteur.  After a few moments, 

        16        Mburuburungero arrived at the place, he told us that the 

        17        President's plane had been shot down, and that Tutsis 

        18        had played a role in the downing of the plane.  He asked 

        19        us where Tutsis answering to the name Rukara lived.  

        20        This person Rukara made breezeblocks at the Mukamira 

        21        military camp.  The Lieutenant asked us where his house 

        22        was and asked us to go and fetch him.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Now, sir, prior to --

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: There is a word that Judge Ramaroson has heard 

        25        in French -- can you ask -- get it from the interpreter 

        26        straightaway, Judge.  Please go ahead.

        27   JUDGE RAMAROSON: What is "briquette"; is that a French word?

        28   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: It is the word that translates into 

        29        the breezeblocks into the English.  These are blocks 

        30        with holes in them and they are often used for aeration

         1        in a building.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, the breezeblocks.  Where were these being 

         3        made, according to the answer?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Rukira camp.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Rukira camp. Okay.

         6   THE WITNESS: When the lieutenant arrived, he told us that, 

         7        Tutsis who are making breezeblocks in Mukamira military 

         8        camp, where do they live?  That was the question.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Can I continue, Your Honour?

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.  Maybe you can advise -- also 

        11        Counsel, give him time -- make questions into short 

        12        space so that we can follow.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Witness, try to give your answers and then wait until I 

        15        ask another question and then you can expand on it.  Do 

        16        you understand?

        17   A.   Very well.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, and we will also be taking our lunch 

        19        break, Counsel at 1:00, so you can organise your work 

        20        accordingly.

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Witness, you mentioned that you saw a conseiller of your 

        24        secteur when you arrived at Busogo.  What was the 

        25        conseiller's name?

        26   A.   The conseiller was Asiele Ndisetse.

        27   Q.   What was that conseiller doing -- what did you see him 

        28        doing, if anything, when you arrived there?

        29   A.   Yes, I saw the conseiller do something.  He asked the 

        30        people, especially, the youth who were there not to

         1        attack any other member of the population.

         2   Q.   And can you tell the Tribunal what was the attitude of 

         3        the youth, including yourself at that time?

         4   A.   When Lieutenant Mburuburengero arrived, he asked us to 

         5        go and fetch Rukara, we brought him.  And when we 

         6        started to beat him up, the lieutenant told us that he 

         7        was going to Ruhengere and that when he came back, he 

         8        wanted to see that we had killed all the Tutsis.  When 

         9        he left we immediately killed Rukara.  We remained where 

        10        we were.  And then Lieutenant Mburuburengero came back; 

        11        he saw that the people were there not doing anything.  

        12        He wondered what had happened -- he asked what had 

        13        happened.  The people said this conseiller here stopped 

        14        us from carrying out reprisals on the Tutsis.

        15   Q.   And what happened after the people identified the 

        16        conseiller as stopping you carrying out reprisals on the 

        17        Tutsis?

        18   A.   Lieutenant Mburuburengero gave orders that the 

        19        conseiller be killed, and immediately the person 

        20        concerned withdrew and was able to flee.

        21   Q.   Did youth run after the conseiller?  Did you see them 

        22        chase the conseiller or did they remain there?

        23   A.   The youth remained where they were because most of them 

        24        were not in support of the killing, but the conseiller 

        25        fled and immediately the orders were given that Rukara's 

        26        older brother known as Lucien be brought.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think we can stop at this 

        28        point.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We will adjourn these proceeding and 

        30        resume our work at half past two.  Please, Interpreter,

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  We are in 

         4        open session.  Could you, please, Counsel, proceed?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Good afternoon witness.  How are you?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  We were discussing Rukara when we adjourned 

         9        and he had just talked about his elder brother Lucien.

        10   THE WITNESS: Good afternoon, Counsel.  I am fine.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, you had testified that Lieutenant Mburuburengo 

        13        -- I think it is Mburuburengero had given you certain 

        14        instructions.  Could you tell this Court whether or not 

        15        you went and fetched someone by the name of Rukara?

        16   A.   Yes, I did.  That person gave me instructions to the 

        17        effect that I should go and fetch Rukara.

        18   Q.   And where did you go to fetch Rukara?

        19   A.   We went to fetch him in his house.

        20   Q.   And approximately how far was Rukara's house from where 

        21        you were at Byangabo market?

        22   A.   There is a distance of about 300 metres between the two 

        23        places.

        24   Q.   And who accompanied you, if anyone, to fetch Rukara?

        25   A.   We were many to go and fetch him.  Regarding those who 

        26        got him out of his house, there was myself, Dusabimana, 

        27        I will spell that, D-U-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A; there was also 

        28        Musafiri, M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I; there was also Mbonankira, 

        29        M-B-O-N-A-N-K-I-R-A.  We were assisted by Semanza, 

        30        S-E-M-A-N-Z-A.

         1   Q.   And when you took Rukara out of his house, what did you 

         2        do with him, if anything?

         3   A.   We took him to the road and we killed him.

         4   Q.   Who killed him, specifically?

         5   A.   In fact, I started hitting him and others joined in.

         6   Q.   What weapons, if any, did you use to kill Rukara?

         7   A.   We used metal pipes which we found in the neighbourhood 

         8        and we hit him with these metal pipes.

         9   Q.   And can you tell the Chamber where these beatings took 

        10        place, and where was Rukara killed?

        11   A.   First of all, Rukara was hit next to the tree which is 

        12        near to the restaurant of one Tebura -- Tebura is, 

        13        T-E-B-U-R-A -- and then the people continued beating him 

        14        and he fell, more specifically, in front of the house of 

        15        one Barasesa.  Barasesa is, B-A-R-A-S-E-S-A.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel -- Professor Hinds, is it the same 

        17        Rukara that was talked about before we took the lunch  

        18        break?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is correct.  No, we are just on Rukara, 

        20        we are not on Lucien yet.  I will get to that later.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Yes, go on, Counsel.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Now, with respect to Rukara, you mentioned two 

        24        locations; the tree, and you mentioned two houses.  

        25        Where were the houses located, and the tree?

        26   A.   The difference between the tree and the restaurant that 

        27        I referred to is about four metres.  Now, the distance 

        28        between that tree and Barasesa's house could be about 

        29        ten metres.

        30   Q.   Now, were these locations all in Byangabo market?

         1   A.   Yes, that is correct, those houses are located in the 

         2        centre of Byangabo.

         3   Q.   Now, after Rukara, was beaten and killed, what did you 

         4        do next?

         5   A.   After we killed Rukara we went and fetched his big 

         6        brother called Lucien.

         7   Q.   And where did you go to fetch Lucien?

         8   A.   We found him also at home.

         9   Q.   Was this at the same location that you previously found 

        10        Rukara?

        11   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        12   Q.   And when you said "we went to fetch him," can you tell 

        13        the Tribunal who was it who went to fetch him?

        14   A.   There were a lot of young people in that place, 

        15        including refugees who run in the direction of the house 

        16        of Rukara and Lucien.

        17   Q.   And who took Lucien out of the house, if anyone?

        18   A.   It was Musafiri who got Lucien out of the house. 

        19        Musafiri is, M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I.

        20   Q.   And could you tell the Tribunal what was done with 

        21        Lucien then at that time when he was taken out of the 

        22        house by Musafiri?

        23   A.   Musafiri killed him at the threshold of the house.  He 

        24        killed him with a knife.

        25   Q.   Was GAO present at that time?

        26   A.   Yes, he was present.

        27   Q.   Did you, at that time -- any time that morning see 

        28        Juvénal Kajelijeli at Byangabo?

        29   A.   On that day, I did not see him.

        30   Q.   Now, you testified that Lieutenant Mburuburengero gave

         1        you instructions and then he came back.  Could you tell 

         2        the Tribunal at the time he returned, was Rukara and 

         3        Lucien already dead?

         4   A.   No, when he came back Rukara had already been killed, 

         5        but Lucien had not yet been killed and Lucien was killed 

         6        after the lieutenant ordered that he be brought and be 

         7        killed.

         8   Q.   After Lucien was killed, what, if anything, did you then 

         9        do?

        10   A.   I did nothing -- nothing in particular -- I had nothing 

        11        in particular to do.

        12   Q.   On that particular morning, were you wearing uniform of 

        13        any type?

        14   A.   No, I was not wearing uniform.

        15   Q.   Was anyone within the group who went to fetch Rukara or 

        16        Lucien wearing any uniform?

        17   A.   No, nobody was wearing uniform among those people.

        18   Q.   How were you dressed?

        19   A.   I was wearing ordinary clothes similar to what I am 

        20        wearing now.

        21   Q.   Did there come a time that morning when you left 

        22        Byangabo?

        23   A.   Yes.

        24   Q.   And can you tell the Court under what circumstance you 

        25        left Byangabo and where did you go to?

        26   A.   After we killed Lucien we moved toward Rwankeri a 

        27        locality where Tutsis lived.  Rwankeri is spelt, 

        28        R-W-A-N-K-E-R-I.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe, Counsel, for the record, the witness 

        30        has just said that he was dressed in ordinary clothes as

         1        he is wearing now.  How is he dressed?  How do you 

         2        describe that?

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do you want me to put the question or you 

         4        will put it?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Just for the record, can you describe what he 

         6        is wearing?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I prefer the witness to describe what he is 

         8        wearing.

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Witness, can you describe what you are wearing now?  You 

        11        said you were wearing ordinary clothes as what you are 

        12        wearing.  Could you describe what you were wearing?

        13   A.   Now, I am wearing a shirt and a pair of trousers.

        14   Q.   Witness, the question that I put to you previously is; 

        15        why did you go to Rwankeri?

        16   A.   The lieutenant insisted by saying that the Tutsi played 

        17        a role in the death of the president and that we should 

        18        continue killing them.  We were obeying his 

        19        instructions.

        20   Q.   Now, did you travel to Rwankeri alone or did you travel 

        21        with others?

        22   A.   There were a lot of other people.

        23   Q.   Now, in getting from Byangabo to Rwankeri, how many 

        24        roads are there leading from Rwankeri to Byangabo?

        25   A.   There are roads that lead to Rwankeri from Byangabo.

        26   Q.   Is one of the routes to Rwankeri in front of the ISAE 

        27        institute -- that road -- can you take the road in front 

        28        of the ISAE institute to Rwankeri?

        29   A.   This road that goes through ISAE leads to Rwankeri.

        30   Q.   Did you take that road that morning of the 7th when you

         2   A.   No.

         3   Q.   What road did you take?

         4   A.   I took the road that goes through Byangabo.

         5   Q.   And can you tell the Trial Chamber whether the people 

         6        who travelled with you to Rwankeri were Interahamwe?

         7   A.   I have told you that there were many people from all 

         8        walks of life, namely; the Interahamwe, members of the 

         9        displaced population which had settled in the area, and 

        10        there was the local inhabitants.  So, there were many 

        11        people.

         1        1500H

         2   Q.   What happened, if anything, when you got to Rwankeri  

         3        can you describe to the Chamber what happened?

         4   A.   When we got to Rwankeri, we started attacking the 

         5        Tutsis; they had already left their houses.  One would 

         6        say they had been warned of our attack and they went up 

         7        on a hill in the neighbourhood.

         8   Q.   Did that hill have a name, sir?  The hill where you say 

         9        the Tutsis had gathered.

        10   A.   Yes, that hill is known as Busogo.

        11   Q.   And when you got to the hill, what did you do, if 

        12        anything, and what did the Tutsis do?

        13   A.   The Tutsis who were on that hill were armed with bows 

        14        and arrows and spears.  We launched an attack on these 

        15        Tutsis and when we were doing so, two military vehicles 

        16        came to the place.

        17   Q.   Were there any soldiers aboard those military vehicles?

        18   A.   Yes, there were soldiers aboard the vehicles.

        19   Q.   Could you identify any of the soldiers who were aboard 

        20        those vehicles?

        21   A.   There was a soldier I was able to recognise.  His name 

        22        was -- and that was the name he was known by, Rachel. 

        23   Q.   What, if anything, did you see Rachel do that particular 

        24        morning at Rwankeri?

        25   A.   Rachel took one Mwambutsa and took him near one of the 

        26        vehicles in order to get fuel which was going to be used 

        27        to burn down houses.  Mwambutsa is spelt, 

        28        M-W-A-M-B-U-T-S-A, Mwambutsa.

        29   Q.   Do you know, sir -- withdrawn.  You testified earlier 

        30        that you had not seen Juvénal Kajelijeli all that day on

         1        the 7th at Byangabo or Rwankeri.  Did you see his 

         2        vehicle?

         3   A.   No, I didn't see his vehicle.

         4   Q.   Now, when the military came at Rwankeri, what did they 

         5        do, if anything?

         6   A.   These soldiers began to shoot.  And when the Tutsis 

         7        heard the firing, they went back into their houses and 

         8        they locked themselves in.

         9   Q.   And can you tell the Tribunal what happened after the 

        10        Tutsis went into their houses and locked themselves in?

        11   A.   At that time we had started breaking down the windows 

        12        and doors in which the Tutsis were hiding and the 

        13        soldiers were throwing grenades into the houses and were 

        14        shooting into the houses.  The people who tried to 

        15        escaped from those houses were killed by use of 

        16        traditional weapons.

        17   Q.   Did you participate in those killings?

        18   A.   I didn't kill anyone in Rwankeri.

        19   Q.   But were you present?

        20   A.   Yes, I was.

        21   Q.   Now, do you know who -- withdrawn.  Do you know the 

        22        names of Tutsis who were killed in Rwankeri?

        23   A.   There are some names that I could give, but I didn't 

        24        know the other people.

        25   Q.   Could you tell the Tribunal the names of people who you 

        26        knew who were killed or any family names who were killed 

        27        in Rwankeri?

        28   A.   An old man known as Bihutu was killed in Rwankeri.  

        29        Bihutu is spelt, B-I-H-U-T-U; one Karasankima and his 

        30        daughter, I will spell Karasankima,

         1        K-A-R-A-S-A-N-K-I-M-A.  There was another boy whose name 

         2        I don't know and was also killed.  Nyiraburanga was also 

         3        killed.  Nyiraburanga is spelt, N-Y-I-R-A-B-U-R-A-N-G-A, 

         4        this was a young girl.  Also killed was one Sengoga 

         5        spelt, S-E-N-G-O-G-A; also killed was Sebirayi and 

         6        Gasominari. Seburayi is spelt, S-E-B-I-R-A-Y-I.  

         7        Gasominari is spelt G-A-S-O-M-I-N-A-R-I.

         8   Q.   At Rwankeri did anyone instruct you to obtain weapons?

         9   A.   No, no one gave instructions for weapons to be obtained.

        10   Q.   Did you know someone by the -- did you know someone at 

        11        that time by the name of Rudatinya?

        12   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Could Counsel kindly spell that 

        13        name?  Could you please repeat the question?

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Yes.  I am asking whether or not the witness on that 

        16        morning knew someone with the family name of Rudatinya 

        17        spelt, R-U-D-A-T-I-N-Y-A, Rudatinya?

        18   A.   You mean the old Rudatinya, the old man Rudatinya, I 

        19        didn't see him that morning.  But if you want I can say 

        20        something about that individual.

        21   Q.   The question I am asking you is, did you know whether or 

        22        not there were killings of Rudatinya's family members 

        23        that morning in Rwankeri?

        24   A.   Yes, Rudatinya's family members were killed on that 

        25        occasion.

        26   Q.   Was GAO present at Rwankeri?

        27   A.   Yes, he was there.

        28   Q.   How long did you stay at Rwankeri that day?

        29   A.   The killings in that location started between 8:30 and 

        30        9:00 in the morning, and which concluded at 4 p.m. after

         1        which I went back home.

         2   Q.   Did you see any rapes that took place at Rwankeri that 

         3        day?

         4   A.   No, I didn't witness any rapes on that day.

         5   Q.   Did you -- did you hear about any rapes that occurred 

         6        that particular day at Rwankeri?

         7   A.   No, on that day, I didn't hear any mention of rapes in 

         8        Rwankeri.

         9   Q.   Later on after the events that took place in 1994, did 

        10        you hear any stories about rapes that took place there?

        11   A.   Yes, mention was made of them.

        12   Q.   When was the first time you heard about the rapes that 

        13        had taken place there?

        14   A.   There is what is known as Gacaca.  And any Gacaca -- and 

        15        Gacaca proceedings began in the prisons.  The prisoners 

        16        were speaking about events that took place in their 

        17        regions and they were saying the truth about anything 

        18        that happened in their areas, in their regions.  So, it 

        19        is in this framework that 47 detainees spoke of what had 

        20        happened in their regions within the framework of 

        21        Gacaca.  And it was in this occasion that I first heard 

        22        mention being made of rapes.

        23   Q.   And you said that in the Gacaca hearings, 47 detainees 

        24        gave testimonies; is that correct?

        25   A.   Yes.

        26   Q.   And were these detainees at the*****?

        27   A.   Yes,******-.

        28   Q.   And what were the dates of those Gacaca hearings?

        29   A.   That started from 1999 until the year 2002.

        30   Q.   And during those hearings, did any of those detainees

         1        mention the name of Juvénal Kajelijeli as being involved 

         2        in any of these crimes? 

         3   MR. FLEMING: With respect, Your Honours, that's becoming far 

         4        too remote to be probative.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: I think you can go on if you want.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you.

         7   THE WITNESS: No one mentioned the name of Kajelijeli.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Was GAO there at these Gacaca hearings?

        10   A.   Yes.

        11   Q.   Was GDQ there?

        12   A.   I don't know the name of that person.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        14   THE WITNESS: Maybe you could write down the name of this 

        15        person on a piece of paper in order to assist me. 

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I would like to -- we could do 

        17        it one of two ways.  I can go into closed session, put 

        18        the name on the record and then come back out, or we can 

        19        pass out the slip of paper.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: No, we prefer a complete record rather than 

        21        having this piece of paper which could be misplaced in 

        22        the course of time.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.  Your Honour, then I would ask that we 

        24        go into closed session for a short period of time.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         2   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         3   Q.   Were there any officials at this Gacaca hearing that you 

         4        just testified about?

         5   A.   Yes, there were important people present.

         6   Q.   Were you able to identify any of them by name?

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: What is -- what are you trying to demonstrate 

         8        Counsel, if we may follow you? 

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, all I am trying to demonstrate 

        10        at this point is that there was a public hearing at 

        11        which this witness and others who have -- some of whom 

        12        had testified in this trial, were present who were 

        13        giving testimony.  No one mentioned Kajelijeli.  The 

        14        events that we are talking about are events -- the 

        15        events like they were dealing with -- are events that 

        16        are contemporary with this witness's testimony here 

        17        today, which is all that we are interesting in.  

        18        

        19        Now, I am dealing with who was there in the event that 

        20        we can deal with corroboration of this witness's 

        21        testimony and things what he is saying happened, 

        22        identifying individuals who were present at these 

        23        particular -- at least at this particular hearing.  So, 

        24        I just want to spread on the record the people who were 

        25        there asides from individuals who are incarcerated with 

        26        him, they were public officials.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: But according to his evidence is that 

        28        according to him, he saw no rape or he heard of no rape 

        29        at the material time, and --

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: What he said was that the only time that he

         1        heard about the rape was at the Gacaca trial which was 

         2        heard in the prison.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: I then asked him concerning whether or not 

         5        at that trial, at that hearing whether anyone mentioned 

         6        the name of Kajelijeli being involved in any criminal 

         7        activity on the particular date in question. 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Now, he said they also went, that is some 

        10        prisoners left the facility and went to Gacaca trials 

        11        that occurred in the community.  And it is in that 

        12        context I am now developing who was there, and I am 

        13        about to ask him after he answers that question another 

        14        question.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe you can just raise in a very fast way 

        16        and have this matter concluded.  We don't see the -- 

        17   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, may I raise the issue as well. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        19   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours would recall that I objected a 

        20        while ago actually to this and said that it was too 

        21        remote to be probative.  The evidence given here must be 

        22        of necessity but relevant to be probative.  

        23        

        24        What our learned friend is trying to do is to say that 

        25        because there was another proceeding somewhere, which 

        26        presumably is recorded and Kajelijeli's name wasn't 

        27        mentioned, therefore, that in some way inversely he 

        28        wasn't there.  Now, we object to this line of evidence, 

        29        including what he is going to do now.  First, because 

        30        it's not probative; second, we have not -- this 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        obviously is alibi evidence, and we have heard it for 

         2        the first time as Your Honours have heard it, not what's 

         3        said to be Gacaca in the prison and that was contained 

         4        in the statement that we received, but now our learned 

         5        friend is telling us about this for the first time now, 

         6        and we've never heard any of this before and we object 

         7        to it on that basis as well because the purpose of alibi 

         8        material, so that it can be properly dealt with.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is by no stretch of the 

        10        imagination, alibi.  There is no one who is here 

        11        testifying, nor is there any assertions that Juvénal 

        12        Kajelijeli was any place that any witness is, in fact, 

        13        testifying to.  That is what an alibi defence is.  An 

        14        alibi defence is that the defendant was here, he was -- 

        15        I saw him elsewhere.  None of that is here, and so, 

        16        therefore, what Mr. Fleming is talking in terms of alibi 

        17        is misconstrued.  

        18        

        19        The issue here is are in terms of whether it is 

        20        probative.  The witness is testifying about events that 

        21        took place during the time period that he, in fact, gave 

        22        a statement about.  He is testifying that he has, in 

        23        fact, attended proceedings where there were inquiries 

        24        made from within the community about events that took 

        25        place during the same time period.  What we are, all of 

        26        us, are searching for is the truth, and the evidence 

        27        must be relevant and must be material in order to meet 

        28        the test of whether it is probative.  The evidence is 

        29        relevant; it deals specifically with this witness 

        30        attending proceedings where there were individuals

          KAJELIJELI                                      18 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        within the community at the Gacaca hearings, where they 

         2        were dealing with what?  With the events that took place 

         3        on which all of us are trying to search to find out what 

         4        occurred.  The fact that people who testified here 

         5        participated and none of them mentioned Kajelijeli is, 

         6        in fact, probative.  

         7        

         8        Now, what weight the Tribunal gives to it compared with 

         9        other evidence is for the Tribunal to determine.  But 

        10        certainly, this witness, he was there, he heard what 

        11        transpired.  If individuals had said a number of people 

        12        had accused Kajelijeli, it would be equally probative 

        13        from the standpoint of notwithstanding it might have 

        14        been hearsay, but from the standpoint of that those 

        15        statements were made for whatever weight they would be 

        16        given.  

        17        

        18        But at this particular time, the witness says that there 

        19        were individuals who came to this Tribunal who top the 

        20        witness stand and, in fact, accused Kajelijeli.  They 

        21        were present in other proceedings when they were 

        22        discussing openly what occurred and who did what, they 

        23        never mentioned him.  That is relevant and that is 

        24        material.  I could understand the Prosecutor objecting 

        25        to it because it does not, in fact, aid and help his 

        26        case.  But what we are dealing with is the truth. 

        27   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, my learned friend becomes so 

        28        offensive.  I don't object to material which doesn't 

        29        help my case; I object to material on proper legal 

        30        basis.  And the proper legal basis that my learned

         1        friend has put is sheer gobbledegook.  There is no legal 

         2        basis that he has just presented.  If it's not alibi, 

         3        into what category does it fit?  It doesn't fit with any 

         4        legal category known to any of these courts, and it's 

         5        just going on and on and on, trying to get in as remote 

         6        evidence as he possibly can.  Thank you, 

         7        Your Honour. 

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, on the question of evidence, 

         9        the evidence is not -- it is not alibi, and because 

        10        evidence is not alibi, does it mean that it is not 

        11        admissible?   That's nonsense.  The evidence goes to -- 

        12        it is relevant.  Why is it relevant?  It is relevant 

        13        because it deals with whether or not witnesses who 

        14        previously testified in these proceedings, in fact, were 

        15        present at another proceedings when they were asked what 

        16        occurred on that particular day, the day they testified 

        17        before this Tribunal and they never mentioned 

        18        Mr. Kajelijeli.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Professor Hinds, I think we have told you to 

        20        conclude this matter.  You can ask the two substantive 

        21        questions on that and have this matter finalised.  We 

        22        don't want to go into who was at that meeting; who 

        23        spoke, let us get the answer of the witness on that 

        24        general aspect.  We are not going to be overdrawn into 

        25        inquiries that cannot be followed up later.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I agree with you one hundred percent, 

        27        Your Honour.

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        29   Q.   At that public proceedings, did anyone accuse 

        30        Juvénal Kajelijeli of committing any of the crimes?

         1   A.   No one mentioned the name of Juvénal Kajelijeli.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: You can move to the next point, Counsel.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, at Rwankeri on April 7th, 1994, did you see 

         6        anyone cut off the breast of a woman and lick her blood?

         7   A.   I did not see anyone do that.

         8   Q.   Sir, in the evening on April 7th, 1994, were you aware 

         9        whether anyone went to ISAE for drinks -- not anyone, 

        10        rather, any Interahamwe?

        11   A.   I do not know of any Interahamwe who went there to have 

        12        a drink.

        13   Q.   Do you know if any Interahamwe went to the bar of 

        14        Juvénal Kajelijeli after the killings in Rwankeri on the 

        15        7th?

        16   A.   I do not know anyone.

        17   Q.   Sir, do you know whether there were any attack at the 

        18        nun's convent on April 7th?

        19   A.   I do not know of these attacks.

        20   Q.   Were there any looting that took place at or around 

        21        Rwankeri that April 7th, 1994?

        22   A.   Yes, the looting took place.

        23   Q.   Do you -- were you, withdrawn -- were you able to 

        24        identify any of the individuals who were involved in 

        25        looting at Rwankeri?

        26   A.   Yes, there are some people -

        28        interpretation is not very clear to me.

        30        The interpretation to the English interpreter is not

         1        clear.  That's what he says.  Can you repeat the answer?

         2   THE WITNESS: Yes, there were some persons, including women 

         3        who looted goods and other persons who killed cows and 

         4        ate them.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Were there any roadblocks that were set up on April 7th?

         7   A.   I did not see roadblocks.

         8   Q.   On April 8th, were you at Byangabo?

         9   A.   Yes, on that date, I was at Byangabo.

        10   Q.   Were you there all day?

        11   A.   I lived in the neighbourhood of Byangabo.  And each time 

        12        that I had nothing doing at home, I would go to 

        13        Byangabo.  And you will understand that this is a 

        14        marketplace and each time I had nothing doing at home, I 

        15        spend my time at Byangabo.  This means that most of the 

        16        time I was at Byangabo.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.  All right, we'll be taking a 

        18        break at four, I don't know how long do you still have 

        19        to go, Counsel?

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I have to go into few other areas.  I 

        21        think we'll go until five, close to 5 o'clock with this 

        22        witness.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Okay.  All right then, in that case we 

        24        would take a -- you can complete this aspect if you so 

        25        wish, then we'll take a break for 15 minutes and come -- 

        26        and when we come back, you continue.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay, I can stop right here, Your Honour.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay. 

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Which is a convenient place.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  And you say you intend to

         1        go on up to about 5:00? 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I think I have about 45 minutes more.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right, we'll stop here and take a 

         4        break for 15 minutes up to quarter past four.  Quarter 

         5        past four.

         6        (Court recess from 1600 to 1622)

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Yes.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, during the break we were 

         9        informed by Mr. Kajelijeli that his vision is blurred 

        10        and he cannot see the page in front of him.  I informed 

        11        the registry and they have summoned the doctor.  He has 

        12        instructed me to inform the Court that he is prepared to 

        13        proceed even though he cannot see because he does not 

        14        want it to appear that he is holding up the proceedings.  

        15        I don't want him to have a stroke on my conscience quite 

        16        frankly.  So I've told him to sit in there and to rest 

        17        because the last time his blood pressure was over 200.   

        18        So, I don't know what the situation is.  Prudence 

        19        suggest that we -- 30 minutes to go, we make sure that 

        20        the doctors see him, he is prepared for me to continue 

        21        my examination.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  What do you say to that, Mr. Fleming?  

        23        Any comment from the --

        24   MR. FLEMING: No, Your Honour.  We said before that we don't 

        25        want to stand between the man and his health, and we 

        26        look to the Court in these circumstances.  We don't 

        27        insist on going on in those circumstances.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We understand Professor Hinds, you said 

        29        -- you indicated, I know there cannot be very firm time 

        30        frames -- that you have about 45 minutes to complete

         1        your examination-in-chief. 

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's about it.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: So, I think we'll stop here to enable the 

         4        Accused to get medical attention and then resume these 

         5        proceedings tomorrow, and I hope in the course of the 

         6        remaining part of the day or by tomorrow morning, we'll 

         7        be advise of his health position.  But for the time 

         8        being, we'll adjourn these proceedings till tomorrow at 

         9        9:00 in the morning.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And could you please advise -- tell 

        12        Witness RGM that we have adjourned these proceedings 

        13        earlier than expected because the Accused may need 

        14        medical attention.  That is one.  Secondly, since he has 

        15        started testifying and he is on the stand, he should not 

        16        discuss his evidence with anybody else outside the Court 

        17        until we meet again tomorrow in the morning at 9:00.  

        18        

        19        So, until tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning, these 

        20        proceedings stand adjourned.
