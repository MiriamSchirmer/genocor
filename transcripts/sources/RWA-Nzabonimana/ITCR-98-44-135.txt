MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Registrar.  Could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal For Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 29th of June 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Rwamakuba, Case Number ICTR 98-44C-T.

Thank you, Your Honour 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  The appearances are the same.  

There were three issues to clear up before we start our proceedings this morning.  One issue with the EVD statement.  Two, the admission of the Defence exhibits outstanding.  And, three, a question on the submission raised yesterday.  I think I would start with the last first, Mr. O'Shea.  And I would like to find out just two questions which I would also expect a comment from the Prosecutor, if you have one.  The treatment of the signed will-say or statements by the witness, does that apply to all witnesses, including the witnesses called by the Defence?  

And secondly, enforcement; what is the consequence of failure to have the statement signed?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Yes, thank you, Your Honour, with regard to Your Honours first question, yes, it would apply to the Prosecution and Defence.  It would only be fair that it should do.

With regard to the second question, and as I said at the outset of my submission yesterday, there is no question of admissibility here.  We fully accept that all types of witness statements are admissible, and, indeed, must be disclosed.  That is why I emphasised that the issue here was not neither admissible or disclosure.  So there would be no consequence in that regard.  The fact that did --  even an original witness statement is not signed, does not prevent its admissibility, nor does it foreclose the duty of disclosure; so there is no consequence in that regard. 

And, otherwise, Your Honour, in my respectful submission, when there is a violation of a Rule, it is always a matter of discretion as to how the Trial Chamber would deal with that.  Some violations are more minimal than others and for some violations there need be no sanction.  There is an assumption, in my submission, that there are professional lawyers before the Court, mistakes can be made, small sins can be committed, and it doesn't necessarily imply that there must always be a sanction to a violation of the rule.

There may be an alternative remedy, if it is deemed to be appropriate that the will-say statements be signed and the witness is here, the simple remedy may be simply to direct the Prosecution to see their witness, and allow their witness to read through the statement and sign it or not sign it, which may involve an adjournment of five or ten minutes.  If there were problems to be created by that, then there may be no need for a remedy at all.  It also depends on the circumstances, Your Honour, because some will-say statements will cause more prejudice than others.  If we take the example of the GLM will-say statement, in my submission, the prejudice there is greater because we are dealing with a will-say statement which has a substantial amount of detail in it.  There may be other will-say statements which involve one or two lines and, essentially, no different from what is in the original statement, in which case no prejudice will be caused, but what we say is that it is a matter of good practice to have these will-say statements signed.  It enhances the Court role in monitoring and ensuring that the minimal guarantees are fulfilled.

So, in a way, what the Court could do is perhaps use mutual terminology.  If the Court were minded to accept this argument, the Court could use mutual terminology rather than use the word order, use the word direct, for instance, just to indicate that this is a matter of good practice and expectation on the part of the Prosecution.  But as I said yesterday, we don't -- we don't consider that it would be a grave violation of the minimum guarantees not to do it, we just consider that it would be proper and fair for the administration of justice.

In a national jurisdiction, these things might be dealt with through a general practice direction, or through the BARRIS themselves.  But in these international tribunals, we don't have the kind of facilities outside of the courtroom.  And so it is incumbent upon the Trial Chamber to do what it can under     Rule 54 to ensure a fair trial, both in terms of Rules of Evidence but also in terms of Rules of Procedures.  I'm sorry, as usual, I have gone on a bit long, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But there is one thing I wanted to take up, I would like you to just make a brief comment on -- you see, you use the concept of practice direction, this is something to be done by a practice direction.  Now, would a decision in this trial have the same effect as a practice direction affecting all trials?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Well, the technical distinction would be that a practice direction would have less binding force than an order.  The difficulty with a practice direction in this context is that I'm not sure that the institutional framework is really in place, both in terms of producing practice directions and also in terms of ensuring compliance.  And, as I said, in national jurisdictions, bar counsels have an enormous amount of control over the behavior of lawyers.  That is not the case here, and in that sense, there is a difficulty.  
Also, we are in the middle of a trial.  And a practice direction is something which conceivably involves elements other than law, and may take time.  We are having an average of one to two witnesses a day in this trial.  And we say this is a measure which we would like to have for the fairness of the trial of this Accused; so there is that difficulty as well.

I hope that answers Your Honours' question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it does.  

Do we have any comments on --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good morning to the Defence and to the court management.  

Respectfully, we would disagree, Your Honour, with regard to the Defence application.  My understanding is that they would like to request that the Prosecutor be required to have witnesses sign will-say statements.  I would like to begin by addressing the whole notion of a will-say statement.  There is nothing in our Rules of Procedure and Evidence --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a long submission?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have a long submission?
MR. WEBSTER:
It is not long, but I don't plan to miss any point, but it is not long.

There is nothing in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence that addresses will-say, Your Honour.  That is a terminology that I only begun to hear about with regularity in the last six or seven months or so.  I think in the Rules there is a reference -- there is a 67(D) that allows the parties to make a submission of additional evidence.  And that is provision under which we serve notice on the Defence of additional evidence that we would like the witness to comment on.  

The Defence suggestion that the statements be signed, that these notices be signed, invades upon the independence of the Prosecutor.  We have a procedure that we invoke for the taking of the statements.  If you look at a typical witness statement, there are four signatures on it.  There is a signature --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if the Prosecutor would please slow down for the interpreters. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, in your absence we have circulated a guideline to facilitate the interpreting facility.  And one of the -- one of the issues is speed of speech. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay, I will slow down. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And you are notorious for your speech.  So you have to think about it. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
But, you understand, Your Honour, I was reacting to the Court's observation that I was going to be long, so I was trying to speed up to make the proceedings much faster, but I will revert a bit.

Our concern fundamentally is that the request that the Defence is making invades the independence of the Prosecutor in how we organise our investigations and documents, our conversations with witnesses that we call.  

If you look at a typical OTP witness statement, there are four signatures on it.  As a matter of procedure, there are exceptions, but as a matter of procedure, there are two investigators that are present when a witness statement is taken.  There is the signature of the witness; there is also the signature of a certified interpreter.  That is not the situation when the lawyers go to speak to witnesses in a safe house here in Arusha.  

Usually, the lawyer is by himself.  There are different circumstances; I can't say that that is always the case.  But for the most part, this is an attorney that is going to speak to a witness and there is no official interpreter present.  There is an assistant that works with WVSS, who is not a trained interpreter, and that is the person who mediates the conversation, usually, between the attorney and the witness.  Right there, in that exchange between the lawyer and the witness, is a problem.  

Now, I understand that the Defence concern, that they would like to be able to cross-examine witnesses on these statements and they are not prevented from doing so.  In the Niyitegeka appeal decision, it has clarified that any record of a prior statement by a witness is a statement for Rule 66 purposes.  And we disclose investigator's notes now, and these will-say statements in order to put the Defence on notice of items or factual issues that the witness will address in their testimony.  But to require at that stage that these statements be signed is not -- does not present an issue of fairness for the Defence, and it is actually unfair to the witnesses themselves.  So that is the primary point that we wanted to address.

Will-say statements are made available so that the Defence is not taken by surprise.  And we do that to make the proceedings fair.  To now require us to have them signed elevates them to a status that they do not deserve.  And the option would be for us not to file these statements at all.  

So on that basis, Your Honour, we would submit that there is no reason.  There is no reason, in terms of fairness, why these statements should be signed.  So, I will conclude there.  I welcome questions from the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am going to have to try to curtail the time taken up on this matter this morning, but I will hear you, very briefly, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, I will do my best in my academic way.  With regard to the independence of the Prosecution, the independence of the Prosecutor does not mean that the Court cannot take measures to enhance the fairness of the trial when it involves activity of the Prosecution, I think that is clear.  In fact, this particular measure would promote the independence of the Prosecutor, would promote the independence of the Prosecutor because of promoting the transparency of the process of interviewing witnesses, and it would promote the independence of the Prosecutor because it protects Prosecution counsel from situations where the witness changes their evidence in the witness box.  

With regard to the logistical difficulties, we see no reason why the proper translator can't be there.  The fact that there is an admission that the proper translator isn't there, is, again, an admission that this exercise of will-say statements is being conducted without any real, genuine concern that the Defence have accurate notice of the defence against it.

And with regard to the comments about not filing at all, that is, of course, an option, but it is an option with consequences.  As my learned friend correctly points out, there are reasons for will-say statements.  And those reasons go back to the minimum guarantees which are indicated to             Your Honours.

If a will-say statement is not used at all, there may be the consequences that the Defence is not put on notice, and there may be a risk that either there is an adjournment or the evidence should be excluded.  There is jurisprudence on that.  So that could be an option of the Prosecutor, but one with consequences.  

Can I just have one moment, Your Honour?

Yes, I'm reminded by my learned friend with regard to the issue of the interpreter.  It is only at the time of the signing of the will-say statement that the interpreter is really needed, which should take a relatively short period of time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, if I can make one final comment.  The Defence application, Your Honour, is essentially an attempt to introduce procedures in our rules that are not there.  There is nothing in the Rules and nothing in the jurisprudence that tells us what a statement -- how a statement should be taken.  We take statements and record them and we disclose them months in advance of the witness's testimony.  

When we file what is referred to as a will-say statement, it is simply for purposes of putting the parties on notice, and the Court, that there are additional elements that the witness will go into.  That is an invention that we have improvised in this Tribunal.  

I can understand Mr. Hooper and Mr. O'Shea's concern, because they are coming from a legal tradition that focuses on a witness's statement prior to a witness's testimony.   That is not standard even within the common law tradition.  These statements that we serve months in advance simply to give the parties an idea of what the witness will say, the broad contours of the witness' testimony.  Over time, because of the continuous objections that the Defence makes, that such and such an item is not in a witness statement, we have improvised by coming up with these will-say statements, but they are not standard in our procedures, it is an improvisation that this Tribunal has adopted.  And now we are at the precipes of almost making it a requirement, when there is nothing in the Rules that make provision for it.  

And to make a decision on this issue in this way I think is going to have unfortunate consequences, across the board, for this trial and for other trials that come before this Chamber.  So our submission is that there should be no requirement, the Prosecutor should not be required to have witnesses sign these statements.  They have the status of statements independent of the witness's signature.  And if we -- if the Court takes the measure of requiring a signature to be affixed to the statement, we are going to have to change the way that we take these statements and have them interpreted.  And we don't have the facilities for that.  

Even now, when we go to prepare our witnesses for testimony, it is a problem finding sufficient interpreters.  And they are not even trained interpreters, necessarily.  These are simply Rwandans who speak English or who speak French who facilitate our conversations with the witness.  So, if these will-say statements are going to be elevated in our procedures, everything is going to have to change in response to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  As you appreciate, we have decided to take some time to consider this and we have started doing so, so this will facilitate our deliberation.  

Mr. Hooper, did I see you stand on this issue or was it something else?  

Yes, I think we will close this discussion here and we will try to get back to you as soon as possible on this matter.

Second issue, Defence exhibits.  Are you ready?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, Mr. President.  First of all, dealing with the witness before last, Witness AVC, I have four documents; his statement in English and French, his confirmation certificate, and will-say of the      22nd of June 2005.  And could those be exhibited, could the registrar assist me with the appropriate numbering of that exhibit?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence exhibits, Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, the next exhibit is D. 25. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Did you want these, Mr. Registrar, as one batch under 25, no?  So it will be 25A and B, being the statement of AVC, his only statement in this case.  The confirmation certificate would be Exhibit D. 26, and the will-say will be Exhibit D. 27.

Moving onto yesterday's witness, a witness who was completed yesterday, Witness AVD, I produce his statement in English and French, dated the 6th of November '03.  The Exhibit 28, D. 28 and his confirmation certificate, I put it like that, as Exhibit D. 29, and that bears the date of the                     16th of March 2005.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted into evidence.  Mr. Fry can you just confirm the --  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  And I was wondering should we put these under seal?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, given the content of those statements, they should be. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted under seal.  Thank you, Mr. Fry.
(Exhibit Nos. D. 25A and D. 25B admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 26 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 27 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit Nos. D. 28A and D. 28B admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 29 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings us completely up-to-date with all exhibits, Prosecution and Defence. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes it does, Mr. President.  I think we are up-to-date. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Now the last issue, Ms. Fall, do you have a position on the -- are you in a position to make a statement on the AVD issue from yesterday?  

You haven't got me?  You have not understood me.  Yesterday afternoon there was an issue raised because in the witness box the witness had said that he had not met with anybody from the Prosecution during his stay in Arusha.  And when the matter was raised, you had hinted that he had met with somebody, but that he was not able to recognise the person when he looked at the Prosecution table.  And I thought that the matter should be something -- we thought that the matter should be clarified and that you should make just a statement for the record as to whom he meant and under what circumstances which could close that issue.  So I thought I had made that -- I thought that yesterday afternoon the indication was that that would happen this morning.  
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much for that clarification.  I believe that my point was made very clearly yesterday when I responded, in fact, this witness met a member of the OTP.  And that is the answer I can provide.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  Could you call the Witness in, please, Witness GIN.

Good morning.  Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence will continue this morning.  You are under the same oath that you took yesterday to tell the truth.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I follow you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Now, the Prosecution will continue her examination from yesterday.
WITNESS GIN
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness? 
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Yesterday when we closed you gave me information about the killings that began in your secteur; is that correct?
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	You also told us beforehand that you had given testimony in the Rwamakuba case before? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba? 
MR. O'SHEA: 
It is the Defence case that this witness does not know the Accused.  It is the Defence case that this witness does not know the Accused.  In that context, the question which has just been asked is a leading question.  The fact that it is preceded by the statement that this witness has given evidence before in this trial does not change that 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, have you heard about André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I have heard of him. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you heard about him? 
A.	I heard about him in various circumstances.  On some occasions he was talked about as a visitor, in other circumstances he was discussed as someone who gave orders. So you understand that these are different circumstances. 
Q.	You said that they talked of him as a visitor; can you be more precise about that?
A.	When I saw him for the first time, he was a guest, and he was introduced to me as a visitor to that place. 
Q.	Can you tell us how he was pointed out to you as a visitor, what were the circumstances? 
A.	I saw him in ********************.  He came with someone who seems to be one of his friends, who is called Kayiranga.  He was attending a wedding in the Kayiranga family.  In the beginning, Kayiranga introduced him to the guests.  I was also present at this party as a guest, it was in 1992.  
Q.	Can you give us a more precise date? 
A.	No. 
Q.	If this does not reveal your identity, can you tell us what ceremony this was? 
A.	There is no problem.  There was a wedding of a child who was Kayiranga's nephew or niece or cousin, I don't know; that is what I know about it.  
Q.	Did you have occasion to see the person pointed out to you as André Rwamakuba during that time? 
A.	Yes, I saw him again. 
Q.	Can you tell us in what circumstances that was? 
A.	I saw him in that **************.  He came to visit a family where I was. 
Q.	If this would not reveal your identity, can you tell us what family this was? 
A.	It is my family. 
Q.	On that occasion, did you speak with André Rwamakuba? 
A.	No, I was like a child in the house; I was not supposed to speak to him. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether André Rwamakuba spent a long time with your family on that day? 
A.	He didn't stay long but he did stay more than an hour, in any case, and afterwards he left. 
Q.	Apart from these two meetings, Madam, have you had occasion to see the person known as         André Rwamakuba again? 
A.	Yes, I saw him once more on another occasion. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I saw him in Gikomero secteur, Gikomero commune.  I saw him at the trading centre in that commune.  He was with the authorities of the commune and with civilians.   
Q.	Madam, can you tell us the period within which you saw him accompanied by these authorities? 
A.	It was in 1994 in the month of April, between the 10th and the 14th of that month, and it was 10 or      11 o'clock in the morning.  He was with bourgmestre, Rutaganira, the accountant, Mathias Rubanguka and former brigadier Nyarwaya, whose first name I don't know.  He was also with Ngarambe, a commune policeman and another commune policeman known as Kayibanda.  There were also other people, ordinary people with him, including François Xavier Kamanzi, Ngiruwosanga ,Mivumbi and several other people, whose names I no longer remember. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I hope I can anticipate my friend will revisit that section of evidence a little more slowly, and perhaps we can have some more detail about the names, the spelling. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
All right, a correction by the interpreter.  The witness said 10 and 12 o'clock, between 10 and              12 o'clock, not between 10 and 11.  The interpreter is sorry. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether everybody received a list that you asked us to provide on which all names that could have been pronounced by our witnesses have been indicated on that list.  I think copies were given to the Defence, the Trial Chambers and the interpreters. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I think we have one somewhere, but I still can't keep up even with reference to the list in the time that -- in an ordinary spoken time; if it could just be gone through a little more slowly, bearing in mind that we are trying to keep a note and others are trying to type in a note, it would be helpful.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall -- 
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, if you wish to use the list, and you have it at hand, when the witness mentions the name perhaps you could just give the number on the list, that might help. 
MS. FALL: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.  To save time I would like to ask the witness that each time if she has a name, she should spell it if she is able to do so.  Regarding the names that she has just given, in order to save time, I would like to ask her to repeat those names so that the Defence can take them down.
BY MS. FALL: 
Q.	If you could repeat the names of the people who accompanied the said André Rwamakuba in 1994, we would be much obliged? 
A.	Yes, I can do so.  Rutaganira, the bourgmestre R-U-T-A-G-A-N-I-R-A, Rutaganira.  There is Mathias Rubanguka, Rubanguka is R-U-B-A-N-G-U-K-A, Rubanguka. There is Ngarambe, N-G-A-R-A-M-B-E Ngarambe.  
Q.	Number 92 on the list.  
A.	There is, Ngiruwosanga. 
Q.	Than is number 95 on the list?
A.	There is Mivumbi, M-I-V-U-M-B-I, Mivumbi.  There is Ngiruwosanga.  
Q.	You have already named Ngiruwosanga, as I said it is number 95 on the list.  There is a policeman called Kayibanda, K-A-Y-I-B-A-N-D-A, Kayibanda.  There is François Save Kamanzi, which is K-A-M-A-N-Z-I, Kamanzi.  There is Didas Karekezi, K-A-R-E-K-E-Z-I, Karekezi, number 55 on the list.  Thank you, witness.  Can you tell us where these people were when you saw them? 
A.	I saw them in Gikomero centre where a dipping tank is found, that is where they were standing.  
Q.	Where were you at the time, Witness? 
A.	I was at Gikomero centre, also, that is where my house is; I was at the entrance to the yard of my house. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, what happened when you saw these people at the place that you have told us about? 
A.	These people were going towards the Gikomero secteur office.  That is where this person joined the figures of authority of Gikomero.  I don't know what they said to each other.  In any case, I saw them there.  And when they got to the centre, they realised that the inhabitants had arrested young people who were moving, and people were asking these young people to show their identity cards.  Before showing them, Rwamakuba and the people who were with him called them; apparently, these young people did not have their identity cards because they showed their certificates.  Rwamakuba tore the certificates up and he said, "These are not identity cards." 
MR. HOOPER: 
Please, I ask the Prosecution to manage their witness in a way where a note can be taken, because I can't keep up.  I have half of that.  My last phrase is, "They found that young people had been arrested -- or young people had arrested."  Sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, it would be helpful to the proceedings if you paused after each sentence so that a note could be taken about what you say.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Thank you, Mr. President.  I was going to ask the witness not to go too fast, so that notes could be taken. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, could you more slowly start again from where the Defence stopped taking notes that is from where the young people were arrested? 
A.	The inhabitants caught these young people.  And Rwamakuba and the people who were with him called them; these young people approached Rwamakuba and the people who were with him.  And Rwamakuba and his group asked these young people to show their identity cards.  These young people were not able to do that.  I felt that they did not have any identity cards because they showed their certificates instead.  Rwamakuba tore up the certificates, and he ordered that these people be arrested and killed.  He confirmed that these young people were Tutsi because, as he said, they had refused to show their identity cards, and that, instead, they had shown their certificates.  These young people were caught and taken to a wood which was below the centre, and they were killed. 
Q.	Where were you at the time? 
A.	I was at the entrance to my courtyard, the courtyard of my house, as I told you before. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately the distance from where you were standing and the distance between where you were standing and where these events occurred? 
A.	I am going to estimate, as I did not actually measure the distance, I think the distance is 40 to 50 metres. 
Q.	From where you were, Witness, were you able to hear what was being said? 
A.	Yes, I could hear what they were saying, of course, I couldn't hear everything, but I could hear what they were saying when they spoke aloud.  And, indeed, they were speaking aloud. 
Q.	Can you tell -- you told us about two young people.  Can you tell us who they were? 
A.	There were two young people who were seeking refuge.  I did not know them. 
Q.	You said that these two young people were killed.  How do you know that? 
A.	I knew that because the people who took them away returned alone, and since I could not see the place where they were taken, I cannot say what happened exactly.  But when these young people were being beaten, I could hear them scream. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, who took these young people to this stand of trees? 
A.	Yes, I can tell you the names, the names I remember, at least.  I remember that amongst them there was one Ngiruwosanga. 
Q.	Yes, the name is on the list and it has already been mentioned.  Witness, would you go as slowly as possible so the names can be identified on the list?

1000H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The people who took these young people to the woods, do you have any idea whether they were armed or not?  
A.	Yes, these people were armed.  
Q.	Would you be in a position to describe the weapons they were carrying?  
A.	They were bearing machetes, clubs, and others carried guns.  
Q.	Witness, I am going to ask you, once again, to estimate the distance between your position and the place to which those young persons were taken.  
A.	I did not know that this question would be put to me, but I would put the distance at about 70 to 
	100 metres because the distance was not too far away.  
Q.	Would you also be able to tell us how long these persons remained in the woods?  
A.	I will estimate and say that I believe they were in the woods for about an hour and 30 minutes.  
Q.	Witness, besides what you have just told the Court, did you have any other opportunity to see 
	André Rwamakuba?  
A.	Yes, I did see him again.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court under what circumstances you saw him?  
A.	I saw him again at the same centre.  
Q.	Could you tell us at about what time or the period at which you saw him?  
A.	This happened a long time ago.  I will try to recollect and I believe that it was in April, four or five days after, he returned to the same centre.  
Q.	Let me put a question to you before proceeding further.  After the incident where these two young persons were killed, according to your testimony, did André Rwamakuba leave promptly or immediately?  
A.	No, he didn't leave immediately.  He spent some time at the centre. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court what he did, if you are in a position to do so, what did he do at the centre after?  
A.	He did two things; he encouraged members of the population to continue the killings, and he thanked them because they had already begun killing.  But before he left, a young man showed up on motorcycle.  He was stopped and required to show his identity papers.  I do not quite remember whether he showed an identity card which bore a statement on his ethnicity.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't want to interrupt the witness, but I can't make a note if she is talking at this pace and I write fairly quickly.  My last note was:  "He encouraged members of the people (sic) to continue the killings, and he thanked them for" -- I am not sure if that last bit is accurate, but I need to keep a note for obvious reasons.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am really quite sorry about these interruptions from Counsel Hooper.  He is not the only one taking notes, and I don't believe that we have to work at this -- however, we will call on the witness again to slow down, and for that reason, I will repeat my question.  Let me thank Counsel Hooper for that interruption, be it as unwelcome as it was. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, Witness -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just please be assisted.  "He encouraged members of the people -- population to continue the killings and he thanked them for" -- and I know not what was said there.  If you can remember it, and then go on to the next bit about the checks on the bike.  
THE WITNESS:
Well, he thanked them because they had begun the killings.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  After your last sentence, let me backtrack a little and hope this is -- I hope I am entitled to do so.  Let me backtrack and put the following question to you.  

After the incident where the two young persons died, did André Rwamakuba leave immediately?  
A.	No, he spent some more time at the centre speaking to the inhabitants who were present.  He thanked them for having begun the killings and gave them instructions to continue the killings.  While they were still there, a young man showed up on a motorcycle.  He was stopped and asked to show his identification papers.  I do not quite remember whether the identity card he showed bore the ethnicity or showed his ethnicity to be Hutu, or whether he told them himself that he was Hutu.  All I recall is that Rwamakuba said that no Hutu was fleeing and that it was only Tutsis who were fleeing.  He therefore gave orders for that young man to be killed because he was telling a lie and that he had adopted an ethnicity that was not his.  So his motorbike was impounded.  He was taken away and killed as well.  
Q.	Witness, while those things were happening, where were you?  
A.	I was at my home.  
Q.	Can you tell us where you were in your home?  
A.	Yes.  I was in front of the door of the entrance to the courtyard.  
Q.	You have told us of the things that were said by André Rwamakuba, did you hear them with your own ears?  
A.	Yes, I heard some of his statements myself.  He was in the company of my husband and my husband also told me what they said to each other.  
Q.	You have told us that the young man on a motorbike was killed.  Can you tell us where he was killed?  
A.	Yes, they killed him at the same location where the two young people were killed, that is, in the woods, the little woods which I have already referred to.  
Q.	If it is possible, Witness, could you please tell us the persons who took the young motorcycle rider into the clump of trees?  
A.	It was the same people who had previously taken the two young persons.  It was the same people, they hadn't changed.  
Q.	Were those people still armed?  
A.	Yes, they were still armed because they hadn't gone anywhere else.  
Q.	Where they bearing the same weapons that you previously referred to?  
A.	Yes, the same weapons.  
Q.	When these things happened, can you tell us where André Rwamakuba was?  
A.	I have said that he went along with that group of persons who went to kill the two young people.  I cannot confirm whether he went right to the spot where the people were killed because I didn't go along with them.  But he was there and he saw what was happening on the second occasion when the young man on the motorcycle -- the young man who had come on the motorcycle was taken away.  So he remained with the bourgmestre in an open area.  
Q.	Witness, in narrating these facts, you told us that you were standing in front of your yard, we know what your ethnicity is.  Were you not afraid of being attacked, given your ethnicity?  
A.	Yes, I was afraid, but my husband was present and my husband was armed, so I had no problem.  I was afraid, but I felt confident. 
Q.	Well, if these were not to reveal your identity, could you tell the Court what ethnicity your husband belonged to?  
A.	There is no problem, no difficulty with that, I can tell you.  My husband was Hutu.  
Q.	Witness, after that second incident, can you tell us how much longer André Rwamakuba remained at the centre, if you are in a position to do so?  
A.	I cannot provide any further details as to how long he remained at the centre.  All I know is that I went back into the house and upon coming out five minutes thereafter, I noticed that he had left, but I cannot be specific as to the time at which he left.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to show the witness a document at this juncture, that would be Exhibit P. 2, Prosecution Exhibit P. 2.  

I am sorry, just one moment, please.

That would be page 19, Mr. President, photograph number 12, K-number K0276239. 
MR. HOOPER:
I notice that this photograph is marked in three ways.  
MS. FALL:
I am sorry, Mr. President, I am mistaken.  This is the page I am referring to.  
I am sorry, Counsel, I was mistaken as to which picture I was referring to.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you recognise the area on that photograph?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Could you please describe to the Court what you see on that photograph?  
A.	Yes, with the leave of the Judges.  
Q.	Please do, Witness.  
A.	I can see some houses and I see some people.  There is a road, there are some trees; there is a piece of land with some trees, and then there is a dipping tank. 
Q.	You have told us that you can see a road; can you tell the Court which road this is?  
A.	If this is not dangerous, I may do so. 
Q.	Do you believe that it might be dangerous to say which road this is, Witness?  
A.	Well, it is for you to decide, I don't know.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think there is any danger in saying what the road is.  It is a photograph, but if you are going to identify anything else, that may have a different consequence. 
THE WITNESS:
Well, do you want me to simply state the name of the road or should I say in what direction the road would lead?  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Please, tell us in which direction the road would lead?  
A.	This road goes from ********* to Kayanga.
Q.	You also talked about some houses.  Can you tell us who owned those houses?  And I would like to tell this witness that this document is under seal and it is confidential.  
A.	I agree with you, but aren't we in open session, or are we in closed session? 
Q.	We are in open session.
MS. FALL:
And I believe that if the witness feels uncomfortable and feels that we should go into closed session, Mr. President, maybe we should do so briefly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how long do you think this period of your question would last?  
MS. FALL:
For the closed session, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, the confidential part of the examination.  If you have other questions that should be put in closed session, I would like all to be put at the same time.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just indicate it's an area that I would be going into, so if my friend, as it were, wants to leave the formal point into wherever -- to a later closed session, I will be necessarily having one with this witness, in any event.  So I would just indicate that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much longer is your examination going to last, in general, your examination-in-chief?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am not in a position right now to tell you specifically how much time I would take, but I believe that within an hour or so I would be done.  I believe that if we go into closed session now for about five minutes, we should be done before the break.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will move into closed session. 

For the benefit of the public, this closed session would last approximately five minutes.  Immediately after the closed session, the Court will take a short recess, and so that would mean that we will be resuming in open session in the vicinity of 10 minutes to 11.  We are going into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 19 to 20] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 14 to 18 by Sithembiso Moyo)





















	(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can now resume in open session.  

Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are back in open session now.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understood that.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you referred to two events that you witnessed.  Can you tell us whether after those two events you again had opportunity to meet André Rwamakuba?  
A.	Yes, I did.  
Q.	Could you tell the Court at what time or at what point you saw him?  
A.	I saw him four to five days later, if my recollection is right, and I saw him again at the trading centre.  
Q.	Could you tell us under what circumstances you met him -- you saw him again?  
A.	He had come in a vehicle and stopped at the centre.  I do not remember whether he alighted from the vehicle, but I know that he spoke to the inhabitants and I believe, from his vehicle.  
Q.	Today, would you be in a position to describe that vehicle for the Court?  
A.	Madam Prosecutor, this happened some 11 years ago and I wish that you bear that in mind.  That is a long time ago, but I remember that it was a station wagon and I do not remember the licence plate numbers.  All I can remember is that it was a station wagon and white in colour.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that he stopped at the centre, he greeted members of the population.  Would you be in a position to identify some of the persons who were present at that place?  
A.	Yes, I do remember a few of them.  For example, I remember that one Callixte was present.  Another inhabitant who was present was called Twagirayezu, Drocella Mukayiranga was also present; Ngiruwosanga was also present, then Mirumbi as well.  There is a policeman by the name Ngarambe, as well as one Gihanga.  There was another man also by the name Gatinseyi, and there were other persons whose names I do not remember.  
Q.	Could you tell us if possible and if you do remember, how long André Rwamakuba remained at that place?  
A.	He wasn't there for a long time, maybe two to five minutes. 
Q.	Witness, are you in a position to tell us what he did thereafter?  
A.	Counsel, are you referring to what he would have done at the centre or what is the question, I didn't understand it.  
Q.	I asked you, Witness, whether he was there for a long time, you said no, he had been there for two minutes.  Did you see him leave?  
A.	Yes, I did.  I saw him leaving. 
Q.	Could you tell us, Witness, in what direction he went?  
A.	Yes, I can.  He went on his way towards Kayanga. 
Q.	Witness, at that time, where were you?  
A.	I was at my home.  
Q.	Were you alone at your home on that day?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Could you tell us who was with you, and please be careful not to disclose any name that might identify you?  
A.	I was with my husband and Drocella Mukayiranga, whom I have already referred to here. 
Q.	On that day, did you receive anybody at your home at any time whatsoever in the course of that day?  
A.	No, I didn't have any guests at my home on that day.  
Q.	Was your husband with you throughout on that day?  And I am referring to the day on which you saw André Rwamakuba leave headed for Kayanga. 
A.	No, we were not together the whole day.  
Q.	Could you tell us where your husband went then?  
A.	Yes, I can.  At some point a vehicle came to collect people at the trading centre and my husband went along with them, in that group that was headed for Kayanga in that vehicle.  
Q.	Are you telling us that a vehicle came to collect people?  Can you tell us the people who were taken along or who were collected by that vehicle, can you tell us?  
A.	Yes, that vehicle came to collect Interahamwe who were carrying out the killings, as well as communal policemen.  That vehicle took them towards Kayanga.
Q.	Witness, are you in a position to tell us, if you know, any of the persons who were transported in that vehicle?  
A.	Yes, I do know some of them; at least, I can remember a few names.  When the vehicle arrived, Mathias Rubaruka was aboard.  There was a driver whose name is Nzaramba, and I do not quite remember whether he was a driver of the commune or of the health centre of the commune.  All I know is that he was a driver.  In that vehicle there was also the communal police brigadier whose name is Nyarwaya.  In fact, there were two vehicles -- there were two vehicles that came.  
(Pages 21 to 22 by Sithembiso Moyo)




1115H 
THE WITNESS:
	The vehicle of the commune and then the vehicle belonging to the priest whose name was Michel. 
Those vehicles stopped in front of my house.  In fact, one of the vehicles stopped in front of my house and the other stopped in front of *************.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, was there any reason -- any particular reason for the car to stop or the vehicle to stop in front of your house? 
A.	No, there was no particular reason.  The only reason, I believe, was that the road went by my house and it was ********************.  
Q.	Witness, could you tell us whether the persons were armed or not? 
A.	They were armed.  
Q.	Could you tell us the type of weapons they were carrying? 
A.	I cannot give you the specific names of the weapons that those attackers or those persons were bearing, but I can refer to them in general terms.  
Q.	Please do.  
A.	They had firearms, guns and grenades.  
Q.	Witness, if you do know, can you tell us where those vehicles went? 
A.	I have told you that they stopped at the places I mentioned to pick up a number of inhabitants; including policemen, my husband, and some Interahamwe who were, so to speak, members of the population, and then they went off together to Kayanga.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we can't get the floor.  

It looks like there's a technical problem; the microphones have all been switched off.  

It looks like they have come back to life.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Inaudible)
MS. FALL:
Dead again. 

It would seem that whenever I try to stand, that turns off the microphones.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
(Court recessed from 1123H to 1411H)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody. 
Mr. Registrar, we are now located in Courtroom 2 and we are ready to commence the afternoon session. 
MR. HOOPER:
A big problem -- with these.  You will probably hear Mr. O'Shea -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was having the problem too.  I thought it was exclusive to me, but everybody has a problem with the hearing.  You haven't?  I beg your pardon?  Well, is everybody hearing now?  Can you hear?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Can you hear us, sir?  This is the English booth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can hear you, Mr. Interpreter. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can resume our session now. 

Madam Witness, can you hear me?
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're going to continue your evidence now.  You will be under the same oath that you took this morning to tell the truth, and the Prosecutor will continue to ask you some questions.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, this morning before the break I had put one last question to you -- the following question:  How did you hear that the people who'd -- were on board the two vehicles had gone to Kayanga.  How did learn of that? 
A.	I heard of it because those people left with my husband.  On his return, I put the question to him and he spoke to me about it. 
Q.	Before continuing, Madam Witness, I would like to come back a bit.  You said that those people who were in the vehicle were armed, and you'd noticed that the -- their weapons were rifles and grenades.  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us if you have any information as to whence those weapons had come from, the guns and the grenades? 
A.	I do not know the provenance of all those weapons, but some of them I do know their provenance. 
Q.	When you mean "some of the weapons", can you tell us which weapons you're speaking of? 
A.	I wasn't speaking of all the weapons those people held, but some of them I know who had distributed the weapons to them.  But as to the others, I don't know the provenance of their weapons. 
Q.	Can you tell us, madam, those people for whom you know the provenance of the weapons they held, as long as, of course, it does not reveal your identity. 
A.	Well, for example, as regards François Xavier Kamanzi and Ngarambeli and Desiré and Ngiruwosanga.  As far as those people are concerned, I know the provenance of the weapons they held.  And also as regards the accountant, Rubanguka. 
Q.	Could you inform the Court as to the -- the -- the provenance of those weapons? 
A.	It was Kamuhanda who had distributed those weapons to them. 
Q.	Let us continue, Madam Witness.  So you say that it was your husband who left with those people and on his return, he informed you that they were in Kayanga; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Did your husband tell you what happened at Kayanga? 
A.	Yes, he did. 
Q.	Are you able to remember, Witness, what your husband told you about the events at Kayanga? 
A.	Yes, I remember part of what he told me. 
Q.	Can you tell us here today what he said? 
A.	My husband told me that on their arrival at Kayanga, they had found Rwamakuba in the company of the person in charge of the health centre whose name was Ka- -- Ka- -- Kamanzi.  Subsequently, the people -- those people talked among themselves and a few moments later, Rwamakuba gave permission for the massacre of the people at the health centre.  Among the victims were people who had sought refuge and injured, wounded people who were being treated at the health centre.  Hence the massacre began and Rwamakuba left. 
Q.	Did your husband tell you how Rwamakuba had ordered the massacres to start? 
A.	He did not give me all the details, but he did say that it was Rwamakuba who had ordered those people to be killed. 
Q.	You told us that your husband had informed you that those people were refugees and injured people being treated.  Did he also tell you to which ethnic group those people belonged? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what did he tell you on that topic? 
A.	He told me that those people belonged to the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have just told us that your husband told you that Rwamakuba departed shortly after the beginning of the massacre.  Did he, at all, specify the time frame? 
A.	I did not put that question to him. 
Q.	Did he confirm Rwamakuba's presence there while the people were being killed? 
A.	He told me that Rwamakuba had given permission to the killers who went in and started killing people, and then Rwamakuba left.  I did not ask my husband how long he had stayed on the spot -- stayed there.  It did not interest me and there was no reason for me to put that question to him. 
Q.	Did your husband tell you approximately how many victims there were of the Kayanga health centre massacre? 
A.	If I had put the question to him, he might have told me approximately how many people were there.  But I did not put the question to him because I did not think that it could be of any use. 
Q.	Madam Witness, apart from those events that you have told us about -- that is, between the 10th and the 14th of April, did you -- were you aware of any other massacres that occurred in your secteur? 
A.	Yes, I was witness -- I witnessed other massacres. 
Q.	Can you tell us, what were those massacres? 
A.	After the Gikomero centre -- trading centre massacre, the assailants continued to flush out Tutsi and kill them.  For example, in respect of those Tutsi who managed to hide, they were flushed out and killed.  And there were also people who left Remera to seek refuge at our place and when those people were inter- -- were intercepted, they were killed. 
Q.	You told us that people were killed at ********** (phonetic); is that correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth is requesting that counsel for the Prosecution repeat the question. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	You did tell us, unless I'm mistaken, that people were killed at *********; is that correct? 
A.	No.  I did not say that. 
Q.	Well, can you tell us what you said because I think I misunderstood. 
A.	I stated the following:  After the massacre planned by Rwamakuba and at -- and at Kayanga health centre and Gikomero, people were flushed out of their hiding places and people who left other places to come and seek refuge with us. 
Q.	Could you be more precise and tell us where people were in the habit of hiding? 
A.	Well, there were places where people sought refuge -- such as, in the schools, health centres or bushes, shrubbery, or someone might shelter someone else -- hide someone in his house.  People did not all go to the same place; they went to different places. 
Q.	You mentioned seeking refuge in the schools.  Did you obtain any information -- were you given information that there were any massacres in any of the schools in your secteur? 
A.	Yes, I do know of them. 
Q.	Can you specify which school, please? 
A.	At Gikomero school where there was also a Protestant church. 
Q.	Witness, I will be finishing.  Can you tell us, though, first, about the massacre at the school -- at the church.  Was Rwamakuba involved? 
A.	No.  He did not play any part in that massacre. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I have, for the moment, finished with the witness, and I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall. 

Madam Witness, your evidence now will continue, but now you'll be asked questions by the lawyer for the Accused and you have to answer these questions.  Do you understand me? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  Can I -- 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	Can I ask you this, first of all:  How -- how long have you been here in Arusha, meeting to -- to give your evidence in this case? 
A.	I have spent nine days here so far. 
Q.	And during that time, have you met anyone from the Prosecution in order to discuss your evidence in any way? 
A.	Yes, I met people from the Prosecutor's office. 
Q.	On how many occasions? 
A.	Twice, but I met different people on both occasions. 
Q.	And did you have the opportunity of going through your evidence with those people? 
A.	Yes, these people reminded me that I must tell the truth and talk about events that I had witnessed. 
Q.	Did you go through your evidence with them? 
A.	I did not go through the evidence with the Prosecutor who is present here.  He just reminded me that I wished -- that I should tell the truth, and asked me whether I remembered what I was to say. 
Q.	I'm -- I'm just asking you about the two meetings you had with the people from the Prosecution.  Nothing wrong with that, you know, it's a common practice here.  What I'm asking you is:  Did you have the opportunity to discuss your evidence? 
A.	This is what I answered.  The lady who has just put questions to me, came to see me.  I think it was on a Saturday.  I had arrived on the preceding Monday and the Prosecutor reminded me that I should tell the truth and she asked me whether I remembered the contents of my statement.  I am referring to what the Prosecutor, who is present here, told me. 
Q.	So -- so how long did that meeting last? 
A.	10 to 15 minutes. 
Q.	And the next meeting you had, you say, was with somebody else.  How long did that meeting last? 
A.	5 to 10 minutes. 
Q.	At any time, have you had any facility to be able to refresh your memory from any evidence that you have given on a previous occasion? 
A.	I did not have any such opportunity because the Prosecutor told me that she was very busy.  And she told me that she would be the one -- I don't remember what -- what she said exactly.  I think she said she would be examining the witness, but I don't quite remember in what terms she said that. 
Q.	Now, can I turn to your evidence itself, I'm a little unclear.  Dealing with the first incident and the two people in the trading centre, when those people were led away in order to be, you believed, killed in the small wood, did André Rwamakuba go with that group of people or not? 
A.	I told you that André Rwamakuba went with the group, but I added that I did not know whether he actually reached the place where these people were killed.  I also added that from where he was standing, he could see what these other people were doing. 
Q.	Very well.  But, your recollection and evidence is that he -- he went with them.  That you couldn't see the final destination of the group, so you can't tell us if he went all the way with them to the spot, where you believed, the two were killed.  Is that right? 
A.	If you listened to me carefully, I said that André Rwamakuba had followed the group, but that I could not see very clearly where the people were killed.  But that, however, Rwamakuba was standing from a place where, from which he could see what was going on. 
Q.	And the other matter I would like to ask you about -- about that first incident at the trade centre is this: When Rwamakuba came, where did he park his car or his vehicle? 
A.	It's a long time ago, but I shall try to remember.  I think that he parked his vehicle at the centre because when I saw him, he was on foot.  He was coming from the secteur office in the company of the bourgmestre, so I cannot -- I do not know where the vehicle was parked.  At least, I don't remember very well anymore. 
Q.	Did you see his vehicle on that day? 
A.	Yes, I saw his car when he was leaving. 
Q.	Do you remember anything about the car? 
A.	I don't understand your question.  What did you say?  Do you want to know the colour of the vehicle? The make?  I don't follow you. 
Q.	My question was:  Can you remember any details about the vehicle? 
A.	I would like to remind you that it's 11 years since.  It is not easy to remember everything at once.  I tell you that I don't remember anything -- more. 
Q.	But you remember later, he's in a white estate car, is that right, on the second visit, translated in English to my ear, as "a white estate car"?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So that is something you remember after 11 years, is it? 
A.	No, this is not the only detail I remember.  I think I said -- I've said many things, so I don't agree with you there.  If you say it is the only thing I remember, then that is not it. 
Q.	Maybe it was lost in translation.  I'll merely ask you this:  You don't remember anything about the car on the first occasion and it's 11 years ago, and who would remember, necessarily?  But, you do happen to remember the kind of vehicle and the colour of the vehicle that you see Rwamakuba in on the next occasion.  What was so striking about the vehicle on the second occasion that you can remember it today? 
A.	I told you that one cannot remember everything at once.  It is possible that I remember every detail and, if you ask me a question tomorrow, I might be able to add more detail.  Apart from that, there was nothing special to remind me of what this vehicle looked like.  It had -- it bore no particular marks. 
Q.	And it's correct, is it not, that you have never mentioned any details of a white estate car before today in the witness box, is that right? 
A.	It all depends on how questions are put to you.  Perhaps the question was put to me at a time when I no longer -- I did not remember the detail, or perhaps, the question was not put to me at all. 
Q.	But this white vehicle is something you remember today, though you've never mentioned it before.  Is that right? 
A.	This is what I've said.
Q.	Well, thank you -- 
A.	It is because of the person who put the questions to me.  Everything came from the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	You've mentioned the killing, the massacre, at the Gikomero Protestant school.  Did you yourself see the corpses of the dead there? 
A.	I did not see all the bodies, but I did see some. 
Q.	I didn't ask you if you saw all of them.  You saw the corpses of people at the Protestant school who had been murdered; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And when, in relation to their murder, did you see those bodies? 
A.	I told you that these people were killed between the 8th and the 12th, if I remember correctly.  I don't know on what day I went past that place to seek refuge elsewhere.  But that was the day -- that is, when we were going to seek refuge.  It was on that day that we saw these bodies.  I no longer remember the date or the year. 
Q.	I don't think you gave us a date for the killing at the school.  But now you say it's between the 8th and the 12th; is that correct? 
A.	It is difficult to remember dates.  You, yourself, must know that; I estimated it. 
Q.	No, but you just said in your estimation that it was between the 8th and the 12th.  Would that be correct? 
A.	Yes, I said it is an estimate.  That is what I said. 
Q.	Well -- well, thank you.  I'm -- that's what I understood you to be saying, and I'm not suggesting anything different to you.  And you say that you saw those bodies on the day you sought refuge, but you couldn't remember the date that you sought that refuge, nor the year.  That was the answer I -- I heard as translated.  Is that what you meant to say, that you didn't remember the date or the year?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President.  Mr. President, I'd like to make a correction.  There was a correction in the Kinyarwanda booth, which indicated that it had made a mistake, and that the witness actually said that she remembered the month and the year. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Madam Fall, for that information.  I thought there probably was an error somewhere. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, I'm not asking you to give me the date -- not yet anyway, I'm merely asking you this:  How long after the killing at the Gikomero school did you see the bodies of the dead there?  I'm not asking you for a date.  Was it the same day, the next day or a week later?  What's your answer, please? 
A.	I -- I saw them less than a week before they died. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I have that translation revisited, please?  I got it as "I saw them less than a week before they died."  Can someone in the booth help me?  Is that a correct translation of what she said?  And, I'm getting nods that it is.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, let me put the question again.  How long after the massacre at the Gikomero school did you see the bodies of those killed there? 
A.	I have already answered that question. I do not know whether you're looking for a different answer from the first one.  I've told you that when I saw the bodies it was less than a week after the massacre, but that I did not remember the number of days that had passed after the massacre. 
Q.	And -- and how many bodies, in your estimate, were there?  In your estimate, and you didn't see them all, I appreciate that, but in your estimate? 
A.	You see, when you're fleeing, you're frightened.  I cannot tell you that I counted the bodies; it would be a lie. 
Q.	Was it -- were there more than 20 people there, 20 dead people?  
A.	But you're putting the same question differently.  I have told you that I do not remember the number.  And, what is more, I did not feel like counting bodies.  I must add that at the time I did not know that questions would be put to me about it.  If I had known that, perhaps, I might have counted the bodies. 
Q.	Look, madam, I think we can all appreciate that setting your eyes on a massacre site is a terrible and shocking thing to see, and I'm not asking you, as I think you well know, whether you counted the bodies.  But can you help this Tribunal with an approximate number of people that you believed were killed there as seen by your own eyes?  And I've started off by asking you, was it about 10 people or more than that?  And I'm sure you can help us a little better than you're doing.  Do you think you can answer this question to the best of your ability? 
A.	Yes, I can answer the question and I'm answering the question based on the number of people I saw before the massacre.  I do not know whether my answer will satisfy you. 
Q.	No, that's not the question I'm asking you.  I'm asking you from what you saw, as you went through that massacre site, whenever that was, in the week after the massacre, was it more than 10 people?  Was it more than 100 people?  Something very general, that's all I'm asking.  Can you help us? 
A.	I cannot guess at a figure.  I told you that when I was fleeing; I was frightened and that I saw many bodies lying about.  On our way, there were some bodies because it was along the road, but there were many bodies all over the place. 
Q.	All right.  Just -- just one final -- did you go to the Gikomero Protestant school massacre site; yes or no? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	But you can't help us when that was, except it was within seven days of the massacre there; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I told you that it was during the week of the massacres. 
Q.	And why did you go there?  
A.	I told you that I went past there when I was fleeing. 
Q.	Why were you fleeing? 
A.	I was fleeing because there was a war. 
Q.	Who were you fleeing from? 
A.	Who were you fleeing from?  We were fleeing from people who could have killed us in our homes. 
Q.	What people are these people? 
A.	Interahamwe. 
Q.	And who were you fleeing with? 
A.	I was with Rusila  Mukayiranga -- Drocella Mukayiranga.  That is the only person who was with me. 
Q.	Were you with somebody called Murekatete? 
A.	No.  On the day we were fleeing, we were not with her. 
Q.	So just you and Drocella.  And where did you go? 
A.	We fled and at one point we came near a forest and we sat down.  We thought that the Rubungo Interahamwe were coming towards our region.  When we find out later that they did not, in fact, go there, we went back. 
Q.	So you fled your home with Drocella and you got as far as a forest, and then when you thought the coast was clear, you went back to your home at the trading centre; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was the time that you had your opportunity to see the terrible scene of massacre at the Protestant school, is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And that was sometime, you can't tell us when, but sometime in the seven days after the massacre at the school; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it was within that week. 
Q.	And within that week, did you flee anywhere else other than the forest? 
A.	We fled and returned to our homes each time.  We did not go very far. 
Q.	In that week, following the massacre at the school, did you go anywhere else and, if you did, can you tell us where, and can you tell us when and who with, please? 
A.	We sought refuge in Gasagara.  We also sought refuge at a place, Kibobo. 
Q.	Is the first place you named, Gasagara, is that the forest or is that a different place? 
A.	That is not where the forest is, this is some other place. 
Q.	Kibobo, is that where the forest is or is that another place? 
A.	But, Counsel, you asked me to tell you the other places where I sought refuge, so I couldn't be talking about the forest.  I talked -- told you about the forest and then I'm telling you about the other places where I sought refuge. 
Q.	Well, thank you very much for clarifying that.  And Gasagara and Kibobo, were those places that you went to in the seven days after the Gikomero school massacre?
A.	No.  I went to other places, different places, but I did not leave my secteur. 
Q.	Am I correct in thinking, from what you've said, that in the seven days following the massacre at the school, at some time you went to the forest and returned home to a place called Gasagara and presumably returned home, and some time at a place called Kibobo and returned home.  And all that within the seven days after the -- the massacre at the school, is -- is that correct? 
A.	But why are you focusing on these seven days?  I have told you about days following the massacre at the school. If you're focusing on the seven days, you must have something in mind. 
Q.	Well -- well, I have something in mind and I believe the clearer your answers are now, the quicker we'll get along and the less time you'll be in the witness box, which I know, isn't a pleasant place to be.  So if you can just answer the questions in a straightforward and helpful a manner as you can, that will help me.  And, let's come back to the question.  After the massacre at the Protestant school - and, at the moment, we're just limiting it to those seven days to make it easier for you, you see.  In that first week after that -- and you can't give us dates -- you visited, is this correct, the forest, Gasagara and Kibobo, three separate places.  Yes or no? 
A.	Those are the places I remember that I went to. 
(Pages 23 to 33 by Jean Baigent)






























1500H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, do you think you went to other places too? 
A.	But I have told you that these places I have mentioned are the ones that I remember.  All this happened a long time ago and I did not count the number of trips that I made.  I did not count the number of times that I left my home to flee, and I did not note the number of places or the various places that I went to.  Well, if I had known at the time that you were going to put a question to me about that, I would have remembered. 
Q.	Well, we hear your answer and we -- I think we can understand what you are saying.  So it was at least these three places and several more during that time, during that week after the massacre at the school.  It was several other distinct and different places, as well as those three, that you went to.  Would that be fair? 
A.	Yes, you are right. 
Q.	And if it doesn't strain your patience too much, could you tell me how many times you went to Kibobo? 
A.	If I remember, I went there twice. 
Q.	And was that twice in that week or different occasions? 
A.	I went there one first time, then I went there again. 
Q.	See if you can help us as to when those occasions were in relation to the killings at the school.  
A.	I do not remember the exact dates.  However, I think I went there first one or two days before the massacre. 
Q.	And that first time, did you stay there the day and come back or did you stay the night there as well? 
A.	We didn't spend the net -- the night there.  We stayed there all day and then we went back home at the end of the day. 
Q.	Thank you.  And the second time you went, when was that, please? 
A.	You have just repeated your question.  You've done so about six times.  I shall try to answer, however.  I told you that I went there in the days following the massacre that occurred at the school.  I, however, added that I did not remember the date or the day for that matter. 
Q.	And when you went there did you have to go through and past the site of the massacre at the school? 
A.	Yes.  I have already answered "yes", to your question.  I told you that I went past there. 
Q.	Now, no, this is a specific question.  When you went to Kibobo that time after the massacre, was it necessary or did you have to go -- did you go past the pseudo-massacre site at the school at the time you went to Kibobo? 
A.	You are referring to the first or the second time I went through that place?  
Q.	Let me ask you the question again.  When you went to Kibobo after the massacre at the school, did you pass through the site of the massacre on that occasion? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was that the first time that you saw the bodies at the school? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So why did you tell us a moment ago it was when you went to the forest that that was the first time? 
A.	Please repeat your question, I didn't understand it. 
Q.	Why did you tell us a moment ago that it was when you went to the forest that you first had an opportunity to see the bodies at the school? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Which is why I'm asking you very careful questions, you see, so that we can be clear or try to be clear about your answers.  So is it now your evidence that the first time you saw the bodies at the school was when you were on the way to Kibobo, not to the forest? 
A.	You did not ask me to explain.  But if you had, I would have told you that the forest was in Kibobo.  So it is -- so the forest is around Kibobo, and so you mustn't make a difference between the two. 
Q.	But that's why I asked you if they were distinct and separate places, and you told me that they were.  
A.	Yes, there are two different places.  There is the forest, and then there is a settlement where people live.  These are two different places.  I give you an example of two similar things that will help you to understand. 
Q.	When you went to the -- Kibobo, was that the first time, as I understand it was, the first time that you'd left home after the massacre at the school in order to seek refuge somewhere? 
A.	We did not know at the time that questions would be put to us, questions of such a nature.  I cannot remember whether or not it was the first time that I left my house after -- following the massacres, or -- I did not pay attention to all these details because I did not know that questions of this sort would be put to me. 
Q.	Well, just on this before I leave it:  When you went to Kibobo that time, that first time, and went through the school, who were you with? 
A.	But I never told you that when I went to Kibobo the first time that I went by the school.  I did not say that I went by the school -- through the school. 
Q.	Well, did you or did you not go through the school the first time you went to Kibobo after the massacres? 
A.	But your question is now clear.  I did pass through the school when I went to Kibobo the second time.  And it was the first time that I went there to Kibobo after the massacre. 
Q.	So the second time you went to Kibobo, you passed through the school.  Have I understood that correctly? 
A.	You are confusing me in the way you put your questions.  You speak of the first time, the second time, now you are speaking of the time again.  My mind is being confused.  I cannot follow you. 
Q.	Why don't you just tell us -- 
MS. FALL: 
I just wanted to intervene, Mr. President, before the witness testifies.  And can, indeed, confuse -- I think maybe counsel imposes not the best method of question.  I do not see him evoking any contradictions that the witness has made, and he speaks of one event, he goes back to another event and then goes on to a third event, which might, indeed, confuse the witness.  I think the questions could be clear and precise in order that the witness might also answer clearly and precisely.  But if he goes on like that, I think, indeed, there will be confusion.  I just wanted to say that.  Before the witness answers, I felt that I had to make this comment.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, I am not seeking to confuse you, Madam Witness, and I noticed that when you were giving your evidence earlier you were able to give quite long statements.  So what I'm going to ask you to do is to tell us briefly what happened after the massacre at the school.  Just tell us what you remember you did in that week.  Where you went; when you went there; and, if possible, who you went with.  Just tell us your story about that week in terms of these travels that you've certainly confused me about.  So let's just start:  There was the massacre at the school, and then what happens after that?  When do you first leave?  Where do you go to?  And do you have to go pass the school and see this terrible sight?  Tell us in your own words; don't worry about my questions.  
A.	I'm not trying to avoid your questions.  I would tell you what happened.  I told you that in the week following the massacre, I passed through the school when I was fleeing and we went to some woods, and then we returned home.  I also told you that in the following days we sought refuge in Gasagara, and this with Drocella Mukakaranga and Murakatete.  Subsequently, we fled to Kibobo, and then we came back home.  I had to go to other places that I don't remember because I didn't take notes in order to remember the places inasmuch as I did not anticipate being questioned on that. 
Q.	All right, well, thank you for that distillation of what you've said.  So the -- so the first one you go through the school to the woods.  And the woods were in Kibobo; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And you went, as you told us, with Drocella; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you can't remember how many days after the school massacre it was in.  It was in the first seven days that you made that visit to the school, and is that right? 
A.	Approximately the seventh time I'm going to answer.  I think you are doing it on purpose.  You must have understood my answer.  I left in the week following the massacre.  You insist on seven days, but I spoke of a week, the week in which the massacre took place. 
Q.	If I understand the question -- an answer from you, I will not go back to it, believe me.  Last question on this at this point:  Can you help us as to how many days after the massacre that visit to the woods in Kibobo took place? 
A.	You put that question at the beginning of the cross-examination.  I told you I went to Kibobo forest in the week following the massacre.  I did not say exactly how many days or what date. 
Q.	In your statement you say that more than 4,000 people were killed at the Gikomero Protestant school complex.  Is that a correct estimate on your part?  Is that correct?  Obviously not a precise number; I wouldn't dream of suggesting that, but it is that kind of number of people that you are talking about, isn't it? 
A.	I made that estimate on the basis of the number of people I saw at that place before the massacres, and I made that estimate knowing well that there were very few survivors.  Very few people survived that massacre. 
Q.	Your husband and your brother-in-law both participated in killing Tutsis; is that correct? 
A.	No, I cannot say that is true inasmuch as I am not prosecuting them, nor am I a prosecution witness against them. 
Q.	Do you believe them to have killed people? 
A.	It would be a lie on my part if I told you that I was convinced that they had done so, nor can I deny it because I wasn't with them.  But I cannot either assert inasmuch as I did not see them kill. 
Q.	Now I'm going to ask you -- ask you questions that may identify you, and you are a protected witness.  And in those circumstances it would -- and it's not appropriate that I do so in a public court. 
MR. HOOPER:
And I notice the time, which is coming up to the afternoon adjournment, and I'm in your hands, 
	Mr. President, as to whether we go into closed session now or whether we perhaps postpone it until after the break.  And I appreciate it's an inconvenience to those members of public who have come to demonstrate an interest in these cases, but I'm afraid I've reached an unavoidable juncture in my questioning and I can't step over it.  I need to put questions of a personal nature.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long do you anticipate this will last?  
MR. HOOPER: 
It's both a fact of the questions and a fact of the answers.  And I will try and ensure that my questions are economic, and I'm sure the witness may assist us in economic replies.  And on that basis, I would say it would take me about half an hour.  That is counsel's half an hour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know the policy that we have that all of the material which needs to be explored in a closed session should be done together so that we do not have to go into closed session more than once during the witness's testimony.  Are you able to organise your questioning on that principle?
MR. HOOPER:
It's particularly difficult because of the particular witness, and I do intend, in fact, to go in detail into her statement.  And, in fact, probably I can -- that wouldn't be a problem in itself referring the statement.  No, I think I can hopefully get through most of my questions in a way that won't need to be in closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we think we should stick to our normal schedule and take the break now.  For the benefit of the members of the public gallery, we'll take a 15-minutes break, and I will assume that if counsel's estimate is accurate, the open session of this hearing will recommence in the vicinity of quarter past four.  We normally sit until 5:30 in the afternoon.  So we will take the break now.  
(Court recessed at 1530H)
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 39 to 48] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 34 to 38 by Gifty C. Harding)
































BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right.  So coming back to Faustin Rutabagirwa, do you agree in a previous occasion in evidence that you said this, of the investigators; "They told me that Rutabagirwa had given them my address."  Do you remember saying that? 
A.	I can't remember the content of my statement, at the same time, there is quite a bit in it. 
Q.	Well, we are not concerned with what is here or there, but what your recollection is, your evidence.  You said on a previous occasion, that the investigators told you that Rutabagirwa had given them your address.  Now, in saying that, is that correct or not? 
A.	They told me that they had come from the communal office and that they had got -- obtained my address at the communal office. 
Q.	From Rutabagirwa; is that correct? 
A.	There are many people working at the communal office, not only Rutabagirwa.  They told me that they had obtained the address at the communal office without specifying that it was Rutabagirwa who had given it to them.   
Q.	Then why on a previous occasion, on the ***********, last year, did you say, this is your answer;  "They told me that Rutabagirwa had given them my address."  Why did you say that? 
A.	I meant it in general terms because I knew that the man was bourgmestre of our district. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I should like to make a request.  Where there are references made to transcripts, I think we all have them because we are asked to print them, so I would like to invite my learned friend each time he refers to a transcript to specify the dates, the page, and, if possible, the line; because I don't know if it is possible or not, but I think it would facilitate proceedings.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, where I'm able to do so, I will do that.  I believe that was page 31 on the ***************.  I have extracted them, so I'm not able to give you the precise line on the page.  Where there is a contradiction, we will provide the pages at the close of the evidence.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can we come to your statement, please, of the 3rd of February 1998.  And may I start by asking you, Madam Witness, this question; are you familiar with the contents of that statement? 
A.	Yes, I know the contents of that statement. 
Q.	And do you acknowledge that the account that you give in that statement is radically different to the account that you give in evidence in this trial? 
A.	I do not agree with you, unless you point out the contradiction to me, in which case I could respond. 
Q.	Very well, then, that is what I will do.  Now, let's start at the beginning, the date of the interview was the 3rd of February 1998, and you were interviewed -- may I just pause there.  Do you speak English or do you speak French in any way sufficient for it to be worthwhile having this statement in front of you, or would you like the statement in front of you anyway? 
A.	I asked to testify in Kinyarwanda because it is Kinyarwanda that I speak.  Now, if you have a statement in Kinyarwanda, in Rwandese, I'm ready to receive it.  
Q.	I ask that because I note that you spent three years in Uganda where English is taught widely in schools.  I just wondered whether you had English at all, and if you had English sufficient to follow, for example, an English statement because I don't believe we have a Kinyarwanda statement for you.  So, would you be helped by an -- a statement in English or not at all? 
A.	A statement in English would be of no use to me, no assistance to me, of no help to me. 
Q.	I guess it would be true of a French statement, it would be of no help to you? 
A.	Quite, that is why I asked you to give me a statement in Kinyarwanda because I do not understand the other languages you mentioned. 
Q.	Well, subject to anything, Mr. President may direct me, I'm going, in fact, shortly to read very much of your statement to you, so that there is no doubt in your mind of the areas that I'm going to be concerned with.  But before we do that, I think it may help, even if you can't follow the text, if you are provided with a copy of the statement because I'm going to refer to the general layout of this statement and to some aspects of it which I think you will be able to follow, even though you don't speak English.  
A.	I think that this statement will be of no use to me.  I don't see the significance for me to look at words on pages when I don't know how to read the language in which the document is written. 
Q.	I think everybody here is sympathetic to that difficulty.  But I would like you to look at this photocopy of the original statement that you signed, and you can, for example, acknowledge your signature, and also those parts of it which are clearly written in Kinyarwanda.  So, can this statement please be passed to you, and we will see how far we can go with it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, can I ask you a question?  Do you speak French?  
THE WITNESS:
Very little.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you read French?  
THE WITNESS:
My level of education does not make it possible for me to read the language comprehensively, but I can somehow read that language.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And at this juncture I'm informed that the interpreters, as matter of course, will have this statement, and so do not need my assistance in respect of that.  I also understand that, Mr. President, you and your colleagues have access to the statement, but I have had printed off anyway hard copies of the English and the French, which may I pass up.  And if they are of a convenience to you at this stage, separate documents, assessable documents, because I'm going to be going through these in considerable detail, and sometimes the hard copy may assist.  And the French copy, of course, has -- is the original here, with signatures and the like.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And the first thing I have to remind myself, Witness, is that we are in open session.  So, I don't want, particularly personal details to be referred to. 

	Now, if you look at the first page of that statement, Madam, you will see that it is headed "United Nations".  I don't know if you can read that, even though it is in a language that I understand you don't know, but you can see the words there United Nations at the top, and the same on the other side, except in French this time.  And then underneath that it has the date on which that investigation was made, the statement was taken, which is the 3rd of February of 1998.  I don't think that is a problem, I hope with closed and open.  And then after that, there are details.  And we have, for example, names of the two investigators, and, again, I don't think this is a matter of sensitivity, Almah Amoud Sidibe, and Adaamou Allagouma are the two investigators.  I dare say after such a long time, Madam Witness, you won't remember the names of the people who came to see you, but I dare say you accept, looking at that document, that those are, indeed, two investigators who came to see you all of that time ago, seven years -- seven and a half years ago.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, I have confidence in you. 
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I agree with you without actually remembering what those people looked like.  
Q.	And  no one can blame you for that after seven and a half years.  And then just before there is a line across the page, there is the name of interpreters.  And those names are given as Jean-Marie Gatabazi and Teodomir Halindintwali.  And just pausing there, looking at those names, Madam, I think you would probably agree that those were two Rwandese interpreters, ie; they were Rwandese people; is that correct? 
A.	I can assert -- confirm to you that those people understood and spoke Kinyarwanda, but I cannot make a pronouncement as regards their nationality.

1700H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Very fair comment.  But you also had the advantage of not just one, but two interpreters on this occasion; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	No, I don't remember, this was quite some time ago.  All I remember is that there was an interpreter present.  
Q.	Now, looking at that date, the 3rd of February 1998, it is a long time ago, but you will agree, will you not, that relatively speaking, it wasn't very long after the genocide, less than four years; that's correct, isn't it?  
A.	You said the 3rd of December 1998. 
Q.	Third of February.  
A.	I don't see the date.  
Q.	Well, it is right at the top, but I needn't trouble you with it; we can all see it and draw our own conclusions.  But the matter I put to you and I would like an answer to, if possible, you can help me, is this:  Do you agree that when you saw these investigators and gave your account, the events would be obviously far, far fresher in your memory then than they are now, today, seven and a half years later?  Do you agree with that?  
A.	It was about five years after the events.  I could remember the events, but I couldn't remember everything and you know when you can't remember everything at once, some items of information you might miss at one time and then come back to them later, and that reality applies to my present situation.  
Q.	Now, when these investigators came to see you, it is obviously the case they spoke to you and they kept notes of what you said; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, they certainly took note of what I told them, but we can't say that they couldn't have made a mistake, for example.  
Q.	No, I don't have their notes, maybe the Prosecutor does, we will have to see.  But you acknowledge that they kept notes, that is the point I am asking you, they didn't just listen to you, they kept notes of what you said and then came back later on the 12th of February.  We can see that because your signature and the date appears on the front page of the bottom left-hand corner.  So they see you on the 3rd of February, they listen to you; they take notes and then on the 12th of February they come back with this statement typed out.  You might not remember again the precise date, but you can, I hope, trust me to have interpreted what I see on this document and which everyone now has fairly.  Does that fit in there with your recollection?  
A.	Let me tell you that I don't know the number of the document I am referring, but I think you have it in your hands.  The investigators did not question me concerning solely Rwamakuba.  They were interviewing me with respect to Rwamakuba and Kamuhanda, jointly; and then they went back to their place of work, their office and they drafted a declaration that they brought back for me to sign, and they brought various statements back at various times.  I have explained sufficiently here that this document was brought to me and then investigators found me at my place of work, and I had not been given permission to meet them.  They read the contents of the statement briefly, because I was in a hurry.  I did not have enough time and I have explained why I was in a hurry at that point in time.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that answer, and it may be you are distancing yourself from the statement, but just bear with me for a moment and let's just see some of the details that's on it.  

Now, on that front page in front of you, even though you may not speak the language it is in, if you can read, I am sure looking down on that, you will see words and details that are, in fact, correct, and, indeed, your personal details that were passed about earlier today by the Prosecution and in which you had a chance of looking at, are wholly exactly the same as these details.  So, in other words, everything that we see, I suggest, your name there, your date of birth there, your occupation then and in 1994, your place of birth, your actual residence and your residence in April of '94, all those things on that page are accurate, do you agree?  
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  
Q.	Now, the difficulty is we are in open session, so don't be too specific, but indicate where you think something is not accurate.  
A.	My place of birth and my residence are given, as well as where I was when I signed this statement.  But the document, contrary to what you have just said, does not indicate my current address.  
Q.	No, this is a document that was born in 1998, it doesn't give your current address today, if that's what you mean, it is what it was in 1998.  
A.	Yes.  Yes, indeed, that is why I said that I did not agree with you about my current address because my address at the time I signed this statement is different from the address at which I live today.  
Q.	I think we understand that and we take that point.  Thank you.  

Now, if you turn over the page, you will see there and again, don't read it out, I am not going to, but it has got the name of your parents there, the details, the first name and second name for each of them, and as we know everyone has a different name in Rwanda; they don't have a family as such.  Then it has your status which describes you and I don't think this is a sensitive matter, **********, I don't think that's an identifying feature, but it gives the name ****************************, and also the number of children you had at that time, which was correct.  You went on, one understands, to have further children, but at that time that was correct.  It goes on to accurately reflect what languages you speak and also I suggest to accurately reflect any time you didn't spend in Rwanda.  So, again, all that information is correct; isn't it?  The investigators got all that correct, didn't they?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	They seem to have taken trouble and care in getting it correct, don't they?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I just want to point out one small matter.  Mr. Hooper said, "We can see the languages that you speak."  Is it a question of language or languages?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we can all see the document.  I think it is plain on the document, isn't it? 
MS. FALL:
Was it language or languages?  Because in the document I have, we have "language spoken and understood:  Kinyarwanda," whereas you have referred to the languages you speak?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, you just speak Kinyarwanda and you just read Kinyarwanda.  It is correct, isn't it?  I am not suggesting anything else, I hope not.  So everything there is dead right, right down to the language.  

Now, how long did they spend with you when they came to see you the first time?  
A.	Counsel, it is increasingly difficult for me to answer your questions.  For example, if you ask me how much time I have spent with you in this courtroom since morning, I would say it is a long time.  And you will understand that my answer will be more difficult in the case of an event that occurred a long time ago, that is since 1998.  
Q.	But it is quite a lot of information that you have provided, I suggest, in the statement.  So I suggest they must have spent quite a time with you; isn't that right?  
A.	I have told you that they found me at my place of work and that there was a power outage.  I did not have leave to see them -- authorisation to see them, so I was not able to spend much time with them.  
Q.	Could you have spent as much as two hours with them, for example?  
A.	No.  
Q.	An hour and a half?  
A.	If I remembered, I would have told you.  I have told you that I don't remember.  I can tell you for sure that it was a short interview.  
Q.	On the **************** 2004, page 39 of the transcript -- page 41 -- correction.  You said -- this is you speaking, without any suggestion, "How long did you spend with the investigators?  And you said, "Our meeting lasted from one to two hours, perhaps an hour and half."  Do you agree or disagree with that recollection of only a year ago?  
A.	I agree, but all depends on the question that is put.  You are telling me -- you are talking to me about the time when the investigators came to get me to sign the statement.  But when I answered the question that you have just read out, I was referring to the time when the investigators came to collect or to take down my written statement.  
Q.	Very well, I accept that.  So you would accept that it was up to two hours, in your recollection, that they spent with you on the first occasion when they came and ask you for this information, do you agree with that?  
A.	Yes, I am not giving you a precise duration, but I agree that, approximately, it might have been that, that is when they came to meet me to take down my written statement.  I think we spoke for a fairly long time then.  
Q.	Very well.  And then when they came back on the 12th of February with the statement, they -- did they read the statement to you before you signed it?  
A.	I have told you in detail that they came and saw me -- looked for me twice, they didn't find me, and when they did find me, I was in a hurry because it was at my place of work.  I took my statement, but I wasn't able to read it through because I was in a hurry.  So I signed the statement.  It was very quick reading.  
Q.	Did they read the statement to you, yes or no?  
A.	Obviously, it is they who read the statement.  
Q.	Right.  
A.	It was not I who read the statement because, as I have told you, I only speak and understand Kinyarwanda.  
Q.	I will ask you again, just for the last time, did they read your statement to you?  
A.	You have repeated your question several times, and so I am going to repeat my answer to you.  I said that the statement was read to me very quickly because I did not have authorisation to talk with these people.  My bosses had not given me leave to meet these investigators.  
Q.	And having read it, did you make any changes to it?  
A.	I told you that I did not make any changes to the statement, considering that I was in a hurry, and since I was in a hurry, the statements could not be read out to me word-for-word.  
Q.	Do you remember saying on a previous occasion this answer to this question?  "Did you make any changes to it?  And the question was, "When it was read to you, did you make any changes to it?"  Your reply, "Yes, I corrected a few passages in the statements because the person who drafted it could have made a few mistakes in some places."  I am unclear.  Did you alter anything before the final statement was signed by you or not?  
A.	You have just read out a question that was put to me and my answer.  I would like to tell you that this depends on the time that is being referred to.  Perhaps this refers to changes that I made when I came here and the Prosecutor interviewed me and not at the time when the investigators came to get my signature and reread the statement -- my statement to me.  
Q.	When you signed the statement on the 12th of February, did you believe that what was contained in the statement was, indeed, what you had said and wanted to say?  
A.	Generally, when investigators approach you, they ask you to trust them.  So I trusted them and I told myself that they had added or taken out nothing apart from what I had said.  However, it is entirely possible to make a mistake here and there in a statement.  
Q.	All right.  Now, may I just ask you this before coming to the statement itself; it is right that you have given evidence to the Procurer investigator -- the Prosecutor for Rwanda.  You have given evidence in respect of cases in Rwanda; is that correct?  
A.	No, that is not correct.  
Q.	Well, can you just clarify the position?  I thought the position was, as you told us in evidence to the Prosecutor this morning, that you provided statements in respect of cases in Rwanda.  Is that correct or not?  
A.	I said that I gave information.  I did not say that I gave testimony in trials that are ongoing in Rwanda.  This is because people from our region have not -- are not yet being tried, because the trials concerning our region have not yet begun.  
Q.	My question was -- or I thought it was, have you given evidence, or maybe that was misleading, have you made statements in respect of other people -- people detained in Rwanda to the Rwandese prosecution, and I think from your answer, the answer to that is yes, I have statements in respect of people detained in Rwanda.  Is that correct?  
A.	Yes, you understood correctly because I said that I gave information to the court and to the police in Rwanda.  I was connecting this to something else in Rwanda, whereas, to the best of my knowledge, I have never gone before a court to give testimony in a trial in Rwanda.  
Q.	And, indeed, before the United Nations investigators came to see you in February of 1998, you had already provided information to the judicial police in respect of, for example, the killings at Kayanga health centre.  That is correct; isn't it?  
A.	No.  
Q.	That's incorrect; is it?  
A.	It is not correct.  It is not true.  
Q.	Didn't you, for example, speak to a judicial police officer called Mister -- and I may not get his name right -- Papius and provide him with information concerning particular people detained or to be detained in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I gave him information.  
Q.	Did that concern, for example, Brigadier Nyarwaya, yes or no, please?  
A.	There are two people called Nyarwaya, so I don't know which of them you are referring to.  
Q.	Well, either one?  
A.	Yes, I gave information. 
Q.	And was that man a brigadier during the genocide?  
A.	Yes, he was.  
Q.	And did the information you gave relate to the Kayanga health centre?  
A.	There is a lot of information on Nyarwaya, and the people were looking for particular information, the people concerned, that is.  
Q.	Well, can you answer the question?  Did it concern Kayanga health centre?  
A.	I have told you that I did not mention that event.  There is a lot more information about this person available and the authorities needed to collect all that information.  
Q.	Did you provide information concerning anyone concerning the Kayanga health centre, yes or no?  
A.	In Rwanda, the authorities needed eyewitnesses.  They did not want just information.  But at one point, some people came to me and asked me to give them information about this matter and I gave it to them.
(Pages 52 to 57 by Sithembiso Moyo)
































1730H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And is it right in providing information about what you knew of the Kayanga health centre killings, that you made no mention of André Rwamakuba, is that correct? 
A.	No question was put to me in Rwanda by Rwandan authorities about Rwamakuba. 
Q.	And is the answer to my question, "Yes, I did not mention Rwamakuba to anyone in Rwanda concerning the Kayanga health centre or any other matter"? 
A.	I never spoke of Rwamakuba in any case. 
Q.	And the first time you mentioned him was then in 1998 when the United Nation's investigators spoke to you?  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Sorry, excuse me, Madam Witness, can I trouble you to turn to the last page of your statement that you have in front of you and, perhaps, this is the last matter I will deal with this evening.  And if we look at the last page of the document you signed, the document itself is in Kinyarwanda and French, and could you read to us, if you agree to, and it's a matter for you, but could you read it out because as you read it out it can be translated, you see?  Can you read out the bit that you signed, starting from "E" Nyandeko (phonetic).  Do you see that line there?  It's the line at the top.  "E" Nyandeko (Kinyarwanda spoken).  You can see why I'm not going to read it out.  And, if you'd just read that out and then we can get the translation  immediately as you read it.  If you can do that, that would be a help, and that's all we're asking you to do this evening, all right?  So you read it in Kinyarwanda and the gentleman there, will translate it instantly into French and English for the rest of us.  And if -- if you're in difficulty about reading it, say so.  I don't want to embarrass you if there is a difficulty, but if you can read it, can you read it to us, please? 
A.	I have no problem with reading this passage. 
Q.	Okay, would you like to read it out to us because, if not, the interpreter probably has it in front of him and he can read it straight out to us, and we'll get it translated like that.  But if you read it, we all get a translation. 
A.	"This transcript is being read to me in Kinyarwanda.  It is true and complete to the best of my knowledge and to the best of my recollection. 

"I gave this statement freely with no promise or constraint.  I know that this statement could be used in a court of law in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda."  

Should I continue? 

"I also know that I may be called on to give testimony in an open session before a Trial Chamber either in the Trial Chamber itself or in the Appeals Chamber.  I'm also aware that any false testimony could lead to prosecution against me by this Tribunal, according to the rules of procedure of this Tribunal." 

Then, you have the name, the signature and the date.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
End of translation. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And so, as you put your signature to that, it was obvious that was a significant and important document that you were signing, that's correct, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as - if, I may say so, with respect to you, an intelligent and careful person such as yourself, you would not have signed that unless you believed that what it contained fairly and accurately reflected what you had said.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	But why are you adding that I did not do -- do this as an intelligent person?  I don't understand you.  I told you from the outset that I trusted the investigators.  That is why I agreed to sign the document after a cursory reading thereof.  And I even explained the circumstances under which this cursory reading was conducted. 
Q.	And just before we leave it this evening, the next bit, as you can see, is in French.  And I'm not going to read it all the way through, but that's signed by the interpreter, and he says that he's been informed that you don't speak -- or you only speak Kinyarwanda.  He says that he's translated the declaration from French into Kinyarwanda in your presence, and that you have confirmed to him that you had heard and understood his translation of your statement. 

And he goes on to say that you recognise that the facts and affirmations in your statement translated by you -- by him, are a true reflection of what you have seen and heard on the subject.  And this interpreter then places his signature and your signature appears again. But, as I understand it, you're saying, what, that he didn't do that and that he's lied, has he?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	No, the interpreter did not lie.  I would like you to tell the Trial Chamber what you're driving at -- because up until now, I still don't see what you're driving at.  I have explained everything to you about my statement and if you consider that there is a translation -- a new translation, then, please, bring it to the knowledge of the Trial Chamber.  And if you can do so, then perhaps you may be able to prove what you're saying. 
Q.	Thank you, Mrs. -- Ms. -- Mrs. Witness, in fact.  That's as far as I'm able to go and continue tonight and we can continue with this or we'll continue with this tomorrow.  So good evening from me and I'll see you tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, this is, indeed, a time to adjourn. 

Mr. Registry, we will resume in this courtroom tomorrow? 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we'll resume in this courtroom tomorrow morning at 8:45. 

I'm sorry, Madam Witness, I just need to remind you that -- I just need to remind you that you're in the middle of giving your evidence.  You will have to come back tomorrow to continue your testimony.  As a witness in the process of testimony, you're not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know, I know.  I have understood. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1745H)
