P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Fry, could you open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 9th of November 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same?  
MR. HOOPER:
They are.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Registrar informed me that you wanted to make a motion.  Somebody wanted to make a motion?  No.  

Call the witness, please.
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be continuing your evidence this morning, and the Prosecutor will continue questioning you.  I must remind you that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth.  
MS. FALL:
Excuse me, Mr. President, we are unable to hear the French booth.  

Mr. President, the French booth is telling me to inform you that the technician needs to change the connections because there is a problem.  Actually, yesterday there was a new team that was here and they changed the connection.  I am the interpreter today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  How much time is that going to need?  Do we need to rise for a few minutes, or can it be done right away?
  
JUDGE KAM:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think we may be ready by now.  

Madam Witness, can you hear me?  

It's still not working.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, we can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar has showed me now that the problems are completely resolved.  I just need to put on the record that we are starting late because of technical problems.  You are still not getting anything?  The problem is not yet found.  

Mr. Fry, do we need to do something?   

The Registrar informs me that we have to rise for a few minutes for the matter to be resolved properly.  So we will take a short recess while the technical problems are resolved.  
(Court recessed from 0903H to 0928H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, is everybody hearing me now?  So this problem has been satisfactorily resolved.  I just wanted to say that we are now starting approximately 45 minutes late, due to technical reasons.  We have a tight schedule this session, as we would like to stick to our schedule and have the Defence case completed during the course of this session, and I would just like to appeal to the technical staff to try to minimise this type of problem, because sometimes even situations of this nature can contribute to our failure to stick to our time standards.  

Now, Madam Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence will resume now.  The Prosecutor will continue her questions, and I should remind you that you remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony started.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
WITNESS 920,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	We are going to continue with cross-examination, madam.  I would remind you that yesterday, when -- before we broke up, we were speaking of André Rwamakuba.  I will, therefore, continue putting questions to you regarding him and I would remind you that under examination-in-chief, in response to the question had you heard André Rwamakuba say nasty things about the Tutsi, you answered that you had never heard him say such things.  Now, tell us how many times you had the opportunity to hear André Rwamakuba.  
A.	Never.  I don't even know him. 
Q.	Having -- never having heard him, how can you say that you never heard him saying nasty things? 
A.	You asked me whether Rwamakuba said nasty things about the Tutsi, and I answered that I never heard him speak. 
Q.	Did you hear him saying kind things, nice things, about the Tutsi? 
A.	I never heard him say nice things because I told you I have never heard him speak. 
Q.	So we agree to say that you don't know whether he said nice things or nasty things about the Tutsi?  
A.	No, I cannot confirm anything, whether they are nice things or nasty things.  I never heard him speak and I never heard people saying that he held -- that he had held any meetings.  
Q.	I'm not speaking of meetings now; I'm merely speaking of what you have stated.  Let us continue.  Yesterday you were shown a photo concerning André Rwamakuba and you answered that you had never seen that person in your life.  Can you tell us at what -- when you saw that photograph for the first time? 
A.	I saw that photo when I arrived here in Arusha, when we were informed that we were going to meet lawyers, advocates. 
Q.	Can you tell us exactly when you saw that photograph for the first time; in other words, when did you arrive here?  Please be more specific.  
A.	I do not recall exactly the date on which I was shown that photograph.  I know that we arrived here on a Wednesday, the 2nd.  I think I also remember that one day we came to visit the Tribunal.  I do not remember exactly the date, but I know that I saw the photograph when I arrived here.  If I had known that I would be put questions as to the date, I would have tried to keep it in memory.  
Q.	So, when you began testifying here on the 7th, you had already seen the photograph? 
A.	Yes, I had been shown the photograph before. 
Q.	So when, madam, you saw -- you said in your testimony that it was the first time that you saw that man, it was not correct, because you had seen the photograph some days before? 
A.	I thought you were asking me whether I had physically seen that man, so I answered that in my life I had never seen that man in the photograph. 
Q.	It wasn't me who put the question to you; it was Counsel Hooper.  Let us continue, Madam Witness.  Do you think that if you had seen that person you were shown in the photograph at the time of the events of 1994, you would have been able to recognise him today? 
A.	I would not have recognised him immediately. 
Q.	Can you tell us exactly why you would not have recognised him immediately? 
A.	Well, it was quite some time ago.  People can get fatter, get thinner.  People can change.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, for that answer.  You also said under examination in-chief that all the people -- inhabitants of your secteur did not know him.  Can you tell us exactly how many people live in your secteur, the number of inhabitants? 
A.	Were I to make an estimate, I should think that there are 1,500 inhabitants of this secteur.  However, I don't think I mentioned the whole secteur.  I think I was speaking of the cellule, of the inhabitants of Ndatemwa cellule.  As to the inhabitants of that place, there are 115 families -- 115 hearths, homes. 
Q.	Do you know all 115 inhabitants of the cellule? 
A.	Yes, I do know them. 
Q.	If you were asked to do so, could you write down the names of all those 115 people? 
A.	If you give me a sheet of paper and a pen and time to remember all the names, I could do so. 
Q.	Let me reassure you, madam, I will not do so.  However, there is a contradiction between what you said before and what you are saying now, inasmuch as you have stated that André Rwamakuba, you heard him mentioned in 1990 -- before 1990 and after 1990, at the time of political party meetings, and that some people from your area knew him, and you even said there was an MDR member who knew him.  So I note there there's a contradiction between what you said about nobody knowing him and that there were, in fact, some people who did know him.  
A.	I told you yesterday.  I gave you an example of Joas Habimana who knew Rwamakuba because he was a member of that political party.  I heard him mention André Rwamakuba.  In the neighbouring secteur of Rutunga -- that man lives in Rutunga, which is a neighbouring secteur, so he lives on the border between the two secteurs. 
Q.	Madam Witness, have you had the opportunity to question all the inhabitants of your cellule, to know whether they knew André Rwamakuba or not? 
A.	After having heard on the radio that Rwamakuba had killed people at Ndatemwa secteur, most of the inhabitants of our area began saying that that news was surprising and were asking ourselves.  You can even investigate if you ask -- take a sample of 20 people, I know that everybody will tell you that they do not know that man and that he never killed anybody at Ndatemwa centre. 
Q.	And what you are relating is what was said at the Gacaca proceedings, of course? 
A.	No, it was not what was said at the Gacaca proceedings.  Nobody mentioned the name Rwamakuba at the Gacaca proceedings.  It's as if someone meets his neighbour and begins discussing the news they've heard over the radio.  So people chatted and they were saying that they were surprised to hear such an item of news over the radio. 
Q.	And did you discuss it with the 115 inhabitants of your area? 
A.	No, I did not chat with everyone, but I told you I live at a trading centre, where many people come.  It is, of course -- one can understand that certain people live very near Lake Muhazi and don't know what happened at Ndatemwa centre, but those who live at the trading centre or round about there, we discussed that surprising item of news. 
Q.	So, contrary to what you are saying, it's not all people who didn't know him, but some people with whom you had an opportunity to chat? 
A.	I did not tell you that all members of the population, all inhabitants, didn't know him.  I said that the people who I met and talked with, who live at the centre or around about, all said that they were surprised to hear that item of news over the radio.  I wasn't undertaking an investigation, just talking about conversations between people. 
Q.	Madam Witness, do you know what Rwamakuba's position was? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You never heard that he was a member of a government? 
A.	Before fleeing, I heard the name.  I heard the name on the radio when the government was being set up, established.  That's where I heard his name mentioned. 
Q.	Can you tell us specifically when you heard that the government had been established? 
A.	Well, if I were to make an estimate, I think the government was instituted -- established, on the 9th of April 1994.  I can't be specific as to the date, but I think it was in the course of that week.  So let us say I think it was the 9th of April 1994. 
Q.	Quite, Madam Witness.  And did you hear André Rwamakuba speak on that day? 
A.	You mean over the radio?  No.  And even if I had heard him, I wouldn't have recognised his voice unless someone introduced him before he spoke.  Otherwise, I would not be -- I wouldn't know how to answer your question. 
Q.	On that day, madam, were the members of the interim government sworn in, and weren't the various ministers mentioned by name? 
A.	It is possible, but I didn't have -- it is possible that I didn't have the opportunity to listen to the radio on that day.  I wasn't listening to the radio all day long. 
Q.	But did you say that you heard it on that day, the 9th of April 1994? 
A.	I heard people saying that the government had been established and they gave the name of some of the members in the government, and that included the name of Rwamakuba.  But as to the swearing-in ceremony, I did not listen to that.  I did not follow that over my radio.  
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness, for this very selective memory.  

We will now go on to something else.  You said under examination-in-chief that no vehicle came to the trading centre, apart from communal vehicles, and you even specified between the 10th, 11th and 12th of April.  Were you consistently outside to be able to assert -- to be able to assert that no vehicles came on those days?  
A.	I live very close to the road, and over all that period, because the situation was delicate, whenever we heard a vehicle, we went to see.  I live right next to the road.  And, moreover, on the photograph I was shown yesterday, you can see me.  I looked at the photograph carefully and it is me.  Because every time we heard the sound of a vehicle, we went outside to see what vehicle was coming.  I can assert that no other vehicle came to the trading centre during that period.  
Q.	So to go out -- you're speaking of a rumbling vehicle, noises.  Is it possible that a vehicle could come that doesn't make too much noise and then you wouldn't know that a vehicle had come? 
A.	It is possible, but in that case I think that someone would have told me that a vehicle will come.  At that time we exchanged all the information we had. 
Q.	And who could have told you of such an event? 
A.	I have neighbours very close, in the immediate vicinity, and at that time we exchanged all the information we had.  I did not live alone at the trading centre. 
Q.	Well, if vehicles (sic) such as you have accepted could not have heard the noise of the vehicle, how could they have alerted you? 
A.	In such a case, I would not have known. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you have also stated that no one -- no vehicle could come from Kigali to your cellule because the roads were impassable, in practical terms.  I think I'm being faithful in summarising what you stated.  
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.  The road to Kigali to Ndatemwa was impassable and the vehicles that came at that time came from Rutunga to Ndatemwa and could go no further.  
Q.	Yes, I understand, but what I'm asking you, why you said straight off that there were vehicles from Kigali and why not Rutunga, Kayanga?  Why were they vehicles from Kigali? 
A.	During that period no vehicle came up that road.  It's from Kigali we heard the shooting.  That's where the situation was the thorniest. 
Q.	Madam Witness, why are you again so formal in saying that no vehicle could come from Kigali?  
A.	It is because I saw no vehicle come from Kigali.  And as I told you, if you put the same question to the people who live in the same places I do, they will tell you the same thing.  Vehicles could not take that road, and even apart from vehicles, people could not move around much and not very far from their residence. 
Q.	Madam, would you be surprised if I tell you that there has been a judgment handed down by this Tribunal that established -- 
MR. HOOPER:
With respect, that was a judgment that was reached not on evidence in this case, and it's wholly inappropriate for my friend to refer to it to this witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that under the circumstances, Counsel Hooper has referred to that -- those judgements -- or that judgement. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, that wasn't clear.  
MS. FALL:
I merely want to do the same thing.  I suggest in Kamuhanda, paragraph 220, it was clearly established that it was possible to come from Kigali to Gikomero in the period between the 7th of April and the 14th of July 1994.  
MR. HOOPER:
My friend's right, there was reference made to the Kamuhanda judgement in the course of the Prosecution case, by the Defence, in respect of two witnesses who were disbelieved on their oath by the Chamber, which is an issue of credibility.  The issue of access is obviously quite a thorny issue.  And while it was addressed in the Kamuhanda case, that is no reason to conclude that the judgement in respect of that fact was correct.  It was, in fact, regretfully, wrong.  But that is not the issue here.  The issue here is what is the factual position in evidence for this Tribunal, and this witness did not give evidence in the Kamuhanda case.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President.  Mr. President, I should simply like to remind the Defence that perhaps I'm not very experienced in cross-examination, since it doesn't exist in my system, but I am sticking to what Mr. Hooper, who knows it well, has consistently done throughout the Prosecution case, and I would use another example in relation to the acts -- events at Kabakobwe, where he referred to a judgement concerning Butare.  I think that, each time, the Court was invited to go to the transcript and then could give the appropriate weight to the information given.  

I don't think I'm doing anything extraordinary.  I'm following the method used by Counsel Hooper.  And I think we're allowed to -- references to judgement, and when you say the judgement is incorrect, there was an appeal, and I think the result is clear.  
MR. HOOPER:
I've dealt with the reference to credibility and to the Chamber finding that two witnesses relied on by the Prosecution had lied in the Kamuhanda case, which is an issue of credibility.  In relation to Kabakobwe, that was not a transcript of judgement; it was an assertion contained in an indictment, that is an assertion made by the Prosecutor -- there is only one here -- in the indictment, not a transcript.  So quite a different situation, in my submission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, a finding of fact made by another Trial Chamber doesn't have any probative value in this trial, so the fact that another Trial Chamber had made that finding is not probative.  So we don't think that that is a suitable matter to put to the witness in this way, for that reason.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I shall comply with the decision because you said that this was prior testimony of the witness that counted, while indicating that references should be included during the Prosecution's case.  So I shall proceed with my examination.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you said afterwards that you never heard about the distribution of machetes and that the machetes that were used were those that were taken from the houses.  Is that an accurate reflection of what you said? 
A.	Yes, that's what I said. 
Q.	So you confirm that there were no new machetes in Ndatemwa centre, do you? 
A.	When I went past the vehicle where the assailants armed with machetes were, I saw no new machete, unless these machetes, these new machetes were distributed after I had left.  
Q.	In view of what you've just said, could it have been possible that new machetes were distributed after your departure? 
A.	You told me not to talk about what I learned in Gacaca court, but -- 
Q.	Madam, I asked you a very precise question based on your prior answer.  You did say that it was possible that the distribution of machetes took place after your departure.  I would like you to confirm that it is possible that a distribution took place after you left, so your answer should be "yes" or "no".  
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	You also told us about machetes that were attached to Ephrem's belt.  Can you tell us how many of these machetes you saw, because you said machetes, in plural, and not in singular.  
A.	I was able to see, I believe, four machetes. 
Q.	So, based on what you have just said, were these machetes new ones or old ones? 
A.	They were small, old machetes. 
Q.	Did Ephrem live in the centre? 
A.	No.  I have explained to you that he lived in Gishaka secteur, near the commune office. 
Q.	So you are saying that the machetes that Ephrem brought were not machetes that came from Ndatemwa? 
A.	These machetes did not come from Ndatemwa. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter cannot interpret counsel's question because she didn't hear the beginning of the answer.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall.  
THE WITNESS:
These were not new machetes.  They were old ones that had already been used. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was trying to attract your attention.  The English booth had a problem with the earlier question and answer before this one.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you.  I apologise.  I'm going to be careful.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I'm not talking about old or new machetes.  You just said that no new machetes were introduced into Ndatemwa, but if I look at your statement, there were four machetes which did not belong in the centre which were brought in by Ephrem, weren't they? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  When questions were put to you in your examination regarding a list of names that was handed over and you were asked whether you had the opportunity of seeing some of these people during these events, you answered in the negative.  I'm not mistaken, am I?  
A.	I did not see these people. 
Q.	Can you tell us, as exactly as possible, the people that you saw on that day at the centre? 
A.	Are you referring to the 13th?  You want their names, or do you want the number?  
Q.	I think if you were to give me the number for the time being, that will be all right.  
A.	I cannot give an exact figure.  I was just going past the vehicle.  I crossed the centre and I was able to see some faces.  Let's say that I saw about 10 people.  There were also refugees from Byumba.  I knew some of the names of these refugees, or I knew the names of some of these refugees, but some others I only knew by sight.  What I can tell you is that, on the whole, I saw about 15 to 20 people when I went past.  I didn't stop.  
Q.	So you were going past quickly.  You didn't stop.  You said that you were able to see 15 refugees from Byumba.  You were able to see three communal policemen, one of whom you knew.  You were able to recognise some people when you were going past fairly quickly.  Were you able to see all the people who were present at the centre on that day? 
A.	It's impossible.  I couldn't see all the people who were at the centre.  I was able to see those who were near the place where I went past.  My main interest was to leave that place as quickly as possible and go to hide. 
Q.	Based on this answer, is it possible that the persons that you said you didn't see were at the centre, without your being actually able to see them? 
A.	I say that it is impossible, because from the 9th, when Nyarwaya fired into the air at the centre in Ndatemwa, people began to leave the centre, so all that were left were the inhabitants of the centre itself and the surroundings.  So when two young people were beaten up, purportedly because they were Tutsis, all the Tutsis and all people who looked like Tutsis left the centre.  There is only one person who lived near the centre amongst the names that you showed me on the list, but the other people did not live near the centre. 
Q.	I am going to repeat the question:  Is it possible that the people who lived near the centre were around there and you did not see them? 
A.	Perhaps if these people were in a wood that was next to the centre, I might not have seen them.  The people I saw were the assailants who came out of the vehicle.  He was not near the assailants, but his house was destroyed.  Maybe he was coming to destroy houses along with the other people who came to do so, although his own house had been destroyed. 
Q.	Something else, Madam Witness:  It is entirely possible that he was there and you didn't see him.  

To move on, from the time on the 9th of April the brigadier fired into the air and the Tutsis became afraid and fled, this brings to mind this question:  What is your ethnic origin?  
A.	I'm a Tutsi. 
Q.	You didn't take flight immediately.  Can you explain to us why? 
A.	The Tutsis and the Hutus of the centre did not understand what was going on when Nyarwaya fired into the air on the 9th.  It was only on Monday, when the young people were beaten up, that we understood what was going on, and from that time we didn't spend the night in our houses.  On Monday and Tuesday night, we spent our nights in the banana grove near our houses.  But there were Tutsis and Hutus who were hiding in this banana grove; we were together.  When they came to destroy the houses and kill people, we were still there, all of us.  And when we heard the sound of this vehicle, we fled.  And I went to hide in the house of the person whose name you showed me on a list.  We all left at the same time; we fled at the same time. 
Q.	So contrary to what you just told us, on the 9th the Tutsis and Hutus did not leave.  "We stayed in our homes" -- 
A.	Yes, we didn't leave. 
Q.	Will you left me finish, please?  So you stayed at your home and spent your nights in banana groves, and it is only after these two people were beaten up that you felt you ought to leave.  So at what exact time did you personally leave the centre?  Can you give us the date again, please? 
A.	I left the centre on the 13th.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I shall return to some matters pertaining to André Rwamakuba.  You say that you never did learn that he said anything negative about the Tutsis.  Did you hear that he did anything bad to the Tutsis? 
A.	I heard nothing of the sort. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you to tell us when you learned that André Rwamakuba committed punishable acts in that centre.  
A.	I heard this on the radio.  I believe it was in July.  I don't remember the exact date.  
Q.	Madam Witness, did you not hear that André Rwamakuba was one of those people who was being sought for the crime of genocide? 
A.	I also heard that on the radio.  
Q.	Witness, can you tell us when you heard that on the radio? 
A.	I no longer remember.  It's a long time ago. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether this was before you heard that he had committed crimes in Ndatemwa, or after? 
A.	It was before. 
Q.	Since you admit that you heard this at least once before you heard that he had committed crimes in Ndatemwa, can you tell us what was said and what he was being accused of? 
A.	They said that he had committed genocide in his commune of origin, in Gikomero.  We did not know exactly where this was.  And it was in July that we heard that it was in Ndatemwa.  We found this surprising.  Before that, we had thought that it was in his area of origin in Nduba.  We didn't think that this involved our centre.  
Q.	Did you also learn that he was on the list of category 1 criminals? 
A.	I did not know that.  I only heard this on the radio.  I don't know whether -- whether that was when they talked about it on the radio, but that is when it was discussed on the radio. 
Q.	So don't you have on your list that you have -- a list from the Gacaca sessions -- a complete list of people who are being sought for crimes committed? 
A.	We don't have a list. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I am going to conclude my cross-examination by giving you a list and I am going to ask you whether you know these people, the people on this list.  
MS. FALL:
If registry would be to kind as to assist me with this.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I say that, as with the document yesterday relating to Édouard Turatsinze, we haven't been shown this document prior to its being used in cross-examination, which has been the norm and one to which the Defence complied, and I regret that.  We're yet to return, unless it's the same document, to the document that was shown yesterday, but we weren't shown that.  And despite requests, incidentally, we haven't been provided with any copies of the document that was shown yesterday.  We asked yesterday and we asked by e-mail, and we were told that we were going to get one, and we asked again this morning.  And it would be helpful if we could get a minimum degree of cooperation from the Prosecution.  

Is there a copy of that list for us, please, and perhaps for the Judges?  And we understand, if there are to be exhibits, that they are duty bound to be produced, or at least offered to be inspected, before they're pulled out of the hat.  May I say that no particular problem arises with this document, unlike the one yesterday.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Everyone has his turn, as one would see.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, that is not, with respect, Mr. President, a sufficient response to the concern that's raised by the Defence; that is, that if an exhibit such as this, and in particular an exhibit as was produced yesterday, is going to be used in cross-examination, then the Prosecution are obliged, just as we were obliged under a Court order, to produce that exhibit before cross-examination.  It doesn't have to be before evidence-in-chief, but before cross-examination.  

We've asked for the document, for example, that was produced yesterday.  We were told we would get it in the Prosecutor's own good time, was the response I got yesterday.  We asked if we could get it served on us during the afternoon.  We've had no response.  We asked for it again this morning.  We haven't been provided it.  And I appreciate my friend is coming to the end of her cross-examination, but I think I made it clear yesterday that we wanted the document, and I made it plain to the Prosecutor, before we concluded with this witness.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I shall not argue with that.  I shall not argue about that.  I would just like to continue with my cross-examination, with your leave. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's appropriate that you should address the issue of giving notice to the Defence because it is a principle which we'd like to see adhered to during the proceedings, and I think it's an order.  I had not intervened earlier because you had made a comment a few minutes ago that you are not accustomed to cross-examination in your home jurisdiction, and so I thought that, as a result of that, a certain amount of our indulgence is called for.  But you should at least give an undertaking as to future conduct and an intention to comply with the principle of giving notice before your cross-examination commences.  So I, at least, expect to hear that from you.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  When I said that I was not familiar with this, what I was saying was trying to make a joke and I was just trying to follow Mr. Hooper's conduct in examination-in-chief in respect to the transcripts.  You will see that I have asked Mr. Hooper to give us documents not at the last moment but a lot earlier than that.  The transcript will reflect this.  I think that Mr. Hooper used the same attitude during the Prosecution case.  He would say this is the document, we have a reference; we do not know whether we are going to use it -- tender it as an exhibit.  He said this yesterday and it was very clear.  
I didn't want to argue, Mr. President, but this is forcing my hand a bit.  We made a suggestion to the witness.  The witness answered.  We said in respect of the document pertaining to that, that we might tender this as an exhibit, and the document has yet to be tendered as an exhibit.  So, Mr. President, I don't want to argue too much.  With all due respect to the Trial Chamber, I have taken notes of what you have said and I think we will follow what decision you have made.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Proceed.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you have before you a list of names.  I don't think I shall bother reading them.  You have numbers.  I'd like you to tell us merely who you know and what your relationship to that person is.  I'll begin with No. 1.  Can you tell us how you know that person?  If you know them, of course.  
A.	No, I don't know No. 1.  
Q.	So she doesn't live in your cellule or secteur? 
MR. HOOPER:
It's a "he"; it's a male.  
THE WITNESS:
I know someone that has the same name as him.  I don't know if it's that person you're referring to, but the one I am thinking about is still very young.  He's about 20 years old.  If you could specify the age of the person you are thinking about, I might know whether you're speaking of the same person whom I am thinking about. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	No, really, I'm asking if that person, whether very young or not, lives in your area.  
A.	Yes, that person lives in our locality, in our area. 
Q.	And No. 2, do you know that person? 
A.	Yes, I know No. 2. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you came to know that person? 
A.	I know -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, just to go back to the last one -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- that it is someone who worked at the commune before. 
MR. HOOPER:
The Prosecution in fact have a full statement from that last-named person, and his date of birth is on it of 1970, which makes him, of course, 35.  So my friend will have that information.  So it's not right to say that she knows this witness knows that person, if in fact she's distinguishing the person by age.  So, please, don't mislead the witness, please.  
MS. FALL:
I don't understand Counsel Hooper -- when he tells us we have a false statement with a false identity, I did not correct -- I did not follow -- I didn't follow at all what Counsel Hooper was saying.  Maybe there was a problem in the interpretation or translation.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It sounds so to me, from what you have just said.  The witness had said that the person whom she was thinking of was a young person whose age was in the vicinity of about 20.  Now, Mr. Hooper said that you have a statement which indicates that the age is 35, so it is possible that the person whom this witness was referring to was not the same person who you were asking about, and that in order to avoid misinformation, you should have disclosed the issue of the age to the witness to ensure that there was -- that you are both speaking about the same person.  That's the point he was making, which I think is a fair point.  
MS. FALL:
I have fully understood, Mr. President.  Indeed, it was deliberately that I did not dwell on the topic of that witness.  I wish to continue and speak of the second person, the second person. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel mentioned the name on the list.  Counsel now says, "The name I just mentioned should be redacted, expunged from the record."
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will make that order and you can refer to the name by number -- the person by number.  
MS. FALL:
The number, of course, yes.  I'm sorry, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Now, No. 2, you say you knew that person and they worked before at the commune? 
A.	Yes, that is what I have just said.  That person worked at the commune before the war. 
Q.	Can you tell us what relations with that person were? 
A.	All I knew was that that person worked at the commune.  There was no other connection between us.  That person was not my neighbour.  He lived very far from us. 
Q.	Madam Witness, have you seen that person recently? 
A.	Yes, I have seen that person. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you met or saw that person? 
A.	I saw that person in Kigali. 
Q.	Can you specify exactly where you saw that person in Kigali? 
A.	I saw them in Remera. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what specific circumstances you saw that person? 
A.	I met him when he was waiting for a list. 
Q.	Witness, did you have the opportunity to discuss this matter or the events that occurred with that person? 
A.	No, we did not have the opportunity to discuss it.  I had no programme to discuss with that person. 
Q.	Do you know whether that person is due to come and testify in this case, or not? 
A.	As we used -- since we used pseudonyms, I don't know whether that person is to come or not.  We don't live in the same place. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I say that we are dealing here with protected witnesses, and they are together in the safe house, and this witness should feel under no constraint about talking about that.  They are in the safe house together here in Arusha, together with other witnesses.  They were all brought as a job lot last week and they were all put, whatever their backgrounds, in the same safe house.  And their identities should be -- or no.  They all know that they're giving evidence.  
MS. FALL:
So Counsel Hooper did not allow the witness to testify.  He testified in her stead and I note that, in relation to her solemn oath, she did not speak the truth.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. President, I wish the Prosecutor in this case could restrain herself a little from time to time.  I intervened because I could see the problem, and the witness had already alluded to that problem.  And as she might well know, witnesses who are protected when they're coming to talk about other witnesses who are protected, are told never to refer to them.  I won't say any more than that, but it must have been apparent the witness was struggling with that constraint.  
MS. FALL:
I repeat, therefore, what I just said, that what -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, that is quite unnecessary because, in due course at a later stage in the proceedings, we will be assessing these issues. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I shall continue. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	We then go to the next witness, witness No. 3.  Look at the list, madam.  Thank you.  Do you know this witness No. 3? 
A.	Yes, I know this witness. 
Q.	Can you tell us what are your relations with this person? 
A.	I don't see this person -- his wife still lives in our -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, could you please ask the witness to repeat that answer?  There was a -- I'm sorry, Mr. President, could we have that repeated?  It wasn't clear, I'm afraid. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we have the witness's last answer?  
THE WITNESS:
How do you expect me to have relations with this person?  That person has been in prison for 11 years and I never see them.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I wanted you to specify in 1994, since you inhabited the same place, what were your relations with that person.  
A.	He was my neighbour.  Otherwise, there was no special connection between me and him.  
Q.	You did tell us in your testimony that before the presidential plane crash, and even after the 9th, there were still excellent relations between all members of the community and that you shared everything.  So you had no relations with that person, which would be contradictory to what you said about good relations existing between all members of the community? 
A.	Yes, we were in good terms -- on good terms, just as I was on good terms with other members of the population.  We did not drink beer together, as some people did, but he was my neighbour and I lived on good terms with that person.  
(Pages 1 to 16 by Karen Holm)





















1048H
BY MS. FALL: 
Q.	Your answer, Witness, surprises me.  When I asked you to tell us what was the nature of the relations, you said, "Well, when we had a glass, we would share it."  That is in the transcript; that is what you said.  And now you're telling us that you did not drink together, so I would really like to know where the truth lies.
A.	You must distinguish between sharing a glass of beer when you meet at a bar, and if someone has money and buys beer, he shares with his neighbours.  All that sort of thing was going on. 
Q.	But you said, Madam, that that person is detained, imprisoned.  Can you tell us why?
A.	He is accused of genocide; that person is accused of genocide. 
Q.	Do you know where -- he is accused of committing genocide where?
A.	In Gacaca proceedings we have the name of that person on our books. 
Q.	But in relation to acts committed where?
A.	He is accused of having committed crimes at Ndatemwa; that he had a lance, a spear; and that he was in the company of the assailants who destroyed houses at Ndatemwa. 
Q.	Let us go on to witness No. 4.  Do you know that person?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you made their acquaintance?
A.	At No. 3's office, and it's a long time since I haven't seen that person.  In 1994 that person was very young, but at present he is a young man. 
Q.	Have you had occasion to meet him recently?
A.	No.  It must be one or two years that I haven't seen that person. 
Q.	And you don't know where that person is now?
A.	No.  How do you expect me to know?  He was a child before.  When the war started, he was a pupil.  After the war, he continued his studies and after finishing his studies he got a job in Kigali.  I don't know whether he is still in Kigali or not. 
Q.	Let us go on to No. 5.  Do you know that person?
A.	There is no full name, Christian name; I see only one name here.  If I could be given his other name -- I think I know his name, but it would be better were I to be given his full name, to be sure that we're talking about --
Q.	I'm very sorry, Madam Witness; this is the information we received from the Defence.  But I can tell you that No. 5 had a bar that was near number 3's.
A.	What, near No. 5?  Sorry, the Prosecutor was not clear.  Near to someone else on the list.  If that is the person that you're referring to, then I know them (sic).
Q.	Under what circumstances did you make their acquaintance?
A.	I knew him, because he was trading also at the centre -- he had a business at the trading centre. 
Q.	And can you tell us what were specifically your relations with him?
A.	I had no problems with that person -- I had no problems with any one. 
Q.	Can you tell us where that person is today?
A.	That person lives at his home. 
Q.	Do you know whether that person had any problems in respect to the Gacaca proceedings -- in respect of the Gacaca proceedings?
A.	I don't know anything about that, because that person lives in Kabarera cellule in Rutunga secteur. 
Q.	So you know that person well.  Although they don't live at the trading centre, you know where they do live?
A.	Yes, I know him and where he lives, because his cellule neighbours ours. 
Q.	Have you seen him recently?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances?
A.	I saw him at church. 
Q.	Can you specify the date?
A.	I don't have a calendar with me, but I think it was about two weeks ago. 
Q.	And did you have the opportunity to discuss this case or those events with that person?
A.	No, I did not.  We just saw each other.  We did not discuss this case, the present case.  I did not know that he had any connection with this trial, and I don't think he knew that I had any connection with the present trial. 
Q.	Very well.  We come now to the last person, No. 6.  Do you know that person?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us your relations with that person?
A.	There are no relations between that person and I, but I know him. 
Q.	And how do you know that person?
A.	He was a communal accountant. 
Q.	I put the question to you again, Witness:  you specify that there's no relationship between you and that person -- family relationship?
A.	No, there is no relationship.  We're not related, but I know of that person. 
Q.	Could you tell us where that person is now?
A.	I don't know where that person is today, but when I left my country, that person was in prison. 
Q.	And do you know why that person was in prison -- is in prison?
A.	He is also accused of genocide.  I did not see him participate in the events, but I heard people say that he is accused of genocide.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think I have finished cross-examining this witness, and I wish to thank the witness for having answered all my questions.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Madam Prosecutor.  I think we ought to take a short break now.
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry to leap to my feet, but just to save time, over the adjournment, can the Prosecution please be invited by you, Mr. President, to provide the Defence with such material as they have, or can indicate the area of material that they have that links the name of the man Édouard Turatsinze with an     Édouard Turatsinze in Ndatemwa.  And can we please be provided with the document that was produced yesterday, because we need to make enquiries, and I would like to make those, as best I can, before the examination of the witness -- the full document, Mr. O'Shea quite, I hope, rightly, reminds me -- so that we could see its context, its provenance and so we can get somewhere on it.

At the moment the Prosecution has left it in the air, and I think we are entitled not only to have had notice of it before it was put, but to have its provenance and its relationship to the man named, asserted by the Prosecution, made clear to us.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that we've been very clear in regard to this position, this document.  We didn't say it was an exhibit.  We suggested something to the witness; the witness responded; and we said that we had this document and that we might tender it as an exhibit.  And, so far, this has not been done.  We have never said that it was an exhibit of the Prosecution.  We said that we might use it as such.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but it was used during the examination of the witness, and the Defence are entitled to re-examine concerning the matter that was put.  So the document should be shown to the Defence.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, thank you for that.  But, in fact, the Defence are entitled before cross-examination, in my submission, to know the provenance of the document, for the Prosecution to say:  "Well, we assert this on this basis."
MR. PRESIDENT:
I agree that is the position.  I'm not certain Ms. Fall is disputing it.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know.  Are you disputing that that is the correct position, Ms. Fall?  

I wasn't aware she was disputing it, but I think I should ask her.

MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we're going to give the document to the Defence.  I think we were clear -- we said that we got this document from Zaire (sic).  We said this yesterday, and we will give it to the Defence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Ms. Fall, as a matter of interest for the future, is there a dispute about the procedure?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that we might have a dispute regarding this procedure, since I fail to understand the requests of Mr. Hooper, because considering documents that are not yet tendered as Prosecution exhibits -- in view of what occurred during the first session, Mr. Hooper, several times, referred to documents.  In spite of our requests, he declined to give the documents and then he didn't tender them as exhibits.

So I do not know what is the procedure that is followed now, but I have realised that the Prosecution have a small problem with this.  I'm sorry, Mr. President; with all due respect, I would like to have some clarification on the matter so that we will understand each other and comply with the decisions of the Trial Chamber.  We do not wish to ignore legal rules, but we expect that there should be equality of arms in this case, and we would like, for this reason, to know what exact procedure should be done.

Based on the transcripts and verifications that we conducted thereof, there were documents that we asked Mr. Hooper to disclose to us.  It was never done, and he said that he couldn't do this because they were not yet exhibits.  And that is why I fail to understand the position now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't recall exactly what you're referring to.  As far as I understand the position, there's no obligation on either party to put any document into testimony -- into evidence.  That is a discretion that each party will obviously exercise.

But, in terms of the documents that are being used during the testimony of a witness, the other side should have notice of the documents that are being used during testimony of a witness.  So if you're cross-examining on a document, that document should be disclosed to the other side for the purpose of the testimony of the witness.  So that is the limited issue that I was dealing with at this stage.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that, having said what I have said, I have nothing more to add at this point.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, but before we rise for the short morning adjournment, can I just invoke again my request that we, and indeed the Chamber, are provided with the basis of the nexus between the name on the document and the person that the Prosecution asserted were one and the same?  What is the basis for that assertion on the part of the Prosecution?  That is something that I need to know and, in the long term you, the Judges, are going to need to know.  We may not be revisiting this position.

Before I cross-examine this witness, I need to have in my mind what the position is.  What is the strength of the Prosecution assertion in respect to this?  After all, it's been done and said to smear this witness.  There was no other possible explanation for its introduction.  It is an unfairness to this witness to allow this witness to leave without my having knowledge of the basis of the assertion so that I can take the witness to it and deal with it properly before she returns to her country.  Thank you.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think, in this case yesterday, in respect of the name that was referred to, or the person who fled, we put it to the witness that it was possible that this person might be on the list of known criminals.  We based our supposition on a document or research that we conducted in Zaire (sic), because the information given to us by the Defence in terms of names and dates is fairly limited.

So we carried out this research.  When we saw this name, we said in the transcript and in our statements that we had this document, and that we did not wish to tender it as an exhibit, but that we reserved the possibility of doing so subsequent to further investigation and verification.

This was clearly indicated in the transcript.  It was clear that after we had checked -- after we had further research conducted on the document, we would determine whether we were going to tender this document as an exhibit.  We never did say that it was an exhibit, and it is following the research that we conducted in Zaire (sic) that this name came up and that is how we received the information.

Mr. President, this is what happened, and I think it is verifiable.  We never at any point suggested that we were going to tender the document as an exhibit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, the issue of an exhibit is not really the problem, because the issue as to whether you tender it as an exhibit is a matter for your discretion.  

But the point is, you see, that you put to the witness something very specific.  One would not expect counsel to make a statement to a witness unless there was a verifiable source for it.  So that is the issue which is being raised now.

I think what I should do at this stage, though, is I think we should still take the break now.  I trust that the matter will be resolved during the break.

MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  We will resolve that, I hope, before you return.  Thank you.
(Court recessed from 1113H to 1140H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we now resume?  Yes, Mr. Hooper, are you ready?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I am; thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, under the rules of our Tribunal, you'll now be asked a few other questions by Mr. Hooper, acting as the Defence lawyer.  So you may proceed now.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I just want to clear up a few points or ambiguities, if they were such, in evidence.  The first matter I'd like to ask you is this.  You described yourself as ***********************.  Was that for the secteur or the cellule?  Can you help us, please?
A.	I'm ********************. 
Q.	And that cellule encompasses, does it, all the centre of Ndatemwa; is that right, or not?
A.	That's right. 
Q.	And if you can just be shown for a moment the photograph which we showed you yesterday, and which you've looked at, where you indicated your house and, indeed, marked it, I'll pass up an unmarked copy to you of our exhibit book P. 2 at photograph 1 on page 14.  

While I'm doing that, I'm also going to pass up two photographs to you.  As those are going up, you mentioned, you may recall, this morning in answer to my friend that on the photograph, as I understood it, that you've been shown yesterday, that having a closer look at it, you think you saw yourself on the photograph; is that right?
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	All right.  So let's see if we can see you there.  And how did you happen to come to be on the photograph in the Prosecutor's bundle?  Did they ask you all to come out and stand outside your houses, or what?  How did that happen?
A.	I do not know when the photograph was taken.  When I looked at it, I realised that the clothing was mine, but --
Q.	So -- I'm sorry.
A.	-- you could see vehicles going past, so I really cannot tell in what year this photograph was taken.
Q.	Don't worry about which year, I'm not going to ask you that.  I'm going to ask you to look at the book that you were shown yesterday, first of all.  And if the photographs can be put down beside her, I'll come to those in a moment.  Thank you very much, Mr. Issa.  
Can you just, very briefly, describe, as best you can, the clothing that you recognise as yours and, therefore, that you'd be wearing in that photograph, photograph 1?  What colour is it?
A.	It is thanks to these documents -- these clothes that I realised that it might have been me, because the face is not visible.
Q.	I appreciate it's very small, but which is the clothing?  Can you describe the colour and then we can find it ourselves?
A.	It is a kitenge, blue in colour -- blue and yellow in colour.  I was carrying a child on my back, so I'm wearing a kitenge, I have a child on my back, and I'm wearing a red T-shirt.  I'm also wearing a head tie on my head.
Q.	Yes.  You've obviously got good eyesight and, in fact, it's the figure on our print-out that is just stood in front of the house that you indicated was -- the building in which your house is, and you're stood side on, and you've got in the photograph what looks like a yellow band around your chest and then the kitenge, which is of course a form of cloth, forming the dress.  And you're in profile, and we can just make out, I think, a baby's head -- yes -- sticking out there.  
A.	Mmm.
Q.	Well, it's not the most important point, but there you are in the photograph, and that was a photograph taken by the -- you wouldn't know this -- we know that it was taken by a Mr. Baghel.  Can you look at the other two photographs, please, and do they also show Ndatemwa -- Ndatemwa centre -- commercial centre?  So, do you recognise the place in those photographs?
A.	I recognise the place, but my house cannot be seen on the photograph.
Q.	No, we can see that, that in fact the photographer has moved down a little past your house to take the photograph.  Right.  But looking at that photograph, again, we can see that your neighbours there, and the people who are in Ndatemwa when the picture's taken, and on the other photograph, are there, and they appear to have come out to see, or they are all watching the photographer; that's right, isn't it?
A.	It is possible, because generally, when we hear the noise of a vehicle, then we go out to see what it is.
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  That's all I need to ask you about the -- about these photographs.  Now, I'm not sure when you mentioned names yesterday whether we, through the interpreters and the work of the stenographers have all got now a spelling of them.  I've made an enquiry, and I think we have, but there was just one that puzzled me, and that was someone you called -- a trader called and I got it down as Ndoli.  Was there a trader called Ndoli and, if there was, can you spell it?
A.	The name is Ndoli -- N-D-O-L-I.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Talking about the events that happened on the 13th, which was the day when, as you told us, the Interhamwe arrived and you fled to a neighbour's home, you dealt with this in your evidence-in-chief, but so we have the picture again, about what time -- and we all appreciate these are approximate times, but at about what time did that pickup arrive with those Interhamwe, as best as you can recall?
A.	It was in the morning, and I think it was at about 11 a.m.
Q.	You said in your evidence-in-chief that the events that then happened -- the looting of houses and the kicking of doors, et cetera, that you heard -- carried on.  Until about what time did that carry on, as far as you can remember?
A.	They broke down the doors very quickly.  There was a house with a metallic -- a door made of metal and it is because of this house and this door that we were able to hear the noise that the assailants were making as they destroyed the houses.  When the noise stopped, when presumably the destruction of the houses had ended, it was about half an hour later, so I would say it took half an hour.  After breaking down the doors, the others began to take property from inside the houses.
Q.	And how long did that go on for?  When did people eventually -- the attackers leave, as far as you could tell, if they left?
A.	They stayed for about an hour, and then they left to destroy the other houses that were somewhat further off from the centre -- the houses that I referred to yesterday.
Q.	So they went off to do that, to houses further away.  And how long did that go on for, can you recall?
A.	I was no longer very close.  I was already in the house where I had sought refuge.  That did not take a long time, because one of the houses they went to belonged to a bachelor, or to a single person, and it didn't take them much time.
Q.	So when did the Interhamwe stop or go away from your area; when did they leave that day, can you remember?
A.	They stayed till evening, till afternoon, I'd say 3 p.m., when they got to Rucikoma's.  That is when the soldier fired a shot and they dispersed.
Q.	Now, can you give the name of that soldier?  Did you know, or have you found out since, who it was, or who you believe it was?
A.	I heard that he was called Ndahayo, and I know that there was a soldier of that name who was at the military outpost that was near our place.
Q.	And do you know what his ethic origin was?
A.	No.
Q.	Now, you told us how, by the time you left, and with everyone fleeing, Hutu and Tutsi alike, you eventually left the area, and you told us how you went away down towards the lake for some days there, and thereabouts, and how you then went across the lake to the safety of the Inkotanyi-held commune on the other side, returning, you said, on 23rd July 1994.  And you then said that local people then found bodies buried in a banana grove -- bodies of men whose hands had been tied behind their backs.  Do those bodies -- are they the subject of Gacaca hearings or not?
A.	No.  In Gacaca sessions we only talk about events that occurred before the morning of the 14th of April. 
Q.	Now, the person that you fled to was a man called Turatsinze, Édouard.  And you told us yesterday that he wasn't well; that he wasn't, as you put it, exactly a stretcher case, but that he could not walk easily, and that he died in circumstances that you didn't tell us about.  So let me just ask you a little about him.  Do you know how old Édouard was?
A.	You mean at the time of the events?
Q.	Yes, at the time of the events.
A.	He was 30 years old.
Q.	Do you know what he was ill with?
A.	I do not know what this person was suffering from.  He had traditional scars made on his head, because he said he had serious headaches.
Q.	And the date of that scarring on his head was I've written down the 12th; is that correct?  Did you say the 12th?  Is that the correct date?
A.	When the scars were made, I wasn't there, but when I saw the state in which the scars were, I thought to myself that they might have been made on the 12th.
Q.	Because, of course, you fled to him later.  But these scars, this is part of traditional medicine; is that right?
A.	That's right.
Q.	And so what happens, the head is cut in the hope that whatever the illness is or caused by inside the head can escape from the head; is that right or wrong?
A.	Yes, that's what they do.  I think that is what people think.  People no longer use that method.
Q.	Anyway, as Édouard was concerned, you tell us he died.  Do you know when he died and the circumstances of his death?
A.	I see that he's dead, because we were together.  Perhaps he may not be dead, because I also saw a document bearing his name.  Maybe he will be found.  They came to fetch him from the camp.  The names of many men who were in the camp were written down, and we were told that they wanted able-bodied men.  So they took young men and full-grown men, and that they were supposed to come to carry the foodstuff that was brought for the refugees.  We waited for them to return, and they never did.  None of these people returned.

We had practically forgotten his name, and now I see his name on a list.  Maybe they're going to find him.  If it is true that he did in fact commit crimes, then he should be brought back and be tried like the others.
Q.	Quite so.  And as a Tutsi survivor yourself who lost family, no one would expect you, or any other decent person, to have any other view than that.  But tell me about this camp.  Where was this camp?
A.	The camp was in Rutare.
Q.	And is that in fact just neighbouring Gikomero?  It is the commune on the other side of the lake?
A.	This is a commune next to Gikomero commune.  We went through Gasabo secteur.  We crossed the lake to get to Rutare commune.
Q.	And Rutare, we know, and we've seen from sketches and we've heard from other witnesses, is the commune opposite Gikomero on the east, on the other side of Lake Muhazi; is that correct?
A.	That's right.
Q.	And the camp that you talk about, was that a camp that had been organised by the Inkotanyi?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And was that a camp that you stayed in, or did you stay in another camp?
A.	I was in this camp.
Q.	And were there Tutsis only in this camp, or were there Tutsis and Hutus?
A.	There were Tutsis and Hutus in the camp.
Q.	And was the camp under military control?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And how long was it that people were at this camp before these men were taken away to get food and never returned?
A.	It was about a month after our arrival at the camp.
Q.	And how many men disappeared from this camp?
A.	I can't say how many there were.  In every secteur there was someone who wrote down the names of those who left, and in our secteur the person who wrote down the names went with those others who went to look for food.
Q.	And did that person come back?
A.	This person did not return.
Q.	The people who disappeared, were they Hutus or Tutsis, or a mixture?
A.	I wouldn't know.
Q.	Are we talking here of, you know, five or ten people, or perhaps 50 people, or 100 people?  Can you give us any approximate idea of how many went away, not to come back?
A.	There were many of them.  I would say there were 400 to 500 people on the road.
Q.	As far as you know, did any of them come back?
A.	I saw only one man who returned, and this is one of my neighbours.
Q.	Did he, or could he tell you what had happened to the others?
A.	He did not say anything to me.
Q.	And the men who were found with their hands tied behind their backs in the banana grove, do you know, are they believed to have been killed by Interhamwe, or by somebody else?
A.	I think they were killed by someone else, because after the 13th, the Interhamwe left when they heard the firing by the soldiers.  They didn't do anything after that.
Q.	Now, you've given your evidence about what you saw with your own eyes, heard with your own ears over those days.  And you've also told us what you've learnt in Gacaca courts held for this area.  And you told us that not only did you not see André Rwamakuba, or ever hear about his playing any part at all in either preparation or perpetration of crimes, but that you've never heard anyone say so in your conversations over 10 or 11 years, in your conversations, in particular, when it was announced on the radio recently that he was accused of crimes in Ndatemwa -- you describe that as a surprise to you and others.  And, in particular, in Gacaca hearings, again, no one has ever pointed a finger at all at a man called André Rwamakuba.  Is that a fair summary of your position in respect of André Rwamakuba?
A.	Yes, that is what I said.
Q.	And as a survivor and a Tutsi, would you do anything in any way to protect somebody who might be a genocidaire?  Would you ever do anything other than tell the truth?
A.	Any person who committed a genocide and against whom there is evidence, and moreover we must add that the genocide was committed in broad daylight -- no one was killed at night in our region, so I think the perpetrators of the genocide should be punished in an exemplary fashion.
Q.	And, finally, you've said: "Well, I know what happened, and my neighbours know what happened."  Has anyone from the Prosecution, to your knowledge, ever bothered to come and ask you or your neighbours about what happened?
A.	I saw no one.  You mean these last days?
Q.	These past years, has anyone been to see you; been to see, as far as you know, your neighbours; been to give --
A.	No, no one from the Office of the Prosecutor came to me and told me that they had any questions they wanted to put to me.
Q.	You suggested that if you went to your area and took any cross-section of 20 people who told the truth about events, they would tell of a similar story to yours; is that right?  Do you believe that?
A.	Yes, I think my statement would be corroborated by any such sample.
Q.	And ********************** the area, if anyone wanted to do that, if they wanted to, they could ask you for your assistance to facilitate it; is that right?
A.	Quite.  But no one ever came to me for my assistance to interview people.  I think it's been a long time now.  Some people came to ask me questions about rape, about people who would have been raped, but no one ever came back to me.
Q.	Now, when you were questioned by my friend a moment ago, reference was made to a list of names and people on that list were described as witnesses.  And you said that you were surprised, for example -- and that happened three or four times -- you were surprised, for example, with one name, because you'd seen him at church two weeks ago, and you didn't know he was a witness, and he didn't know you were a witness; right -- is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.
Q.	Well, look, it might worry you that people might learn who you are as a witness, just as you found out now who that man was.  And we'll try and do something about that.  All right?  But you must understand we're normally very careful, as we can be, about revealing that, but slips happen.

Now, Édouard Turatsinze, the man who was so ill he needed to be helped to walk, the man who had traditional tribal healing scars recently put on his head to help him get well, is the position that he went to the camp you spoke about when you left your commune, the camp in Rutare and, if so, was he among the 400 or 500 men who were marched away by the Inkotanyi?
A.	Yes, I confirm that he was part of those 400 or 500 men who were taken from the refugee camp.
Q.	And I think you told us that his wife and children still live in the commercial centre; is that right?
A.	Yes, that is correct; they live a bit above the small trading centre.
Q.	And I dare say she and her children, and perhaps you, all live in hope of seeing this man again, hence your comment in respect of the list you were shown yesterday, that perhaps he is alive somewhere; is that right?
A.	Yes, we were hoping, but it's because I saw his name on a list that certain doubts and anxieties are raised in my mind.
Q.	Yes.  Well, I'm going to address those doubts to some extent now, I hope.  And I'm afraid that you should have no hope, nor carry any hope, to his wife and his children that he's alive because of that list, because the list itself is headed "Préfecture de Kibungo", and Kibungo is the most eastern-most province, as we know, of Rwanda, bordering on Tanzania.  It relates to a commune called Kayonza, K-A-Y-O-N-Z-A.  It's headed  "Liste des criminels connus".  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
List of known criminals.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It then has 48 names on it in two pages, together with their secteurs, professions of some of them, and there's even a map attached to it showing how far away the communes are, one from the other.  And your evidence, of course, is that you were with that man fleeing from Ndatemwa.  That is your Édouard Turatsinze, the sick man.  You were at the camp with him, and you last saw him being marched away by Inkotanyi.  

Now, over the morning adjournment, Mr. O'Shea, who assists me here, and the Prosecution had a discussion.  And I understand that the link -- the basis upon which this document was produced yesterday and linked with the Édouard you know, was described as being on quote "no basis" unquote.  There is no link, as I understand it, between the two.  It was what in my language we would call a complete red herring.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I wish to object at this point, because what he's saying, after having had a conversation with us, is without basis.  We never said it was without basis, and we are in a position today to say why we used this document.  I therefore object to what he has just said.
MR O'SHEA:
Well, Your Honour, since it's denied, I perhaps point out that I put the specific question:  "Is there any reason, other than the fact that it is the same name?"  And I was told that there's no reason, by both counsel.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I should like us to be quite clear on this point and would tell you what we did indeed answer to Counsel O'Shea, who has a tendency to extraordinarily compress what we said to him.  We told him that we did a search, and we said why, in relation to a name, and it's on an official document that we made this presumption; it's an authentic document, and if we refer to the geographical conclusions we attached to the map and we note that Gikomero, contrary to what is said by the Defence about Kayonza, it is not at the antipodes of Gikomero.  

We did not violate the rules.  We based on identical documents and that is the explanation we gave the Defence.  In relation to the information we had, the information supplied to us, we undertook the search on that name, and the name of Édouard Turatsinze, and that is when we took this document, telling ourselves perhaps after investigation we might admit it as evidence -- tender it as evidence.

We did that in good faith.  There's no problem in that regard, and it is not without grounds, therefore, that we mention this document.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, well, I thank my friend for those comments.  I'm holding here, at page 29, the draft transcript of questions put on this subject yesterday, which I'd like to refer to question by the prosecution to this witness:  "Would you be surprised to know that that person" -- Édouard Turatsinze -- "has been on the list since 1996?  I'm talking about the list of persons who are known to be criminals."  Answer from the witness:  "That would come as a surprise to me."  Question:  "And yet that is what happens, because this person is listed as one of the most well-known criminals in Rwanda."  Answer:  "No, that person's name is not on the list of those who perpetrated genocide.  Up until date we know all the persons who distinguished themselves during the genocide and we don't know about the name of that person up until today."  Question:  "It is possible for us to disclose a document on which that person's name figures as being one of the genocide perpetrators."  Answer:  "I'd really like to see that document, Madam Prosecutor."  

The document is produced and there's then a question by myself as to the origin of the document, and pointing out certain obvious defects in the logic of the relevance of that document, to which Ms. Fall replies:  "Mr. President, we drew that document from Zaire (sic) after having collected the necessary information.  We reserve ourselves the right to proffer further evidence showing that Édouard Turatsinze is the same person in question, and we will do this subsequently." 
MS. FALL:
Could you please read all that follows? 
MR. HOOPER:
Gladly.  Though in asking me to do that, I think my friend misses the point. "We would also like to reserve the right to introduce the document as a Prosecution exhibit, after having brought the necessary information." 
We seek to exhibit the document.  We're not going to wait on the Prosecution to do so.  The fact is here that counsel for the Prosecution, in our submission, has absolutely no justifiable basis for making the assertion she did yesterday.  It's been watered-down now to her stating that it was merely the suggestion of a possibility that the names were coincidentally the same.  That is clearly not what was said yesterday, as the record shows.

But, even so, there has been no gracious withdrawal of this allegation.  It remains what it essentially attempted to be moulded as being, which was an attempt to smear this witness through an association with someone who is a genocidaire.  There's absolutely no evidence that these are the same people.  It would take an extraordinary leap of imagination to connect the two on this evidence.

I pass the document back up to you, Mr. President.  We only had an opportunity to glance at it yesterday.  I pass it up to you and your colleagues -- it's the only copy I have.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a copy.
MR. HOOPER:
Do you have the copy now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.

Now, an improper, inept allegation was made yesterday, and I call on the Prosecution to withdraw it, or substantiate it now.  It is quite improper that this witness should leave the witness box, return to her country, without a reasonable satisfaction in respect of this matter, because everything suggests that Édouard Turatsinze has gone, having been murdered.  It's not the person the Prosecution states he is, and it is inept to suggest it is.  So can we have, please, with respect to my submission, a decent and honourable withdrawal of this allegation? 

If the Prosecution come up trumps in the future with something that contradicts what I've just suggested, then let's have the evidence in its proper form.  But this matter should never have been introduced, and nor would it have been introduced if the Prosecution had abided by very simple rules in producing some slight degree of notice.

I go further and say I don't think I've ever heard such a significant allegation put with absolutely no basis.

MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I merely wish to leave it to the Chamber to assess what has been done since yesterday.  The Defence said there's no question the Prosecution of course would withdraw anything whatsoever and, also, the Defence have provided no evidence that it wasn't the same person -- that it isn't the same person.  I maintain that, contrary to what is said by the Defence, Kayanga is not at the antipodes of Gikomero, but is quite near.  

I've also stated what was the source of the documents, that it is authentic and official sources.  We have revealed the sources, and it is certain that the Defence will also have to prove what was the bad faith on our part.

I should not like -- in relation to what the Defence said that it was the first time he has heard such allegations, we don't wish to argue, but we would, I could tell the Trial Chamber, have things to say on that score.
MR. HOOPER:
Without tempting, I'm afraid, your patience at this time, just very briefly, we asked yesterday for the complete document.  I see at the bottom it's got source "ZyFIND Belgian files".  I don't know where Zaire comes into this at all.  My suspicion is that the research done here was the press of a button on a computer.  That was the extent of the research done here.

But we would like to see the complete document.  We would like to see the document for the préfecture of Gikomero, for example -- commune, I'm sorry 
MR. FRY:
Mr. President, as I stated yesterday, and made it clear -- Counsel Hooper read it when he referred to the transcript -- the time at our disposal was very brief when we undertook that research.  In regard to the name, it is this document that arose, and this is the document we produced.  We have admitted that we will be making further investigations.  We have not had the time to do so yet.  This document was what we obtained, and this is what we disclosed to the Defence.  For the time being, we haven't found any other document.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English interpretation booth wishes to apologise, because, indeed, the "Zaire" has been used on several occasions when Counsel for the Prosecution was referring to "Zy", the complete title of course being "ZyFIND", but it sounded a bit like "Zaire", and this mistake was 'unfortunately' quite frequently made.  Our apologies, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that the Chamber has heard enough from counsel.  Ms. Fall, I think that part of what you are answering is not exactly the point that's being made.  As far as I understand the position, the issue of disclosure is a secondary issue, but which is covered by Rule 66(b), so there is an obligation to disclose material which is necessary for the defence preparation.  So there's a legal obligation to make the disclosure under Rule 66.  I don't assume that there is an objection to doing that.

As far as this witness is concerned, the issue to me has to do with a slightly different rule and, basically, one would not expect counsel to make a statement to a witness -- put a matter to a witness on which there was no justification for it.  

Now, it often happens that that is done for a number of different reasons without there being any issue of bad faith.  And, normally, if counsel falls into the situation where, due to problems in the quality of research or the quality of information which they have had, if they fall into a problem where something is put and it subsequently becomes evident that it was put in error, then it is normal for something to be said to the witness before the witness leaves the stand, to clarify that position.  

So I think that, despite the extravagance of Mr. Hooper's language, I think that's the simple point to which he was referring.  I think it's the normal practice that occurs from time to time in any court.  

However, we don't think it's a matter which the Court should intervene in.  We don't think it's a matter that we should make any orders about; it is a matter which is, in my view, a matter for the discretion of counsel involved.  

With regard to the disclosure, I would expect that the rules of certain obligations will be observed.  So I think we can move on.
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions of the witness.  I have concluded my cross-examination.  

In terms of exhibits, very quickly can we move to those and I'll just mention that we -- we'll do it tomorrow -- but just to -- we seek to move as an exhibit her statement that was served on the Prosecution.  She's been cross-examined on that.  Several times it's been said that she was wholly inconsistent with accounts in her statement, and I think the admission of the statement will prove the contrary, in our submission.

Secondly, the two Ndatemwa photographs that have been shown to her will be exhibited.  The two photographs she marked both in terms of where she was in the ambulance and where she was -- where her house was, the latter under seal obviously, tomorrow.  

The exhibit that's been referred to by the Prosecution, the ZyFIND document, we would move that as an exhibit, too, in order to preserve the context of the comments that were made in that way.

There will be, of course, her identity document, which has already been exhibited.  The list of names that she was shown relating to Ndatemwa, both those produced by the Prosecution and those produced by the Defence.  So all those will be -- I think that's it, unless anyone -- those are all the matters that will be moved as an exhibit tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Would the Prosecutor have any exhibits?
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, the list of witnesses that we submitted to the witness -- the list of persons we submitted to the witness that we should like to tender and, also, but I think the Defence has done so, the witness statement of the 23rd of July, to be entered as evidence under seal -- and placed under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If possible, we would prefer it if you could get together with Defence counsel so we can have the administrative end of it, to clarify it, and we can deal with that tomorrow morning.
MR. HOOPER:
And, finally, if my language was extravagant and if it moved towards excess, I apologise to Ms. Fall and to the Chamber for that.
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.

Madam Witness, you've come to the end of your testimony.  We thank you for coming here and for giving your evidence before the Tribunal.  You are now excused and free to go.  It's now 12:40 and we must take our recess now.  We adjourn until tomorrow morning.
(Witness excused)
