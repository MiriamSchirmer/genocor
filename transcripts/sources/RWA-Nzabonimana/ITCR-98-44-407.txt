P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, the 17th of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

The appearances are the same. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  Before we continue the testimony, the Chamber has an oral decision which it would like to deliver.  And I'll do that now. 

On 15th July 2009, the Chamber declared admissible the statements of Pierre Ntamushobora, Marcel Gatsinzi, Jérôme Bicamumpaka, and Aloys Simba, pursuant to Rule 92 bis, subject to their certification and to the witnesses appearing for cross-examination.  

On 3rd and 9th February 2010, Joseph Nzirorera moved for permission to withdraw the statements of these witnesses.  The Prosecution did not file any response.  Therefore, the Chamber grants Nzirorera's requests.  

Now, Mr. Robinson -- Ms. -- Ms. Diagne, are you ready to continue your examination?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes, Mr. President. 

Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to all parties.
JACQUES-ROGER BOOH-BOOH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

Mr. Booh-Booh, do you still have before you the document I gave you yesterday?  
A.	Yes, I do have the document with me. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Yesterday, before we broke up, the presiding Judge of this Trial Chamber urged us to bear in mind the waiver from the United Nations to Mr. Robinson in respect of your testimony so that we may remain within the confines defined therein.  By way of compliance, I would like to remind you, Mr. Witness, to bear the content of that letter from the United Nations in mind.  

That having been said, let me now proceed with you and address the issue we were dealing with yesterday relating to some excerpts from your book, The Boss of Dallaire Speaks on the events in Rwanda.  At page 119 of that book, you refer to the assassination of bishops and priests and say the following:  That these assassinations were carried out by the RPF.  Please could you expatiate -- could you provide a few details on that point for the benefit of the Trial Chamber. 
A.	Thank you.  Mr. President, I would like to reassure you that I will faithfully uphold the letter or the -- 
	the -- the letter of the -- document from the United Nations to Mr. Robinson relating to my testimony before this Trial Chamber.  I want to reassure you accordingly, therefore.  And if I were, by any chance, to stray -- stray away from the provisions of that letter, that waiver, I would urge you to call me to order.  And I would consider that to be in the natural order of things without any difficulty.  

Now, as to the question from Defence counsel, madam, I would like to refer you to documents with, should I say, greater authority which have dealt with these issues or with that question, including newspapers as well, because those are the only sources of information that I used.  I have no other clarification to furnish beyond those sources which I have mentioned. 
Q.	I thank you.  And I take it that if you mentioned this information in your book it is because you thought that the sources of your information were reliable.  
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, I have a question, a personal question for you, particularly in your capacity as the former special representative of the United Nations in Rwanda at the time of the events.  In your book you state that the RPF requested the departure of the RPF from other UNAMIR -- from Rwanda in order to focus on the war.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes.  I do.  And I do so based on personal analysis of my observations of the behaviour that obtained at the time.  Although I did not receive a written document from the RPF ordering UNAMIR to depart, I, however, drew a number of conclusions from my observations and wrote what is contained in my book.  
You may want to know that at some point the RPF practically declared that I was a persona non grata because it had come to the conclusions that I had taken sides in the conflict.  The RPF even accused me of having delayed the setting up of the institutions and of being a personal friend of the president of the republic at the time.  

All those accusations, among others, led me to submit my resignation to the president of -- or the Secretary General of the United Nations on the 6th of June 1994.  Somewhat acting before they 
could -- I believe that my departure from Rwanda may have somehow dealt with the RPF's impatience to boot out of Kigali all those whom they were not pleased with. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  You also state in your book -- you talked about the -- the activities or blunders of the RTLM and Radio Muhabura which, in fact --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if -- if counsel would be asked to repeat her question, it would assist the interpreters.  Thank you, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, the interpreters request that you repeat the question.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will do so. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, I was asking you to speak to the point which you mention in your book about the blunders of the RTLM and the fact that on the other side there were Tutsi extremists who had Radio Muhabura, which was an RPF radio station.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	I can confirm that. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Booh-Booh, can you tell this Trial Chamber how it is that you came to the conclusion that Radio Muhabura, like RTLM, was an RPF radio station, an extremist radio station which did not stand for national reconciliation.  On what grounds do you come to that conclusion, Mr. Booh-Booh? 
A.	Madam, I would like to start by saying that I cannot put those two radio stations on the same footing.  RTLM took very extreme positions against UNAMIR.  Right from the beginning of UNAMIR activity, it had called for our departure.  

RTLM was a radio station which has been scrutinised by this Court.  And it stood for violence.  

And so I do not believe that my impression on this point could be any better than talking about the disappointment I felt when I met one of the journalists from that radio station, particularly in their editorial line or the manner in which they processed information.  I was further disappointed, particularly because he was trained in one of the major journalism schools in Africa, which is found in Cameroon.  So I asked him whether all what he was narrating over the radio station he had learned from the school in Yaoundé.  He said no, whether he felt that he was a good journalist.  So on that score, that radio station stands in a class all by its own.  

Now, as for Radio Muhabura, Radio Muhabura was a war radio station.  And we need to understand that.  Because the -- the language used was not always language that would be soft on UNAMIR nor on the other side, namely, all those who belonged to the MRND and what have you.  So Radio Muhabura, at the time of the crisis, distinguished itself in the rather strong language it used at that time.  

And it is not for me here to repeat all what has been said about that radio station.  I can simply refer you to the transcripts of the Belgian parliamentary commission on Radio Muhabura.  My concern, therefore, and my thoughts in that matter were clearly recorded by a number of Belgian authorities.  And there were other witnesses as well who testified on that radio station.  

So these two radio stations could have been referred to as war of -- or -- or combat radio stations.  One of them being more violent and virulent in its language while the other was more tactful.  In any event, those who have analysed the issues do recognise that whatever was broadcast over Radio Muhabura needed to be scrutinised carefully.  

Now, let me tell you too that we had a unit at UNAMIR which listened to broadcasts from all radio stations in the region, particularly state radio stations in Rwanda at the time.  I also had opportunity to read the transcripts of some of the broadcasts over those radio stations.  

Now, because you are interested in this matter, I would like to encourage you to contact the services of the United Nations, which I believe hold all the documents, all UNAMIR documents, in their archives. 
Q.	Thank you for furnishing all those details.  And by the way, I note from your book that you mention a captain of the Ghanaian contingent who was assigned to record the programmes broadcast over Radio Muhabura.  I am raising this because we also had available here recordings of RTLM.  But if -- within the framework of our defence work, we never had access to the recordings of the -- of Radio Muhabura.  

And that's why I take advantage of your presence here, you, personal representative -- special representative of the SG, to obtain some details from you in the interest of this Trial Chamber.  You understand what I mean?  
A.	Yes, I do.  I understand what you are -- I get -- I get your drift.  But I -- I'm afraid I may not be in a position to provide further details or information other than that which you've been able to elicit from my book and that which I just shared a few minutes ago.  I have given you the right address from which you would get satisfactory information on that point. 
Q.	Well, thank you very much for that, Mr. Booh-Booh.  To close, Mr. Booh-Booh, I would like to ask you whether you had the opportunity or even the pleasure of meeting my client, Édouard Karemera.
A.	Yes.  The name -- the name means something to me.  But really, I never had the opportunity of working with him.  And let me confess that if he were in this hall I would not be able to recognise him. 
Q.	Well, I am asking the question because he was a high-ranking official in Rwanda at the time when you were there.  And since I noticed that you -- you met personalities during your term, I just wanted to ask the question whether, during the time when you were there, you ever had the opportunity of meeting him.  
A.	I really cannot recall.  I met very many high-ranking officials.  But, again, this was generally those who were in contact with me for the purposes of putting in place the institutions that had been provided for by the Arusha agreements.  I do not know whether he was part of this delegation or these officials.  But the leaders who were in charge of that file are people that I met several times on a frequent basis, and 
	I -- I can recall those leaders very well.  

But the name may mean something to me, but I -- I doubt that he was directly involved in that which was my duty.  I must also add that when I arrived I paid courtesy visits to several ministers in office.  But I do not think on that occasion I met him. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Booh-Booh, for having answered -- accepted to answer my questions.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I am done.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Diagne. 

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, thank you very much.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, Frédéric Weyl is my name, the lawyer of the French -- Paris Bar.  I am one of the lawyers of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, counsel for his defence.  

I would like to put a few questions to you.  And my wish is that you answer these questions with the candour which has characterised all your responses since yesterday morning.  And so far as I am concerned, what I retained from the letter authorising you to come here, or the waiver enabling you to testify before this Trial Chamber, is just one word, freely -- freely -- librement in French.  And it is my desire that you testify on what you witnessed in Rwanda in 1994 with that freedom that is granted to you.  Do so freely.  
Having made that clarification and to take things up immediately from where my colleague, my 
learned colleague, just stopped -- I think about the -- virtually the same questions.  

I am counsel for the defence of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I would like to ask:  Did you have the opportunity of meeting frequently during your stay in Kigali?  
A.	We had sustained working relationships with -- what -- whom we called "Mathieu".  Well, I -- I -- that's how we called him.  

I realise that you pronounce his name very, very well, but for us we had the habit of addressing him -- referring to him -- referring to in -- Rwandan interlocutors by their first names.  We had so many difficulties pronouncing their surnames.  

So as a matter of fact, for purposes of work, I met Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I think that is it.  
Q.	That is it.  My advantage of -- over you is that I have been with him for virtually 12 years, working with him, and so I've had time -- enough time to practice pronouncing his name.  

Now, during your discussions, what was the dominant trait of character which you noticed?  Was he a man who was rather carried away?  Temperamental?  Was it -- was he sober?  What type of man was he?  What do you remember?  
A.	Mathieu was quite sober.  He would not speak very much, a man of few words.  He would participate normally in discussions.  Quite reserved, maybe because, in his capacity as president of the main political party at the time, he made it a point of duty to speak with a sense of responsibility and making sure that he did not just say anything.  That's the impression I had of him.  He was not talkative. 
Q.	During -- can you say whether, during any of your conversations, you felt that his behaviour was maybe dictated by ethnic considerations? 
A.	No.  I don't recall that.  I do not recall ever having noticed that during any of our conversations that he attacked any ethnic group.  But, again, I am -- I say he was the head of a political party.  And maybe beyond the rooms of our discussions, our conversations, he may -- maybe act differently.  He could speak some other language.  That is possible. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, very briefly, I would like to raise a few issues concerning the swearing-in ceremony of the 5th of January 1994.  To the best of your knowledge, did the RPF appoint its own members of parliament? 
A.	I did not see the list of members of parliament of any political party.  But from what I gathered, the prime minister at the time communicated the lists of MPs to the president of the republic, and whether the list of the RPF MPs was in that list, I cannot say.  

But lists of MPs, members of parliament, had been submitted to the president of the republic, who, for his own part, rejected most of these lists, particularly concerning the Parti libéral -- I dwelled on this abundantly yesterday -- and the MDR.  And so I got information that, in effect, lists had been submitted to the president and that the president had expressed disapproval regarding some candidates from the two parties that I just mentioned, in particular.  

In addition, I also met the president of the court.  Now, how do you call it again?  The supreme court.  Yeah.  Mr. Kavawa (sic) -- well -- well, the president of the supreme court at the time.  I met him.  And he told me, briefly, that he approved the list that had been submitted by Madam Agathe, who was prime minister at the time.  

That is all I can say concerning the issue of RPF lists.  I did not see the RPF lists, just as I did not see the lists from other parties.  But, of course, there were lists.  From the reports I got, there were lists.  Lists existed. 
Q.	Maybe -- and very specifically now -- my question is very, very precise.  Would you know if the representatives of the RPF and eventually the MPs designated by the RPF -- do you know whether they attended the ceremony of the 5th of January 1994?  Did they attend, or did they not attend? 
A.	I really cannot recall any longer about what happened during that part of the ceremony.  But I do know that there were many representatives of political parties, particularly those who were (inaudible) to become either MPs or mem -- or ministers.  That is what I can tell you.  

I also must say that I was informed at the time that some members of parliament who were not in the good books of grace with the party in power had had some difficulties having access at the entrance of the CND, that is, the Rwandan parliament building at the time.  I was told that they had difficulties to have access.  I was told that these candidates, members of parliament and ministers of RPF -- I do not know whether they were part of this.  But these are details which I did not have.  But I received information globally which -- which reflected some of these trends.  
Q.	Yes.  But, Mr. Booh-Booh, you certainly recall that the RPF was within the CND and that, so far as it was concerned, there was no difficulty getting in there because it already was there.  You agree on that? 
A.	No.  I do not agree with you on that.  I did not tell you that the RPF candidates were not -- could not get into the hall or that they were in the hall or whether they were in the hall.  That did not really strike my attention.  But apparently, there were candidates, particularly some on the list of Parti libéral and some candidates on the MDR list, who apparently found it very difficult getting access into the national assembly, the palace where the ceremony was taking -- taking place.  I can tell you that globally, but if you ask for names from me, I am sorry I am unable to describe events in detail. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would now like to mention some issues concerning the problem of the arms cache.  Were you presented any sort of proof regarding the existence of these arms cache personally? 
A.	Well, personally, I would say no. 
Q.	Do you think that the existence of this -- were arms caches -- were they in the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can you ask counsel to take over his question and go slowly, please. 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Excuse me, please.  The interpreters into English would like the question repeated so that they could interpret it.  

Mr. Weyl, you are requested to speak a bit more slowly. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, maybe I was going a bit too fast because of some delays which we encountered much earlier on.  I'm sorry.  I will take it over. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, do you think that research on the -- the existence of any arms caches in Kigali had led to investigations on any eventual arms caches of the RPF and eventually on any infiltration by the RPF? 
A.	Well, I am not in a capacity to answer that question.  In the sense that the problem of arms cache or arms posse (sic), as I said yesterday, was -- is a recurrent problem in that country, because there was much talk about it even before the signing of the Arusha agreements.  So that problem was not a secret to who -- anybody.  And, of course, there may have been some who knew how to hide their weapons very well.  And maybe others who knew the art of hiding weapons less.  It's possible.  

But this problem was raised by both parties, both parties which went to New York on the 5th of October 1993 to present their requests for assistance before the Security Council.  That problem was raised.  It was mentioned.  And both parties, by the way, expected and wanted the United Nations to set, among the objectives assigned to UNAMIR, the duty of investigating and confiscating weapons that were illegally kept in possession, illegally held.  And so that problem always arose.  

Now, as to the issue of whether the investigations or the research regarding these arms caches created any other problems, that I cannot say.  Nevertheless, in Kigali, which was supposed to be a town devoid of any weapons, UNAMIR had the specific responsibility of ensuring that it was a city devoid of any weapons.  

And maybe I must add that, after more than a thousand patrol trips carried out by UNAMIR forces, we succeeded in finding nine pistols, which should give you an idea about the magnitude of the idea of this notion of arms cache, which, therefore, means that the research that we carried out did not lead to much, given that out of about 1,200 (sic) patrol missions, those that were fixed, those that were ambulant, those that were itinerant -- well, there's a report on this.  Of all the trips, all the rounds that were done, only nine pistols, nine in all, were found.
(Pages 1 to 9 by Tanya West)
































1000H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you.  But were you informed of any suspicions of the hiding of weapons in convoys that were bringing firewood to the RPF there at the CND?
A.	There was general suspicion looming that the RPF had succeeded in bringing in weapons into Kigali during the period when negotiations were ongoing, in order to create the transition government.  Those suspicions were there.  

Several times the president of the republic had to wake me up very late in the night to tell me that the RPF is bringing in truckloads of weapons into Rwanda.  And during these calls he would give me the matriculation numbers of these vehicles.  He would give me the colours of these vehicles.  So he was very, very well informed.  

Maybe he personally did not have the resources to do such work, but, as you know, he had friends.  He had friends who had the wherewithal or the necessary resources that could elicit such information for him.  And so there is no doubt that suspicion was there, and the president himself, at least twice, drew my attention to that problem.  

And when I asked General Dallaire, who was in charge of the troops, he told me, no, he had carried out an investigation and that nothing was found.  

And at least twice, again -- the president drew my attention, late in the night, again, to the fact that RPF elements -- RPF troops had left the compound, the venue where they were located.  That was the CND.  And on that occasion, after an investigation, General Dallaire told me there was no such thing and that he had contacted the Tunisian battalion which was in charge of security at the compound where the RPF troops were.  

Now, it is in the Belgian report, the report of the Belgian senators, that I read a statement by Colonel Marchal, who was in charge of the Belgian contingent.  And from that statement in -- or in that statement the colonel stated that each time the RPF was returning from Mulindi with firewood it took advantage of that opportunity to stealthily bring in weapons into Kigali.  

That appears in the report that was done in Belgium.  But at the time I was in Kigali I was not aware of these details.  
Q. Thank you.   Very precisely, this leads me to another question which I intended to ask you, because Colonel Marchal personally noted the fact that there were openings in the walls of the CND that made it easy for people to go out without any control, to the extent that they were thinking about increasing supervision and control after the 7th of April.  

Did General Dallaire not mention this to you?  
A.	No.  No report was sent to me on that issue.  And I must say that there really was a break in the operations, the way things functioned within UNAMIR.  This is not the forum to dwell on that dysfunctioning, but those who have taken the pains to read my book certainly can -- certainly do know that the military components of UNAMIR witnessed great problems of dif -- dif -- issues of things not going on well.  

There was a great research mission to investigate weapons but we found out only nine pistols.  For a city that was presented as a city that was replete with arms caches and weapons, abundant rifled weapons, only nine were found.  

That should give you an idea of the control that UNAMIR had there in Kigali.  And there in Kigali UNAMIR had specific duties, specific responsibility, to make Kigali a city devoid of any weapons.  But nothing was done.  

And yesterday I mentioned the fact that when personalities, top-ranking officials, are killed, persons who were under our security, Belgian soldiers are killed without any reaction from the UNAMIR troops, that should tell you the state in which these troops were, to be able to carry -- shoulder the responsibilities that were theirs.  I believe that by reading my book you'd realise that there were many shortcomings within those forces. 

And I must say that, regarding the military component, UNAMIR was an underdeveloped mission.  This has been pointed out by the committee of independent persons, which was chaired by the former 
prime minister of Sweden, Mr. Carlsson.  He acknowledged that it was a mission that did not have the necessary resources to do its work and a mission which had -- at the height of its activities, it was supposed to have 2,528 or 30 soldiers.  2,530 soldiers, thereabouts.  

Now, when you look at UN missions today, you count 10,000 men, 10,000 strong.  We already had that in Sierra Leone at the time with 20,000 strong.  
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, there is a problem, there is a sound problem apparently.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I -- I wanted to get back to a question to Mr. Booh-Booh.

BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	But, please, Mr. Booh-Booh, can you answer me very briefly, very directly.  

Yesterday when you mentioned the Jean-Pierre Turatsinze affair, I had the feeling -- or what I understood was that in your mind you did not exclude the fact that it was a manipulation.  

Can you tell me exactly whether, after the night, the step back, do you think that that affair was a set-up?  
A.	I'm not the only one who believes that, who had an opinion on that.  I believe that profound investigations and a doctorate thesis took upon such aspects on the functioning of UNAMIR and have studied it. 

But I think that -- to answer you directly, I think that there was a manipulation on that issue.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Now I have a very, very specific question for you on the setting up of the interim government:  In your discussion with Colonel Bagosora in the hours following the attack, was that at your behest, or was it at the request of New York?  
A.	The initiative was that of General Dallaire.  He is the one who was in contact with those soldiers.  He is the one from whom audience was sought.  

And in relation to the discussion with the soldiers, at some point he felt that the issue was not within the purview of his competence.  And it is at that juncture that he turned to me and asked me to receive that delegation of soldiers.  

That is the chronology of the events as they unfolded.  New York was not contacted and did not have to authorise or deny authorisation of that meeting.
Q.	According to you, was it legitimate on the 7th of April to attempt to set up an interim government?  
A.	You must understand that these were Rwandan problems for the Rwandans.  If the government provided for by the Arusha Peace Accords had been set up before those events, I believe that the country would have gone through a lesser turbulence, because the public services would have experienced the continuity that obtains in all countries.  But the fact is that there was no government at that level.  

And then came the events of the night of the 6th to the 7th of April, at which time it appeared that the military were in control.  So it was for them to determine whether they wanted to have a government or not and whether it was necessary to contact the other entities which were party to the Arusha Peace Accords.  

UNAMIR could have provided some assistance if any requests were made in that respect.  But it was not for UNAMIR to determine whether a government should be set up or not in the night of the 
6th to the 7th of April (sic).
Q.	But would you know whether the solution that was adopted for the setting up of the interim government was subsequently validated by the United Nations?  
A.	Validated by some legal instrument?  I don't think so.  However, the United Nations traditionally deal with the government in place.  And, therefore, I would not have had any difficulty contacting those authorities.  

However, things happened differently, and I was either here in Arusha for the negotiations, or 
General Dallaire did not provide me an escort to enable me drive across the town during that time of war. So I did not have the opportunity to meet the provisional or, should I say, interim government.  I was not able to meet the leaders of that government.  But I think the matter was not whether the United Nations recognised or did not recognise it.  

Mr. Riza, one of the advisers to the Secretary General, came to Kigali and was able to meet the leaders of that government, which at the time was already in Gitarama.  He was able to meet them on behalf of the Secretary General.  

So I think that this is not an issue for the United Nations, because the UN, generally speaking, deals with the authorities in power at any particular time.  
Q.	In your capacity as the special representative of the Secretary General, did you become aware of a cable from the Secretary General to Mr. Dallaire which expressed the legal opinion of Ralph Zacklin, confirming the fact that the interim government was the state authority in Rwanda at the time? 
A.	No.  I did not become aware of such a fax or telex or message.  I was not aware of that document.  

But I have provided you, in a previous answer, the summary of the general principles that apply, including the fact that there was no prohibition from the Secretary General upon us from meeting those officials.  I even said that a special envoy from New York was able to meet that government.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, for the record and for better understanding, I am referring to a cable, D. NZ425.  
Exhibit D. NZ425 from Mr. Annan, 22nd -- 25th of May 1994, to Mr. Dallaire, for Riza, UNAMIR, Kigali.  

I take good note that the special representative of the Secretary General was not aware of that cable.
THE WITNESS:  
What I would like to say is that during that time I was expected to travel to Nairobi.  You see, I left Kigali, once and for all, on the 14th of May.  So maybe the cable came in to Kigali and was dispatched to Nairobi, where I was at the time.  

But there was a host of correspondences from New York which were dealt with directly by 
General Dallaire, who was on the spot, without necessarily forwarding the correspondences to Nairobi, where I was present with a good part of our political, administrative and financial staff.  Only the military staff remained in Kigali at that time under the leadership of General Dallaire. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, when I put these questions to you, it is because you must remember that the issue of the legitimacy of the government in conducting negotiations was at the very heart of the discussions with the RPF in connection to the ceasefire; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say then that the RPF refused any discussions with the government? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  But that did not have any bearing on whether or not the interim government was recognised by UNAMIR.  Those are two distinct issues.  

And I must state that, for some time, the position of the RPF was ambiguous.  The RPF made a distinction between the patriotic officials, with whom the RPF had normal relations, and then there were other officials whom the RPF did not recognise.  And all they called for was for such officials to be arrested and tried by the courts.  

That position may have evolved over time.  But, initially, the RPF considered that there were 
two categories of interlocutors, namely, the good soldiers who were patriotic soldiers and with whom the RPF could work, and then there were the criminals, rebellious soldiers, whom the RPF simply did not recognise and would not engage in any discussions with. 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. Issa, please place document number 3 before Mr. Booh-Booh.  That is the third document in my bundle.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you remember sending this cable, Mr. Booh-Booh? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Please turn with me to the second sheet, paragraph number 2.  

Wouldn't it be correct to say that in this document you make mention of the RPF's refusal to enter negotiations on a ceasefire with representatives of the interim government and that the RPF also said that the Gitarama government was illegal? 
A.	Yes.  That was the position of the RPF.  I have no particular comment to make on that score.  The position of the RPF was that the Gitarama government was illegal.  
I -- I've also told you that they refused to meet the representatives of the government, as such, because within the government there were some officials, whose names I will not mention here, who were considered by the RPF to be patriotic soldiers.  And the RPF was only prepared to discuss or have negotiations with those soldiers only.  I think that some of those patriotic soldiers later on joined the RPF government. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, at the very end of paragraph 2, it is stated that -- that the RPF said that, by insisting now for a ceasefire, the international community is, in fact, siding with the Rwandan armed forces, or the FAR, and, according to the RPF, it is the R -- the Rwandan armed forces which started the war and which are now losing it.  

Now, do you feel that the RPF dismissed you?  Not so much as it dismissed the international community, because it was opposed to its attempt to take power in Kigali.  Is that the case?  
A.	Well, I am not a military strategist, but when one enjoys favour and military advantage under such circumstances, one is not inclined to seek a ceasefire.  And that was clearly the point.  

When I brought together the two parties on the 15th of April -- repeat, 15th of April -- the position of the RPF was exactly the same, namely, that it was not entirely opposed to a ceasefire, but that it was not ready to talk about a ceasefire at that time.  

The idea was that a list of preconditions was going to be presented; and, therefore, we were still very far away from any proper ceasefire negotiations, because we had to deal with preconditions and conditionalities.  

I know we don't have time to go into all the details, but I could mention that all the generals had to be arrested, the Presidential Guard has to be dismantled, all militia had to be arrested, and that it would only be after doing all those things that they would entertain the possibility of negotiating a ceasefire.  That was the situation.  

And yet, on the other side, government was in difficulty, at least militarily speaking, and the government was ready at any time to proceed with signing the ceasefire agreement.  This is the answer I can offer.
Q.	Mr. Witness, I thank you.

1030H 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness.  I simply would like to produce into evidence this document, subject to whatever Mr. Webster may say as to whether this document is in evidence or not.  So my application is for the fax of 4 May 1994 to be produced into evidence under 
number D. NZ93 (sic).  That will be all, Mr. President. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, during my examination of Witness Booh-Booh, I used a document which I would like to produce into evidence as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you have not responded to Mr. Weyl's application. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I only got the document this morning.  So I haven't had a chance to go through the -- the exhibit list to see if it's been admitted or not.  I don't think it has because it wouldn't have been -- I don't think it's a Prosecution exhibit.  So I can double-check and report back at lunchtime.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do we admit it now or do we defer it until you've had a chance to -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, we -- we can defer it, because there'll be no further, I assume, Ngirumpatse exhibits.  So we can give it a number at the conclusion of the witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Well, that was the same idea I had, mindful of how vigilant Mr. Webster is and how he's able to tell whether a document is already in evidence or not when it is being produced.  So it would appear to me that this document has not yet been produced.  And I would, therefore, move that it be admitted as 
D. NZ -- D. NZ93 (sic).  And if there were to be any difficulties -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. NZ? 
MR. WEYL:
No, no.  D. NG. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

And with regard to Mr. Karemera's application, we, apparently, have to defer to your (inaudible) on this issue. 

MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think that this, you know, this portion of the book is in evidence.  My suggestion is that we wait until the conclusion of the witness's examination so it's without prejudice to Madam Dior Diagne.  
We have no opposition to admitting the exhibit, but I think, as things progress, we'll see that we may not need to -- to admit it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I would like to confirm that this has not at all been produced, and I would insist that it be produced under the number that Mr. Issa would give us, by way of reminder.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We -- we don't see any harm in waiting until the end of the witness's testimony to admit all these documents.  The application remains -- remains, and we'll address it in due course.  

The Prosecutor has indicated he has no objection to admission.  So it will be admitted, but we think we'll just wait to see just for confirmation.  

Mr. Witness, the time has come now for you to respond to questions from the Prosecutor -- I'm sorry. Are you hearing me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you.  Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 10:30.  We take our mid-morning recess now, and upon resumption, the Prosecutor will commence his examination of you.  
(Court recessed from 1035H to 1110H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster, are you ready? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, yes, Your Honours.  Good morning to everyone.  I was informed by Mr. Hometowu a few moments ago that the witness was 4 hours and 55 minutes in his direct examination.  I expect to be considerably less -- to spend less time with the witness.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	But, Mr. Booh-Booh, I wish you a good morning, and I'd like to suggest to you that you could be helpful to me in my endeavour to take much less time with you in cross-examination than the Defence took with you in your direct examination.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	When I suggest to you that you could be helpful, what I mean is that I'll ask you very specific questions, and I'll try to make them as clear as possible, and if you would assist by just giving direct answers to the questions I ask you, we'll move along much more quickly and more efficiently.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'd also indicate for the record that I've distributed a bundle of exhibits.  Many of these have already been admitted.  Usually I hand up an exhibit to Mr. Issa and ask him to show it to the Chamber and to the other parties before it's placed before the witness, but today I've spoken to Mr. Robinson, and I've also shown my packet of exhibits to Mr. Hometowu, and I would offer to the Court that I have highlighted the aspects of the exhibits that would interest me -- and would make it easier for the witness to find it -- and it's just highlighting in yellow in the document itself.  

And rather than have Mr. Issa take it to the Trial Chamber and over to the other side of the courtroom every time we use it, I'm simply going to ask him to put it directly in front of the witness.  And I think Mr. Robinson trusts me at this point not to include any funny document in the materials that I'm passing up to the witness.  

So with the Court's permission, that's the procedure I'll adopt.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So back to you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  In 19 -- in 2005, you wrote a book, Le Patron de Dallaire Parle, "Dallaire's Boss Speaks", which for the most part is your analysis and history of the UNAMIR peacekeeping mission in Rwanda.  And my understanding is that in that book, you attempted to set the record straight by giving the world your side of the story, and I assume that's because you had come under quite a bit of criticism by other parties to the mission and historians and human rights activists and so on and so forth.  But I'm suggesting to you that in writing your book, you had a full and unimpeded opportunity to tell the world your side of the story.  

And I'll give you my assurance at this point that the Prosecutor is willing to have your book -- or the more significant parts of it simply admitted in evidence.  So -- though you may have a concern to give us all of the background information and to really put your story across in your testimony, that may not be necessary because your book itself will become part of the trial record and your side of the story will become a record of these proceedings.  

So -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there an English version of the book? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Significant portions of it have been translated.  In fact, the -- the portions that would interest us were translated because they were admitted in evidence in the Bagosora trial and they've been distributed in my bundle.  

What we have is pages 69 to 161 in the French.  And within those passages, at least 50 or 60 pages have been translated into English.  Not the entire, you know, contents from page 69 to page 161, but we can certainly request their translation.  

But the book itself, everything that has to do with the substance of this witness's testimony is in the bundle, and it can be offered for admission in evidence, and I don't think that I would meet much opposition -- or any opposition from the Defence in that regard.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So I say that as an introduction to my cross-examination, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Taking note that much of what you would like to tell us is in the document that we can enter into evidence, which is a document that you wrote, I would ask you, once again, simply to answer my questions directly so that we can move through my cross-examination efficiently.  Are we agreed? 
A.	Yes, I agree.  
Q.	Now, your book is your work.  It was not ghost-written.  Can we -- can I get that assurance from you as well? 
A.	I hope so.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, you had never travelled to Rwanda prior to the 23rd of November 1993; 
	is that correct? 
A.	I had travelled to Rwanda before 1993.  
Q.	How many trips did you make before 1993? 
A.	One.  One official mission.  
Q.	You told us in direct exam that you had met Casimir Bizimungu before.  I understood that your meeting with him was in Cameroon.  Did you meet with him in Cameroon or in Rwanda? 
A.	I met him in Cameroon.  I believe it was during the conferences of the OAU, in Addis Ababa as well, and then I also met him when I went to Rwanda.  
Q.	And do you recall the names of any of the other Rwandan politicians or state persons that you had interacted with before arriving as the head of the mission -- the UNAMIR mission on the 23rd of November 1993? 
A.	I received a Rwandan minister in Cameroon who had come to meet the president of the republic.  Unfortunately, I do not know -- or I do not remember his name, and I'm sorry for that.  But he must have been the minister for national education or higher education at the time.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  And then after the UNAMIR mission was completed or, at least, your participation in that meeting -- in that mission, there were a number of members of the interim government and political and military figures associated with that interim government of Rwanda that took up residence in Cameroon.  I'm talking about after the RPF military victory in July of 1994.  

Did you have any interaction with any of the former members of the interim government while they were present in Cameroon after 1994?  Here I'm talking about Bagosora, Semanza, Ntagerura, Nzirorera, Nahimana.  I think there are at least 15 or 20 Rwandan state persons, all of whom -- or most of whom have been indicted by this Tribunal that were living in Cameroon right after 1994.  Did you interact with them at that time? 
A.	I met some of them, particularly the names that you've mentioned -- the names of those personalities you mentioned, I met -- I met some of them.
Q.	Tell us the names of the ones that you remember having met and what the nature of your interaction with them was. 
A.	I did not meet Bagosora, but I met Nzirorera.  And there was also another one whom I did not meet in Rwanda often, but I was told that he was a former general manager of the radio station.  I'd not known him previously, but he is said to have been the general manager of Radio Rwanda, the national broadcaster.  There is a third person whom I met, and I do not remember his name, but I must have met three or four personalities in Cameroon whom I knew in Rwanda.  

But the name that quickly comes to mind is that of Mr. Nzirorera.  He was there with his wife.  
Q.	The media personality that you met may have met Ferdinand Nahimana.  Now that I say his name, does that refresh your recollection? 
A.	Yes, yes, that is it.  Yes, yes, that does help, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	So of the 15 or so persons that I've mentioned to you that have been indicted by the Tribunal, at least three of them you met yourself or you interacted with in some way in Cameroon. 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you assist them to get settled in Cameroon? 
A.	No, they did not ask anything of me.  
Q.	So it was just happenstance that they all ended up in Cameroon, and you simply ran into them there.  
Is that what I should understand? 
A.	I met them by happenstance, so to speak.  Now, whether we're talking about their stay in Cameroon or the time they left Cameroon, all of that did not in any way depend on me.  
Q.	And if you could just briefly -- very briefly describe the nature of your interaction with them.  Were these social visits, or was there a diplomatic purpose to your meeting with the three individuals that you mentioned, Nzirorera, Nahimana -- and I don't recall the third name, but you gave us a third name before.  
A.	I do not remember the third name either.  No, I don't.  However, we met because it was normal for me to receive people, particularly, Mr. Nzirorera, who had received me in Rwanda.  Let me state that we met only once.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you very much.  Now, you also mentioned in your direct examination that you and President Habyarimana were age mates and that you were able to develop a better rapport than the president could have hoped to achieve with Dallaire; right? 
A.	We were not age mates.  He was one year older than myself.  He was born in 1937, and I was born in 1938.  Yes, he didn't have good relations with General Dallaire.  
Q.	But you left us with the impression that because you and Juvénal Habyarimana were around the same age that you could speak to him in a manner that was more forthright and you could develop a good rapport.  And what I'm trying to elicit from you is that Dallaire may not have had that same relation because he was considerably younger than yourself and younger than Habyarimana.  Right? 
A.	I cannot make such an assertion.  They met in Rwanda, even before I got to Rwanda.  
Q.	What about your relationship with Paul Kagame who was a considerably younger man, probably around the same age as Dallaire?  
A.	My rapport with President Kagame was not extensive.  I didn't meet him often, but whenever we met, our discussions were conducted normally.  
Q.	Normally and in English, a language with which you were not completely comfortable.  Is that fair to say? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, for the benefit of the French booth, if the Prosecutor would kindly repeat his question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Your interactions with Paul Kagame were not very numerous and they were conducted in English, a language with which you were not completely comfortable.  Is that a fair statement? 
A.	Well, that is correct, but there was always an interpreter with us.  
Q.	So if you and Juvénal Habyarimana had a good relationship, because you were around the same age and both francophone, and Dallaire and Kagame had a good relationship, because they were around the same age and they both spoke English, there's nothing necessarily prejudicial about that.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Nothing prejudicial, yes, but Dallaire and Kagame were both soldiers as well.  
Q.	And I'm presuming that both you and Dallaire were professionals.  So even though you may have had a professional affinity with Habyarimana and Dallaire may have had a personal affinity with Paul Kagame, your professionalism should've permitted both of you to have a very balanced and impartial relationship with either of those two individuals.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	Yes, agreed.  
Q.	Now, you told us that as far as you're concerned, the mission -- the peacekeeping mission never really got underway because the broad-based transitional government had never been installed; that, according to you, your real work would begin after the implementation of -- or the installation of the broad-based transitional government.  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	But that didn't stop you from taking your responsibilities very seriously during the period leading up to the implementation of the broad-based transitional government; right? 
A.	Yes, definitely.  
Q.	Can we agree also that neither you nor Dallaire had any sophisticated understanding of 
Rwandan politics before arriving in Kigali?  
A.	I knew very well Rwandan politics before arriving in Kigali, but as far as Dallaire's concerned, I cannot say.  
Q.	So in your view, at least you were adequately prepared for the tasks at hand in managing the mission as the head of mission? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, even though Rwanda may have a very sophisticated political culture, can we both agree that the issues and the stakes that provoked the political crisis in 1993 were really very simple, and what I would suggest to you -- and you can tell me if you disagree -- is that competing elites wanted to control the state.  The state was the source of all power and enrichment, and the state had to be divided up between the monolithic party, the MRND that had controlled it for the last 20 years, and the rebel expats from Uganda, who wanted to return home and have a piece of the state.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	Your Honours, it is correct.  
Q.	And between the MRND on the one end of the spectrum and the RPF on the other end of the spectrum, there were these opposition political parties, and they too wanted a piece of the state.  Isn't that what the scenario was back in late 1993 after the Arusha Accords had been signed? 
A.	That was the scenario.  
Q.	And can we also agree that there was political maneuvering with the MRND and Habyarimana on the one side and the RPF on the other side because both wanted to have a majority coalition in the transitional national assembly, which was the source of state power as it was being reconfigured in Rwanda.  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Both the MRND on one end and the RPF on the other end were jockeying for alliances with the MDR, the PL, the PSD, the PCD? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...the state.  They wanted to have a coalition that they could use to run the state in their own interests? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And you agree with me that Habyarimana, in particular, and the MRND feared allowing the RPF to 
have -- or to attain that majority coalition because they thought the majority coalition in the transitional national assembly would be able to bring Habyarimana before the constitutional court and charge him with past human rights abuses.  Isn't that true? 
A.	That was the impression I had.  
Q.	And the really sensitive issue was the PL party.  Because in the PL party, which is a party that welcomed both Hutu and Tutsi, political developments were such that you had a Lando wing, because Lando was one of the leaders of the PL, and a Mugenzi wing, because Mugenzi was also one of the leaders of the PL, and the party was splitting between them.  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And if the deputies that were attributed to the PL party were proposed by Lando, that would give the RPF coalition a majority.  But if Mugenzi would be able to propose his deputies, it would give the MRND their majority because Mugenzi was siding with the MRND by the time we get to the end of 1993.  Isn't that really the issue that was hovering in the background towards the end of December of 1993? 
A.	Virtually right.  That was virtually it.  
Q.	So by the time we get to the 5th of January 1994, when Juvénal Habyarimana was to take the oath of office and start the transition, it was expected that the deputies for the transitional national assembly would be sworn in that afternoon; right? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	He took his oath of office in the morning, which started the transition, and had things gone normally, the deputies would have been sworn in in the afternoon and you would've had the broad-based transitional government in effect as of the 5th of January 1994.  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	But Habyarimana would not allow that.  He caused his soldiers to prevent the deputies from arriving at CND to take the oath of office because he knew that the list that had been submitted -- the list of deputies that had been submitted was the list that was favourable to the Lando wing of the PL party.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	The lists were from the PL.  The PL lists were favourable towards the patriotic front at the time.  
Q.	Yes.  And what I'm saying to you is that's the very reason that President Habyarimana or persons acting on his behalf -- persons in authority acting on his behalf -- used soldiers to prevent the deputies from arriving at CND to take the oath of office.  He, in effect, stopped the government from being implemented.  Isn't that so? 
A.	It's more complicated than that.  
Q.	Well, things are always more complicated than one or two sentences.  But, sir, surely you agree that what I have just said captures the essence of the problem that Rwanda faced on the 
5th of January 1994.  Yes? 
A.	Yes, yes, that was the problem.  
Q.	It was not only the problem, because I mentioned Habyarimana's solution which was to use 
Rwandan soldiers to stop the government from being implemented.  And you say as much in your own book; don't you? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In fact, at page 77 of the French text and page 4 of the English text, you make, basically, the same analysis that I've just presented to you.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then on the 8th of January, there were demonstrations in Kigali, demonstrations that were organised and commanded by the MRND, which involved the Interahamwe and elite units of the Rwandan armed forces, some of whom were in civilian dress.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And again, Habyarimana -- or those close to him and acting on his behalf -- used all of the resources at their disposal, which is to say the army and the Interahamwe, to prevent the broad-based transitional government from being installed.  
A.	You're referring to the 8th of January?  On that day, there were no plans to put in place the said government or the parliament.  It was an ordinary day.  And, in effect, forces that were in favour of the president caused some turbulence, and some members of UNAMIR were even molested.  
Q.	Yes.  Perhaps a swearing-in was not to be held on the 8th, but when things did not go right on the 5th, there were plans to have another swearing-in a day later or a few days later.  But all of that was disrupted by organised demonstrations of Interahamwe and government soldiers, and you say as much in your own writings.  
A.	Yes, there were many -- several attempts at putting in place the institutions.  And reservations were displayed from the side of the president, and very often we would even go out to the ceremony grounds.  And very often -- there was not often any confrontations there at the ceremony grounds because we could not even get there.  
Q.	Because of government soldiers and Interahamwe militias; right? 
A.	Simply because the invitations were often cancelled.  
Q.	And there were also government soldiers and Interahamwe that were involved; right? 
A.	Who were participating in putting in place institutions or participating in what?  
Q.	Who were making sure that the government would not be installed because the MRND anticipated that had the government -- if the government was going to be installed, then they would not have the ruling coalition, because the deputies that were submitted by Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, the list of deputies for the PL, were weighted in favour of the RPF.  
A.	Yeah.  There were these calculations on the ground.  
Q.	Well, it all seems very clear to us now -- or clear to me now from your responses.  But this clarity in your response didn't emerge at all when you were answering questions from Mr. Robinson, but since this is what you have written about in your book, I'm sure we understand each other because I've read your book.  And if you see anything contrary to what I've just suggested, you can tell me where it appears in your book.  But this is, essentially, what you yourself have said in your book that you published in 2005.  
A.	A book of more than 200 pages cannot be summarised by answers:  Yes, no, that's correct, that's not correct.  I think the situation in my book is a more balanced view with more nuances.  Just because 
it is -- I'm -- I'm not a court, per se, the book is not an indictment of a tribunal.  When everything went -- went right, I mentioned it in my book.  When things went wrong, I also captured that in the book.  
Q.	Well, let me just read a few passages.  On page 6 of the English translation, which is pages 80 to 81 in the original French text, you say at the top of page 6 in the English, "While the militia were taking over the streets on the 8th of January, I tried in vain to reach the head of state by telephone to ask him to put a stop to the acts of violence perpetrated by people who claimed that they were representing him and who were obviously trying to wreck the peace process."  
A.	Oui, oui, oui.
Q.	And then -- 
A.	Yes, yes.  
Q.	And then you met Habyarimana later that same day.  And in several passages, you recount how he apologised to you profusely and repeatedly because he thought that the Interahamwe had even attacked and harmed you; right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	So instead of saying that your book was more nuanced, maybe you should say it was more detailed.  You brought more detail to the same summary that I've been eliciting from you over my last 
	two or three questions.  
A.	Yes, yes.  I provide further details, but those are not the only details.  I hope that we'll also be able to see the other aspects that I bring forth in my book.  
Q.	Then there was the issue of the CDR because President Habyarimana manipulated the situation to make the participation of the CDR party in the transitional national assembly a blocking point.  He had gotten past the issue of the PL.  There was pressure from the international community to implement the broad-based transitional government, and after the issue of the deputies had been resolved, then the MRND and President Habyarimana started to say, "No, we have to include the CDR."  Isn't that so? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	And the issue of the CDR was a connivance; it was an astuce.  It wasn't a -- a legitimate issue.  It was something that was invented or introduced just to prevent the government from being implemented; isn't that so? 
A.	It was a hypothesis foreseen by the Arusha agreement.  That possibility was foreseen by the 
Arusha agreement.  
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, that was your own analysis.  I'm not being creative in suggesting this to you.  
This is what you, yourself, wrote in 1995 when you were responding to questions from 
Professor Filip Reyntjens; isn't that so?  
A.	I -- I cannot recall what question from the CDR.  I said that the possible admission of CDR -- as -- same for the Islamic party or for any other party -- was provided for by the Arusha Peace Accords.  And that could be used politically, I agree.  But it was provided for.  
Q.	Well, let me hand up to you a copy of the letter and document that you produced in 1995.  I believe the date is the 20th of July 1995 in response to a request from Professor Filip Reyntjens.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And it is in the bundle.  I think it's document 11B.  There's -- A is the English, and B is the -- is the French.  My numbering is in the lower left-hand corner of the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, could you again try to slow down a bit.  
MR. WEBSTER:
To repeat, I've just asked that the document that I have identified -- I've just asked that the document I've identified as 11B, as marked in the lower left-hand corner of the document, be handed up to the witness.  

There's an English translation that precedes it, 11A, and I'm directing our attention to page 3 in the English text, and it would be page 1 -- excuse me.  Not page 1.  I believe it's page 1 of the document itself in the French text.  It's K number K0196142 in the French text.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Booh-Booh, you say that during the last ten days of the month of March, observers at the Arusha Peace Accords, namely, the ambassadors -- and then you list a number of European countries, and then also Zaire, Tanzania and the apostolic nuncio and yourself, as the dean of the diplomatic corps, succeeded in reconciling considerably the two leanings of the Parti libéral, which was the last obstacle to the establishment of the transitional institutions.  

But contrary to all expectations, we saw a sudden demand from the coalition for the defence of the republic, the CDR party, for the post of member of the national transitional assembly in accordance with the Arusha Accords.  And here's the sentence that interests me, Mr. Booh-Booh.  

"The unanimous view is that the head of the state" -- meaning Habyarimana -- "allegedly instigated the move by this extremist Hutu party involved in numerous acts of violence and hitherto strenuously opposed to the Arusha Peace Accords.  All efforts by the international community to remove this new obstacle were in vain."

So here we are in March of 1994, ready to implement a broad-based transitional government, and, again, Habyarimana, on behalf of the MRND party, creates an issue, which he knew was going to block the implementation of the government, by demanding that the CDR be represented in this new broad-based transitional government.  That's what you tell us in your responses to Professor Reyntjens back in 1995.  
A.	No -- well, Mr. Prosecutor, I believe we are saying the same thing.  The only nuance I wish to put in is the fact that that mission of the CDR, as of any other party, was provided for earlier on, but we agree that it was used for political purposes and the interests by the president.  We are agreed on that.  
Q.	We can agree that the CDR was a fundamentally racist party; wasn't it? 
A.	I already said so.  I said so in my book as well.

	1200H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The CDR party claimed that Rwanda was for the Hutu exclusively, and even in its definition of Hutu:  The only true Hutu was one born of a Hutu mother who was a hundred per cent Hutu and a Hutu father who was a hundred per cent Hutu, right? 
A.	I learned that, but not from the CDR.  That was conveyed to me by other persons. 
Q.	And they were adamantly opposed to the Arusha Accords. 
A.	Yes.  Yes, they told me so. 
Q.	But in March, when the implementation of the broad-based transitional government was imminent, Habyarimana, on behalf of the CDR, insisted that they be included in the government that was going to include the RPF, which created an impossible impasse -- impassable impasse in implementing that government. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And to get past this last connivance of Habyarimana, you went to Gisenyi on Easter weekend in order to meet with him. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You may not want to describe it as a tête-à-tête, but surely we could agree that it wasn't simply a social encounter. 
A.	It was a working visit. 
Q.	And once there, he and the people around him invited you to lunch with Alphonse Higanero at Higanero's home, and then later that evening you had dinner at Habyarimana's home. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on both occasions, Joseph Nzirorera was present. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And while in the context of your socialising, you were also discussing the future of the country in terms of how the Arusha Accords could finally be implemented. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at the end of that visit, according to what you have written, Habyarimana still promised you nothing.  You were still at an impasse.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In fact, I think your exact words were, "He promised exactly nothing".  
A.	Yes.  For the records, at least he promised that he was going to see me after his return from 
Dar es Salaam; that was on the 6th of April.  That was all he promised me, that he would grant me an audience as soon as he returned from Dar es Salaam. 
Q.	So he would meet you again, but he was not making any concessions that would allow the government to be implemented -- or that was not your understanding on the 3rd of April when you parted company with him? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Well, that is essentially the point I wanted to make through these questions, Mr. Witness.  Because the way we left things -- the way things were left from your examination-in-chief yesterday, it would have been easy to conclude that you thought the MRND was trying to implement the government -- implement the broad-based transitional government, and we both know that exactly the opposite was the case, right? 
A.	The MRND was negotiating.  The negotiations were on course and everybody was negotiating.  That's how I see things.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, your previous answers are on the record.  The Court will be able to appreciate them.  But we have just gone through 10 or 15 minutes of question and answer where you have told us over and over again that the MRND was using -- or President Habyarimana was using his soldiers, the Interahamwe, and political intrigue to prevent the broad-based transitional government from being implemented.  But we'll go on to something else.  

Now, you knew that the Interahamwe and those controlling it, including Habyarimana, was behind the violence on the 8th of January; isn't that so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that's something you knew as the events were occurring.  It's not something that you figured out weeks later.  It's something that you could recognise as the events were unfurling, right?  Both because you were an eyewitness and almost a participant, inasmuch as you yourself had been aggressed by the Interahamwe.  
A.	I was not aggressed or mugged, but I was a direct eyewitness of all these events. 
Q.	Okay.  Are you familiar with the term "accusations in a mirror"?  This is a term that is used in the theory and analysis of propaganda.  It's actually the subject of academic enquiry.  If you are familiar with the term, you can let me know.  If you are not, I'll put the matter to you in another way, "accusations in a mirror".  
A.	No, I do not know that expression. 
Q.	In any case, this is when someone accuses someone else of doing precisely what they themselves are doing.  So it's a strategy to deflect blame or responsibility or to justify one's actions.  You accuse the person in front of you or opposed to you of doing exactly what you yourself are doing.  And I say that to you because I'd like us to look at the first document in my exhibit bundle, which is a communiqué that was issued by Joseph Nzirorera on the 10th of January 1994 in regard to the violence that took place on the 8th of January.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness.  I have it in its original Kinyarwanda, and I only have a French translation, but it's the first document in the documents that I circulated earlier.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'd like -- Mr. Booh-Booh, you could read the document to yourself.  What interests me is the beginning of paragraph 1, and the bottom of paragraph 3, and I'm going to read portions of it.  But certainly you can read it to yourself so you can appreciate all of the context of the document.  And I'll summarise it in English, and if my summary is in any way inaccurate, you can let me know because you are reading it in French.  And if you look at the Kinyarwanda, you'll see at the bottom it's signed by Joseph Nzirorera.  You have the seal of the MRND party. 

It says, "Yesterday, the 9th of January, Sunday, Radio Rwanda issued a communiqué signed by Nzamurambaho, Nahinzira, Twagiramungu, and Ndasingwa which was read by Félicien Ngango over the airwaves of Radio Rwanda."  

And what Mr. Nzirorera says is that, "The MRND doesn't understand how Radio Rwanda, who didn't say anything about the demonstration of the day before yesterday, which is the 8th of January, could allow Mr. Ngango to fool public opinion by suggesting that the president of the republic and the MRND had organised the demonstration, when, in fact, the demonstration was made by inhabitants 
of the city of Kigali who were led astray by the lies and intrigues coming from Twagiramungu, 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, Kavaruganda, all in the interest of the RPF."  

So here Nzirorera starts by saying that the demonstrations that you and I both know were organised by the MRND and involved the Interahamwe, were somehow the responsibility of Twagiramungu, Uwilingiyimana, Kavaruganda, working on behalf of the RPF.  

And that paragraph 3 at the bottom, he says, "The city of Kigali is full of Abakombozi, who have just undergone military training by the RPF and who await the signal from the RPF to exterminate all of the opponents of the Inkotanyi."  You yourself know that that was clearly not the case, right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Booh-Booh, is that this is an accusation in the mirror, because I'm going to use that same -- I'm going to repeat that same sentence, and I'm only going to substitute 
	one or two words and let's see what that sentence says to us.  

Suppose you heard the sentence:  "The city of Kigali is full of Interahamwe, who have undergone military training by the FAR, and who await the signal from the FAR to exterminate all of the opponents of the MRND."  Doesn't that have the ring of truth?   
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	What don't you know?  Where is the doubt? 
A.	The doubt arises on the manoeuvres and military training and the manoeuvres purportedly undertaken by Mr. Ngango's party.  There are facts about which I don't have evidence, but the situation was such that from the 8th of January almost the entire international community was accusing the Interahamwe and the MRND and those who were referred to as the Hutu Power as having been involved in those demonstrations.  That was reported, and I also said so to President Habyarimana myself.  

Now, as for the other facts and circumstances surrounding that assertion, I am not in a position to comment.  I am seeing this communiqué, by the way, for the first time. 
Q.	Yes, I can appreciate that we're reading it together for the first time, Mr. Booh-Booh.  And we've already agreed that the demonstrations on the 8th of January were being organised or that the violence was being perpetrated by the Interahamwe.  You know that because you were an eyewitness.  So that's really not where my question lays.  

My question is with the third paragraph -- the end of the third paragraph of Mr. Nzirorera's communiqué, where he is warning the people of Kigali that there are Abakombozi who are being trained to attack opponents of the Inkotanyi with an intention of exterminating them.  And I'm suggesting to you that that's an accusation in a mirror because if we substitute Interahamwe for Abakombozi and substitute the FAR, the Rwanda government military forces, for the RPF, and substitute MRND for Inkotanyi, the sentence would read as follows: 

"The city of Kigali is full of Interahamwe, who have undergone military training by the FAR, and who await the signal from the FAR to exterminate all of the opponents of the MRND."  

Giving the matter some thought, wouldn't you agree that that was the reality on the ground back in January of 1994? 
A.	I believe that the author of this denial or refutation, who is present in the courtroom, can or will be in a position himself to explain to you what the full depth of his thoughts were.  
Q.	He may have that opportunity, but I am putting the question to you, so I would like a response.  
A.	I do not have any answer to offer to that sentence.  I have just read the sentence like all others reading it.  I want to insist on what I have said; namely, that we all pointed at all -- accused the authors of the demonstrations of the 8th of January.  We actually condemned those demonstrations.  

Now, whether any ideas were woven into and around those demonstrations would only be a matter that lays with those who wrote it or who believe in it.  And you are not going to get me to say "yes" or "no" to something, whereas, as the representative of the Secretary General, my assessment led us to the position whereby we strongly condemned those actions and pointed out who the authors or perpetrators of those demonstrations were. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Booh-Booh, putting aside what you yourself knew, from your observations on the ground up to the 10th of January, which was when this communiqué was issued, doesn't what I have just suggested to you, that the Interahamwe were being trained by the FAR to exterminate the enemies of the MRND upon command, doesn't that fall in line with what you learned over the period of 11 to 12 January 1994 when you discussed these very issues with Dallaire?  
A.	The 11th and 14th of January of 1994 -- 
Q.	No, that's not what I said.  What I said was that you saw the demonstrations on the 8th of January, so you know what that entailed, and this communiqué came out on the 10th of January.  So even if you were not able to put two and two together, based on what you could observe in Kigali up to the 
10th of January, wouldn't you agree that by the time we get to the next day and the day after that, the 11th and the 12th of January, these were the very things that you were discussing with Dallaire.  And this was the information that you were relaying back and forth to New York, and this was the substance of that famous fax of the 11th of January, which you claim -- which we discussed yesterday.  
A.	I have some reservations about that fax which General Dallaire refers to.  You have seen it.  I have not seen it.  So I don't think that we can be on the same wavelength regarding that telegram from Dallaire, who apparently, from the very beginning, was not channelled through the normal UNAMIR channels. 
Q.	Okay.  We're going to get into that.  But before we do, I'd like some clarity on one issue from you.  Is it really your testimony that you have never seen or read this fax of the 11th of January 1994? 
A.	I maintain my testimony. 
Q.	It doesn't shame you at all to make that admission?  Sixteen years after the genocide -- you as the chief of mission of UNAMIR, a document that has generated so much controversy and so much commentary that it's used to suggest that there was a conspiracy to commit genocide -- you are telling this Chamber that you didn't have the intellectual or professional curiosity to find it and read it after it's been circulating freely in the public domain for the last 10 years? 
A.	Maybe you are in possession of that document.  What I am telling you is that I only became aware of this document through rumour.  What the United Nations asked me to do was to look for weapons caches in the city.  I and General Dallaire went to see President Habyarimana to tell him that there are weapons that are hidden in Kigali and that the Secretary General has asked us to tell him that he will be responsible from -- for any situation arising because of those weapons caches and that he should take action in respect of those caches and not distribute the said weapons.  

That is what I was asked to do and that is what I did.  No one ever asked me whether Jean-Pierre had killed somebody or whether Tutsis were being killed every second or what have you.  

Now, the version that I am giving you is contained in a book that has just been published by 
Frederic Eckhard, he -- who was Kofi Annan's spokesperson for eight years.  I do not want to subject you to -- anyway, let me just say a thing or two on the issue at hand.  

The spokesperson --
Q.	We'll get to that -- 
A.	Can I speak?  Can I speak?  
Q.	(Microphone not activated)...to pick up where I have left off because you still haven't answered my question.  What I suggested to you is that it is astounding that someone who is the head of the UNAMIR mission, which is regarded as a failure because of the genocide, would, 16 years later, admit that he has not even read the fax, which is a document that has been circulating publicly for at least the last 10 years, that has been so central to how the genocide has been discussed and the failures of UNAMIR have been discussed -- you weren't the least bit curious to read its contents for yourself, whether or not you think it's an authentic document or not? 
A.	Many people think that this document is fake.  There are other write-ups which point to the fact that this document for several years could not be found in the United Nations archives, that is, this -- 
Dallaire's telegram, simply because he went through another Canadian, General Baril.  So this telegram was not forwarded through the normal communication channels.  And mindful of the importance of the content of that fax, the responsibility for the contents should normally have fallen to the head of mission.  

So my position on the genocide -- you who have read the book, you know what my position is.  I condemned the genocide, and towards the end there is a mea culpa.  I do acknowledge that, but I cannot acknowledge things that, right from the very beginning, did not proceed properly.  The telegram of the first commander was a problem -- was problematic right from the beginning, and New York did not send this telegram to me.  
Q.	We have your response. 
MR. WEBSTER:  
Mr. Issa, if you could give this document to Mr. Booh-Booh.  

This is the next document in my bundle.  It's actually in evidence.  It is D. NZ15.  What I have handed up to the witness is the original English text and a French translation.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Mr. Booh-Booh, we will have the opportunity to read this famous fax together.  And it may be easier for you to actually follow it in the English, but you have the French translation.  But it's addressed to Baril, as you suggested, and it's signed by Dallaire.  And you see it's dated the 11th of January 1994.  And in the English text it's two pages long, in the French it's a bit longer, but if you could begin by just reading to yourself the first sentence for each of the enumerated paragraphs, because actually the first sentence captures the essence of the paragraphs that follow.  

So for enumerated paragraph number 1, it's the "Force commander put in contact with"  -- an -- "informant by" -- a -- "very, very important government politician."  The "Informant is a top-level trainer in the cadre of Interahamwe-armed militia of the MRND."  

Paragraph 2, "He" -- referring to informant -- "informed us he was in charge of last Saturday's demonstrations which aims were to target deputies of opposition parties coming to ceremonies and Belgian soldiers" -- those are the demonstrations that we just talked about on the 8th of January that you yourself were caught up in.  

Paragraph 3, "The informant confirmed that 48 para-commandos and a few members of the gendarmerie participated in" -- those -- "demonstrations in plain clothes" -- again, referring to the demonstrations of the 8th of January that you yourself saw.  

Fourth paragraph, the "Informant is a former security member of the president."  

Fifth paragraph, the "Interahamwe has trained 1,700 men in Rwandan government forces military camps outside the capital.  The 1,700 are scattered in groups of 40 throughout Kigali."  

Go to paragraph number 6.  The "Principal aim of" -- the -- "Interahamwe in the past was to protect Kigali from" the "RPF."  But "Since" -- the -- "UNAMIR mandate, he" -- referring to informant -- "has been ordered to register all Tutsi in Kigali.  He suspects it is for their extermination."  The 
"Example" -- that --"he gave was that in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to 1000 Tutsis."  

It's not mentioned as a prediction.  It's mentioned as an example in the fax. 

Seventh paragraph, the "Informant states" -- that -- "he disagrees with anti-Tutsi extermination.  He supports opposition to" -- the -- "RPF but cannot support" -- the -- "killing of innocent persons."  
And "...he believes the president does not have full control over all" -- the -- "elements of his old 
party" -- and -- "faction." 

Eighth paragraph, "Informant is prepared to provide location of major weapons cache with at least 
135 weapons." 

Ninth, this is Dallaire's voice now, "It is our intention to take action within the next 36 hours" -- to recover these arms, presumably. 

Tenth paragraph, "It is recommended the informant be granted protection and evacuated out of Rwanda."  

Eleventh paragraph, "Force commander will be meeting with the very, very important political person tomorrow morning in order to ensure that this individual is conscious of all the parameters of his involvement."  

And the last sentence of the eleventh paragraph, "Force commander to inform the special representative of the Secretary General first thing in the morning to ensure his support."  

So this must come as quite a revelation to you now, reading this famous fax for the first time.  
A.	You may not believe it, but yes, it is the first time that I am seeing this fax in a full document as you have it.  You, yourself, you read the last sentence in which General Dallaire says that he will inform -- he will inform me the next day.  Well, when I saw General Dallaire the next day, this is exactly what he told me:  That he had sent off a fax to New York through Baril, the Canadian general, relating to persistent threats in Kigali and weapons caches, particularly.  

As you can see, this telegram deals with a number of points, including the weapons cache.  On that very day, I received a message from New York stating that they had received a fax on a situation of weapons caches in Kigali.  New York then asked me to contact the ambassadors of western countries with whom I worked regularly, so that each one of them could go and see Habyarimana and represent to him that the threat of weapons caches was not acceptable and that Habyarimana must denounce all that.  

New York also asked me to make the same representations to President Habyarimana, and I went with General Dallaire.  He accompanied me to that appointment.  We never talked about Tutsis who were going to be killed.  Every 20 minutes or what have you, we went to deal with the issue of weapons caches.  

A short while ago I told you that Kofi Annan's spokesperson does narrate the same version which I am giving you, and all of that in two sentences, which I could read out to you with your leave.  This is what he says: "The Secretary General instructed the chief of mission in Rwanda, the Cameroonian, 
Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, to show the telegram to Belgian, French, and American ambassadors in Kigali, the three most influential governments in Kigali, and also to alert President Habyarimana, a Hutu, and tell him that they were expecting that he would foil any attempts to execute this plot.  Now, he asked whether these instructions were, in any manner, problematic to him and the answer was no, and he went on to do what he had been asked to do."

This testimony is not from me.  This testimony is from the spokesperson of the Secretary General, and he states clearly that he asked me to go and see Habyarimana to deal with this issue of weapons caches, and I carried out my mission accordingly.  This telex was sent to several ambassadors. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
Your Honour, I see the time.  If we could break now, I'll pick up again after the lunch. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And, Mr. Booh-Booh, I would like you to have the two documents that I just handed up to you.  So you could keep those for your own records and consultation.  
A.	Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take our lunch break.  
(Court recessed from 1235H to 1407H) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Good afternoon to everyone.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good afternoon to you, Mr. Booh-Booh. 
A.	Good afternoon.
Q.	I'd like us to pick up where we left off.  And my understanding is that with regard to the fax -- the Dallaire fax of the 11th of January, you had not seen that fax or discussed it with Dallaire before it was sent.  And your first knowledge of it was the following day when you received a code cable from Kofi Annan in New York; is that the case, or would you like to clarify matters for us?  
A.	I would like to clarify.  The fax which was sent to me from New York was not Dallaire's fax, rather, it was a fax referring to Dallaire's fax and -- which was asking me for one thing, as I have said often in the past, stop the caching of weapons by President Habyarimana.  That is what I had been asked.  But I would like to add, Counsel for the Prosecutor, that when we saw President Habyarimana, the fax which had been sent from New York on the 11th, was equally asking us to identify the informant who had talked about caches of weapons.  Yes.  
Q.	We're going to get to that, Mr. Booh-Booh.  So you'll have a chance to tell us more about your conversation with the president, but for right now what I'm trying to find out is if you had any discussion with Dallaire about the fax that he sent before receiving a reaction to that fax by Kofi Annan in New York? 
A.	Yes, General Dallaire talked to me about a fax which he had sent to New York regarding the issue of weapons and violence in general, but he did not give me the text, which you handed to me this morning.  That is the issue I am talking about.  Rather, it is New York which sent me a fax on the 10th, as a matter of fact, dated on the -- on the 10th and requesting me to carry out certain operations, but Dallaire and I did not discuss before -- before we went to meet President Habyarimana.  
It is after I had received the text from New York that I -- we went to see President Habyarimana.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you for that.  So I'm just trying to clarify that you discussed the contents of the fax with Dallaire before receiving Kofi Annan's reaction.  
A.	Yes.  Yes, indeed -- not the contents. 
Q.	And your testimony earlier this morning was that that conversation with Dallaire took place the following morning.  In other words, the fax went out at night, and it was the following day that you had discussed its context with Dallaire; is that your testimony? 
A.	Yes, indeed, but, once again, we did not discuss, and he didn't give me the text.  He informed me that he had sent a document to New York regarding the caching of weapons and the issue of -- of violence and insecurity, but I did not see the text. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could assist by giving this document to the witness.  This is the third document in my bundle.  It's the code cable from Kofi Annan to Mr. Booh-Booh dated the 10th of January.  And as it's scanned, it's a document that consists of two pages.  And this was admitted by the Prosecution as P. 39 through another witness.  But in examining it closely, I think we may have done something in error when we provided the document to CMS, because if you look at the second page at the very top in the 
right-hand corner, it bears the notation, "CNR-25 page 2 of 2", but the first page says, "CNR-005 
page 1 of 1".  

So by my assessment, this document should really only consist of one page, and the second page which bears K number L0001705 should be removed.  So I would make that request to the Chamber, and I do that only for the accuracy and reliability of the record.  I think this is a document 
one page in length.  At the bottom of the first page you see, "regards", and then it continues with paragraphs 4 and 5, but I don't think paragraphs 4 and 5 actually pertain to the first page of this exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, do we have to address this particular issue now?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No.  It just comes to mind now.  We can deal with it afterwards.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I think it would be better because we need more assistance to make a formal decision.  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Okay.  So Mr. Booh-Booh, if you look at the document that's placed in front of you, I think it pretty much reflects what you told us, that on the 10th of January Mr. Annan sent you a code cable, and he refers to Dallaire's cable, CNR-12.  And if we look at the document I gave you earlier this morning, which is 
D. NZ15, it does bear the notation CNR-12.  So we know that Mr. Annan is referring to the cable that Dallaire sent on the 11th of January, the very one that we looked at.  

And he says at paragraph 2, "The information is a cause for concern, but there are certain inconsistencies.  We must handle this information with caution."  And as you told us at paragraph 3, it says, "We await your considered assessment and recommendations."  

So clearly, Kofi Annan is asking you to provide further information before he reacts to the information that was contained in the fax that Dallaire sent.  So we're agreed on that, and I think this documentation actually supports that portion of -- of your evidence.  But what concerns me is the next document that goes out.  

I'd like Mr. Issa to hand this up to you.  It is document 4 in my bundle.  This is the code cable that you sent, Mr. Booh-Booh, to Kofi Annan on the 11th -- it is dated 11th of January 1994.  It refers to MIR79, which is the same document that we just looked at -- excuse me.  It is numbered MIR79, but it refers to your code cable number 74 dated the 10th of January.  And that's the code cable that we just looked at, which is P. 039.  

So Mr. Booh-Booh, that's your signature at the top of the document, right, next to your name?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you refer to code cable 74, right?  You see that at the top of the document?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you inform Kofi Annan that:  "In response to directions given at reference" -- and, of course, you're referring to code cable 74 -- "no further action has been taken with informant at this time", which is exactly what he told you to do.  He told you not to take any action.  "A pre-planned contact this evening will happen solely in order to maintain communication with" -- the --"individual."  

So you are following Kofi Annan's instructions, but what interests me is what you say at paragraph 2.  And there it says -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  You gave us a little bit of a difficulty following your numbering, but we found it now. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry about that.  These exhibits have been used over and over again and everyone has their own way of identifying it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, I know, but you see, this is number 4 in bundle 1. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I'm sorry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
That's what had fooled us initially. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  I'm sorry. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Back to you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  At paragraph 2 of that document, which is in evidence already as P. 41, you tell Kofi Annan that "General Dallaire, force commander, briefed me during the night even though our code cable indicated to the contrary."  So it seems that your conversation, by your own admission, with General Dallaire who you claim was keeping you out of the loop, took place even earlier than he indicated in this code cable, because you had discussed it that night.  That's what you are telling Kofi Annan.  
A.	That is what is written here, but definitely on our part there was certainly an error in including this paragraph 2, because I did not see Dallaire in -- at night.  I didn't meet him during the night.  And he, indeed, had promised earlier that he would see me the following day.  So this fax was drafted by my executive director, who, along with Dallaire, had gone to meet and collect information on -- or about the informant, because when I received the -- telegram 64, I sent -- I asked General Dallaire, along with the executive director, Mr. Kabia. 
Q.	We're going to get to Mr. Kabia, but I think we need to take things step by step.  
A.	Very well.
Q.	Because I don't think -- just given the way that the documentation was run, I don't think Mr. Kabia was involved in the communications between you and Dallaire on the 11th.  Looking at paragraph 2, it says, "General Dallaire, force commander, briefed me during the night even though our" -- "our code cable indicated to the contrary." 

"Our" is first person plural.  You and General Dallaire sent a code...(microphones overlapping)
A.	Yes, that's true.  No, not at all.  We didn't send the telegram to New York together.  That is what I was trying to explain to the Chamber that the telegram we have here is a reaction to telegram 74 sent by Kofi Annan requesting further detail. 
Q.	Yes, but, Mr. Booh-Booh, what I'm suggesting to you is that your paragraph 2 is really a defensive reaction, because when Kofi Annan wrote back to you and told you not to take any action and to give him more information, you respond by saying, "Well, Dallaire met me earlier than would appear in this code cable, even though our cable indicated to the contrary".  

So we'll go on, and maybe you'll pick up on the thrust of your message to Kofi Annan as we read on, but I think if you read it as one continuous document, you would agree with me that you were trying to explain and mollify Kofi Annan by giving him more information than was contained in Dallaire's initial fax. 

So if we go to paragraph 3, you say, "In order to respond to your point" -- excuse me.  "In order to respond to your point at paragraph 2 of the reference" -- where Kofi Annan is asking for more information and is trying to assess the reliability of the information, you informed Kofi Annan that the "force commander", which is Dallaire, "accompanied by Dr. Kabia", who is your political advisor, right?  
A.	Yes, he was UNAMIR's executive director. 
Q.	(Microphone not activated)  
A.	Yes, a very close collaborator.  Unfortunately, he is of late.  He died shortly after that mission. 
Q.	Yes, but this is someone in whom you had confidence.  It's not your relationship with Dallaire.  This is your man on whom you rely and whom you had no degree of mistrust, which is what you seem to say about Dallaire.  Can we agree on that point before I move on? 
A.	Allow me to rectify by stating that I trusted all my collaborators, because it would make no sense for a mission head not to trust his collaboration - collaborators, and that they do not ask for them to be removed.  I didn't ask for Dallaire to be removed.  I trusted him.  He had a specialty area, and I had no reason not to trust him.  

Now, I was about to say that I am a bit surprised by paragraph 2.  It should -- it does -- it doesn't reflect the chronology of the events, because Dallaire could not have received me at night at the time when he was sending the telegram.  Secondly, General Dallaire and I did not draft a fax or a telegram together.  That outgoing code does not reflect the document we did together, he and I. 
Q.	We have that, Mr. Booh-Booh.  We are moving forward now.  But in any case, you tell Mr. Annan that in order to respond to his paragraph 2, that the "Force commander, accompanied by" -- your political advisor, "Dr. Kabia, met with the VVIP" -- the very important personality in question -- "who originally established the link between UNAMIR and the informant."  The VVIP is the prime minister designate, who you already identified as Twagiramungu.  

"The interview was conducted in a very serene atmosphere and the force commander forthrightly questioned the prime minister designate" -- which is Twagiramungu -- "on his belief/confidence that the informant was in fact a genuine individual who wishes to change his ways and leave this terrible movement." 

So what I suggest to you, Mr. Booh-Booh, that by paragraph 3, you are trying to reassure Kofi Annan that even though -- you know, without you're having made contact directly with this informant, your political advisor, along with General Dallaire, met Twagiramungu and spoke with him at length in a very serene environment to get the initial information about this informant who gave you this very sensitive information.  Isn't my characterisation a reasonable inference in relation to that paragraph?   
A.	Your understanding is correct.
(Pages 28 to 40 by Deborah Gentile)


1430H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let's go on to the next paragraph.  The person who asked the prime minister designate, who is Twagiramungu, to approach the fourth commander, that is Dallaire, to establish the contact is a conseiller at the foreign ministry with whom the prime minister designate has had a very privileged professional relationship within the party MDR.  The informant is the brother-in-law of the conseiller.   

So here again in paragraph 4 you are trying to reassure Kofi Annan of the reliability of the informant because he was put in contact with Dallaire through Twagiramungu who had a personal relationship with the conseiller in the foreign ministry with whom -- to whom this informant is related.  So this isn't some person that just sprung out of the woodwork.  He's someone who has links to an identifiable government official in the ministry of foreign affairs and foreign ministry who knows Twagiramungu.  

Doesn't that run counter to what you were telling us yesterday where you suggested that this Jean-Pierre person may not even exist? 
A.	Those are the pieces of information that we had on the 11th of January, but subsequently further research was conducted with respect to that Jean-Pierre, and appear specifically in the 
	Belgian parliamentary commission report.  And it was Twagiramungu himself who testified to that commission.

In sum -- to summarise what Twagiramungu, who initially had been saying he knew Jean-Pierre very well -- before the Belgians Twagiramungu stated that Mr. Jean-Pierre was a deserter of 
Habyarimana's army, that he was somebody who had been some sort of double agent between the RPF and the MRND.  He further specifies that these are people who are not serious, that these are some of the people who are not serious and wanted to take advantage of the situation to make money for themselves.  

He said that that Jean-Pierre he's talking about is the one he knows and that he is not serious, unless he claims that there is another Jean-Pierre.  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know.  But the one that he knows and whom he was able to describe to General Dallaire and -- to General Dallaire and Dr. Kabia is an (inaudible) to the one he is referring to before the Belgian senators.  

That is where the war in question arises.  Because at the time when we were sending in this information to New York on 11th January we felt that it was founded.  But, subsequently, as I told you, I can't tell if Mr. Twagiramungu came and testified before this Trial Chamber.  But if he did so, then I imagine that he seized the opportunity to throw more light on this Jean-Pierre issue.
Q.	I'm happy to take note of the last phrase in your answer where you said, "We felt that this information was founded," because that is what I was suggesting to you all along when you referred to "our code cable".  This is something you had discussed with Dallaire.  You are trying to reassure Kofi Annan.  You're doing so by relying on the conversations that Dallaire had with Twagiramungu.  So you are urging the folks in New York to take your information seriously because you thought it was reliable at the time.

But let's move on to the following paragraph, paragraph 5 on the next page:  "The 
PMD" -- prime minister designate, again Twagiramungu -- "expressed total, repeat total, confidence in the veracity and true ambitions of the informant.  He is 100 per cent sure that the individual wants out of all this killing and disruption.  Such an endorsement cannot be ignored nor taken lightly."  

So, here again, you're relying on the information coming from Twagiramungu to suggest to 
Kofi Annan in New York that this information must be taken seriously and it is -- has the appearance of reliability.  Right?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you also talk about more than arms caches because you refer to killings and disruption in that paragraph, which suggests that the information that you had been sending -- you had been sending to New York to Kofi Annan addressed something more than just arms caches.  Wouldn't you agree that this is a reasonable inference to draw from this paragraph? 
A.	In this paragraph, and all that follows, there's one thing that must be taken note of it.  And it is the fact that in this second stage I am involved, the second stage of Dallaire's fax.  

In the first fax I am not involved and nobody went through me.  But this one shows that I am now involved in giving this response and this information to Kofi Annan.  It was not me who went and fetched the information, but it was collaborators of mine whom I trusted and I therefore conveyed the information to New York exactly as they handed it over to me. 
Q.	Well, thank you for your response.  But my comment to you is that you seemed to be endorsing the information which was contained in the earlier fax.  That's really the point of query.  

But let's move on.  Paragraph 6:  "The informant does not have long before he must 
continue" -- "continue to distribute the remaining arms."  

So you're not talking about arms caches.  You're talking about distribution of arms.  

And you go on to state in that paragraph:  "We await your guidance on how to handle the situation, including the request for protection", so on and so forth.

Seventh paragraph:  "The force commander is prepared to pursue this operation in accordance with military doctrine with reconnaissance, rehearsal and implementation using concentrated, overwhelming force.  Should at any time during reconnaissance planning or preparation any sign of a possible contravening or possibility of an undue risky scenario present itself, the operation will be called off."  

So, Mr. Booh-Booh, what I am suggesting to you is when you read your code cable going out under your signature as one integral message, you seem to be endorsing the contents of the previous fax of the 11th of January sent out by Dallaire, making specific reference to some of the information that he put in that fax, which you claim you didn't know about.  There is a reference to disturbances, to arms distributions, killings, disruption, how you came to meet the informant, his connections to the very important VIP.  

So we have your responses.  All I'm suggesting to you is that you seem, by this document anyway, to have had much more involvement and knowledge of the contents of the fax that was sent on the 
11th of January than you led us to believe yesterday.  
A.	If you consult all these documents, particularly that which came from New York, number 74, and that which we dispatched on the 11th of January, we are going to receive another cable to go and see Habyarimana.  

Now, if you look at all these cable messages, we are referring to a cable message that Dallaire sent to New York.  But the substance of that fax is not provided.  It is in no document, be it from New York -- or is it going from Kigali to New York?  

Mention is made of violence, turbulence, arms caches, and these are topics which we have regularly handled.  And yet I have never had the first fax which left beyond my purview of authority.  It did not go through the normal channel, which was going through me.  And I never had a copy of this text.  And New York, on the spot and asking me to complete this information, does not send the said fax or the said telegram or cable.  It does not appear anywhere here.  But what should be noted is the fact that when I get information from New York, I involve myself in the process that is ongoing with my collaborators.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Let's move ahead.  Let's go to the next document, which is a code cable from 
	Kofi Annan to you responding to the code cable that we just finished discussing.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And it is clear that these cables are going back and forth rapidly because the information is so sensitive that both on your side in Kigali and in -- on Mr. Annan's side in New York, you have to keep clarifying the situation to find out exactly what is going on.  

So this one dated 11th January from Kofi Annan to you starts out by saying that, "We have carefully reviewed the situation in the light of your MIR79" -- that's the document we've just finished looking at.  And you will see the notation, MIR79, right at the top of the P. 41, which is the document we just looked at.

And as you told us Kofi Annan told you, "We cannot agree with the operation contemplated in paragraph 7 of your cable as it clearly goes beyond the mandate entrusted to UNAMIR."  So he's telling you not to go and try and recover these arms, which is exactly what you told us yesterday.  

Then he goes on in paragraph 2 to say:  "However, on the assumption that you are convinced that the information provided by the informant is absolutely reliable, we request you to undertake the initiatives described in the following paragraphs."  

In paragraph 3:  "The special representative of the Secretary General" -- which is you, Mr. Booh-Booh -- "and the force commander" -- Mr. Dallaire -- "should request an urgent meeting with the president."  

That's what you told us.  

"At that meeting you should inform the president that you have received apparently reliable information concerning the activities of the Interahamwe militia which present" -- "represent a clear threat to the peace process." 

Now, Mr. Booh-Booh, relying on your evidence that you had never seen the fax of 11th of January sent by Dallaire, doesn't this sentence inform you, indirectly, that the information that was sent to New York concerned the activities of the Interahamwe militia?  
A.	Well, I don't believe we should stop at that point or that sentence.  It would be worthwhile to read the entire sentence.  It sheds greater light on what I understood after receiving that document. 
Q.	Let's do that.  Let me read it.  But bear in mind that my concern is that you claim that you only were told about arms caches.  That was all that Dallaire told you about.  But here we have Kofi Annan responding directly to you, telling you about the information that he had received from you guys in Kigali.  

So after that sentence, and I'll read it again:  "At the meeting you should inform the president that you have received apparently reliable information concerning the activities of the Interahamwe militia, which represent a clear threat to the peace process."  You, Mr. Booh-Booh, should inform him, the president, that these activities include the training and deployment of subversive groups in Kigali, as well as the storage and distribution of weapons to these groups.

Now, when you read that back on the 11th or 12th of January 1994, if you didn't know that Dallaire had told New York about Interahamwe training, certainly this paragraph from Kofi Annan should have rung some bell in your mind and generated some enquiry on your part, given the seriousness and the sensitivity of this information.  
A.	Well, I must tell you that the subversive activities of the Interahamwe were not something which on their own needed us to stop and stare. So far as we were concerned, we were used to these subversive activities by the Interahamwe.  We had always reported these activities back to New York.  And that is why I am saying my actions only began after New York drew my attention to it.  And there was -- particularly the distribution of weapons, the trainings and the arms caches.  That was what, to me, was the important point and which was urgent.  

But as for the activities of the Interahamwe, they did not begin on that day.  They did not begin with Dallaire's cable.  Neither did they end with Dallaire's cable.  We had to cope with these activities all the time.  

Contrarily, the training of these militia, the distribution of weapons, the existence of arms caches, as described here, caused some sensation, I must tell you.  When I went to see President Habyarimana, if I talked about Interahamwe, it was within the general framework of the subversive activities of those parties, but not necessarily because General Dallaire had given me a copy of his cable.  He had not given me a copy.  I have asserted this everywhere and all the time.  I don't understand how I'd come here to say the contrary.  

But thereafter we worked together to shed further light on the situation for the people in New York, that is at the headquarters of the United Nations.  But before President Habyarimana, we insisted, particularly on the problem of the existence of arms caches, the distribution of weapons and the training of militiamen.  And when we went to meet the president of the party and his colleagues, we harped upon that, and that alone. 
Q.	Your response is very helpful, because clearly you're telling us that Jean-Pierre was not the initial -- the first source of this information, or the only source.  It was obvious to you that Interahamwe were being trained, that arms were being distributed to them, that they were being used by the president to create disruption in the city in order to stop the implementation of the broad-based transitional government.  The only thing that seems to be missing from your acknowledgment of two minutes ago is that they were attacking the Tutsi; wasn't that obvious also? 
A.	I would begin by saying that I do not know Jean-Pierre.  I never met him personally. 
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, that is not my question.  I can repeat the question for you.  
A.	No, Mr. Prosecutor.  I have understood your question. 
Q.	Please respond directly to the issue that I've raised.  
A.	Yes, I believe that the activities of the Interahamwe were targeting the Tutsis.  But these activities could also affect other people because there were people who were considered as accomplices of the Tutsis, and I believe those as well suffered outrageously at the time in the country.  So this was a violent group, and whenever they were unleashed even some of the UNAMIR staff received beatings from them. 
Q.	Okay.  All right.  Let's move on.

The next document in the bundle is a fax that was sent from Dallaire to Kofi Annan, recounting some of the same things that you have already told us earlier today and yesterday, which are contained in your code cable of 13th of January, which I believe Mr. Robinson went over with you yesterday.  

So we don't need to go over those two documents line by line.  But what I would like to hear from you is when you went to see President Habyarimana, which is what Kofi Annan instructed you to do, who else was present for that meeting?  There was you.  There was Dallaire.  I believe there was Kabia.  Who else was there from the president's side for that first meeting with Habyarimana when you explained the information you had received from this informant?  
A.	I do recall that in attendance was his director of cabinet, but I can no longer recall the presence of anybody else.  But, consequently, when he got a grasp of the aim of our initiative, that was when he made a phone call to the representative of his party calling upon them to meet them -- meet them, that is, to meet us, Dallaire and myself, because when we went there they did not know exactly what we were going to talk about.  

The director of cabinet certainly was always by him.  But when he got to know the aim of our visit, he got -- he got us to know that we were knocking at the wrong door, since he was no more in charge of the party and the militia of the Interahamwe any longer and that we had to go and see the team that was in charge or that was leading party. 
Q.	Thank you.  General Dallaire testified before one of the Trial Chambers of this Tribunal about the events of 1994.  But he was -- as far as I know, he was never questioned about this particular meeting with President Habyarimana and yourself and Mr. Kabia.  I believe the substance of his testimony concerned the events of April 6th and thereafter.  

But in Dallaire's book, which I can concede is not sworn testimony, this is how he describes the meeting.  And I would like you to listen to what Dallaire says in his book and then comment.  I am referring to the last document in the bundle I distributed.  It is number 16.  I only have it in English.  And he's referring to the very meeting that we were talking about, Mr. Booh-Booh.  
And Dallaire says:  "Both the special representative of the Secretary General and I were rather taken aback when he" -- referring to Habyarimana -- "agreed to meet with us immediately.  
He greeted us on his sunny patio flanked by Enoch Ruhigira, Bizimana, the minister of defence, 
Major General Déogratias Nsabimana, the chief of staff of the army, and 
Major General Augustin Ndindiliyimana, the chief of staff of the gendarmerie.  Of the five men present, four were hardliners and Ndindiliyimana was an uncertainty.  I trusted none of them.  And we were about to hand over the best inside information that we had received to date.  

"Booh-Booh led off giving the president a detailed summary of our knowledge of his party's activities, including the distribution of illegal arms inside the Kigali weapons secured area as well as the MRND involvement with the Interahamwe and its attempts to subvert the Arusha Accords." 

Now, do you, Mr. Booh-Booh, agree with Dallaire that these four military officers were present when you met Habyarimana?  
A.	No, the generals were not at that meeting.  I remember Mr. Enoch who was mentioned, the 
	director of cabinet, who was always by the president.  And I must say that when I sought audience insisting on the urgency of that lead, it was very, very urgent.  Since the Secretary General had told us that we should do that as such and do that immediately, I was the one who booked the appointment.

I did not say on the telephone to Habyarimana what I was going to tell him, that which was in the telex from New York, so I cannot understand how he could flank himself with all his staff, his military staff.  

Meanwhile, the aim of my visit was not known to him for obvious reasons.  Well, I didn't tell him exactly why I was asking him to grant me audience very urgently.  Contrarily, I gave him information when we told him -- we went into greater detail exactly what we had been instructed to convey to him.  

When that was done, there and then he immediately called the members of his party -- called the leaders of his party and asked them to meet us. 
(Pages 41 to 47 by Melissa Hook)









1500H  
THE WITNESS (continued):
And we met the same day that afternoon.  The president received us in the morning, and immediately thereafter we met his collaborators of the party in the afternoon.   
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, thank you for that.  We'll rely on your evidence because you're here telling -- giving us sworn testimony, and I prefaced my question to you with the acknowledgement that this is something from Dallaire's book.  We don't know what he would say if he was here before the Court and testifying under oath, but I still wanted to hear from you whether you agreed with his characterisation.  So you've told us the military folks were not there.

Were you the one that was providing all of the information to Habyarimana?  Because that's what Dallaire says.
A.	I provided the information that was available in the telex, the telegram that I have before me, which is what I had been asked to do.  It was -- it had nothing to do with another telex or telegram.  I was being requested to warn. 
Q.	Thank you. Now, you keep insisting that the only thing Dallaire discussed with you was the arms caches, but it seems that what you were telling Habyarimana also included the activities or the misdeeds of the Interahamwe.  Because upon hearing whatever you had to say, he directs you to the leadership of the MRND who is in control of their youth wing, the Interahamwe.
A.	However, this allusion is indeed found in a telex that came from New York, and I was asked to inform them about the contents of that telex.  And so it is normal for me to inform them about the Interahamwe issue with respect to the distribution of weapons, the cache of weapons in the city.  However, I don't believe that I went to give any Interahamwe lesson to President Habyarimana who was an expert on the issue. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, thank you.  He directs you to -- or calls in your presence the MRND leadership, and then you go and see them.  Where did your meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera take place?
A.	If my recollection serves me right, it was at the UNAMIR. 
Q.	Which is the Amahoro hotel in Remera.
A.	Yes, indeed.  The UNAMIR headquarters. 
Q.	And you complained to them about training of Interahamwe, their control of the Interahamwe, the disruptive behaviour and crimes of the Interahamwe, weapons being distributed to them and hidden by them.  You discussed all of that with the MRND party leadership; right? 
A.	I no longer remember the exact terms, but the discussion had that tone even with the president.  It was a harsh and serious tone. 
Q.	And in particular, you complained about the behaviour of the Interahamwe on the 8th of January during the demonstrations that we talked about earlier this morning; right? 
A.	I no longer remember if that is linked to all these events.  It's likely, but I no longer remember.  These are things that happened in 1994. 
Q.	Let me have Mr. Issa hand this up to you.  This is a document that you looked at with Mr. Robinson.  It's P. 43.  And it's your code cable to Kofi Annan on the 13th of January in which he recounts your meeting with the president and then your meeting with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera.  And at paragraph 6, which is on the second page of that cable, in the middle of the paragraph, paragraph 6, you say, "We also protested the conduct of their party's militia during the demonstrations of the 8th of January."  
A.	So we talked about that.   
Q.	During that meeting did Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Joseph Nzirorera ever indicate to you that they could not control their party youth?
A.	Yes, indeed.  They alluded to rascals and people who could not be controlled and could have infiltrated the Interahamwe ranks.  In our opinion, that was not a valid excuse as it was a well-known fact that the Interahamwe were at the service of the MRND.  And the youth who were members said so themselves. 
Q.	So you knew that what Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera were saying was false when they were telling you that these were bandits and infiltrators.  You knew that the disruptions and the illegal activity and the circulation of arms -- those were all things that the Interahamwe were doing in the context of their being the youth wing of the MRND party.  You knew that from your own personal experience and observations; right? 
A.	We had that feeling from all the notes and studies that had been done at the mission, the UNAMIR.  And now and then we would forward that to New York, but these were recurrent issues.  As a matter of fact, we knew the MDR which had faced lots of problems with the Interahamwe during a meeting that that party had organised.  So we were informed and we had the general overview of the activities of those militia. 
Q.	Now, when you met with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, do you recall if any other MRND leader was present?  Was it only those two, or were there others? 
A.	I believe there was a third person, but I don't know his name, and I don't know what was his office within the president's MRND.  Was he the vice-president of the MRND?  Maybe, but I dare not be more specific. 
Q.	Do you recall if a Belgian officer by the name of Frank Claeys was in the room with you when you were having these conversations with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera?  You and Dallaire and Kabia.  Was there also a Belgian officer?  If you remember.  
A.	I don't remember specifically, but what I know is that Dallaire had an aide-de-camp who was, rather, Dutch.  He was his aide-de-camp.  And so he was, of course, a member of the UNAMIR.  And if he was with Dallaire at that time, then it is likely that he might have been in the room.   But to be candid, I don't remember. 
Q.	Well, I would suggest to you that Dallaire's aide-de-camp was a man by the name of Brent Beardsley who would have been English speaking, a Canadian who may also speak French.  And the person that I was asking about, Frank Claeys, is Belgian, and he would have spoken French or Flemish.

Now, we can't force you to remember, but having said that, could you shed more light if you think it's one or the other or neither that were in the room with you.  And let me say that I have no particular expectation of your response, Mr. Witness.  It's just information that I'm trying to gather.
A.	Allow me to say that the presence of a Belgian at a meeting such as that one would seem out of place.  It doesn't make sense.  If that person is not connected to General Dallaire, is not his aide-de-camp, this was not a matter which was of special interest, particular interest, to the Belgians.  And I told you earlier that when I received this telegram, I was instructed to inform western ambassadors, including the Belgian ambassador, about it. 
Q.	Let me tell you this:  Both Frank Claeys and Brent Beardsley were part of UNAMIR.  So they were officers with the UNAMIR peacekeeping mission.  But Claeys was with the Belgian contingent, and Brent Beardsley was with the Canadian contingent.  But the reason I'm asking you this is because Claeys has testified in this trial, and he testifies to there having been two meetings -- or apparently 
	two meetings with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera.   

So I wanted to hear what you had to say about that because there was a meeting on the 
12th of January which directly followed your meeting with President Habyarimana.  After you met with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera, there was another meeting between the informant and UNAMIR, and the informant told the UNAMIR personnel that he had just been contacted by Ngirumpatse.  So clearly there was communication between Ngirumpatse and the informant that same day, the 12th of January.

And what I'm trying to find out from you is whether you were aware of a second meeting with Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera the following day, again at the Amahoro headquarters, after Dallaire had had confirmation of a weapons cache that same night, the 12th of January.   

Do you follow my question, Mr. Witness?  Or I can repeat it and simplify it if you haven't quite followed me.
A.	I can answer you as follows:  I wasn't formally informed about a meeting that allegedly held -- was held with the informant and the president and the secretary general of the MRND.  I was not aware of that meeting.   

However, I recall that as early as the following day General Dallaire doubtlessly told me that while we were attending the first meeting, if I can describe it as such, the one I attended -- so that while we were at that meeting, the MRND leaders had given instructions for the displacement of the place where the weapons were cached.   

That is the information General Dallaire told me, that while we were discussing with the leaders of the presidential party, instructions had been given by these people for the place where the weapons were found to be changed.    
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh.  Do you recall receiving a letter from the national committee of the Interahamwe on the 19th of January 1994?
A.	I don't remember.  Habitually the letters that were sent to UNAMIR were received by the executive director.  He was the one who received all correspondence and who knew what to do with the letters meant for me, especially with respect to political matters.  So a letter such as that one may have been received at the UNAMIR without reaching me. 
Q.	In any case, I'll ask Mr. Issa to hand this up to you.   This is P. 13.  It's the letter dated the 
	19th of January 1994 signed by the 11 members of the Interahamwe national committee.  And you can look at it and tell us if you recall seeing that document before.  If you haven't, it's not a problem.  We'll go on to something else.

But you will agree with me by reading it you see that it's addressed to you and this national committee of the Interahamwe are trying to speak directly to you complaining about how they were being blamed, wrongly blamed, according to them, for the demonstrations that you observed on the 8th of January.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I did not receive this letter, but maybe I had a resume of it, but I didn't read it as such.  Often the executive director would have a précis of a paragraph or two of a letter which he had received.  But from what I see, you can clearly see that it wasn't a love story between Interahamwe and UNAMIR as on several occasions they had requested that we should leave Rwanda.   

And on that famous 8th of January, they attacked me personally claiming that I had come to Kigali to ensure that Habyarimana was overthrown.  And I met some of the members of the MRND executive who stated to me that they had asked their militia to send me a letter asking for forgiveness for everything that they had talked about me 

So I don't know if this is the letter that they sent to me or if it is something else.  Irrespective, the fact is that I didn't see any such letter in its entirety. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We'll go on to another document.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness.  It's document number 5 as written in a little circle in the lower left-hand corner of my bundle.  It's already in evidence as P. 49.  It's a document in French.  I don't have an English translation.  

And, Your Honours, this is a document that we're also going to have to look at again at another time because only one page, only the first page, was scanned by CMS, but the document consists of 
four pages, but we can address that afterwards.   
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Booh-Booh, if you just skim the contents of this document, my question to you is:  Have you ever seen this document before, or did you become aware of any of the information that is contained in this document back during the period January, February, March of 1994?  The document is from a Captain Deme to the force commander.  It concerns -- and I'll read in French -- "The report on the subversive activities".  
A.	I often received documents sent from that MIO cell which was dependent on the force commander.  I also received documents on studies which the force commander's collaborators made.  Now, did I receive this document in particular?  That is likely, but I, off the cuff, can't remember it as presented to me here. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you for that.  On the first page, which covers paragraphs 1 through 4, it's giving some background information about the distribution of arms in the country starting in March of 1993, and it goes on to talk about November 1993.  But when we get to page 2, paragraph 5 at the top, there's a statement -- and I'll read it in French -- "The relationship between the RPF and, more specifically, the Presidential Guard or the MRND with respect to support is doubtless.  MRND has many weapons and arms its members.   

"Hence we know with certainty that the headquarters of the MRND, the building of which belongs to the army chief of staff of the gendarmerie, is where weapons are found, about 50 AK-47 guns -- four -- and G3 weapons as well as ammunition which are sealed.  Four other areas have turned out to be areas where MRND weapons caches are found with, on the whole, hundreds, several hundreds, of them."

And again I'll read in French, "In December was the effective confirmation of the training of Interahamwe.  North of the Kanombe airport was the first place for assembly and nightly training."

And then down to paragraph 9, it says -- and again I'll read in French -- "In all the uprisings the Interahamwe were identified with or without their uniforms.  The example -- the most salient example 
is -- doubtless -- is the manifestation demonstration of the 8th of January for the CND.  The deployment of the militia was a test with a concrete case.  It was proven that they were supervised by the Presidential Guard."

You've already told us that the information you got about the Interahamwe and training and arms caches and so on and so forth didn't come exclusively from Jean-Pierre.  So now I'm asking you about this memo dated the 13th of February from Captain Deme, the 13th of February 1994.
Would you have any reason to dispute or to question the information that Captain Deme is providing to the force commander about his observations on the ground or his investigations on the ground in relation to the distribution of arms and Interahamwe training and Interahamwe activity?
A.	I have the feeling that this intelligence was well done.  And allow me to state that I had been informed that the MRND was indeed in a building that belonged to the gendarmerie army chief headquarters and that that building may have had weapons in them.

I remembered this particular detail which had been reported to me.  I can't remember whether it was by the force commander or it was the executive director of the UNAMIR.  I no longer quite recall.  But this reference to the gendarmerie headquarters I remember.  That is in paragraph 5.
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Booh-Booh.   
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I see the time.  We have a few minutes to go before 3:30, but the next line of questioning is going to take us directly to the 6th of April.  I've basically finished with my enquiry about the beginning of 1994.  I had hoped to finish today, but that's clearly not the case.  I think it wouldn't take me more than 40 minutes to an hour, if that much, tomorrow morning.  So my suggestion is that we adjourn today, and I'll finish up tomorrow morning.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  We take the adjournment now.   
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
