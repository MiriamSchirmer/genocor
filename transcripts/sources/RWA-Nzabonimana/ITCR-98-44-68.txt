MR. PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are called to order.  Would the registry introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber this morning, please?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.

Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 22nd of April 2003, for the continuation of the Defence case when Prosecution counsel, Ms. Ojemeni, will continue with the cross-examination of the Accused, Juvénal Kajelijeli, in the matter of the Prosecutor v Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case Number ICTR-98-44A-T  Thank You, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the Registrar.  

May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with the Prosecution.
MS. OJEMENI:
May it please Your Honours, Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney.  I appear with Dorothy Marotine for the Prosecution.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel.  

May we have the appearance of the Defence, for the record, please.
MR. HINDS:
Good morning, Your Honour, Lennox Hinds representing Kajelijeli assisted by Professor Bompaka; and Juliette Chinaud, as researcher; with Emilien Dusabe as translator.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, learned counsel. 

Yes.  Kajelijeli, the Accused, testifying on your behalf, the Trial Chamber would like to remind you of the solemn declaration you made on Monday, the 14th of April 2003, and that you will continue with your testimony today on that same solemn declaration.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have got a big problem.  I talked about it last time.  It concerns some problems of my health since the beginning of this session.  I would like to -- I wish to continue with you so that your programme is not upset, but I'm not feeling well.  I'm trying to fulfil the commitment for this session, but I'm not feeling well at all.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm told you have been seeing a doctor this morning, is that correct?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
It's correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, we'll go, but if you think you can't continue, you can apprise the Trial Chamber of any problem that you may see or in the course of your testimony today, all right?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
We can continue.  At times I have difficulty in breathing and my heart races, but we can continue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  So you can always advise the Trial Chamber as we go along, that's the most we can say.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Good morning, Your Honours.  I have not spoken to Mr. Kajelijeli, and I just -- I saw Dr. Abbe when she was here, but I don't know what her findings were.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we're --
MR. HINDS:
She came in and then she left.  I assumed that everything was all right.  I'm kind of surprised to hear him saying what he's saying.  So I'm just a little concerned what the diagnosis was, if anything.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right, that's what we are also trying to find out when we called the registry.  We understand the registry doctor has been around here to see the Accused.
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, indeed, My Lord.  I had sent someone to call to a doctor, she arrived and she attended to the Accused, and a few minutes before I came to call the Judges I saw her and she said okay, she has attended to the Accused and he is okay, he can continue.  So that's all I can say, My Lord.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As we said, if there is anything that needs attention or anything in course of the testimony the Accused, who is testifying in his own behalf, can apprise the Chamber accordingly.  

Can you start your cross-examination, Counsel?  

Maybe in order to be able to move forward quickly, as quickly as possible, so that we can come to the end of the testimony as soon as it is practicable maybe, Kajelijeli, Accused, listen carefully to the questions, answer them in precise terms as you like to answer them so that we save time and we are able to move forward to the end of your testimony; without, of course, losing sight of whatever you want to explain.  But if you are precise, short, to the point that you want to make, that might help things.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
JUVENAL KAJELIJELI,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we are still on the 8th of April.  Could you tell the Court what happened to the bodies of the Tutsis that were killed in Mukingo commune, particularly at the nuns convent in Busogo, Rwankeri, and Busogo hill, the Tutsis who were killed on the 7th of April 1994?
A.	Thank you, madam the Prosecutor.  On the 8th of April I arrived at the Mukingo commune office after midday.  About a quarter to one, about one o'clock, I met the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  He informed me that he had just organised a burial for the people you are talking about.  He told me about Rwankeri, that there were about -- Tutsis killed in Rwankeri, killed at the convent of Busogo parish, and he had arranged the burial for these Tutsis.  That's all I know, and the rest is what I learnt from writings concerning the number of Tutsis killed at the nuns' convent.  Thank you.
Q.	Where were these bodies buried in Mukingo commune?
A.	You might know better, you went there.  But, according to what the bourgmestre told me, there was a burial at Rwankeri where the Tutsis were living, and, for the people killed at the convent, bodies were buried at Munyemvano's house.  That's all I know.  Thank you.
Q.	Did you ever visit these mass graves?  Did you ever visit the grave at Munyemvano's house and the one at Rwankeri on that day of 8th?
A.	No, I didn't have enough time to allow me to do that.  We were in such a difficult times that it wasn't easy to pay such a visit.  But in Rwanda, apart from a requiem mass, it's the custom, apart from the requiem mass, there is no such custom as going to visit burial grounds.  It is not part of the Rwandese tradition; and in fact, when people see you approaching a graveyard they might suspect you of some funny things.  But normally it's not banned, it's not prohibited; you can check it out.  People do not go to the grave site of a dead person.  Thank you.
Q.	Are you saying that you were not at the Mukingo communal office in the morning of 8th April 1994 to instruct the bourgmestre, Harerimana, to go and bury those bodies?
A.	I deny that, and I have -- there have been witnesses that testified to that effect, that among the witnesses was a staff member of the commune who knows when I came.  Besides, it's not usual for an ordinary citizen to give orders to the bourgmestre.  This is not feasible.  Apart from the witness that came to testify in my favour, and even one of your witnesses said that the bourgmestre arranged the burial in the morning.  You can check this out in GDQ.  GDQ said it, and this is about ten o'clock the bourgmestre was arranging the burial, ten o'clock in the morning.
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you were not an ordinary person in Mukingo in April 1994, you were former bourgmestre of that commune.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  I don't know if she's arguing with the witness or asking him a question.
MS. OJEMENI:
Of course I am asking him a question.
MR. HINDS:
Objection as to form, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the witness can answer that question briefly, as put.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I have not understood the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you referred to yourself as an ordinary person in April, on the 8th of April 1994, and I'm reminding you that you were a former bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, so you cannot consider yourself an ordinary person in Mukingo commune.
MR. HINDS:
Objection as to form.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can answer that question.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Up to now the question is not precise.  Let her repeat the question again.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the witness understands my question.  I would like him to answer this question, unless Your Honour advises me to proceed without getting a response.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, the witness said he doesn't understand the question, and it's a statement, not a question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you put back this question?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you were a former bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in April of 1994, weren't you?
A.	Tis not true.
Q.	Did you ever hold office as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune before April 1994?
A.	I was bourgmestre until 1993 in February.
Q.	So the answer to my question is yes, isn't it, that you were, indeed, a former bourgmestre in April 1994?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	By virtue of that position as the former bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, would you consider yourself an ordinary person in Mukingo commune in April 1994?
A.	I was an ordinary citizen who followed orders and instructions given by the administration from the responsable of the cellule, the conseiller of the secteur and the bourgmestre of the commune.  I respected all these people.  I didn't have any position to put me above those people.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Next question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	So, in that position as an ordinary person in Mukingo commune April 1994, if the bourgmestre or the responsable request you to attend a meeting to look into the affairs of the commune, would you attend?
A.	Anyone with high morality is supposed to come to a meeting whenever there are such instructions given by the administration.  I could have come if I had been invited, and I would have come as any ordinary citizen.
Q.	So, indeed, you did not go out of public eye during that period of April 1994.  You remained a loyal citizen and attended to all your civic duties, including attending meetings in the commune; is that correct?
A.	The communal meetings had -- there is a distinction between different communal meetings.  I could not attend some meetings that were meant for conseiller or for other organs of the commune; ordinary citizens could not attend such meetings.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, on the 8th of April you went to Mukingo commune in the morning with seven Interahamwes and Baheza to see the bourgmestre, didn't you?
A.	I give you reference from your own witness who stated that the bourgmestre was not even there, he was arranging burial of the dead Tutsis.  I did not go with Baheza, and I did not even meet Baheza that day.
Q.	You accompanied the bourgmestre to inspect the various massacre sites together with the communal policemen, didn't you; we are still referring to the 8th of April.
A.	I have denied that.  That morning I was at my home in Nkuli.
Q.	Witness, according to your testimony, you stated that Rachel was not in Mukingo commune on the 8th of April 1994; is that correct?
A.	I have not understood your question.
Q.	Witness, according to your testimony you stated that Rachel was not in Mukingo commune since 1992, that you signed her travel papers to Kigali for medical treatment; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	It is fair, then, for me to say that on the 8th of April, according to your testimony, Rachel was not in Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	Why did you sign her travel papers to Kigali, which is within Rwanda?  Why did you have to sign her travel document?
A.	What is the question, please?
Q.	Why did you sign Rachel's travel document in 1992 to Kigali, which is within Rwanda?  Why did you have to sign the travel document?
A.	At that time there was a war going on.  Any citizen who wanted to travel was given a laisser-passer, a travel document, given by the communal authorities, so that where the person is going that person may receive a permanent resident's permit.  That person was going for treatment and did not know when this would be over.  It was, therefore, necessary to give her the paper to have right of residence in Kigali.  That was during the war.
Q.	So, in effect, you monitored the movement of all the inhabitants of Mukingo commune when you were in office as bourgmestre of the commune; is that correct?
A.	It is not correct.
Q.	During the war, as you've stated, in 1992, you monitored the movements of all the inhabitants who were going in and out of the commune; didn't you?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	When those you signed the laisser-passer come back to the commune, do they report back to you?
A.	It was not necessary.
Q.	So Rachel could have come back without you knowing; is that correct?
A.	It was possible, but in her case where she lived, as I said in my evidence, she was a neighbour with people.  I told you she was renting a place.  The person who came to give -- to collect the rent was Gregory, who had daughter Jean.  She was a friend, she was a kind of relative.  I would have known when she comes back.  It was by the roadside.  I would have known, in any case, and your own witness stated that Rachel died in Belgium.  It's not me who told your witness to state that, and I don't know why you are dwelling on this issue.  Your ************************* (phonetic) stated this, and it's even in the time that I talked about.
Q.	Witness, why did you then go to Rachel's house to look for her on the 8th of April 1994, if you knew she was not back?
A.	It is you who is saying that.  You have no evidence about that. 

You have no proof.  Your witness who came here, was contradicted by another witness.  In the file that I referred to, it was stated that Rachel's house was destroyed on 7th of April, and the people who destroyed this house are being tried for it.  I don't know why you are pursuing Kajelijeli on this matter.  There is no proof about what you are stating.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kajelijeli, just answer the question to the Chamber.  Don't get involved in any debate with the witness (sic). 

Answer the question the way you want to answer them, but they are addressed to the Trial Chamber.  These counsel, Prosecution and the Defence, ask questions on behalf of the Trial Chamber and the answers are supposed to be given and should be given to the Trial Chamber.  You should bear that in mind.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	The Interahamwe destroyed Rachel's house on the 7th of April; isn't it?
A.	I don't know whether it was Interahamwe who did this.  I understand there were internal displaced persons from five different communes, and those displaced persons had a role, thank you, had a role in the massacre of Tutsis, especially that they were revenging since they had been displaced by the RPF, which had kept them from their own native communes, and their people had died.  And, after learning the news that the president and his colleagues had been killed by Tutsis, they took vengeance and started destroying houses belonging to Tutsis.  I'm not aware whether these were Interahamwes, but people say it might have been the internal displaced persons who had a big role to play in the massacre that took place in that area.
Q.	Witness, you said you had proof as to the people who destroyed Rachel's house on the 7th of April 1994.  Who are these people, and what are their names?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to repeat and give a reference.  There are 31 people accused.  There's so many names and I can't recall them all, but many of them have come here, some have accepted their crime; others are still undergoing trial.  You have the names.  I gave you the references in that file.  Among the 31 people who are accused, 31 people, okay, accused, you can find -- you can read this, I think.  You can even order for that file.  It is a file that can disculpate (sic) me, that can help clear me.  But there is a lot of evidence in that file.  I can't recall all the names, but many of the people involved have appeared here as witnesses, Mr. President.
Q.	Can you mention the names of the people you remember?
A.	One is the ***************************************************************
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry?  Go on.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
There is Gato and other bandits, including Musafiri, they are in that file.  You know the number of that file, and that should enable you to tell you people implicated in that dirty work.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Michel Gato, Musafiri are citizens of Mukingo commune, aren't they?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	How can you then qualify them as displaced persons?
A.	You asked me -- you asked me about such names that I know.  Since you know the number of the file and knowing the names, those people, they can denounce others, they can give other names, but previously that was said that was mainly the internal displaced persons who destroyed homes, because they were carrying out revenge.  But about these people of the Mukingo commune, these are a few names I came to know, and some of these have even accepted, confessed to it, actually.
Q.	This is one of your fabricated lies.  You ordered those people to destroy Rachel's house on the 7th of April; isn't that correct?
A.	What you're saying -- Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying is not true when she refers to my lies.  I've given written evidence.  I'm talking about files where these people involved are mentioned.  Do you think the officer of the Directorate of Public Prosecution has got this file?  Do you think that was a fabricated story in that file?  I believe that it's not a fabrication, because some of the people I've mentioned have actually confessed to those offences.  It's not, therefore, lies.  What I state is not lies, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, according to your testimony, on the 8th of April you were still insecure because of the threats to your life by the RPF; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	In spite of your insecurity you still found time to search for the Tutsis survivors and instructed Interahamwes, including Rukundo, to go to Musumba in Nkuli commune to kill the Tutsis who had survived in that cellule; isn't that correct?
A.	Mr. President, what she has just said is sheer lies.  It is a misrepresentation of facts before this Chamber.  Rukundo was a witness whom she freed from prison on 25th of March this year just before this session started.  She (sic) was allowed to be released so that he can come over and help to give evidence against Kajelijeli.  The person speaking on the radio -- and this is what I'm stating -- that the evidence I'm giving is from some of the testimony given by her own witness.  Rukundo was a kind of delinquent.  He did a lot of evil things, and he can destroy your case.  She (sic) is known as a terrible criminal.  When he claims that I sent him on the 8th of April, the Prosecutor is actually contradicting herself.  She is saying that I was at Rachel's place, that I was with the bourgmestre, and now she's talking about me getting involved with Musumba.  When Rukundo comes over I hope you will give me a chance to testify to prove that Rukundo was never a good person, considering where he started, how he was expelled from school, how he went to commit offences among Tutsis.  I have names of these Tutsis.  I think the Prosecutor should be prudent.  I have a lot of Tutsis friends, very important Tutsis friends.  She should go slow.  I never met Rukundo, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As I told you before, that we have heard some of the information.  Please answer the question precisely and to the point that you want to make.  If it calls for no or yes, if it calls for the explanation, be very brief.  

Number two, you are addressing that Trial Chamber not the Prosecutor.  Issues of interpretation of the evidence that has been given here will be done by your counsel, as well.  You can make reference to but you don't get into argument.  Please, we would like to hear what you have to say on the issues being raised directly.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
(Uninterpreted)
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I again rise because I think I have to say this.  Mr. Kajelijeli is being accused.  He's being accused.  The accusations that are being put to him -- they are not just simple questions being asked, do you know so and so, how do you know that person.  He's being accused.  It is unfair to say to him, when he is accused of committing certain crimes, for him not to say not only is it untrue, but in fact to express very clearly why he is saying it is untrue.  Now, he says it in his way as a witness.  He isn't saying it as I may say it or you may say it or the Prosecutor may say it.  But it is unfair to allow the Prosecutor not just to pose questions, but I guess it's a practice here, to make accusations to the Accused and then restrict him in his answers.  He has been addressing the Court in the best way that he knows how, but he is also refuting the allegations in the way that he must, in his own way. 

You cannot just restrict him of saying yes or no when the accusations are being made in the way that they are being made, and this is the ruling of this Chamber that that is proper.  We can't, on the one hand, have the Prosecutor make these kinds of allegations to him, mentioning names of people, saying that he was involved with certain individuals, etcetera, and just say to the witness answer yes or no.  I mean, it is unfair.  If you are asking her to -- allowing her to ask questions, do you know such-and-such a person, that's one thing, but we are dealing now with specific accusations, and she's making them over and over again.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my learned friend should --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, Counsel.  

Counsel, if you listened as an officer of the court, this Trial Chamber has not given that kind of instruction, that one should answer yes or no.  We are saying that he can answer briefly.  One doesn't have to go over and repeat whatever has been said.  If Rukundo is addressed, he's entitled to say whatever he has to say on that.  You know this Trial Chamber has not done that.  We carefully want to hear the witness.  We carefully want to hear what is being said.  We carefully want to hear what he has to answer, what has been addressed to him, because it is important he give his answer and we understand his answer.  And where it is necessary, we shall call upon him to explain.  The answer the witness is giving is the answers that are going to be the subject of consideration.  It is extremely important.  And where answers are not answered, we would like to know why, and we take note of that.  We certainly would not limit.  

If you have seen, Mr. Hinds, we have given a lot up because we want to know.  We have not stopped him before we know exactly what he wants to say because we want to understand what issues are being addressed.  Before we say, "Don't do that," we want to hear him.  This is his opportunity, and I hope the witness will take advantage of that, deal with the best issues that are supposed to be answered as we are raising questions.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, please, the witness should be reminded that the Prosecutor is not on trial, he is the one on trial.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and we have said that the Prosecutor is like another counsel, raises questions to the Trial Chamber, on behalf of the Trial Chamber to a witness, and in this case to the Accused person.  The questions (sic) are directed to the Trial Chamber.  We'll move faster that way.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That's correct, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	According to your testimony, you heard about the death of Harerimana, your successor, on the radio on the 9th of April 1994; isn't that correct?
A.	It was around six, yes, that's correct.
Q.	But you were aware that Harerimana died on the 8th of April in his office shortly after he came back from inspecting the massacre site with you and sharing a beer with you as well; am I correct?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	You also testified that before you left your house on the 9th of April, that you did not know anything about his burial arrangement; rather, you were going to the Mukingo communal office to find out what the arrangements were.  Is that correct?
A.	When I left my home my purpose was to go and be with others and to know what had really happened, this sad event that had taken place.
Q.	When you got there, as early as nine o'clock, all the arrangements for the burial had been done by his friends and the authorities, as you testified; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And you just tagged along as an ordinary citizen to witness the burial of your successor that you later preceded; is that correct -- sorry, you later took over from?
A.	Let us first look at the burial.  Could you first look at the burial, the ceremonies?  I did not come as an ordinary citizen, I came as a friend, rather, because there was no conflict between us.  So I came to attend the burial as a friend, to deal with his family in these sad moments, to bury him.  So I did not come as an ordinary observer.  I took part in all these burial ceremonies, be it the father, the priest who was conducting the mass and other burial ceremonies.  So, calling me an ordinary citizen, yes, that is true, but as far as the burial ceremonies were concerned, we were doing this as relatives, as friends, to be with the family who was bereaving a member.
Q.	So, you were, indeed, saddened by his sudden death, weren't you?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	But you retired later to your house to watch video with your family in the midst of this sadness; isn't it?
A.	That is -- what you are saying is not correct.  I requested the president -- you remember that when this was being asked -- this question was being put to me, the state I was in was not normal.  The people were asking me questions.  I did not have interpreters, but here I explained that I started the burial ceremony with others, and I feel when we were interrupted by bombs that were falling on the communal office -- and then we came back later on and concluded the burial ceremony.  That's what happened, Mr. President.
Q.	Witness, I'm referring to your testimony in this course, that's what I'm referring to.  You have testified that you retired later that day on the 9th to your home and you watched video with your family didn't you?
A.	What you are saying happened after the burial had taken place at night.  We had already gone home.  But these activities were not carried out at the same time. 

Another thing, Your Honour, I would like to request to say something about this word, this issue that the Prosecutor has been talking about.  I brought this video.  This video shows the observance of the Rwandese people in general and the observance of the Rwandan people, and I brought this video so that you can view it, so the Prosecutor should know what I was viewing.  This was not very a happy family video.  If you have time, you can view this video so that the Prosecutor can know what type of video I was viewing at that time.  Thank you, Your Honour.
Q.	Witness, you viewed this video with your family, didn't you?
A.	That's is not correct.  It was not with my family, it was the children, and I was there following the news, and I was also following it.  And if you have time also, you can watch it because I have it here with me.
Q.	Your children, are they not part of your family?
A.	That is correct.  I want to say much on this.
Q.	Witness, you were not touched or you did not feel sad with the death of Harerimana, were you?
A.	Your Honour, the words what the Prosecutor is giving to me, speaking to me, make me feel sad and this affects me and makes me feel bad.  I was very saddened by his death.  He was a person who, before he became bourgmestre, he was teaching at a school, the St. Joseph school, and he really liked children.  We liked his conduct, the way he was conducting himself.  I was very sad, not only because of his death, even others, the préfet and the president had died during those periods, that time, nothing can make me happy or sad.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, the following -- on the 10th you testified that you were saddened by your -- by the death of your in-law, and you qualified that situation as a bad omen; didn't you?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	Witness, what is not correct?  Is it the fact I used the word "bad omen" or the fact that I stated you were saddened by the death of your in-law?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  The words that I said are not the ones the Prosecutor is using.  I didn't lose any in-law, rather what is not (sic) true is that no in-law of mine died.  And then again, I never used the words "bad omen", but I just said sad events.  The person who died was my wife's uncle who was killed along with his family in Rugomero in Gisenyi, and even his uncle's family died, who was once a bourgmestre of Nkuli, Gasamunyiga, Stanislas.  So I said that this was sad event for my family.  And then I also, when I include the Tutsis who had been killed then and with whom we had relations, relations, good relationships, I said in general that was the sad events that had taken place.  That's how I put it.
Q.	Did the death of your wife's uncle, the death of your in-law?
THE INTERPRETER:
Could you repeat the question, Counsel?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I'm asking, the death of your wife's uncle, is it not the same as the death of your in-law?
A.	Those words do not mean the same, even someone -- if I said my wife's uncle and my brother in-law, "in-law" is not the same.  The interpreter should maybe explain this to you.  I have a brother-in-law, then I have my wife's uncle.  On the contrary, my wife's uncle I can call my wife's uncle, my own uncle, but I cannot say he is my in-law.  This is not how relationships are explained in Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It could be a difference of language, Counsel.  Do you want to follow that up?  We understand from his evidence he talked about his wife's uncle.  I think later in the course of the evidence this could be corrected, perhaps, going down to maternal uncle; is that right?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, my question is simply referring to his uncle in-law as his in-law.  Is there anything wrong with that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.
MS. OJEMENI:
In Rwanda there is a difference when you use the word in-law.  Could he then explain?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you then explain, Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you think it is important, follow it up.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, it's a simple question I'm asking, Your Honour.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, let me just put this on the record; I'm objecting as to form.  The witness said he did not use those words.  That's exactly what he says.  The Prosecutor is asking him, "Didn't you say this?"  He says, "No, I didn't say that.  This is what I said."  Now she's pursuing whether his wife's uncle is not the same as an in-law.  That's -- and he has already answered that.  I don't know what we are pursuing.  Again, if the witness had made a previous statement, which he is denying now, she should confront him with that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm cross-examining, and I know what I'm looking for, and I'm entitled to this question.
MR. HINDS:
I'm objecting.  Cross-examination is not just asking any question you feel like.  I'm objecting as to form.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm seeking clarification on my answer -- on my question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you think it is important, Counsel, because we know what he was talking about in his evidence, about the death of that person.  We know what he has just said.  So, unless you want to standardise the matter, but I think you know what he is talking about as to the person who died.  Maybe you could move on to the issues that you want to raise with regard to that aspect.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I asked him that for the Court so it will help the Court understand the culture of Rwanda.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't see how material it is.  Can you address the issues that you want to address with regard to that aspect, if you have any?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, isn't it a fact that a former bourgmestre of Mukingo commune lost his successor and retired home to watch video with his family?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That has been answered, Counsel.  We have taken note of the answer given on this matter, so you can go on to with the next question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, doesn't your lackadaisical attitude over the death --
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, again as to form.  Just not any question can be put.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that's a different issue, if her question has been asked and answered that's the point, but we are not going to deal with -- she has the right to cross-examine.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In any case, the question has not been completed.  She may have far to go.
MR. HINDS:
Let me put on the record my objection.  I'm objecting to the term lackadaisical.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should wait, Counsel, to have a complete record of what you want to object to.  She's in mid-sentence.  How do you develop your objection?  How do you help her as an officer of the court?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, doesn't your lackadaisical attitude over the death of Harerimana and the Tutsi population in Mukingo commune demonstrate your involvement in their death?
MR. HINDS:
Can I object?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, the basis of my objection is as to form.  It's an improper question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What?
MR. HINDS:
How can she ask the witness about his lackadaisical attitude?  That's an improper question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, he can answer that question as put.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You understand.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I've understood the question, Your Honour.  The Prosecutor is not really --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just answer to the Trial Chamber.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
What the Prosecutor is saying is not correct.  It is not correct.  And the issue-  if you allow me, I can tell you why it is not correct, why I am saying it is not correct.  What she is saying, she is trying to mislead the Chamber because she's aware the bourgmestre was killed, was announced over the radio, and all the people came to be with the family.  And even the way the Tutsis were killed has been followed and the people who killed them are being pursued, and even the file case, I told you, explains all this and it also shows that what the Prosecutor came to say before the Chamber is not in line with the crimes.  The people committing these crimes are being pursued in Rwandan courts. 

Another thing, Your Honour, this is something called gacaca that is being pursued and it is oppression now and the reports are made and they are read over the radio.  Nowhere will you find Kajelijeli being said.  So what the Prosecutor is saying, she is misleading the Court because she has imprisoned me for more than six years for nothing.  The evidence she is trying to bring before the Chamber is false and fabricated.  So what she is saying is not correct because the way these people were killed is known and it is recorded.  She cannot just explain why she has imprisoned me for six years here without any proof, any evidence.  I was arrested just like a bandit.  I can prove that I was arrested for nothing, and the file is there.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Again, answer the question, don't answer the Prosecutor.  And the Prosecutor is not giving evidence here.  I think you understand that.  If you have an explanation, give your version.  The Prosecutor, like your Defence counsel, is doing her duty.  Take note of that.  I think you are in a position to understand that.  We'd like not to repeat these instructions again.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the witness has not answered my question.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think the witness has answered.  He said it's not true, and he's gone on, again, because I think once you deal with accusations -- I have to say once we deal with accusations, he is going to respond in the way that he only knows how to.  If someone accuses you of killing someone and you then respond and --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we have heard you, please, on this matter.  We give instruction, and if you have a valid point to make on this matter, we'll hear you. 

The witness has answered.  He said in his long answer that it is not true with regard to the elements dealing with the bourgmestre as well as the Tutsi, which was part and parcel of the last question put to him.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, did the witness use the word "it is not true" in reference to his answer?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did you conduct an autopsy in respect of Harerimana's death when you took over as bourgmestre?
A.	Your Honour, I would like to answer this question, but I would also like to make some comments, if you allow me.  The circumstances in which we were on the 8th, bombs were falling in Mukingo commune from Kinigi direction.  This was over a period of minutes.  Many witnesses have testified to this.  On the 9th, after hearing this, we went to be with the bereaved family in order to see how we could bury the late.  At that time the war was serious, was raging.  Bombs at the time interrupted the burial ceremony, and we resumed it later on.  In Ruhengeri, Ruhengeri was also being shelled.  The prosecution witnesses said that it would not have been possible because of the war situation, knowing -- carrying out an autopsy to know what had killed him.  We could not carry out an autopsy because of the war, that could not allow people to take the body to Ruhengeri in order to carry out the autopsy.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I'm referring to your response referring to "we", and I'm asking about when you took over, not when he died, whether you conducted an autopsy.  You can answer me with yes or no.
A.	I would like to request the President to allow me to answer the question but also make a comment at the same time.  No, the comment I'm making is that after being sworn in on the 2nd of June 1994, we were not able -- we did not have time nor the experts to remove the body from the tomb and to carry out an autopsy.  And apart from developed countries, it is -- it requires a lot of expertise to know what killed a person.  So I'd like to tell you that what the Prosecutor is saying, it does not facilitate a reconciliation for the Rwandan people.  Rather, what she is saying is going to create conflict among Rwandans because all Rwandans are brothers and sisters; we intermarry.  But if people here say that -- hear that I play the role in the bourgmestre's there, then she is creating conflicts between our families, my own family and the family of the late bourgmestre.  So I think, Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
The answer is no for the reasons that you have given.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Yes, the answer is no.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you did not consider it necessary to do so when you took over, did you?
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he's answered that question.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, according to your testimony, on the 10th you were at home, you went nowhere; is that correct?
A.	What you have said is correct.
Q.	But you were in Susa, in Mukingo commune, and also in Kinigi commune searching for Tutsi survivors to kill with your Interahamwe; isn't that correct?
A.	That's not correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is on the 10th?
MS. OJEMENI:
On the 10th of April, yeah.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	And you witnessed -- you found Tutsi women in the bush in Susa, and you witnessed their being raped by your Interahamwe, as per your orders; isn't that correct?
A.	Your Honour, allow me to answer this question but, at the same time, make a comment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can answer your question.  If it is no, we would like to hear what is the no; and if you have an explanation to give, it should be brief.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That's not correct.  I never left my home on the 10th.  I never left my home in Nkuli to go to Kinigi at a place called Susa.  So what you have said is not correct.  What you said is not correct, especially because, Mr. President, you followed among the witnesses that came to testify in my favour. There were some who came to say that this Kinigi area was under RPF control.  So what the Prosecutor is saying, attributing to me, could not be possible because of the war that was taking place in that area, and especially because I could not do this.  So it is not correct.  Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you enjoy watching Tutsi women being raped, isn't it correct?
A.	That's not correct.
Q.	One of the witnesses accused you of being present when they were raped?
A.	I would like to answer this question and also make a comment, Your Honour.  Mr. President, what the Prosecutor has just said is not correct.  What she is talking about, of the rapes, this was fabricated by a session call Ibuca  and evega that gives instructions to all Tutsis people who never played a role on the warfront to come and testify against the ten people accused in Arusha, and they prepare text and they give these text to these women, so they can come to testify against the accused.  Because they did not play a role in the war, so this is their war contribution, by coming to testify against Hutus here in Arusha.  

But, again, you find that there is proof, there is evidence to contradict the evidence.  There are many examples.  If you allow me, I'll give the examples concerning from Ibuca and evega how they fabricate so they can contribute to the war through which RPF took over the country and because they never contributed during this war.  Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you testified that during this period of turbulence in Rwanda, in particular April 1994, that you listened to the radio a lot.  Am I correct?  
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And you listened to RTLM, didn't you?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	Which radio station were you listening to, any particular or various stations, during this period?
A.	Yes, that's correct.
Q.	What's correct?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Did you understand the question?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
She's asking me -- she pointed out that I was listening to Radio RTLM, and I said no, but I said I listened to other various radio stations.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You listened to other various stations, including RTLM; is that correct? 
A.	I did not listen to RTLM.
Q.	Which radio station did you listen to, then?
A.	There was Radio Rwanda, there was Radio Muhabura, and Radio France International.
Q.	Why did you not listen to RTLM, which was common during that period?
A.	Thank you, Your Honour. 

The reason why I was not listening to RTLM was because where I was staying.  I was living in a shadow of many hills, and the Prosecutor arrived at the place, at Nkuli commune.   When you arrive there, Mr. President, that place is in a low place and it is shadowed by hills, and it is those on the top of the hills who could listen, who could receive Radio RTLM.  That is the real state of affairs.
Q.	You are telling this Court that your area, in Nkuli, never received RTLM, is that correct, in April 1994?
A.	Whatever the case, it may depend on the radios because some radios are more powerful.  For me, I was using Mirror, a local radio.  Maybe others who had Grundig or Sony, these different radios have different power to receive.  Another thing is that I would listen to these radios and get the most important news, pieces of news that I was interested in.
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you listened to RTLM and you heard RTLM ordering the Interahamwe to search for Tutsis and rape them, and all through they promoted gang rape by Interahamwe in April 1994, didn't you?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  Objection as to form.  These are new elements that I'm now hearing for the first time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which ones?
MR. HINDS:
The allegations that are being made.  They are new elements that are now being introduced into this case.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it is not a new element.  My learned friend is aware of the testimony of GDF, so it's not a new element in any way, and many other witnesses also testified to such acts.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, there are no allegations, so far, except what we are hearing now, concerning Radio RTLM urging anyone to commit rape in all the time that I've been at this trial.  This is a new element that we have, and she has done it with respect to another area, but I thought this was sporadic, but there may be something more here.  And if we are going to be dealing with new allegations not contained in any of the testimony before this trial so far --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this is an issue of common knowledge.  And in any event, the witness has already been tainted with whatever response he will give.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, again, I am objecting to new elements being raised.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, maybe can you refer to your question, Counsel, if you want to address the question of rape within the context of the evidence we have heard here in Susa, whatever it is?  True, perhaps it might not be easy to say, it's a matter of common knowledge that Radio Muhabura -- I beg your pardon, Radio RTLM did urge what you say, Counsel, to be able to form a basis of a general common question based on common knowledge, which certainly it has not surfaced in the course of this testimony or in this case, but certainly there are issues of rape that have been testified on about by some witnesses.  And you may wish to rephrase your question.  Accordingly, we want to pursue this matter along those lines.  So we will rule to that extent, sustain the objection raised by the Defence counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, during the period of April 1994, and, in particular, on the 7th and 10th of April 1994, you urged the Interahamwe to search for Tutsi women and rape them and dispose of them as killed, didn't you?
A.	There was no such date.  I think there was no such date.  Maybe you could rephrase the dates.  Maybe the terminology is and the sense of the word is not correct.  There was no such a date.  But on the question of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't understand the translation.
MR. HINDS:
I am told that the translator said the seventh year.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the person was -- counsel was --
MS. OJEMENI:
Seventh and eighth April.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Seventh and 8th April 1994, because we don't understand the answer the witness is trying to give as well as the formulation that seems to be coming out.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, during the period of April 1994, and particularly 7th and 10th of April 1994, you ordered the Interahamwe to search for Tutsi women, rape them, and dispose of them as killed, didn't you?
A.	Mr. President, I would like to answer the question, but I would like also to comment, too, on the answer I'm going to give.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we take as an answer, we don't tell the difference between an answer and a comment, so just answer the question as you understand it.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
What you are saying is that on the 7th and some time, I ordered the Interahamwe to commit such atrocities which I cannot even repeat is not correct, because, on such dates I gave evidence that I spent the day at my home in Nkuli commune.  Those people I don't know them.  I never met them.  Such words are very offensive to me because I did a lot of good for the Tutsis during that period, and I even hid them.  I couldn't hide them and at the same time give them to those animals to kill them.  Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, it's interesting to note that on the 7th and 10th of April that you were accused of participating in the killing of Tutsi in Mukingo and Nkuli commune, including Rukoma cellule, you stayed home; am I not correct?
A.	I think I answered such a question.  I said I spent the day at my house.  What you have just said is not correct, Mr. President.  No.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Mr. President, I have just taken some medicine and I used some water.  Allow me to go and ease myself.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now 14th.  It won't take long, Accused.  It won't take long.  We'll wait for you here.  Can you escort the Accused person, please?  I think we stay on, we'll have to make some ground.  Please, go.
(Pages 1 to 21 by R. Lear)








1030H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, the Accused is back.  Witness, we'll continue. 
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, it is your testimony that on 14th, you stayed -- you spent the whole day in Nkuli at a place called Kareba?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	A place called?
MS. OJEMENI: 
	Kareba, that's what I heard last time, Karemba (sic). 
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Karemba in Nkuli commune, is that correct?
A.	That is correct, Mr. President.  That is what I said.
Q.	On that date, Witness, of the 7th -- of the 14th of April 1994 you organised and armed Interahamwes from Mukingo commune who were involved in the attack of the court of appeal; isn't that correct?
A.	That is not correct.
Q.	You instructed Rukundo to organise these Interahamwes for the attack of Tutsis in court of appeal; isn't that right?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, Counsel.
MR. HINDS:
Again, the Prosecution is introducing new elements into the case that have not been raised before.  This has not been raised anywhere in the case in-chief.
MS. OJEMENI:
I withdraw that.  I withdraw that, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, which one had you introduced?
MS. OJEMENI:
That's the fact that he instructed Rukundo to go somewhere.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You instructed the president of the Interahamwe and the vice-president to organise or to mobilise the Interahamwes to go for this attack of Tutsis in the court of appeal - at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri town; isn't that correct?
MR. HINDS:
Same objection, Your Honour, same objection: new elements being introduced into the case at this stage.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mean that is not so?  What do you mean, Counsel?  Can you elaborate?
MR. HINDS:
With the issue of vice-president, either in title or name.  This has been raised as issues concerning - well, it's new elements that we are now dealing with, and I am leaving it at that.  At this late stage of the game, what we have now are new elements being raised.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the Accused all through the Prosecution case has been accused of organising and arming the Interahamwes for the -- I mean, to -- for the killings of Tutsis at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri town, and that is what I am following.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I think what counsel is saying, the categorisation Interahamwe is an issue that appears to have run through the proceedings.  
MS. OJEMENI:
I used the word Interahamwe, Your Honour.
   MR. PRESIDENT:
So if you have specific aspects that were never raised at this hour of the day, because he is entitled to certain rights.
MS. OJEMENI:
I have disclosed that to the Accused.  I have sent disclosed details of the -- new details, but I'll withdraw that and I'll proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, on the 14th of April 1994, you instructed Interahamwes to go to the court of appeal and kill the Tutsis who were taking refuge there; isn't that correct?
A.	Mr. President, I would like to answer the question, but I would also like to comment besides answering.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Just answer the question, please.  We don't make a distinction between the comment and answer.  We take it as your answer.  Okay?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
	Thank you, Mr. President.  What the Prosecutor is saying, Mr. President, is not correct because one of the witnesses who talked about this matter, about the court of appeal killings in Ruhengeri town, in his or her letter where he or she was asking for testimony, he said that he was forced to go and testify.  The Prosecutor has that.  What the Prosecutor is saying is recent.  That was in March.  The Prosecutor managed to - managed to fabricate so that this matter should be raised before this Chamber.   What she is saying is fabricated and is misleading to the Chamber.  And even the national courts of Rwanda know the state of the question, and among the witnesses there is one who testified on how the (unintelligible) were killed.  I was also -- I also testified this is misleading to the Chamber.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	(Microphone not activated) to the Trial Chamber, leave out the Prosecutor, we repeat again.  Give your explanation you want to give as you wish it, but the Prosecutor is not testifying nor accusing anybody -- I mean, fabricating.  You just answer the question as they are being asked to the Trial Chamber.   We will repeat that warning again.  
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	-- you fuelled the car that the Interahamwes used for this mission, for the killings -- the Interahamwes used to go Ruhengeri town for the killing of these Tutsis, and you also supplied weapons to these Interahamwes on the 14th of April 1994, didn't you?
A.	That is not correct.  What you are saying -- what the Prosecutor, Mr. President, is not correct, because I spent my day in Kareba organizing work at my -- I was loading firewood for -- to one of my clients, and that person exists.   And what is being said is wrong, and I never took part in that kind of activity.  This has no basis whatsoever.
Q.	Witness, are you aware that the --
MR. KIYEYEU: 
	I am sorry, My Lord, there is a new name there, Kareba.  I don't know whether it is the name of a person or the place.  If could be spelt out for the record, My Lord.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kareba is a place, and spelling is K-A-R-E-B-A, Kareba.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Now, you are aware that before RGM came to this Chamber to testify, that he had not confessed to the crimes he was charged with in Rwanda, aren't you?
A.	Could she please repeat the question?   I didn't it understand it very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Repeat the question, please, to the witness. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you are aware that RGM confessed to the crimes that he was charged with in Rwanda after he had testified in your favour in this Trial Chamber; is that correct?
A.	It is not correct, Mr. President.  That witness had confessed a long time before, and before I even knew that I was accused of what he was testifying.  There are -- there is a lot of evidence, and even a letter of confession is in your possession, and the letter showed the crimes he committed.   And the time he came to testify here in this case of Kajelijeli, we had asked him to change what he said and about three times, but all in vain.  He had confessed.  And right now, he has been released and he has been testifying, and he has his truth to state.  What you are saying about that person is not correct.
Q.	You, Witness, said that RGM implicated you in his confession, aren't you?
A.	What you are saying is what you told him to say, and when he reached here, he denied everything.  He even swore an affidavit to the effect saying that the Prosecutor asked him and that it wasn't correct, and he swore an affidavit to this effect showing that the Prosecutor and the workers of the Prosecution had invented stories about him.  Therefore, that is not correct, Mr. President.
Q.	Witness, you rewarded all the Interahamwes who participated in the killing of Tutsi population in Mukingo and Nkuli communes from the 7th up to 13th July, 1994, when you fled Mukingo, didn't you?
A.	Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying is not correct.  There was no list whatsoever on how I gave a reward to those people they call Interahamwe, which I don't even know, especially as at the time I was working as an independent person, and therefore I couldn't meet them especially as myself, I had my own programmes.  What she is stating is not correct, and I didn't pay them anything.  The time Prosecutor spent in Mukingo commune, there is no single proof -- during her stay with her workers, there was nothing in writing showing that Kajelijeli was involved in whatever she's saying.  There is no single proof whatsoever to that effect. 
Q.	Witness, you testified to the fact that Mukingo communal office was bombed, didn't you?
A.	It's not correct.
Q.	You testified that while you were burying Harerimana, bombs were falling in Mukingo commune, didn't you?
A.	That is correct.  What I am denying is that the communal office of Mukingo was bombed.  It's not correct.
Q.	Where was Harerimana is buried?
A.	Harerimana was buried at his own home as I explained when I was being questioned by my counsel.
Q.	Where is Harerimana's home located?
A.	It is in Mukingo commune.
Q.	Where in Mukingo commune?  You have testified that his house was within Mukingo commune, the communal office.  Was he buried there?
A.	Mr. President, I don't follow what is being said in Kinyarwanda.  The translator is saying that the bourgmestre was buried in Mukingo communal office.  I contest, I contest the translation which is being put forward.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Just a minute.  We -- the witness - the Accused is saying that the translation is not - is giving him some problems.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, that is what I want to clarify.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
	That is why I asked the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:  
Q.	Witness, you testified that Harerimana was living within the Mukingo communal office compound; is that correct?
A.	Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying is not correct.  It is not correct.  I did not say so.
Q.	Now, how far was Harerimana's house from the Mukingo commune, communal office?
A.	I believe, but I didn't count well -- I didn't measure well, from the communal office it was about 150 metres.  From Mukingo commune compound, from that compound it's about 100 metres.  There is the communal office; there is also the communal compound.  I distinguish between that compound.  From that compound it is about 100 metres.  From the office, it is about 150 metres.  There is a distinction between the two, but I did not measure, but it could be verified.
Q.	Witness, you rewarded the Interahamwes for a job well done with money or property of Tutsi population in Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	What is being said is not correct because I didn't have any position within that commune.  The commune had its own administrative set up.  This is not correct.  It has been fabricated.  It's not correct and it never happened.
Q.	As the last bourgmestre of Mukingo commune before you all fled on the 13th of July, 1994, where did you keep the documents belonging to the communal office?  What happened to the documents?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  All those documents belong to the commune.  I told the Chamber that when Mukingo commune was captured, those who came from there -- I was in Gisenyi.  I was -- there was no way I could have left Mukingo commune.  I left the commune, and I didn't know that I would - I was going to move back.  I wouldn't dare move back.  Everything remained behind in Mukingo commune because I was afraid.  I remained in Gisenyi because the place had been taken over by the enemy, so I couldn't go there and rescue the documents.
Q.	Witness, is it you then fair to say that you do not know what happened to the documents belonging to the Mukingo communal office after your departure from Mukingo commune on the 13th of July, 1994?
A.	I do not know.
Q.	Witness, in response to a question put to you by your Defence regarding the killing of Tutsi population at the Mukingo -- at the court of appeal in Ruhengeri town, you wondered how the Tutsis could be killed in a place guarded by gendarmes and why the alarm did not go off to alert the soldiers.  You concluded by saying that you think that some politics or games were being played by those in charge of the préfecture.  What did you mean by politics or games played by those in charge of the préfecture?
A.	On this question, I wanted to condemn the manner in which the administration handled the whole affair because it is very sad that a place that is being guarded by the gendarmes up to the time people took refuge in the court of appeal -- and people were killed inside there, including even the gendarmes.  Why, if it was in the préfecture and that place was being guarded, why was there no arrangement to protect such people?  If we are to speak the truth -- I can't speak the truth because I am under detention, but I can condemn the manner in which the whole matter was handled, and nobody took any steps to protect such people.  It is not understandable how such people could have been killed.  I don't accept the explanation that is being forwarded because those people were supposed to be protected, and they were very well known.
Q.	Witness, did you find out who killed these Tutsis and the Interahamwes and soldiers?
A.	I tried to know how they were being guarded, that was -- that's why I'm sad.  Up to the time when the gendarmes who were guarding them were killed, afterwards, if you follow how the war was going on, those who were detained were released by the RPF, like in the '90s and in Mukingo we would detain people and RPF would release them.  I couldn't judge; I couldn't decide what was happening.  Those who were attacking were responsible also, especially in terms of the security and punishing the culprits.  The war interfered a lot.  Even the cases that were being tried could not be because, for example, the court was destroyed.  All the documents were destroyed by the RPF.  You see, the problem is on the side of both combatants, and it's a very long story.  There is no way I can explain.
Q.	Witness, you said that those who attacked were also in charge of security.  What do you mean by that?
A.	I mean that if there are people who have been caught and because they have been killed - because they have killed people and the RPF would attack and release them, this is a problem.  And when they destroy the place, they take away the documents, and starting new files would be difficult.  This would be a very difficult matter because there were no cases to -- that could be continued since those people who are detained would be released by RPF.  This happened about three times at different - at three different attacks. 
Q.	Was RPF in charge of security in April 1994 in Ruhengeri town?
A.	In Ruhengeri préfecture, in the communes that were under the RPF occupation, knowing how the situation was being handled, it was not easy because nobody would step in and come back and tell us what was happening.  That is a problem I cannot handle, but if you have the time, you can investigate and know a bit more about it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
	(Microphone not activated) in Ruhengeri town in April 1994.  I think that is your question, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
	Thank you, Mr. President.  She hadn't said the Ruhengeri town.  In 1994, at the time, there were people who were detention because of the killings that had taken place in 1994, because besides the killing of the Tutsis, many Hutus were killed.  They were killed because some of them were taking revenge of other people.  Some had been arrested and put in prison.  The RPF released them when they captured Ruhengeri.  

It wasn't the first time.  In '93 in February, RPF captured Ruhengeri and released all the prisoners.  In '92, in '91, the same happened.  Being in charge of security was not easy because they would arrest people and detain them, and the RPF would come and release them from prison.  If the RPF captured Kinigi, those people were in detention would be released, and the RPF would convert them into their people to work for them.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But counsel -- counsel's question is to the effect that how was the RPF in charge or connected or concerned with security in Ruhengeri town in April 1994.  I think that was substance of the question.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  It is a follow-up question in response to my question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	That is the question of counsel, counsel's question.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
	At the time they were bombing Ruhengeri town from the 8th, on the 9th, and the subsequent days, there are people who would be killed in Ruhengeri, and that's because of those bombs.  There were houses that were destroyed; prisons were destroyed.  You know that there was no security in Ruhengeri at the time.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Then the RPF was in charge of the security of Ruhengeri town, is that what you are saying?  That's the way you think they were in charge.  We would like to understand you.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJEIL: 
	I said that the RPF was really against the security of the city of Ruhengeri.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	In response to my question, you said that those who attacked were in charge of security, and we are talking about court of appeal incident where Tutsis were killed on the 14th of April, 1994.  So it is in that context that I am asking you explain what you mean by that.
A.	I don't know how you confuse the two.  I didn't say that those who were in charge of security are the ones that killed. This is a new element you are adding.  I said that the way that those people were killed -- and even those people who were in charge of the security, that is the gendarmes, they were also killed.  The very fact that the gendarmes were guarding the Tutsis at the court of appeal and there was no way of stopping those people who killed them, I didn't appreciate at all the way such a case was handled and was not for the truth for such people.
MS. OJEMENI:
Let the record --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
-- show that the witness is evading my question because the records are very clear as to what the witness said in response to my question.
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  I mean, I could just as well characterise this in terms of the questions being put to him being unclear, so I don't know whether it helps anyone to say that the witness is evading any questions.  His answers are consistent.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We take note of the witness's answer and the question.  Can you go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, as a responsible citizen who felt really bad as to what happened in court of appeal -- I mean, at the court of appeal on the 14th April 1994, what did you do?  How did you challenge what -- the role the government played?
A.	Excuse me, in what capacity would I have done anything at all?  If I am one of the citizens of Ruhengeri and you ask me what I should have done, tell me in what capacity I would have done it as an ordinary citizen.  I wasn't the conseiller, I wasn't a bourgmestre.  I was nobody in the administration.  Even the administration in the place was -- even the administration in place was in trouble.  There were so many Hutus that were killed, large numbers.  For example, you that carried out investigations, if we would include even the Hutus that were killed, you know, the investigation be carried out into the killing of such people because time should come for that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Deal with your case., and so, Accused, we would like to hear you on all that is relevant to your case. We will be taking a break around this time and then we will come and continue.  We will take a break and resume our work at 20 past 11, 20 past 11, at 20 past 11.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned.  
	(Court adjourned between 1105 and 1125H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Counsel, can you continue with your cross-examination, please?
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, would you tell the Court what you did as a responsible citizen of Mukingo commune when you heard about the killing of Tutsis at the nuns' house, at the nuns' house around Rwankeli's cellule, Busogo hill in particular?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The question put to you me by the Prosecutor if I did anything when I heard that there were massacres in different areas now just mentioned.  I heard a lot of news about these areas on the radio, but where I came to know of the massacre sites was at Rwankeli and in Busogo.  The way things stood at that time, we were together with other people in that tragedy.  We prayed for the dead, all the people, including those who were not Tutsis.  And those who were killed afterwards, I also prayed for them.  This is all I could do in my position as a citizen who had no other capacity, other power or other authority under the law.  Thank you.
Q.	And did you find out who killed them when you assumed office as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, shortly after the massacre of Tutsis of Mukingo commune?
A.	I never found out in my capacity as a former bourgmestre but as a person who loves fellow citizens, who loves human beings without distinction.
Q.	I am not sure you understood my question.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	The answer seems to be incomplete.  Perhaps the question was not properly understood by the witness.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court what you did, if anything -- I mean, whether you did anything when you took over as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune to find out who killed the Tutsis in Mukingo commune?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you can tell him the time -- well, the time frame as well when he took over, for clarity's sake.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, you took over the office of the bourgmestre in Mukingo commune shortly after the killing of the Tutsis in Mukingo commune in April 1994; is that correct?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  It is simply not true.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you took over as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune sometime in June 1994, didn't you?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	And that was - this was after the massacre of Tutsis in Mukingo commune, isn't it?
A.	There were also Hutus who were killed.  I don't know why you are making a differentiation.  There were massacres against the Tutsis as well as against Hutus.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes.  She is addressing particular aspects of Mukingo commune.  Can you answer that question?  It's a follow-up question.  Can you answer that question?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
	I am confused, Mr. President, because the question she's asking, if a Tutsi was killed, you cannot -- if the Tutsi or if he's living with a Hutu, why should I talk about the Tutsis and not talk about Hutus?  Some of these people were living together.  I cannot differentiate as the Prosecutor wants me to.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But if you have an answer of any other people, you can answer that, but the Prosecutor is addressing a specific question.  You may have time to deal with some other aspects that you want to deal with.  Do you understand the question?   Would like him (sic) to that - to repeat to you?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
	Let her help me by repeating the question.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you took over -- or rather, you became the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in June 1994 after the massacre of Tutsis in Mukingo commune; is that correct?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	Could you tell this Court what you did as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in June regarding the people who killed the Tutsis?
A.	I did not differentiate, I did not -- I talked about the killings that took place at that time.  I did something about the -- finding out about what had happened.
Q.	What were your findings? 
A.	I came to learn the number of the Tutsis who were killed at the nuns' convent; secondly, I managed to pray for them, to hold a service for them, as I explained just recently.
Q.	When was this service held?  What date in April or June, could you tell the Court?
A.	I believe -- I think I specified that it was a week after the tragedy.  As to how the killings took place, I followed up this matter in June, but the requiem mass was held a week after the tragedy.
Q.	In fact, the requiem mass was held in April 1994; is that correct?
A.	I went to the church, it is correct, and I have explained it already.
Q.	Witness, is it fair, then, for me to say that you actually took over the office of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune immediately after the death of Harerimana, but the government ratified or approved your position as bourgmestre in June; is that correct?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is the objection?
MR. HINDS:
There are no facts for that statement.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is being suggested to you him.  He can answer that question.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, if I may assist the Court, the witness has testified that he held mass for them as a bourgmestre.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no, no, not as a bourgmestre.
MS. OJEMENI:
When he was in office, I asked him a question --
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a different matter.  The question of mass was differently put than what you referred to, Counsel.  He did attend mass and he even gave a date, but not, maybe you can have it verified, not in his capacity as a bourgmestre, or thereabouts in April 1994.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question regarding whether it is fair for me to say that you took over the of office of the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune immediately after the death of Harerimana in April of 1994, but the ratification was done in June 1994?
A.	This question is mixed up.  You are asking me what I did.  I don't know at what time you place this.  Let the Prosecutor, Mr. President, sir, let her be more clear.  She is mixing up things between what I did and other issues.  It's not clear. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last question I think is very clear, it is very clear, unless you were not listening to it.
MR. HINDS:
Objection Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
The question is designed to obfuscate.  It is not clear, and I have to say this because the question is being -- it's facts that are not in evidence, first of all, but this is the ruling and she can do that.  But the question that is being suggested is clearly -- there are no facts to support that.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We have ruled on that, Counsel.

Can you answer that question?  Counsel is asking you, is it correct that you, in fact, took over office as bourgmestre of Mukingo shortly after the killing in April or the massacre, and ratification by the government of your appointment or position of bourgmestre was done in June.  That is the substance of counsel's question.  What do you say to that?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
Thank you.  I think you have facilitated matters.  It is now clearer.  I would like to - it's not to delay you.  Sometimes she's doing it intentionally.  It is not correct.  Allow me to comment, and I will show.  The witness has showed how the different bourgmestres were appointed.  There was Ndesetse -- Ndisetse; there was Semahana who followed up appointed by the préfet.  It was the Prosecutor's witness who announced this.  It was in June when I was appointed.  I couldn't be a bourgmestre, I was a simple citizen during that indicated period.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you go on.   
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, your appointment as bourgmestre of Mukingo was a reward for a job well done by the government through the préfet of Ruhengeri; isn't that correct?
A.	What you are saying -- Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying is not true.  To leading the commune I have already given evidence, I have explained how there was an electoral process and different candidates would come up, and the one with the highest number of votes would be shipped  -- the name would sent to the administration higher up, and what the Prosecutor is saying is not correct, Mr. President.  
Q.	Witness, the job well done was your active participation in the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo and Nkuli communes in 1994; isn't that correct?
A.	Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying mere propaganda.  If it was true, there would be no Tutsis who would come to give evidence in my - in favour of Kajelijeli if Kajelijeli had done harm to their families.  Those Tutsis came here, and among the witnesses there were Tutsis.  If you will allow me, I will give the statements written by Tutsis exculpating me against those accusations.  Thank you, Mr. President.
Q.	Witness, why was a man, Mr. Kajelijeli, who was never interested the affairs of Mukingo commune since February 1993 when he left office as bourgmestre of Mukingo, could you tell the Court why you should be appointed bourgmestre above all in Mukingo commune?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think he has answered that question, according to his evidence.
MS. OJEMENI:
No, Your Honour, I haven't posed that that question.  He must have --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no.  I think it has been asked and answered.  He gave -- on a similar question he said, well, he went through an electoral process, according to his evidence, and ultimately the recommendations were made through the appropriate authority.  That was his evidence on that.  We think the question is answered.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, you must have been an important and respectable man for the people to choose you in Mukingo commune in April 1994, isn't it?
A.	I don't know where you get that from.  Mr. President, it does mean that I was a respected person.  I respected other people instead.  When you respect other people, then if you didn't respect other people they would not, they would not respect you back.  I said how new leaders were appointed from April to 17th to 18th June.  I was told that I had more votes than the others.  I don't know where she gets the rest of the information, and that's why I'm saying it is propaganda.
Q.	You testified that when you left office, you fizzled out of the public eye, didn't you?
A.	It's correct.
Q.	Did you stand for the election yourself or people just elected you?
A.	At the time of nominations, everybody knew about it.  Nobody suggested my candidature.  I personally stood as a candidate, and I got more votes.  I was elected because I had more votes.  Your Honour, Mr. President, apart from the intentions of the Prosecutor to delay this, all this has got evidence, written evidence.  She can - she could get some of the statements from Rwanda.  The people were there watching.  I never -- I would not - nobody, nobody gave my name for the post.  That's not correct.
Q.	Witness, you testified that when you left office as bourgmestre, you went into private business and you were not interested in the affairs of the commune; is that correct?
A.	Mr. President, I think the Prosecutor should help me get the answers.  There is a double meaning there.  It doesn't mean that I wasn't interested in what was happening in the commune.  I did not follow up what was happening simply because I was in the private sector doing my own work.  How the bourgmestre worked and the staff of the commune worked, I did not follow up these matters.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But Witness, the moment there was vacancy in the position of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, you became interested and put yourself forward for the election; isn't that correct?
A.	I don't know what you mean.  There was no electoral campaign, it was during the war, but people simply gave their names as candidates.  There was no campaign.  People just showed what their opinion was on paper.  There was no campaign.  It was, in fact, done suddenly.  People gave in their names to stand as candidates, and the electoral report was given to the préfet, and the préfet submitted this to the relevant authorities.  It was under multipartyism, and there was no other way to go about it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but that is not counsel's question.   Counsel's question -- that is not counsel's question.  The counsel's question was that when an opportunity came, you became interested to run for the post of bourgmestre.  

Can you put back the question to the witness, perhaps?  Listen carefully, please, and give a precise answer so that we can move forward.  
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, when there was vacancy in the position of bourgmestre in Mukingo commune, you became interested and you put your name forward to be a contestant for the position, isn't it?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	And you were indeed selected.  How many people contested for this position in Mukingo commune?
A.	I mentioned some people that I can recall.  I think it was between seven and 14 people. 
Q.	And out of the 14 people, you came tops as the bourgmestre, and you are telling this Court -
A.	There -
Q.	And you are telling this Court that you were not important or a respectable man in Mukingo commune in April and in June 1994; is that correct?
A.	I believe that you are mixing up issues.  I was respecting the people.  To say that I was respected, it's not on that basis that I stood.  I was - I respected the people and I showed the people that I respected them.  Given especially that there was no discrimination to say that you are accepted by this or -- you know, I respected the people, and that is why they voted for me.
Q.	Now, Witness, you recall your - that in response to a question put to you in Cotonou when you were interviewed by agents of the ICTR, you testified to the fact that it was the will of the people that you should stand for the election of bourgmestre -- as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1994?
A.	Mr. President, it would be more understandable if you read the question and then saw the answer I gave, and then from there you can ask another question.  If you repeat the question and the answer given, Mr. President, you can understand better the issue.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) the answer.  We shall have time to read the record.  We have it; it has been tendered as an exhibit.  Now, if you understand counsel's question, we would like to have your version on this question.  We shall have time to look at all the records that is being made in the course of these proceedings.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
But the problem is that she is confusing me.  The question must be clear.  I cannot answer as a little rascal.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You don't understand the question, is that what you are saying?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
Can you repeat it?
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, in response to a question put to you by agents of ICTR in Cotonou regarding your election as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1994, you testified that it was the will of people to elect you as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, didn't you? 
A.	There is something you are adding there.  Mr. President, the Prosecutor is adding something there.  She is saying, "When you were elected as bourgmestre," when I hear this in Kinyarwanda.  I think she is mixing up things comparing to what I answered in Benin.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The question is that you -- in answer to that question, a similar question, you said it was the will of the people that you put yourself to contest for the post of bourgmestre, that is question.  What do you say to that?  Isn't that what you say?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
What you saying is right.  She should follow your example.  She's talking about me standing as a bourgmestre.  Your question is clear.  What you have said is just clear, but she's distorting things in a way that is in her favour.  I have said that that is correct, Mr. President.
BY MS. OJEMENI:  
Q.	Okay.  Witness, you are telling the Court that you were not occupying any important position in April 1994 that made the people to elect you as bourgmestre.  Is that what you are telling the Court?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
What is your question, Counsel? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	My question is this:  Witness, are you telling this Court that you did not occupy an important position that influenced the people's decision to put you forward as the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune?
A.	Mr. President, have you understood that question yourselves?  I don't understand it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah, Counsel, he was not able to perhaps --
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, you have testified that it was the will of the people that you should be their bourgmestre after the death Bourgmestre Harerimana; is that correct?
A.	I said that between and me and Harerimana, there were two interim bourgmestres.  These also stood as candidates for the post.  I would say that between me and Harerimana, you should not leave that place -- I mean, a vacuum in terms of time.  Let the Judges also understand this:  I did not replace Harerimana.  I replaced people who had replaced Harerimana through the will of the people.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Now, Witness, what qualified you to be the bourgmestre in April 1994?
MR. HINDS:
Objection.
MS. OJEMENI:
Sorry, in June 1994.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In June 1994. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What do you consider your qualification for people to desire that you be their bourgmestre shortly after the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the question is putting me ill at ease.  When she talks about the massacre of Tutsis without mentioning the massacres of Hutus when I have already said that there were massacres of Hutus and Tutsis as well, that really hurts me.  

The way this question is being asked, that put aside, for me to become a bourgmestre, this was based on the votes given by the people, and the people with whom I sued for this post, some of them are still in Rwanda.  There was no offence in this.  The people had to have leaders, and the war could not permit this, but I was elected by the people because I was given votes by the people.  There was no miracle about this to become bourgmestre.  She has the file and the file is in the ministry of internal affairs.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) of the witness's answer.  And can we tell you again that can you please the answer the question precisely.  You can explain whatever you want to explain.  And counsel is asking these question on behalf and for the Tribunal, and you address the Tribunal, and we would like to have your precise answers if you understand the question.  It might be helpful.
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, in Mukingo commune at this time between April and June 1994 were all Hutus, having exterminated all the Tutsis; isn't that correct?
A.	It is not correct.
Q.	Were there Tutsis alive in Mukingo commune in June 1994?
A.	They were there.  They were there, Tutsis.
(Pages 22 to 37 by Petrus Chijarira)


1200H
Q.	You saw Tutsis in Mukingo commune when you took over as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.
A.	It is correct, they were there. 
Q.	When did the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune stop? 
A.	I again say that I'm not -- I don't agree with the way you are putting it, you know, talking of Tutsi massacre.  You should talk about the killings in Mukingo commune.  That stopped in April 1994, according to the report we received after April and when I became a bourgmestre, in June 1994.  I told the investigators that when I was a bourgmestre, there was no single massacre that took place.  When I became a bourgmestre there were some Tutsis still living there, and I can give you names of those Tutsis. 
Q.	Witness, I'm addressing killing of Tutsis, and no other ethnicity.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you answer that?  At least in the -- you can have your own answer later, but the counsel is addressing the question of the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune.  Can we have a precise answer to that? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Mr. President, you are forcing me to answer things which are -- which are favourable to the Prosecutor.  There should be an answer on the killings in general.  There were massacres of Hutus and Tutsi --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please answer that question.  I want you to answer it.  We take note of that.  You understand the question precisely. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
According to what I heard, the massacres stopped in April 1994.  This is according to what I heard.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We take note of that answer. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But, witness, you were emphatic that there was no killing of Tutsis in June.  How did you ascertain that? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The Prosecutor is asking me how I managed to get that assessment.  When I became a bourgmestre, what I wanted was to ensure security for all citizens of Mukingo.  I strived to achieve that so that even people who were in hiding came out in the open, and there has been evidence to that effect in this Chamber that some of them came out of their hiding.  There was no -- the people who survived did not go anywhere else.  Even myself, I had Tutsis.  Nobody persecuted anybody in my commune, whether -- persecute Hutus or Tutsis.  Most bandits who had taken part in the massacres ran away from me.  I can give examples, Mr. President, if you allow.  

There was a Prosecution witness who stated that the last time he saw Kajelijeli was at that time, and next time we met in Zaire.  People like those could not go around like braggarts in the commune, swaggering around.  Some were deserters from the army, people whom I had imprisoned in '91, '92 when I was previously a bourgmestre, and we had punished them, but they would be subsequently later released by the RPF.  Let the Prosecutor not cause confusion here or tell you things which are false.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on, counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, are you telling this Court that when you became bourgmestre of Mukingo commune you punished all perpetrators of Tutsi massacre, in June 1994 -- that's what I'm addressing?
A.	I have shown how those people could not move around freely, where I could see them, especially in 1991, 1992.  Most of these were army deserters.  In June '94, I've said that people could not search -- search -- people who had committed atrocities could not move around freely, but some were put in prison by people, and the RPF in June captured the town of Ruhengeri and set free those prisoners.  Some of these people were fleeing away, and when you are running away, you could not put such people in prison, Honourable President.  There was no more food, no more supplies for the prisoners.  Kigali, the capital, had been captured or was about to be captured.  But, Mr. President, I wouldn't like to have any confusion.  I have a lot of comments to make and a lot of explanations to give.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what is the brief answer to that question? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I would say that in June I imprisoned some people.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I imprisoned some people.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Who were those people imprisoned?  And was it in connection with the killing of Tutsis in April 1994, in Mukingo commune? 
A.	This, it included all this, all those crimes. 
Q.	Who were those people? 
A.	There are some names that I recall; others I don't recall.  But I would mention people like Musafiri, I imprisoned them and others whose names I cannot recall.  At one time I even mentioned Dusabe, that we mentioned the other day; I also imprisoned him, and others whose names I don't recall.  But the circumstances at that time, I cannot give you precision unless you check on records how people were arrested, imprisoned, and how long they stayed there, and how they would be transferred in Ruhengeri.  But the issue at the time was that there was no food to feed them, and maybe a week later they would be released, and this was due -- in a short period because Ruhengeri was under threat. 
Q.	Now, witness, can you give a fair figure, an estimate, of how many people you imprisoned for the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune, or in connection with that? 
A.	At one time I mentioned that in these massacres there were some displaced persons who played a role in this.  At that time people were fleeing and many of these people took the decision to move from Mukingo because the war was approaching that commune.  The number of people imprisoned, I cannot recall.  Apart from you who go to the commune, if you really look at the records, the record books of people who were arrested at that time or the record book at Ruhengeri, because they would first go through the police station in Ruhengeri.  You can even ring and they will give you the list of people who were arrested and imprisoned.
Q.	Now, witness, on what basis did you imprison these people?  How did you arrive at the offence?  Did you conduct an investigation when you took office as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	Your Honour, at that time I was working with the secteur conseillers, and who were heading the secteurs where these crimes had been carried out, and they were, in turn, working with the responsables, heads of cellules, so there's no way they could not know these people and the crimes they had commited.  And I'm talking of the areas where the commune had control over.  For instance, in Shingiro this could not be possible because the conseillers and responsables had moved, so wherever the commune had control, it could follow these issues. 
Q.	Witness, my question is whether you conducted an investigation when you took office as bourgmestre.
A.	Your Honour, if you do not misregard (sic) what I said, at one time I testified saying that the judicial institutions were there in Mukingo.  I had the judicial police who was in charge of carrying out investigations, and that judicial police was under the ministry of justice and was independent.  And that institution was there and was working with the conseiller of the commune and they were giving me reports about their activities.  So this is true; I was montitoring the situation and I would also request him to carry out such investigations.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So in answer to that question -- what is the answer to that question in precise terms?  Did you conduct investigation or were you informed of investigations?  What exactly is your answer to that question? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Investigations were conducted -- investigations were conducted at -- by the institution at the prosecutor's office in Mukingo commune level.  And then these people would collaborate with the conseiller of the commune, and these conseillers of the commune would tell me -- would give me reports of the status.  And so I believe I could say that investigations were conducted. 

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Yes, witness, when exactly?  Can you give the date when the investigation was conducted? 
A.	If I remember well, this would be from the 26th, because that's the first thing -- 26th of June, because that's the first thing I requested.  The week after that, it was the first thing that I requested.  Those who were to be arrested were arrested, and then Ruhengeri was being attacked, so no more activities were -- disrupted, because even the people who were supposed to conduct investigations fled.  But some people were arrested, and this was done by the prosecutor's office. 
Q.	Witness, you fled on the 13th of July 1994, you fled Ruhengeri -- Mukingo commune; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Are you telling this Court that between 26th of June to 13 July you were able to conduct investigation and imprisoned the culprits of this -- of the massacre of Tutsis in April 1994? 
A.	Your Honour, I do not -- what the Prosecutor has added, but saying that people were culprits or -- people had been -- rather, people who were seen and who were alleged to have committed atrocities, massacres.  The prosecutor's office presented even in Mukingo commune would arrest such people and they stopped pursuing them after the war had become too serious, after people had started fleeing.  And I said this took over a short period up to 13th July.  

So we had not reached any conclusion to the extent that you could say that these people were really culprits and that they had been convicted.  No one -- no single case had been processed to its full conclusion to say that such-and-such had been convicted, but, rather, these were people who were in provisional detention so that their crimes -- so that they could be pursued for the crimes they had committed.  Actually I can even tell you that there are many people -- as I told you the other day, that when people are being pursued, if we had already arrested about five people and this was provisional detention, so we were moving ahead, and this was done.  And if you wish, you could check on records at the police stations, because all these people would go through the police stations. 
Q.	Witness, did you arrest RGM during this period?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Could you repeat the question, please, counsel? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did you arrest RGM during this period for his participation in the killing of Tutsis in April 1994? 
A.	Your Honour, I think that I talked about this question last time.  I said that I at one time imprisoned this person.  But what I can tell the Chamber is that in April it was not very likely that people who had played a role in the massacres showed themselves.  Most of them, they would flee to areas where the Red Cross was supplying food.  So saying that having had arrested him, is not true.  But, rather, I had arrested him when I was bourgmestre before, in 1992. 
Q.	Witness, was it the same time you arrested Dusabe, was it when you were bourgmestre in -- between 1992 and 1993?  Was it when you arrested Dusabe? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Was it also during this period that you arrested Musafiri?  I mean, between 1992 to 1993.
A.	Musafiri was arrested in June, but this was not the first time.  I had also arrested him before when he was persecuting people when he had deserted the army.  This was the third time that I -- in June that was the third time I had arrested him.  You will find that -- in front of his name you will find that he had been committing this crime many times; it was not the first time.
MS. OJEMENI:
So on what basis --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think, counsel -- I mean, witness, we would like to get some clarification here.  Because when you -- you did mention Musafiri, yes, when these questions were put to you, and you went on to mention others, including Dusabe --
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, I'm coming to that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Because our understanding was that this was in June, after the taking over of office. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did you arrest Dusabe when you took office in June 1994 in connection with the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I said -- in the testimony I gave I said that I arrested Dusabe in the -- 1992, after he had committed some crime and he was imprisoned and he was even fined; even RGM, that's when he was arrested.  And during 1996, I had little powers.  I said --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it '96 or '94?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I'm sorry, it's '94.  Even in June 1994 I had little powers.  Those who were arrested would be released later on because there was no food to feed them and the préfecture was under threat.  So having detention facilities for them was not easy. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what yardstick did you use in arresting the people you've alleged you arrested in June 1994?  What was your yardstick?
MR. PRESIDENT:
So -- before that, counsel, we would like to understand.  So in June, witness -- in June, because this was in answer to the questions that were put to you by counsel about people whom you imprisoned, who were arrested and imprisoned in June after you took over office, and you said, "I recall some names, like Musafiri".  Do you recall?  "I imprisoned them.  And others I cannot remember."  And then you went on to mention Dusabe.  And you then you went on to say that, "I cannot recall the number of people that were imprisoned or taken or arrested at that time".  Are you now saying that, in fact, in June, Dusabe was not arrested but he was arrested during 199 -- is it '93 or '92? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your Honour, I said around that time, around '92, and what I said is on record.  These are not fabrications.  The Prosecutor can check on this, can verify this if she wants.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So in June 1994 you did not arrest Dusabe; is that correct? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
No, I did not arrest him, because at that time he could not show himself in public.  He was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is what -- what I wanted to know.  Go on, counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court the yardstick you used in arresting the people you claimed you arrested in June 1994 for the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I informed the Chamber that at that time the conseillers, the communal conseillers and the responsables, heads of the cellule themselves, knew about the killings that had taken place.  They would collaborate with the communal judicial police and they would make a report to me when we would meet, in the short time that we had, because the war was ravaging (sic).  We would understand -- we could come to harmonise about the state of the situation, but -- because the war was approaching Ruhengeri préfecture and Mukingo, people fled.  This was disrupted -- but there was a process for arresting people, but this was disrupted by the war situation. 
Q.	So, in effect, the investigation was not concluded in -- before you fled Mukingo commune in 1994? 
A.	Hadn't it been for the war, the investigations would have continued, but the -- the war caused by RPF disrupted this process and the investigations did not go to their full conclusion because we had also plans to collaborate with the other bourgmestres from other communes to know the refugees who had taken -- who had played a role in these killings.  We had requested them to give us names of the refugees -- displaced persons who had played a role in these killings.  But again I say that because of the war, this was disrupted.  We were not able to agree -- to conclude the process.  Those who were arrested would be released.  The detention -- the facilities (sic) would be released and even -- there was no security on roads, and people had problems taking food supplies to detained persons. 
Q.	Witness, Musafiri was an Interahamwe, wasn't he? 
A.	Unless you make him one, but as far as I know, the period you've mention -- talking about Interahamwe -- I remember Musafiri; we were already looking for him because of his crimes.  So himself being an Interahamwe, I cannot testify to his being an Interahamwe. 
Q.	Dusabe, you said, could not show him himself in public when you were in office as bourgmestre; isn't it (sic)? 
A.	I will repeat it again: when Musafiri was arrested for persecuting people who were just passing by -- I would mention girls -- the accusation was that he was stopping girls from going to fetch water.  I arrested him as a deserter who had deserted from the war front.  That person, Your Honour, I even informed an officer -- I informed an officer from Mukamira camp.  He's the one who came and took him, and -- because we could not -- we could not imprison a soldier for a long period; there was a limit to this.  And he was not the only one, the only deserter we had there, imprisoned; we had imprisoned other deserters who were deteriorating, who were causing insecurity among the people. 
Q.	Witness, are you referring to Musafiri in this your last testimony or Dusabe? 
A.	You asked me about Dusabe, and I told you when we arrested him, because I talked about Musafiri enough, and I said this is not the first -- I did not imprison him once, twice.  I would arrest him, then he would escape from prison and I would again have him arrested.  And every time he would escape, he would escape with a gun.  Many serious crimes were commited and these -- these crimes were being committed by people like him, deserters like him.
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was that? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I'm hearing two names, Musafiri, Dusabe, so I don't know which one he's testifying to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you're addressing --
MS. OJEMENI:
Dusabe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  I think it was Musafiri. 
MS. OJEMENI:
My first question was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned RGM and (microphone not on) --
MS. OJEMENI:
My first question was Musafiri.  When we finished, I went on to Dusabe, and in response I was hearing Musafiri, Dusabe, so that was why I asked the question whether he was refering to Dusabe or Musafiri.
MR. PRESIDENT:
To my recollection, the question you are dealing with, which gave rise to that long answer about, was Musafiri.  I cannot -- whether or not Musafiri was Interahamwe.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, I asked that, and when I finished with that, I went on to Dusabe, and then Dusabe, I was now hearing Musafiri being referred to as well.  Even in this last question he mentioned Musafiri and Dusabe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we are dealing with Musafiri.  The previous was: "I know Musafiri" -- you had asked about Musafiri, about his being Interahamwe, and the witness said, "Well, as far as Musafiri is concerned, he cannot testify to the effect that Musafiri was an Interahamwe".  And I think he went on to explain, you know, the occasions that he had had to arrest him.  Maybe you can put back your question and then -- and that he was a deserter and then you went on.
MS. OJEMENI:
On Musafiri, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Musafiri, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
That's why I asked him, are we talking about Musafiri or Dusabe.  Your Honour, that's what I asked, and then he now went on and started talking about Dusabe.  I --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't hear any "Dusabe" in recent terms.
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay.  Let me ask my question.  Yes, he's been talking about him.  I have been hearing it on my earphones, and even what she has written there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you have it clarified, counsel?  Maybe you deal with one aspect or person, one after another.
MS. OJEMENI:
That's what I've been doing, Your Honour.  That's what I've been doing. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Musafiri was not a soldier, was he -- or was never a soldier, was he? 
A.	Your Honour, I think we are moving backwards.  I would like you then if the Prosecutor is saying that Musafiri was never a soldier, let me tell you about him --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Answer the question, please, what you know about him.  Was he a soldier?  And then please give us the answer to that. If there's any additional explanation, you can give, but it should be brief. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
The question is confusing.  He was a soldier and deserted.  After deserting -- I don't see how I can confirm that he was a soldier when he deserted --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, the question being asked is, was Musafiri a soldier, what do you say to that, and then you can explain whatever you want to explain.  I'm sure you understand that much. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Musafiri was soldier, Your Honour. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Why did you arrest Musafiri in June 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  I arrested him June '94, this -- I believe if it wasn't the third then it was the fourth time that we had arrested him.  The first time we arrested him was when he came in wearing military uniform, because the way he was conducting himself before being a soldier, he could not be allowed to join the military.  So he went to his elder brother in Kigali and he was enrolled as a soldier, came back as a soldier, and then he started beating people and we arrested him.  So the officer in charge of him later on had him released and took him.  The second time that he came back it was during a situation.  He had a gun and wanted to shoot people in Byangabo --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, you are talking about that -- counsel asks you what you -- why did you arrest -- for what reason did you arrest Musafiri in June 1994.  You have talked about Musafiri I think a number of times, so the question being put to you, that is standing, still standing, is why or for what reason did you arrest Musafiri in June 1994, that means after you had taken office as a bourgmestre. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Although considerations -- Your Honour, I thank you, because you have helped me a lot.  He was arrested in June '94, because all reports -- many reports were saying that he was one of the people who conducted massacres in the Mukingo commune area. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did you have powers to arrest -- as a bourgmestre to arrest soldiers? 
A.	Your Honour, you didn't allow me to make any comments about this person named Musafiri.  When he was caught, he was a deserter, he was no longer a soldier, because later he was expelled from the army, then he became a killer.  In fact, that the Prosecutor asked me whether I had the power to arrest soldiers, it's not true.  And whenever I got him arrested, I used the soldiers to arrest him.  They were the ones who would come and pick him.  But when he was arrested in June, he was arrested as a criminal, not as a soldier.
Q.	Musafiri was an Interahamwe in 1994, and you knew it, didn't you? 
A.	What you are talking about, me, I'm not aware of it.  What the Prosecutor is saying, I'm not aware of Musafiri being an Interahamwe, because he was (sic) a person who'd fit into the society.  He was a thief; he was a murderer; he was not acceptable in the society.  I cannot testify about it before this Chamber; I would be telling lies.  I don't know; I'm not aware of it. 
Q.	Witness, you testified that Dusabe could not come out in public when you were bourgmestre in June 1994.  Why was that so? 
A.	When it became clear -- thank you very much -- when it became clear -- when we started looking for criminals during that short period that we had, there were many who decided to threaten us, especially those who had deserted from the army, especially as they were armed with guns.  So at that time, the only way to find them, the -- they were not available and we required some special assistance, especially the gendarme.  Those people were killers and they didn't respect any authority, and they would even try to kill the -- anybody.  And in June 1994 we had very little time.  The fact that we did not arrest him, it was not because we wanted it.  It was not planned.  We were looking for a way of cooperating with the préfectural authorities, and it wasn't possible because of the war; but looking for them was in my plans.  Thank you. 
Q.	But it was possible for you to arrest Musafiri and not Dusabe, wasn't it? 
A.	This is what you are saying.  This is what the Prosecutor is saying.  Why had I arrested him before, that Dusabe?  Why didn't I arrest him later, especially as he was known as a criminal?  Even the plan to arrest him with his friends, I intended to do that with the help of the police inspector who was in charge of Mukingo commune.  We had such plans but, you know, arresting a person, I don't know anyone who did the job of arresting people and people who are in charge of security.  You don't put up a notice before you go to arrest a person.  If you want to arrest a person, you do it secretly, and at a time when he's not aware that he's been pursued. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you did not conduct any investigation with regard to the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune when you took office in June 1994, nor did you arrest anybody in respect of the killing of the Tutsis.
A.	Mr. President, this is what the Prosecutor is suggesting.  I know the role I played in pursuing those people, and even before -- but you didn't give me the opportunity to talk about it.  But I tried all my best, especially amongst the Tutsi that were massacred.  There was my godfather and the whole of his family, and he was one of those who helped my parents.  I could not forget him.  There was Gatete among those people.  I was godfather to his son.  Among those people I had my sisters-in-law who were massacred.  I couldn't -- I could not afford not to pursue such people after becoming bourgmestre.  I'm very sad, especially because of the war that placed that kind of spirit between the Tutsi and the Hutu, especially in a situation where there was no such distinction between Tutsi and Hutu, where everybody was a brother and a sister.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we take note of your answer.  Can you now answer in precise terms the question being put by counsel.  Did you carry out investigation?  Did you pursue anybody?  Can we have a clear answer to that.  We know about the relations you have talked about in the course of your testimony.  Can you answer that?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
That is true. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that Dusabe and Musafiri were amongst the Interahamwes that you instructed on the 7th of April 1994 to go and look for Tutsi and kill them in Mukingo commune and Nkuli commune as well.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Mr. President, I testified as to where I was on the 7th.  What the Prosecutor is saying is not correct.  I said no to it and I gave every evidence about it.  There using such people is impossible since I was fighting them and I never used them.  I never entertained any idea of thinking ill of the Tutsi, especially many of them who were like brothers and sisters.  I never had any such evil thoughts about them.  This is what -- the fabrication that the Prosecutor is making against me. 
Q.	Witness, when you took office as bourgmestre, you set up a committee to distribute the property -- to sell and distribute the property of Tutsi population in Mukingo commune, didn't you? 
A.	Mr. President, this question that I had the power to distribute the property is not correct.  All this has to no basis whatsoever.  All I can say before you, Mr. President, this issue, there was the communal administration, the administration itself was in charge of property that was abandoned and how it could be used.  There I never met such a case and I never entertained any idea like that.  I did my job, working as a private person, and I've given evidence right now in my testimony -- I'm not using words.  I have written evidence that shows that the property left behind by the Tutsi were sold by the communal authorities at the time, since 1994 -- from April 1994 till June 1994.  The communal authorities was in existence and was in charge of such property.  This is on record.  My Defence will give you written documentation, and even the present administration of RPF can give you that.  What the Prosecutor is saying has no basis. 
Q.	**************************************************, were members of this committee for the sale and distribution of land of Tutsis in Mukingo commune; isn't that correct?
A.	I'm -- I made a mistake and I called the president of the republic.  But, sorry, I'm still requesting you that at a time when I wasn't available at Mukingo commune, I couldn't know what was taking place in the communal administration.  If Ndisetse was on that committee or Niyoyita, I have no knowledge whatsoever, and I'm telling you the full truth and nothing but the truth. 
Q.	Witness, you compensated Interahamwes with some of this land by distribute -- giving -- donating them to them after killing -- after the killing of the Tutsis, didn't you? 
A.	What the Prosecutor is saying, Mr. President, was actually disproved by the evidence I gave.  And what was done in the management of such property, ********************************** who was a *************************************** how the property left behind by the Tutsi was managed.  He was not the only one.  There are many other people who talked about it, and I feel what is being suggested is wrong.
Q.	Witness, let us assume that's what happened.  What did you do as a bourgmestre, when you took over, to find out what happened to the property of Tutsis who were killed and some who had fled? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  On the Prosecutor's question on how the property of the Tutsi was managed, I'm telling you that the time that was available to me to help the commune from the 26th June 1994 did not allow me to know the extent to which the communal authorities  managed it and sold it and how much it was sold for.  That would have been done by the communal authorities in charge of that.  

But the ministry was no longer functioning in Kigali.  The government had fled the capital, and during June the government was still fleeing and leaving Gitarama.  There was nowhere I could have got into contact with those would were in charge of the general directorate of communal affairs.  It was not easy.  There were no leaders that came to find out how the property was being handled.

What I can confirm is that the communal authorities handled this, the properties.  There were receipts issued by the communal authorities, showing that money was paid into the commune coffers.  When the land was exploited by the inhabitants when the RPF took over power, the Tutsi took over that land that had been exploited and continued to exploit it.  So the Prosecutor shouldn't confuse the two issues. 
Q.	Witness, you met daily with the conseillers when you took over in June 1994, and they submitted their reports to you, that way you knew what was happening in the commune, didn't you, or isn't it true?
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can be slow in your answer so that translation can come through easily and smoothly, and be brief, please.  But say whatever you want to say in brief terms. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you for the advice.  I like it.  

At the time -- the short period we had, I used to meet the conseillers, but each would come on his own, giving me a report on what is happening in his secteur.  There are some others who don't even go to their own secteur because there was fighting going on and very few people were left there.  But as she asked, I used to meet them, but I would meet them individually rather than collectively. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	That did not afford you time to find out what, in fact, happened to the land of Tutsi or property of Tutsi in their various secteurs; is that correct? 
A.	Apart from Shingiro secteur, which was close to the combat zone, others would report how the land was being handled by the communal authorities.  The -- whatever concerns the other properties, I cannot say it.  I cannot say before the Chamber how much was paid to the commune from the exploitation of the Tutsi land, but the services of the commune could not intervene to give the state, so I could not tell exactly what was happening with the land which was left to the commune. 
Q.	Witness, why did you refer to it as the exploitation of Tutsi land? 
A.	Mr. President, allow me.  It seems that the exploitation of Tutsi -- land belonging to the Tutsi is not clear, because that land has boundaries.  Maybe the idea of land, arable land, there is a difference, but there are plots and properties which would get clear about the proper appellation.  There's no such thing as Tutsi land in what I said. 
Q.	Witness, is it fair -- what happened to the Tutsi regarding the property of Tutsi, as you have testified, is it fair to acquire the land or the property of Tutsi and share it amongst Hutus for farming or for rental? 
A.	You will excuse me.  The question is still confused.  She's asking me how, how come -- what happened is that the land that belonged to the Tutsi is that the commune took over the land and would hire it out every year, so that whoever is rentting that land would renew the rental the following year so that the -- that person who is renting it may not call it his or her own private property.  I use the reports from the conseillers, and they said that the land was being rented for -- on a yearly basis and the money would go into the communal coffers.  And I would say I didn't have time to find out how much was paid for the rent of such land because there was simply no time for that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question was, was that fair or appropriate to treat or to deal with Tutsi land in that manner.  Is that your question, counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Because the land was left behind, the people could just take it and add it to their own land and called it their own, and that would become their private property, definitely.  So according to what I know, the commune could not accept that, because in between they thought that peace would come back and the Tutsi would come back and take back their property.  That is why the communal authorities took the property and managed it to avoid that the other people would appropriate it.  And I feel that is a fair way of handling the land, because this could even bring confusion among the ordinary citizens, and I feel that the steps taken by the commune was appropriate in order to avoid that kind of illegal proposition.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	So, witness, in effect, there was no law on how to treat abandoned property or Tutsi property in June 1994, was there? 
A.	Mr. President, I said it before, when I was testifying a few days ago.  The law existed that explained the way and the type of communal property.  There was what we called -- what we called communal property or the property that belongs to the commune.  

The communal resources were provided for by the law if such a thing like land was left behind, it should -- that it should be handled by the commune and managed by it, but if the property owner would come back, he would take it back or it would remain the property of the commune.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	In June 1994, would you consider property of Tutsi as abandoned? 
A.	It is not true.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is not true?  We would like to understand. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
She asked if I thought that the property of the Tutsi was abandoned.  I said that that is not correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was not abandoned, would that be the answer you're giving? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
In French there is what you call "lost" and there's what you call "abandoned".  So I retain the word "abandoned" rather than "lost".  So abandoned is the correct terminology.  So I confirm that such property was abandoned.  I agree with you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I'm not saying that.  The question counsel is asking, was it in June. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
The problem is probably that another interpretation is being given.  I am suggesting that this is -- this could be termed "abandoned property".  I'm confirming that this property had been abandoned by the Tutsi and the commune took over that in order to manage it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So the answer is in June that was abandoned property, is that correct, the Tutsi land?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Okay.  But it is different in Kinyarwanda.  It's -- the suggestion that it was lost is not correct.  I prefer using the word "abandoned".
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are using the word "abandoned".  Let us be specific. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
The witness is saying that there were two different words being used.  He is saying it is not "lost", but "abandoned", and so he should not be sanctioned because he is, in fact, clearing the fact of his confusion.  He says the property was  -- he's affirming "abandoned" and not "lost".  I am only hearing "abandon" in English; I'm not hearing "lost".  But he is -- apparently is confusing between these two words.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, I think we have taken the trouble to ask this question.  The Court itself has done that in trying to follow up what he was -- from his answer.  I think we should be assisted.  If there is any doubt, then you can ask the question being put back to the witness. 
I think we have asked this question:  according to you, in June was that Tutsi property abandoned.  What do you say to that? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
With due respect, that's not the way the question was asked.  She asked whether it was lost property, so we --
MR. PRESIDENT:
In the English that's the translation we got.  Can you put back your question, and we take note of these aspects that are being raised.  Put the question back.  Put it back.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in June 1994 would you consider the property of Tutsi population in Mukingo commune as abandoned property? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Such property was being managed by the commune.  When I reached -- when I became bourgmestre, the property was under the management of the commune and, therefore, it could be located.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was it abandoned?  What do you say to that question?  Was it abandoned property, according to you, or what?  Can you answer that question? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
As far as I'm concerned, I'm talking about the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
In June, those properties were under the communal authority.  They had been abandoned before, but at that time it was handled by the communal authorities.  So that property could have been -- was under the authority of the commune, because at the time there was somebody who was officially recognised, and it was the communal authorities that were handling such property.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So what's the answer?  It was abandoned property or not abandoned property, according to you?  Abandoned or not? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Please, counsel. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, counsel, we hear you. 
MR. HINDS:
I'm having problems with the equipment.  I think -- the confusion I'm --
MS. OJEMENI: 
Please, Your Honour.  This witness is civilised.  This witness understands my question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let counsel say.  He is an officer of the court.  Let's hear him. 
MR. HINDS:
I think the question is, prior to the authorities taking control of the property --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.
MR. HINDS:
-- was it abandoned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  He understands the question, counsel.  He understands that question very well.  We have to have the answer to that question. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your Honour, I understood the question, and I have given a proper answer.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we want to know was, according to you in June, tell us, was that Tutsi land abandoned or not.  That's the language we are using, that has been asked in the question, and we believe you understand that question. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
It is true, Mr. President, in June '94 that property was under communal administration, but it was -- it had been abandoned -- in June it had been left behind by the Tutsi, but it was under communal administration in June.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it was treated as abandoned land, was it? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
There are people that were renting it from the communal authorities, but the commune knew.  I mean, the communal administration was managing that --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.  We know that.  We know that evidence that you have given on that.  But we want to know, was it considered to be abandoned property, according to you, for the commune to be able to do that that you say that they do, was it, or was it not?  Was it considered to be abandoned property?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
The commune took over after the property had been abandoned.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should have said that a long time ago.  But we understand that you have understood the question.  We take note of that. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, let the record reflect that this witness is evading my question.  He has not answered it --
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, we take note of the answer given by the witness.  The Trial Chamber is following the testimony of the witness, as it would do with any other witness.  The testimony is being made before it and we take note of what is all going on. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time, I don't know if you want to take a break.  I had thought it was something that would be a few hours, but --
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time?  What are the time frames for the sake of applying?
MS. OJEMENI:
Another two or three hours, depending on how the witnesses answers.  But I won't keep Your Honours long.  I'll certainly finish today, and I'll finish to enable my learned friend to start his cross.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Re-examination.
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm sorry, re-examination.
MR. HINDS:
Is it some presumption that after she as taken three days that I will finish my redirect in 15 minutes?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that is not --
MR. HINDS: 
What she said, Your Honour, is that she will finish in enough time for me to do my re-direct.  That's what she said.
MS. OJEMENI:
I'm taking the three days that you took.  How about that?
MR. HINDS:
Two and a half.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
So mine will be two and a half as well.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Accused, witness?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  What surprises me is that I am evading his (sic) questions and I haven't evaded any single question from her.  I have respected --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, please, leave that to counsel and the Court.  Okay.  Thank you. 

So, we adjourn for the lunch break, and when we come we'll come at -- we'll resume our work at twenty-five to three, twenty-five to three, twenty-five to three.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court recessed at 1307 to 1440H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  Continue with the cross-examination of the witness by the Prosecution.  Ms. Ojemeni, learned counsel, can you continue your cross-examination, please? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honours. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court what happened to the property of Rachel in 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The question asked by the Prosecutor concerning Rachel's property, I know this issue in general.  In general, like other property by (sic) Tutsis, it was taken in the same way as the property of other Tutsis, and it was being taken care of by the commune at that time. 
Q.	Wasn't this property in Busogo cellule -- I'm referring to Rachel's property? 
A.	It is possible that she had property even elsewhere, but yes, I know that her home was in Rwankeri cellule, not Busogo cellule. 
Q.	Rwankeri was in Busogo secteur - I mean, is in Busogo secteur; is that correct? 
A.	It is correct. 
Q.	Now, Kisayaka (sic) was her neighbour, wasn't he? 
A.	The name is Kaziyake not Kisayaka.  It is correct; that was her neighbour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out the name, interpreter?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
K-A-Z-I-Y-A-K-E, Kaziyake. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, wasn't this land given to Interahamwe to farm by you? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  This question raised by the Prosecutor is hearsay, but it has no basis.  There was ********************************************************************************* what happened, and I've told you that it's in a file on record.  What she is saying is not correct. 
Q.	Now, witness, what happened to Munyemvano's property? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The question given by the Prosecutor concerning Munyemvano's property, as far as I know, and according to evidence available, is that the -- Munyemvano's property was under the care of the commune, was taken -- was under the care of the commune until members of Munyemvano's family came back and got back that property. 
Q.	Witness, by the time Munyemvano's family came back, you were no longer in Mukingo commune, were you? 
A.	I wasn't in Mukingo commune, but the evidence available says that Munyemvano's family got back the property. 
Q.	Witness, didn't you give part of Munyemvano's property to RHU29? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
RHU? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Twenty-nine, Your Honour; his witness. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  What the Prosecutor is saying concerning my having given the property to RHU29 is not right.  ********************************************************************************
          Munyemvano, ************************************** and confirmed that the testimony being given now was -- by the Prosecutor is wrong.  There is nothing correct -- there is nothing that was said by the witnesses, including her own witness.  This is a fabrication by herself to make propaganda.  It does not appear anywhere in the testimony or evidence given in this -- before this Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, what is the precise answer to that question? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
In short, I said that what the Prosecutor is saying is false.  There was no evidence to this effect. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you just testified ****************************************************************.  Is it then fair for me to say that if indeed he farmed the land of Munyemvano, there's nothing wrong with that? 
A.	This is what you are saying yourselves.  Mr. President, I gave evidence saying that they were ************************************************************** He never said anything in the testimony he gave here that he either obtained or purchased anything of Munyemvano's property from the commune.  The witness confirmed that the members of the family of Munyemvano got back the property of Munyemvano.  What the Prosecutor is saying -- there is no basis for what the Prosecutor is saying, and there was no evidence given in this regard, whether from our own witnesses or from her own witnesses. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Excuse me. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, when you became the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in June 1994 your life was no longer threatened by RPF; is that correct? 
A.	Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying has no basis.  I have shown before the Chamber, this Chamber, that my security was not okay, especially considering the letter given by Patrick Mazimpaka to the minister for foreign affairs in -- on 17th of -- on 17th of March '93, requesting the minister, who was a member of the opposition, to fight me, and this was being requested by the RPF.  It wasn't only the RPF; even the deserters, the soldiers who had deserted, were armed, and who were bandits, who could threaten my security.  It was even said on Radio Muhabura that there was a big issue here.  I cannot deny it and I cannot hesitate to confirm.  It is also part of the evidence given by the witnesses here to know the truth about what happened in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Witness, we are addressing the period June 1994, and I'm asking, is it fair for me to say that your security was now -- was no longer in danger; it was safe for you to parade yourself as the bourgmestre, move around, without any threat by RPF? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I said that part of Mukingo commune had been deserted by the people in the Shingiro secteur because of the battles from RPF.  Many people are leaving where they were living; the government left Kigali for Gitarama and later on left Gitarama for Gisenyi.  You would not know whether someone would be here or run away tomorrow.  Now, saying that my security was okay, has no basis at all because people were disappearing just like that, and many who ran away -- you could meet a person today and tomorrow you would not see the same person again.  Apart from me, even the military people, the way they were deserting the war front, they too had problems, and yet they had more powers, more capacity than me.  It is clear, therefore, that in fact my security got worse because -- as problems worsened. 
Q.	Witness, how were you able to do your work, because in the past you said you were hiding in Nkuli commune?  How were you now able, in June, to do your work as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The question put to me by the Prosecutor, saying that I was able to do my work in June and adding that during that time -- I would say that there were communal police at that time who could escort me whenever I was working in Mukingo commune.  This police force was insufficient to guard my security, and what I'm talking about as -- has got written evidence.  RPF members had done infiltration in the area and they were shelling -- causing explosions here and there to cause the flight of people in the internally displaced person's camps.  And that is what happened in Kinigi commune and in Nkumba commune; there were explosions reported near the camp so that the displaced persons could run away.  To say that there was no question, no problem with my security, this is not true.  It's even on record: the person who was préfet or sous-préfet, Kaju Neodous (phonetic), wrote about it, saying that the RPF had infiltrated everywhere and could do anything it wanted.  My security therefore was not assured. 
Q.	But you managed to do your work in Mukingo commune without hiding in Nkuli commune; is that correct? 
A.	As to my hiding in Nkuli, in the evidence I've given, I said I tried to do my best to carry out my duties and also to see -- to look after my security.  I could not go all over the commune because there was little security.  It was obvious and everybody saw this.  An official could do what he could do.  During that short time that I spent as a bourgmestre of the commune, people were running away.  If there was enough security, people would not have run away.  You can image, if there had been enough security, I wouldn't have run away; the people wouldn't have run away.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but counsel is asking you whether you were able to work and stay in Mukingo commune during that period of time of your bourgmestreship (sic). 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  She had not stated it that way.  You are now re-arranging the question better.  I thank you.  

As to my staying in Mukingo commune, it was impossible.  During that short time, that's when my family within Mukingo commune had to run away, and I had to work, going back to Nkuli, or go to Gisenyi and come back to work in Mukingo.  My family ran away, not on 13th of July, as everybody; my family fled a week before all of us ran away, because of insecurity, because of insecurity.  Therefore, there was no -- not enough security for me to spend a night in Mukingo commune.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	But, witness, during the day you were in Mukingo commune, weren't you? 
A.	I was in Mukingo commune.  I couldn't stay in one place.  It wasn't easy to do so.  According to people's movements and checking about their running away, to run away from the war -- war front, I had to do a lot of movement, moving around, to check the situation. 
Q.	But given your position as bourgmestre, it was easy for the RPF to identify you, wasn't it? 
A.	Sorry.  I had that position, yes, but the name -- the RPF had even my name and my photographs.  I stated once that RPF representatives worked in Mukingo commune in 1993 when they were working with the neutral monitoring group when they were circulating with the -- with the Rwanda army officers.  They once spent a night in a place called ISAE, the institute, and I can tell you the names of the RPF members who were meeting me.  They knew me well.  They spoke about me on Radio Muhabura because they knew me, and I could not hide from them.  They were giving -- they were giving lists of areas where infiltration would be taking place. 
Q.	So it is then a lie for you to say that your security was in danger before you became a bourgmestre?  If they knew you and could even meet with you, your security, obviously, was not in danger, was it? 
A.	To accept that I wasn't secure would it be the fact that I was dead.  I have given you examples, and many witnesses have given evidence showing that people were being killed within the internally displaced persons camps, and those people were killed by the RPF.  Some of the people who gave evidence here were members of the ENMOG, the neutral monitoring group, and you cannot -- you cannot impute this on me, forgetting the problems that arose in Ruhengeri.  More than 40 people were killed -- 40,000 people were killed.  The important thing is that there was really no security since the RPF attacked the country. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, is it then fair for me to say that when you took over the position of bourgmestre, you were not as scared as you were before you became the bourgmestre, you were no longer scared of the RPF; is that correct? 
A.	It is not correct.  Even apart from me, lots of people were getting killed, killed by the RPF.  Everybody knows this.  There was a lot of scare (sic), lot of fear.  People were fleeing.  Why were they fleeing?  They were fleeing from killings.  Why were they fleeing?  It's because the attacks were getting closer to their area and people were running, and if that hadn't been the case, I wouldn't have arranged for the flight of my family from Mukingo.

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, why did you then come out of - come in to limelight or public eye to be a bourgmestre when your life was threatened by RPF?  Why?  Could you tell this Court? 
A.	If I accepted the risk, it is because there was no alternative.  And, Mr. President, on this issue raised by the Prosecutor that I accepted to go to accept that job, knowing that my security wasn't okay, I would like to confirm before this Chamber that there were negotiations in Tunis that brought together RPF and the interim government which was governing at that time.  We thought that things would go better during the negotiations in Tunis.  There was signing for ceasefire.  Therefore, when you heard that there was a ceasefire, people felt that -- I felt that I loved the people and I had to try and help them, and there was no way I could run away from this.  I felt that -- the main objective in these negotiations was finding peace.  It is not that my security was okay, but I was hoping that peace would return; it did not.  It was not so, but those negotiations took place.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the witness be shown Exhibit D56.
MR. PRESIDENT:
D56?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before that, perhaps, Counsel, we would like to know, witness has mentioned about negotiations, ceasefire, Tunis negotiations.  When were these?  Were they happening at the time when he assumed the position of bourgmestre for the second time in June?  Was it a time when these negotiations or these discussions that you have talked about -- we would like to know the time frame. Do you understand?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The negotiations --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel was addressing the period in June when you took over the position of bourgmestre again, so we would like to know the negotiations or Tunis meeting you have just mentioned as you were answering this question.  When did these meetings or discussions take place?  Is it during this period of time in June? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
It was during that June period, between the 10th and 15th of June, that period.  It is on record, and I believe the Prosecutor has got such a record.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go on, Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you come to the projector. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The exhibit is?

MR. PRESIDENT:
G --
MS. OJEMENI:
GAP.
MR. PRESIDENT:
GAP.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The Interpreter did not get the whole question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe, Counsel, you may wish to see how best you can deal with protected witnesses.
MS. OJEMENI:
I mentioned GAP -- oh.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Stick down to your -- you see, there is no way we can deal with this situation.  When we are dealing with a protected witness, there are certain mechanisms.  That is what you should bear in mind, Counsel, and, in fact, all of us.  But in a situation when you are dealing with non-protected testimony, it is difficult to exercise certain limitations.  I hope you understand what we are saying.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Go on. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you answer my question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Accused Witness, can you use the pseudonym in your answers?  Do you understand?  Stick to the pseudonym.  I do not know whether it would be possible.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, it doesn't matter.  If -- once we put time frames and titles to the pseudonyms, we have a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the initial problem in the question.  Now we are saying, in further discussion, perhaps we stick down to the pseudonyms, whether it is for this particular witness and what have you, so that we do not have to link up.  If the need comes to linking up, then we have to find a different way of dealing with the situation.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, as you recall, I asked the question about GAP, but that was -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, is it really necessary in elaborating on this issue, given the problem you have already drawn my attention to?
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, may I?  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As long as you don't make the situation more difficult.
MR. HINDS:
What I am saying is, what we did, we in fact went, as you recall, into closed session because I, in fact, on that last witness, I realised that no matter how you dealt with it, you know, just in terms of title, proximity, et cetera, we would have a problem.   And so -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the record is clear.  This is consistent obstruction of justice. 
MR. HINDS:
Counsel, please.  It is inappropriate what we are dealing with.  Let me put this on the record in order to assist the Tribunal.  The way I dealt with it, the very same witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we follow you, Counsel, because if the problem is that, any further discussion doesn't help the situation.  We follow you in what you are saying.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the record is very clear. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you now answer my question?
A.	You can assist me by repeating the question.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, can we then go to the closed session.

MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be the easiest way.  We will go into closed session in order to enable counsel to raise questions with the witness, some of which could have some bearing on some protected witnesses, not necessarily the one being mentioned, it would include this.

Registry, are we there?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes, My Lord.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you also show the office used by other communal policemen in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  Apart from -- even not only in Rwanda, any policeman had their individual offices.  They would meet in the brigadier's office in order to have daily instructions.  So, no other policemen had individual offices.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
Q.	Witness, correct me if I am wrong, Sinaribonye, Nashasson, was a communal policeman --
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Could we have the spelling of the second name, please?  I didn't get the second name.
MS. OJEMENI:
I will do the spelling, please.
MR. KIYEYEU:
It is okay.  I just wanted to draw your attention.
MS. OJEMENI:
I will tell them.
MR. KIYEYEU:
I know, I know.  Continue, please.
MS. OJEMENI:
Sinaribonye, Nashasson, was a communal policeman in Mukingo commune.  I'll spell the name.  I want to spell the name.  I don't know if the interpreters can be correct.  N-A-S-H-A-S-S-O-N.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda name is Sinaribonye, S-I-N-A-R-I-B-O-N-Y-E.  That is the Kinyarwanda name.  It was N-A-S-H-A-S-S-O-N.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you remember the question, Witness?  Would you like to have it put back?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I request that the question be repeated to me, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you put your question, I hope?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in June 1994, Sinaribonye, Nashasson, was a communal policeman in Mukingo commune; is that correct? 
A.	I remember that this Sinaribonye, Nashasson, had been expelled.  So this would have to be checked.  I know that at one time he was expelled; his services had been terminated.  I don't know if by that time he was in service. 
Q.	Sinaribonye ********************************
A.	It is not true.  ***************************************************************************************** -- he came from **********************************************
Q.	He was a retired soldier, wasn't he, before he became a communal policeman in Mukingo commune before June 1994? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	He was employed by you when you were first -- between 1988 and 1993 when you were the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune; isn't that correct?
A.	You requested me to correct you, but rather, at one time he was a member of the national police, that situation existed.  After that as the question you put to me, at one time he was hired as a communal policeman during the time you mentioned. 
Q.	He was employed by you, wasn't he? 
A.	It was the commune that employed him. 
Q.	You were the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune when he was employed.
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Where is he now? 
A.	As of now, I don't know where he is.  It is because when we were in the camp, I left him there.
Q.	You cannot recall when his services were terminated by the Mukingo communal office; is that correct? 
A.	It may be possible that it was in 1992 or 1991, so this would have to be checked in the records because it is written in these records.  I cannot confirm because I may be mistaken. 
Q.	He participated in the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune in 1994, didn't he? 
A.	I don't know because I had not yet carried out any investigation that led to his culpability, so you should continue with your investigations and see where they may lead you. 
Q.	Avith Muhunde was your driver.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Counsel, what is the name?
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Avith Muhunde was your driver, wasn't he, in June 1994?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	He was also your driver between 1988 and 1993 when you were the bourgmestre of Mukingo communal office? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You are aware that he is in Ruhengeri prison, and he is charged with the killing of Tutsi population in Mukingo commune, aren't your?
A.	I heard about that.
Q.	You are aware that he has also confessed to the charges levelled against him by the Rwandan authority, aren't you? 
A.	I am not aware of that.
Q.	Now, Witness, why did you not arrest him for the active role he played in killing the Tutsi population when you were carrying out the investigation that you have testified about? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honour, Mr. President.  When the Prosecutor said that I never arrested Muhunde, I would like to inform you that among the witnesses that the Prosecutor brought before this Chamber, no one of them said that this Muhunde she mentions played a role in the killings.  I would also add that in June 1994 when investigations were being conducted, that Muhunde was alive, and no one has ever pointed out at him as having ever taken a part in the killings.  If he confessed to these charges, it is because at that time no one mentioned about this, and also this could be concerning about the interests in that whoever confesses to these charges is released but by levelling accusations against other, so he might have done this and confessed.  But for me, I would say that we were still continuing our investigations, and we would in the end arrest others apart from the ones you have mentioned, Counsel.  So we had not yet concluded our investigations.
Q.	Witness, can you also indicate --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two things, please.  If he is no longer required for the sketch plan that is on the screen, he can come back to the witness stand.
MS. OJEMENI:
That is what I was just putting to him, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  And two, can we have that name spelt out. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Muhunde, M-U-H-U-N-D-E.  Actually, the first name, I am not --
MS. OJEMENI:
A-V-I-T-H.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the other name?
MS. OJEMENI:
A-V-I-T-H.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you have it confirmed by the witness, perhaps? 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, could you spell the name Avith.
A.	That is the right spelling of the names, Your Honour. 
Q.	Witness, can you also point out the jail where you said Musafiri was imprisoned? 
A.	Number 1 on this plan, this is where the communal jail was. 
Q.	Was that also where Dusabe was imprisoned in 1992? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You can go back to your seat. 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, let's now talk about your role in the affairs of ESTB, the school called ESTB.  Witness, ESTB was owned by Joseph Nzirorera; isn't it correct?
A.	It is not correct. 
Q.	Who were the owners of ESTB? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  This school had two names.  In short, the first was APEBU, the other one was ESTB.  Concerning the question put by the Prosecutor, this school belonged to association members.  It was -- it belonged to association members. 
Q.	Joseph Nzirorera was one of the association members, wasn't he?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Could you then tell the Court who these members were? 
A.	It is difficult for me to mention all their names, but I can give you some of their names. 
Q.	What is the constitution?  How many people were members of that association? 
A.	I believe we were about a hundred, if I am not mistaken, but it should be checked out. 
Q.	Could you then give the names of ten prominent members of that association? 
A.	Are you requesting me to give you names?
Q.	I am requesting you to give not the hundred members, just ten prominent members who were officers of the association.
A.	I would begin with Nsabimana, Deho.  I'll spell Nsabimana.  Nzirorera, Joseph; Bahembera, Alphonse; Maniraguha, Jacques.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell out these names?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Yes, Your Honour, I was waiting to spell after he had given all the names. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Go on. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, remember we are talking about the officers of the association.
A.	Kajelijeli, Juvénal; Kagano, Simone; Munyampeta, Gasper; Hategekimana, Emmanuel.  I think these were the -- I may be mistaken.  There were many.  It would require me to look through documents, and the documents are at the school.  Unless -- would he like me to repeat so that you see if you have the right names, the right names?
Q.	Witness, you can stop at the ninth name.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I spell the names: Nsabimana, N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A, Nsabimana, Deho.  The second, Nzirorera, Joseph, N-Z-I-R-O-R-E-R-A; Nzirorera, Joseph.  The third is Bahembera, B-A-H-E-M-B-E-R-A.  Bahembera, Alphonse.  The fourth, Maniraguha, M-A-N-I-R-A-G-U-H-A, Maniraguha, Jacques. The fifth, Kajelijeli, K-A-J-E-L-I-J-E-L-I.  Sixth, Kagano, K-A-G-A-N-O, Kagano, Simone.  Seventh, Munyampeta, M-U-N-Y-A-M-P-E-T-A, Munyampeta, Gasper.  Eighth, Hategekimana, 
H-A-T-E-G-E-K-I-M-A-N-A, Hategekimana, Emmanuel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what was the position of Nsabimana Deho? 
A.	He was the vice-president for the school -- for the association, rather. 
Q.	What was the position of Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	He was the president. 
Q.	What was the position of Bahembera, Alphonse? 
A.	He was a founding member who was even a member of the office, but I know he was a founding member. 
Q.	What was the position of Maniraguha, Jacques.
A.	He was also a founding member. 
Q.	What was the position of Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	He was a founding member and treasurer. 
Q.	What was the position of Simone Kagano? 
A.	He was also a founding member. 
Q.	What is the position of Munyampeta, Gasper? 
A.	He was also a founding member. 
Q.	How about Hategekimana, Emmanuel? 
A.	He was also a founding member. 
Q.	Now, Witness, what work did Nsabimana do in 1994?  What was his work? 
A.	Before RPF killed him, he was the chief of staff of the Rwandan army.
Q.	What was the work of Bahembera, Alphonse in 1994?
A.	He was in charge of the post office in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Was he residing in Mukingo in 1994 or he was in Ruhengeri? 
A.	He was working at Ruhengeri, but he would reside -- he would go back to -- he was living in Mukingo. 
Q.	What was the work of Maniraguha, Jacques? 
A.	He was a businessman, a self-employed businessman who was operating in Kigali. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who is this? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Maniraguha, Jacques.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What about Kagano Simone, what was his work in 1994? 
A.	He was an agricultural officer in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Munyampeta, Gasper, what was his work? 
A.	In 1994, he had died. 
Q.	What was his work before he died? 
A.	He was a businessman.  He was a self-employed businessman. 
Q.	In Mukingo commune, is that correct?
A.	He was operating his business in Kigali. 
Q.	What was the work of Hategekimana, Emmanuel?
A.	In 1994, he had died.
Q.	And what was his work before he died? 
A.	He was working with the African Development Bank. 
Q.	As what, what was his position in the bank? 
A.	I would be going too far, I am not sure, but he was one of the top cadres in the African Development Bank.  He was on the management team, but I wouldn't know  which position exactly he held.
Q.	Where was this bank situated or where was Hategekimana operating from before he died?
A.	He was working outside the country. 
Q.	Now, Witness, how were you appointed the treasurer of ESTB? 
A.	Thank you.  Mr. President, as usual, being a treasurer, one has to be elected, so the same happened in my case.  There was a meeting and I was elected as the treasurer for the school. 
Q.	When were you elected treasurer of the school?
A.	This was in 1990. 
Q.	What was the term of office of the treasurer? 
A.	We had not yet provided for the term of office for the treasurer, unless there were auditors who would come and audit and then they would find that the performance was poor, and then he would propose for him to leave.  So I had not been given any term of office, up to now I had not been given any term of office, and no one has ever replaced me in the position. 
Q.	Did the association have a constitution?
A.	That association had statutes, a constitution, and it had been approved by the minister in charge of justice and associations. 
Q.	What were your benefits as the treasurer of the school?  Do you recall? 
A.	Up to now, I never -- there was no interest to benefit for having been the treasurer, especially because that association was a non-profit organisation. 
Q.	In effect, the offices of the association were just the president and the treasurer; is that correct? 
A.	There was a president, vice-president and treasurer. 
Q.	There was no secretary, was there? 
A.	There was.
Q.	And who was the secretary? 
A.	The secretary for the association was, if I am not mistaken, it was Alphonse Bahembera. 
Q.	Who replaced Nsabimana when he died?  You said he died in 1994.  Who was then the 
vice-president? 
A.	Thank you.  Your Honour, at that time we were living in hard conditions up to the time we fled.  No meeting, no general meeting for the association had taken place. 
Q.	In fact, Witness, the key members of that association were the president, the treasurer and the secretary; is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	What is then the correct position?  Who were the key members, key officers? 
A.	What is true, what is correct is that somewhere -- these were some of the prominent members, but the list of members that I gave you, the ones that I mentioned, all these were prominent members, but this does not mean that others were also important because the constitution of the association allowed all members to say anything that could advance the interests of the association. 
Q.	Witness, we are now talking about the officers, and my question is this, that the key officers were the vice-president, the president, the general secretary and the treasurer; is that correct? 
A.	That is true, those are the ones who were concerned about the everyday life of the school. 
Q.	How many of you had the school cars to their disposal?  How many of the officers were using the school cars as their personal property? 
A.	I was the only one. 
Q.	Why were you the only one? 
A.	This is because the school association had requested me to monitor the every day-to-day performance and the activities of the school, the association and the school, so this required me to be there many times and this required the use of a vehicle.  In addition to this, as far as I was concerned, I was not getting any salary to do this, so I needed a vehicle in order to work for the school.  Because of the distance where I was living and where the school was, I needed a vehicle in order to perform my duties. 
Q.	Witness, this school is located in Busogo secteur in Mukingo commune? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	Where is the school located? 
A.	This school in Rwinzovu secteur at the border with Busogo. 
Q.	Is that part of the -- the board is in Rwinzovu secteur; is that your evidence? 
A.	I am using the commune map and the location of that school. 
Q.	Is it your evidence that no part of ESTB is within Busogo secteur; is that correct? 
A.	For me, when I say that the school is on Rwinzovu secteur, I am talking about the administration block, the school administration block is situated in Rwinzovu secteur. 
Q.	Does that then mean that part of the school itself is situated in Busogo secteur? 
A.	Apart from the dormitories -- I mean the residences of the teachers, the residences of the teachers are in a small part of Busogo. 
Q.	Now, Witness, from your testimony, it appears that you were an executive treasurer, were you not?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	So contrary to your claim that you did not frequent Mukingo commune when you left office as bourgmestre in 1993, in February 1993, you indeed visited or frequented the ESTB school to monitor the day-to-day activities of that school; is that correct?
A.	That is not correct.  There are some things that we have to distinguish.  The school had a head and it had also someone who is managing the school, and I was the treasurer, the school management and treasurer of the school.  If you wish we can distinguish this so that you know my duties, and what the school itself was supposed to perform as duties. 
Q.	Witness, you just testified that you had the car so as to enable you to monitor the day-to-day activities of the ESTB; is that not correct?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Is it not fair then for me to say that you frequented ESTB within the period you ceased to be bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, that is between February of 1993 and June 1994; is that correct?
A.	That is not correct because I was working according to a plan.  I had a plan, a schedule of how I should go visit the school to know the problems they had.  But otherwise, they had a headmaster as well as the people in charge of day-to-day life, and they knew they had a way of running the school, so it was not necessary for me to go there every day, but I would get to know all the problems that the school had, even without my having to go there. 
Q.	Witness, it is interesting to note that most Interahamwes who have testified so far in this case were students of ESTB, isn't it? 
A.	What you are saying, Your Honour, saying that the Interahamwe who gave testimony here were former ESTB students, this is something that is not true.  It is baseless because there is no person who was once a student in the school who gave testimony here, but what we are now learning is that the Prosecutor is now fabricating these witnesses.  Even people who were dismissed from the school have been given statements to come and give testimony before this Chamber.  But up to now, no student who attended that school has ever given testimony before this Chamber, apart from one.  And also what I know is, I know that he is not an Interahamwe.  He came to give testimony as a Defence witness, and he was not an Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, is it then fair to say that between 1993 and 1994, you knew each student of ESTB by heart? 
A.	Could you repeat the question, please?
Q.	Is it fair for me to say that between the period 1993 and 1994, you knew each student of ESTB by name? 
A.	I did not know all their names.  It is like if I asked you if you know the names of all ICTR staff members.  I did not know the names of all the students.
Q.	What gave you the locus then to challenge what I have said, if you knew that some were set and some were not students of ESTB?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I am basing myself on the people who have testified before this Chamber and the list you, the counsel, has given us.  So I affirm that I can base myself on the list of names you gave, and since then, the person -- the only person I can confirm that he was once a student of that school that you produced as a witness and there is no other. 
Q.	Witness, what car was the head of that school driving?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Could you repeat the question, Counsel?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not very clear.  Can you repeat your question, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	What car was the head of ESTB driving in 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  That school had three directors, three headmasters, and the way they succeeded each other, they used the school van.  This was a Toyota Hilux which was almost khaki in colour.  It was a Toyota Hilux, almost khaki in colour. 
Q.	Witness, in 1994, are you saying that there were three directors for ESTB in existence? 
A.	It had the third director.  I repeat what I said: I said that they succeeded each other.  At that time you mentioned, in 1994, it had -- two directors had been replaced by the third one, so it had one who was the third at that time. 
Q.	Witness, how many cars did the school have as a whole in 1993 and 1994? 
A.	It had two cars, two vehicles. 
Q.	How many people were in charge or running?  Was there any deputy director? 
A.	That is correct, he had a deputy director but whom I would say was a manager. 
Q.	And the two cars, one was used by you and the other one used by the director himself, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Witness, is it also fair for me to say that in any environment you find yourself, you took a leadership role?  Is that fair for me to say so? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question, because I don't understand what you mean by leadership role. 
Q.	You've testified that you were the executive treasurer of the association, and you had a car belonging to the school, and I am asking, this is the third situation you have testified on where you took a leadership role.  So I am now asking you, is it fair for me to say that in every situation or in every environment you find yourself, you took a leadership role; is that correct? 
A.	I just felt I was treasurer for the school.  As for whoever wanted to ask me a question about the school's resources, the school property, I would answer, I would give them the situation. 
Q.	Are you an educationist, Witness? 
A.	I don't understand the question.  Could you tell me in what framework being an educationist?  What I know is that I am a parent, I told you that I have children.  Maybe you ask me about teaching, but otherwise educating, I was born an educator. 
Q.	So in effect, it is right for me to say that you are an educationist by birth? 
A.	We should distinguish the two.  There is educating a child, bringing up a child or educating.  I know how to bring up children, but I was not a trained teacher. 
Q.	Now, Witness, when you were testifying regarding Mr. Gedion, the tenant of Isimbi, you stated that you knew about him as an MRND member because you played a big role in St. Joseph where he was a teacher; is that correct? 
A.	That is not correct. 
Q.	I will come back to that in a minute. Witness, let's move on to your assertion that Alexis Kanyarengwa influence your removal because you refused to join RPF; is that correct? 
A.	I think you are mixing words.  I said that he wrote to me.  I am not the only person that he wrote to.  He wrote to all the bourgmestres in the region that he knew, requesting them that they collaborate with him, and I am one of the people who received these letters, and he also knows it.  The fact that I refused to collaborate with him is one of the consequences that I was removed from being the bourgmestre, and this is in line with the letter written by Patrick Mazimpaka that I told you about.  You should not mix up things.  This is one of the consequences for this  And I believe that you called him during this weekend, and he knows me, he is the one who hired me, who employed me.  I spell Mazimpaka: M-A-Z-I-M-P-A-K-A. 
Q.	Witness, I am not characterising your evidence.  I am referring you to what you said.  Now, Alexis is a Hutu; is he not? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which Alexis?
MS. OJEMENI:
I am referring to -- I am now on Alexis Kanyarengwe.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Kanyarengwe, okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Instead of mentioning the full name, I am using Alexis, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I don't know how often it had been repeated.  We would like to be able to trace it.  Go on, Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, I said that Alexis Kanyarengwe is Hutu, is he not?
A.	That is what I knew, but I don't know the background to him, but I knew him as a Hutu. 
Q.	He was the chairman of RPF which was later regarded as a Tutsi party in 1994, isn't it? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Alexis Kanyarengwe in 1993--'94 was an important politician, was he not? 
A.	That is correct.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In 1990?
MS. OJEMENI:
Until 1993-'94.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, is it then fair for me to say that he must have been important enough to influence the government to remove you as you have stated, is it not, in Rwandan politics? 
A.	Thank you, Your Honour.  I think I answered this question in a detailed way.  I talked of how RPF had been attributed to the ministry of internal affairs, and in this, this was based on the negotiations that the Republic of Rwanda had had with the RPF.  So, it was the RPF that were to distribute these positions and it will, and actually proved that when RPF took over Rwanda, it is Kanyarengwe who took over that ministry.  So I don't think we should dwell too much on this.  He was important and he could give proposals.  I also mentioned about the letter written by Mazimpaka, Patrick, and whose date I gave you also.  I think you shouldn't try to find other proof.  There is written proof, written evidence. 
Q.	Witness, is your answer yes or no to my proposal?
A.	It is yes.
Q.	Let us assume that that is what actually happened, he influenced your removal.  Now, is it safe for me to say that Alexis Kanyarengwe knew that you were an important political asset in Mukingo commune, hence, he tried to influence you to join the RPF? 
A.	That is one of the reasons why he felt that some of the people he knew, whom he had worked with, joined his side. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't understand the answer.  Can you --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, this whole area was gone over on the 16th.  On the 16th this question was asked, the witness testified about what happened in 1991.  I mean, all of what the Prosecutor is now revisiting, in fact the witness was asked those questions relating to this removal.  He answered those and the role that this fellow Alexis played.  That was back on the 16th.  Objection.  Asked and answered, the whole area. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I have not asked the question I will put forward to the witness, and I am following it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MS. OJEMENI:
 It was in a different context.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is different, yes.  You can continue, Counsel.  We overrule the objection.  It may have been raised, but not in this context. 

Witness, you were trying to give an answer when counsel stood up.  We did not understand the answer that you gave.  Do you remember it?  Can you state it again? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Let the Prosecutor repeat the question because the Prosecutor mixed up the question. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, is it safe for me to say that Alexis Kanyarengwa knew that you were an important political asset in Mukingo commune, hence, he tried to lure you to join the RPF? 
A.	I would answer that besides myself and my position as a bourgmestre, I would say that in 1992, in 1991, 1992, besides myself, he would send people from a low position and they would come to me.  It wasn't a person who is highly placed like myself.  So he would send ordinary people.  So, I would say that he was recruiting us during the last times after the meeting between the RPF and the government of Rwanda was going to be implemented.  It wasn't necessary for him to look for prominent people, he could send anybody of any position.  He, for example, sent an ordinary person who had undergone training at Mulindi. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what is the answer to the question put to you by counsel, the answer?  Were you, according to him, an important asset or what?  What is the answer -- the question being asked by counsel.  We follow you, what you are saying.  What do you say in precise terms, a direct answer to that question?  
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I said no to this question, I wasn't a prominent political figure.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Alexis Kanyarengwe was already president of RPF in 1991 and 1992, wasn't he? 
A.	That is what I can recall. 
Q.	In your opinion, why would you -- why would Alexis Kanyarengwe lure you to join his party if you wouldn't make any meaningful -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that is answered, Counsel, you can go on.  You can leave that at this stage.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time, do I continue? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can take a break.
MS. OJEMENI:
I have exceeded the time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, it's okay.  Are you anywhere -- what is your time frames?
MS. OJEMENI:
I will be finishing today, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are finishing today, good.  Then we will take a break for 15 minutes.  We'll resume our work at half past four. 
MR. HINDS:
I didn't hear the Prosecutor.  Did she say she is not finishing or she is finishing?  I was --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel indicated that she may finish today.
MR. HINDS:
Oh, okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we will take a break for 15 minutes and resume our work at half past four.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
	(Court recessed at 1615H)
(Pages 65 to 77 by Sithembiso Moyo)











	(Court resumed at 1632H)
MS. OJEMENI: 
May I continue?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you testified that RPF was after your life when you left office in February 1993 and as a result you took shelter in Nkuli commune; is that correct?
A.	Thank you very much.  I explained sufficiently that I was working privately and I was staying in Nkuli commune for reasons of very little security.
Q.	And what caused the security that you were scared of?  What was the cause of the insecurity?
A.	I explained sufficiently that Radio Muhabura was persecuting me and there was lots of infiltrators, of RPF members, who were looking for administrators and responsible people and there exists a list of those people who were supposed to be eliminated.  I think there is a copy in the Office of the Prosecutor.  I think that list was given to the Trial Chamber No. III.  Those people were supposed to be eliminated, so there was no doubt whatsoever when -- especially as that list was verified and had been signed by Kanyarengwe himself and many people on that list died in the mean time.
Q.	And you were one of the people on the list that RPF wanted to kill; is that correct?
A.	I was one of those people persecuted by Radio Muhabura and Radio Muhabura belonged to RPF.
Q.	Witness, I asked about a list that you mentioned.  Can you answer that question?  You understand my question:  Were you one of the people on the list that you have referred to in your testimony that RPF wanted to kill?
A.	I was not on that list, but what I am saying is that Radio Muhabura was saying enough and many people died.  There are no -- there is no lack of evidence to that effect.
Q.	Witness, was it because of what Radio Muhabura was saying about you that convinced you that RPF was after your life?
A.	There are other -- there is more evidence, the person who brought me the letter told me about people that were being sought after during those hard times.  It wasn't only because of Radio Muhabura.
Q.	So it is your evidence that RPF was after your life when you left office as bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1993 up until you fled Mukingo commune in July 1994?
A.	Even before that.
Q.	Is it correct -- my statement, is it correct, can you answer it, do you understand it?
A.	What you are saying is correct.
Q.	Witness, is it then fair for me to say that you hated or had hard feelings for RPF in 19 -- between the period you knew RPF was looking for you up until you fled Mukingo commune in July 1994?
A.	Instead -- after the time I left the country, I didn't simply leave the country, I didn't simply flee.

MS. OJEMENI: 
Would you ask him to anser my question?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you answer the question now?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your Honour, her question, I cannot see it -- I cannot see what she is aiming it.  I have answered; I cannot add anything more.  If you allow me, let's, let's put it in a -- I don't want the public to hear it.  So, if you want, I could say it outside the public hearing.
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not on).
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, is it fair for me to say that you hated or had feelings for RPF?  

Witness, is it fair for me to say you hated RPF or you had hard feelings for RPF right from the time you were convinced that RPF was searching for you up to the time you fled Rwanda in July 1994?
A.	The answer is that I think the only way I can answer you should be in closed doors, otherwise I wouldn't answer that question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is closed up?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Closed session. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, this is not a protected witness, it is an accused, and the public are entitled to --
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I think in fairness to the witness --  I don't know what he is going to say, I don't know what his concerns are, but in fairness to him, he is saying that he will answer the question in closed session, and I think that that should be honoured if -- I don't think we can second guess what --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We cannot examine whether the matter is justified to be heard in closed session or not until we know what it is all about, so we will have to go into closed session to enable the witness to say what the answer is and we will then be in a position to know whether it is a matter that needs to be addressed in closed session or not.  

Yes.  We will go into closed session then to enable the Accused to explain. 

Are we there? 

MR. KIYEYEU:
Not yet, My Lord.  Just a minute, My Lord.

BY MS. OJEMENI:
Witness, while you were in exile the HCR accused you of intimidating the refugees in the camp and sent you to Kinshasa; is that correct?
A.	Except if you saw that somewhere, after the time I left Kinshasa, nobody ever asked me -- nobody asked me anything, nobody told me what I was being accused of.
Q.	Is that correct or not?
A.	I was never charged with anything.  There is not even a single file about it.
Q.	That was the basis you used in soliciting for financial assistance while you were in exile, wasn't it? 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I could explain to the Prosecutor.  When they took us to Kinshasa, they were saying that our presence in the refugee camps would not -- would encourage the refugees not to go back home, so they decided to move us to Kinshasa so that the ordinary citizens may go back home.  The year we spent in Kinshasa, the refugees didn't want to go home, but they were forced back home.  Saying that I used that in order to obtain money; it's nowhere documented in the RPF --  the RPF gives help but they don't distribute money.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The RPF or the --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The UNHCR, I beg your pardon.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	I am not referring to UNHCR as one of the people you appealed to for financial assistance, that is not what I am saying.  Rather, I am referring to the other people you wrote to asking for financial assistance when you were in exile.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
As -- Your Honour, if it is said that I wrote, it is good, and that writing could be read to me and I could find out whether it is mine.  It might not even be mine and we could verify the signature.  We could verify, but I cannot answer in a vacuum.  I need that document and it should be read to me.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, it is true that you UNSHCR (sic) accused you of intimidating the refugees in the camp; is it not?
A.	After today I am saying no because nobody accused me anywhere.  Where did the UNHCR -- why should they even accuse me, when I was asking for help?
Q.	I am not talking about help now, Witness.  I am talking about the accusation levied against you in the camp which resulted in your being removed or separated from your family in the camp and sent to Kinshasa.
A.	And I was saying that such a charge must be written somewhere.  If it is not written anywhere, I don't see any basis for you to say that people were accusing you (sic).  I was never accused by anybody.  I went there until I left there.  Nobody told us what we were being accused of.  The only thing is that our presence in the camps would cause the population not to think about going home.  What I find astonishing is that the UNHCR told us that they don't know about such a charge, and it was -- this was done by arrangement between the government of Kinshasa and the government of Rwanda to convince the refugees to go back.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now Witness, let's talk -- turn to Joseph Nzirorera.  Can you remind the Court where you were when you were arrested in June 1998 in Yaoundé?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Your Honour, I would wish -- you should help the Prosecutor.  I don't know whether -- when they were questioning me, I was never in Yaoundé.  It is in Cameroon; I have never lived in that country.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Were you living in Cameroon?
A.	I said Yaoundé is in Cameroon and I have never lived Yaoundé.
Q.	Where were you arrested, Witness?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you answer that question, where were you arrested, so that we can move fast?  Our time is going.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
The question is clear.  I was arrested in Cotonou, the capital of Benin Republic.
MS. OJEMENI:
That is true; he was arrested in --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
It is quite a while; it is true.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can you remind the Court where you were then?  Where in particular were you when you were arrested by the agents of ICTR?
A.	I was staying with Joseph Nzirorera because I didn't have the means of my own.  He gave me some -- somewhere to stay, and he was also harbouring some other people.  I wasn't alone.
Q.	How long were you in Joseph Nzirorera's house before your arrest in June 1998?
A.	I had spent about one year in that town.
Q.	And the one year you were with Joseph Nzirorera in his house, weren't you?
A.	I said he was accommodating me, yes, that is correct.
Q.	What names you were bearing in Cotonou or while you were in exile in Congo, Brazzaville?
A.	We can stay there.  In Brazzaville, I was called Gaspar Mbanzabugabo, and in Cotonou I was known as Kajelijeli, Juvenal, and both names are mine.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In which one -- Gaspar was in which country, Witness?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I was in Brazzaville in the Congo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You used which name?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
My name was Mbanzabugabo.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you spell that name?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
M-B-A-N-Z-A-B-U-G-A-B-O, Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the other one in which country, under which name did you use, you say?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
The second name is Kajelijeli, Juvenal , the one which is being used here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you use that one, you say?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Pardon?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why did you use that name Juvenal Kajelijeli.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
I used it in Benin Republic and that was the name that was known in Rwanda -- I was commonly known in Rwanda.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar, is a fake name; you only adopted that name in this Court on the 14th of this month, isn't it?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
What the Prosecutor is saying, Your Honour, is not correct.  How would she have seen it, if I didn't have it before.  I have had it since I was a child because back home --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Slowly please.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
-- because back home your parent gives you a name, that is, your mother will give you a name, and then your father will give you a name.  They give you names, and among those names there is one which is taken as an official name.  Here, what the Prosecutor is saying is not correct.  I had that name in Brazzaville, and what the investigators found, they found evidence that I was bearing that name.  This is not a new thing that I am bringing to this, to this Chamber.  If you had reached my home before and asked about Mbanzabugabo, they would point to me.  It is not an invented name.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, in Congo, Brazzaville, you were in exile, weren't you?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	All the witnesses that have testified so far, ******************* nobody had referred to you as Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar; isn't that correct?
A.	That is correct.  
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Back home, **************************************************************** always calls the father of so and so.  *************************************************************** Here, they said it here, but back in Rwanda they never ever called me by my name.  They respected it very much.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, can you refer this Court to any document bearing the name of Mbanzabugabo in Rwanda before July 1994?
A.	Except if you go to my secteur and ask them whether they know any person known as Mbanzabugabo, they will tell you it is Kajelijeli, son of so and so, and the name was given by his father.
Q.	You were never addressed as Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar, were you?
A.	My family always called me by that name.  That is how they know me.  If you go there, if you ask them whether they know Mbanzabugabo, they will tell you that it is me.  It wouldn't take time.  It is well known and all the neighbours know that name.
Q.	Mbanzabugabo was never your last name was it, even if it was your alias or the name you were known as, but it was never your last name, was it?
A.	In official documents only one name is used, but whenever I went home -- but my father used to call me Mbanzabugabo.
Q.	How did you come about Gaspar?
A.	It was my big brother who gave me that name.  It was a common practice.  Boys who were born when others were big, the big ones could give them names.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Ramaroson said the question was not translated in French.
MS. OJEMENI:
The last one?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the last one that the Witness has been answering.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, Mbanzabugabo was never your last name, was it?  Your last name was Kajelijeli?
A.	It is not true.  No one else had such a name and I never borrowed it from anyone.  What you are saying, Madam, the Prosecutor, has no basis at all.  If you have time you can carry out investigations back there.  Someone, a child of my father who has got that -- such a name. 
Q.	Witness, Gaspar Mbanzabugabo is a fake name which you used to conceal your real identity when you were in exile; is that correct?  Isn't that correct?
A.	To hide my identity. That's not the issue.  What you are saying -
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
What the Prosecutor is saying, Mr. President, Your Honours.  What the Prosecutor is saying is not right, because the name Mbanzabugabo, they even mentioned the father and the mother, and that is part of my identity.  It was not fake.  If you could carry out investigation, if you went to the village and asked, "Do you know Mbanzabugabo, son of so and so?" they would find that yes, that is my identity, son of so and so, which is what I gave as name in Congo.  My full address was in that identity.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we are not referring to a situation where the villagers knew you as whatever name, we are talking about a representation you made to a government; is that correct?  Are you clear on what my question is?
A.	I don't understand it.
Q.	You have never before July 1994 borne the name of Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar, you had always been known as Juvenal Kajelijeli; isn't that correct?
A.	My neighbours knew both names and given testimony on this.  I don't know why I -- on what basis you are contradicting me.  All these names were given to me by my parents and my parents called me by this name. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Mr. President, Your Honours, when giving evidence here, I showed that each member of my family has got two names.  I showed this and these names were usual.  They were part of my identity.  I never changed the identity of my parents.  I never changed my place and date of birth.  This is why I say that the Prosecutor has no basis in alleging what she is alleging.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
When was this name used?
MS. OJEMENI:
It was used -- you mean in evidence?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
When he was testifying on the 14th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Continue with your cross-examination.
MS. OJEMENI:
Examination-in-chief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We just want to know where it is located.
MS. OJEMENI. 
It was in the morning session, nine o'clock, it was used and he stated exactly what he said now, that is 14th of April, first day when he started his examination-in-chief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  We shall be able to locate it. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am asking this, because at the beginning of the evidence you say "my first name is so and so."  We will find it.  Go on, Counsel.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what was your official name in Rwanda before July 1994?
A.	It was Kajelijeli, Juvenal.
Q.	Why did you then adopt this name, Gaspar Mbanzabugabo while you were in exile instead of Juvenal Kajelijeli that you were known as?
A.	This was due to the -- to security reasons.
Q.	What security reasons are you referring to?
A.	When I went to Kinshasa, RPF was about to capture Kinshasa, eventually to date (sic), and where we were in S.N.I.P. area we were with some Tutsis who were in S.N.I.P., some were students in Kinshasa and some were acquaintances.  When the Zairian government decided to chase away these people, they went to Congo, Brazzaville.  When they arrived in Congo, Brazzaville, the people who received these refugees at the office of the Red Cross were Tutsis, so we were scared that if we gave our usual names there would be some harm done to us.  

When it is between life and death, the choice is clear.  We changed it deliberately knowing what our reasons were, and these reasons were reasons of security, and the leaders in Brazzaville were told the truth about this and they saw that it was well founded.
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you adopted this fake name simply to conceal your identity because you were a wanted person in Rwanda at the time because of your involvement in the killing of Tutsi in Mukingo commune.  What do you say to that?

THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
Your Honour, Mr. President, what the Prosecutor is saying is baseless.  My security was threatened, and that is why I had to use that name.  But in Rwanda, yes, I was being sought to be killed, but I could not hide that name in Rwanda because in Rwanda my name was known.  But I used that name in order to be able to escape to Brazzaville according to the circumstances of the area where I was.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you made this representation of facts to a government, the government of Congo, Brazzaville, knowing that it was false, the names were fake; isn't it?
A.	I explained that I had that name before; it wasn't a fake name.  Perhaps you could think about the value of life.  You too would do a similar thing in similar circumstances.  

Without wasting time, you should know that even your own investigators change their identities when they go there.  Even those who came to arrest me in Benin were changing their identity.  Even you use that, and even when you go to Rwanda you use a wrong identity, you disguise yourselves and there are some cases.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, what was your profession in 1994?  How would describe your profession?
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour.  Time frames, when in 1994?  After July, between April and -- I mean, what?  It's -- objection as to form.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, can you specify, Counsel, or perhaps specify what you want the Witness to address in your question as to profession.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, before you became bourgmestre in June 1994, what was your profession?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  It is about the fifth time she is asking me this question.  I have explained in my evidence that I was in private business and I said what business I was doing.  I was in trade and I used a lot of energy; I had to be there personally and supervise.  Whenever I wasn't there, there was the risk of losing -- making losses.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	While you were in exile, Witness, did you go back to school?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  When I was in exile I went -- I underwent some training in Bible reading, Bible lessons, because I felt that I had to confide (sic) my life to God in the circumstances. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	So what would you call your profession while you were in exile between 1995 and 1998?
A.	I don't know how you are mixing up these issues.  You are now -- you are asking me about my profession in '94, now you are asking me about between '95 and '98.  I would like to give evidence that in 1995 I was in Zaire and between 1996 -- in 1996, that's when I was taken to Kinshasa with my colleagues.  Afterwards, in June 1997, that is when I went to Congo, Brazzaville, and spent a second time there and later on I went to Benin.  I don't know whether you were asking me about the profession I had in 1994 or the time I was in exile?
Q.	Witness, how would you qualify your profession in 1997?  You understand my question, please?
A.	Now that it is clear, I can answer the -- this question.  I was undergoing Bible studies.
Q.	Witness, why did you call yourself an accountant when indeed you are not?
A.	I don't know.  You have to read that document to me.  That would help me to answer properly.  I don't know whether you have a proper source for that; I don't know whether there is such a source.  Then I would be able to answer you properly.
Q.	Witness, with what you have known -- what you know about yourself, could you qualify yourself as an accountant in 1997?
A.	I don't know where you get that information.  I would like to see evidence with my signature where you get such information.  You should read out the information to me, otherwise I cannot -- I cannot just answer questions that have no written evidence.  And if there is the evidence, then show me and I can see whether it is my signature and then I can answer your question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But would you call yourself, could you have called yourself as an accountant in 1997?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
If that is - if there is written evidence, it is not true.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Regardless whether there is or not, would you call yourself that title?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I said she should show me the source of information.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, no.  Leave aside the source, would you have called yourself, as you know yourself, as an accountant?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
I don't know about that.  I was never an accountant when I was in exile.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	While testifying, you mentioned that you and your colleagues were taken to Kinshasa.  Why were you taken to Kinshasa --

THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  It is about the fifth time she is asking me the same question.
MS. OJEMENI: 
(Unintelligible)
MR. HINDS:
Objection, Your Honour, it was asked and answered,.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have been through it. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay.  Your Honour, can the witness be shown this document?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I can see this document.  It is a laissez-passer, a travel document that was given to me by the then Zairian government.  When I requested for this, there was a form to be filled and on that form one had to indicate the profession or occupation.  But for me, even people who had passports, there was that question on what their occupation or profession was.  This has nothing to do with what my occupation was.  I was only indicating what I used to do in Rwanda.  I don't think the Prosecutor should change anything about this.  I said what I used to do in Rwanda.  I didn't know, I didn't say what I was doing while a refugee in Zaire.  I think this is -- there is no lie about this, and I could use this while asking for employment.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, are you in the habit of carrying fake documents or fake names?
A.	It is not correct.  I have explained that between life and death the choice is clear.  I stated this because I was asking for authorisation from Zairian Government enable to me to go to the different countries where I was travelling.  The reasons are clear.  I have explained the reasons because of the circumstances, the insecurity.  It is not only me, even you, in your department, you use these -- use these, use this business of disguising names, disguising even vehicles, so that you can have, so that you can achieve what your, to achieve your objective.  I can give you references.  There is a file on this in this Tribunal.  I didn't do anything that other people do not do.
Q.	And that also involved having or bearing or qualifying yourself as an accountant when your profession is not an accountant or your profession is not accountancy?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
Mr. President, she is emphasising these, this question.  It's a way of wasting the Chamber's time.  You know, it doesn't -- I had the intelligence to do that work.  To say that I was an accountant in Rwanda means that I could have been an accountant elsewhere.  When you have a diploma somewhere, you can use that diploma to ask for a job anywhere, and I had a certificate that could enable me to get a job somewhere.  I have -- I showed the occupation I used to have.  

Madam, the Prosecutor, don't waste the time of the Chamber.  I was an accountant and even today I can do that job.  I can carry out those tasks.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, on that form also you have your alias name Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar; is that correct?
A.	I said it is not a fake name because in -- as I gave evidence, everyone in my family has got two names.  It is my father who gave me this name.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, the Prosecution will seek to tender the document as prosecution exhibit --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
No, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let the form -- what do you call it?
MS. OJEMENI:
It is in French, laissez-passer actually.  Please can you bring it --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you describe it, please, at least for the name of the exhibit?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.  Your Honour, can I be given another 20 minutes?  I am about rounding up. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Twenty minutes?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Twenty minutes at most.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Up to 10 -- up to quarter to six.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very close, Your Honour.  Ten to six.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if you can finish early.  
MS. OJEMENI: 
I am rounding up.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Rounding up; okay. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	It is a document issued by the Republic of Zaire titled, titre de voyage.  I spell it:  T-I-T-R-E D-E V-O-V-A-G-E (sic).  And on it is a number, a K number.  KA 005206.  It has the Accused's picture, passport picture on it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we have it so that we -- so let the document -- it will be exhibit, Prosecution Exhibit --
MS. OJEMENI:
Prosecution exhibit -- I am not too sure, Your Honour.
MR. KIYEYEU:
It will be Prosecution Exhibit No. 30.
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
(No interpretation) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No translation is coming through in English.
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
"Republic of Zaire, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, travel document, foreigners who are not political refugees"  No.  KO 00500 - 5206.  And that will be Exhibit No. 30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge.  
(Prosecution Exhibit No. 30 admitted).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Go on, Counsel. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, we move onto your situation in Cotonou.  What document did you use in crossing over to Cotonou from Benin?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think what the Prosecutor is saying may be legally acceptable, but what the Tribunal, under the mandate of the Tribunal from 1st January 1994 to 31st December 1994, I think these questions do not have anything to do with the mandate of this Tribunal.  Under the statute of the Tribunal, we don't see why this is being asked; it's not part of the indictment.  But if you allow the question, I can give an answer.  But I believe that it's not in compliance with the Rules of Procedure and Evidence nor even in compliance with the statutes of this Tribunal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the question, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
I asked him the document he used to cross to Cotonou from Congo, Brazzaville.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You can answer that question.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Oh, sorry. 
MR. HINDS:
I think Mr. Kajelijeli makes a very cogent legal objection.  I would like to incorporate it.  The fact of the matter is, I don't know the basis of the question being asked.  Mr. Kajelijeli is not accused of any allegations relating to false documentation or using false documentation to gain entry any place, so I think his objection is well taken.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the issues are being addressed.  In our judgment, issues that touch on issues of 90 - 98, the Rules of Procedure 98, aspects dealing with credibility.  We will allow that question.  

Can you go on, Counsel, and be specific, we are running out of time.  
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, I have already done that I am waiting for his response.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Very briefly, Witness.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
If the Chamber changes the law --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Answer that question please.  Counsel will deal with the legal issues, not for you.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I made an oath here to tell the truth and it is not good, it would be shameful if I told lies, but I am talking about the circumstances under which I used that travel document.  It was between life and death and the choice is clear.  I used that document of Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar, from Brazzaville to Benin; that's what happened because of security reasons . 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Which document are you referring to Witness, is it the one which is now Exhibit P30?
A.	There is a document I was given by the Congo, Brazzaville, authorities.  You have got that document and that's the document I used to go to, to go to Benin.
Q.	That is the sauf du conduit; is that correct?  Are we correct?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
That is right, Mr. President.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	You have testified that you while in Cotonou you bore the name Juvenal Kajelijeli; isn't it?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry.  When -- 
MS. OJEMENI:
When in Cotonou he was bearing the name Juvenal Kajelijeli; that was his previous testimony.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
It is correct, Mr. President.  I did that knowing what I was doing and I wanted to tell the truth.  That is why I did not choose the name Mbanzabugabo, Gaspar.  Nobody forced me to do that.  I wanted to be legally correct.  I believed that my security was okay where it was and I used the same name that I was officially known in Rwanda.
MS. OJEMENI:
Can the Witness be shown this document please.  Show it to the Defence first.  
BY MS. OJEMENI: 
Q.	Witness, that is a copy.
A.	I accept it.  I've already admitted that I acknowledge it.
Q.	Witness, can you read the latter part that is in your handwriting?  Can you read it into -- read it loudly to the Court's hearing.
A.	It is fax No. 00 -- it's written in French.
Q.	It is in French, isn't it?
A.	Thank you.  Fax 00229:  "In line with your fax of - 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
A date we didn't hear - 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
-- please find below the photographs for my safe conduct to enable me to undertake -- to enable me get my visa for my departure for Cotonou.  I hope -- intend to come back the first flight of Monday 5th May 1997.  Please arrange for a taxi to pick me up at the airport.  Thank you in advance.  Done 2nd May.  Thank you in advance Mr. Mbanzabugabo."
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, this was addressed to Mr. Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	It's right.
Q.	The Prosecution seeks to tender the document as Exhibit P31, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Counsel?

MR. HINDS:
No objection.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let the document be tendered.  What do you call it?
MS. OJEMENI: 
It's a document issued by the Republic du Congo and it is titled by the Ministry of Interior and is titled sauf du conduit spelt S-A-U-F; conduit, C-O-N-D-U-I-T; special,  S-P-E-C-I-A-L with K No. KA 005084. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And date?
MS. OJEMENI:
1st May 1997.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where is 1st May?
MS. OJEMENI: 
It is 1st May 1997.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  There is Brazzaville up there on top.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, but I am seeing another date.  Okay, it is 29 April 19 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
19? 
MS. OJEMENI:
It is 29 April 1997.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So let the said document be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 31.  Is that right?
MR. KIYEYEU:
Yes it is, My Lord.
(Prosecution Exhibit No. 31 admitted).
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, just for a point of clarification.  In both P30 and P31 there are K numbers that are being read into the record.  They are not numbers that are indigenous to the documents but are in fact the Prosecutor's numbers, and I think that should be made clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, those are -- the K numbers are Prosecution numbers and can be for the identification of the document. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
And the Prosecution is tendering it, Your Honour.

MR. HINDS: 
That should be made clear.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is fair that they should do that.
MR. KIYEYEU:
	It has been registered.
MS. OJEMENI:
It is laissez-passer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, can we have the document back, registry? 
JUDGE RAMAROSON:
It is sauf conduit special, special laissez-passer. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Excuse my French.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Now Witness, correct me if I am wrong, is it fair to say that your relationship with Joseph Nzirorera was not close, as you have testified before? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Was not?
MS. OJEMENI:
Was not close, yes, they were not close friends. 
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Thank you.  I gave evidence to the effect that -- and I explained this, I explained this yesterday.  I said that Nzirorera received me as a neighbour and it wasn't me alone that was accommodated by him.  There was a relationship, yes, and there is no offence in that.  There was no other purpose; it was just a relationship arising from neighbourhood, especially during this time when Hutus are in trouble.  Any Hutu who goes to him is well received.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  I was saying that during this time when Hutus are particularly in trouble, whether it is in Europe or in African countries, when you hear that a refugee -- there are Rwandese refugees there, you look for such a person, so that such a person may assist you.  He assisted me because I was in trouble.  He realised where I was coming from.  This is an indelible mark and one can emphasise the friendship, but there was no other purpose, unlike what the Prosecutor is trying to concoct as she has done in the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are inviting you to slow down in order to enable the translation to come through.  We would like to hear you distinctly, if you can bear that in mind. 
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, did you have any business relationship with Joseph Nzirorera up to the dime time you joined him in Cotonou?
A.	There was no business relationship.  I was independent in my business.
Q.	Did you have any financial transaction with him, referring to Joseph Nzirorera?
A.	No trace at all.  No collaboration, no interaction in business or in trade or in business, never.
Q.	Witness, you opened an account in the name of Joseph Nzirorera and you solicited for financial assistance from various individuals, didn't you in 1997; didn't you?
A.	It is correct.  
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI: 
If you allow me, Mr. President, I would like to explain.  In any bank, I think the employees of this bank have got their accounts.  You must have a reference when you go to open an account.  This was like a godfather.  If I had found someone else whom I know, such a person would have been a kind of godfather.  That is a reference.  It is a general rule and you cannot -- there shouldn't be, it shouldn't be part of the propaganda or considered as an offence.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	This account was opened in Bank of Africa Cotonou, Benin; isn't it?
A.	It is right.
Q.	And the account number, can you remember?
A.	You have the proof.  When I was arrested these documents were taken from me.  There are so many years, five to six years.  You have got the references, you can read them to the Chamber.  I can't recall the number.
Q.	And you used this account to solicit for assistance, financial assistance, didn't you in 1997?
A.	It is correct.
Q.	You are telling this Court that you are not close, you had no close relationship with Joseph Nzirorera; is that what you are still saying?  Is this still your evidence?
A.	That strong relationship, that is a very hard word to use.  I -- you also have done the same.  When you go to a bank and you have to give a reference, everyone does that, and that does not show special relationship, it is procedure.
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Can the Witness be shown this document?
THE ACCUSED KAJELIJELI:
Mr. President, Your Honour, as the Prosecutor said, these are documents that I sent to people seeking money, seeking financial assistance because I was in a bad situation.  I used to give them my account for that.  

I believe I admit these documents.  But the unfortunate Kajelijeli, I was not about to get answers from different people.  For instance, this Binyange (phonetic) had to pay me back my money.  This other person Seerakwari (phonetic) I knew, but he never gave any assistance.  After the Prosecutor froze my account, I believe there was some investigation carried out.  She did not find anybody who gave financial assistance following these faxes.  

These documents, also referring to that question, I would like to go back to that question.  They were using my official names and there is no problem here.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, the Prosecution seeks to tender the two pieces of documents as Prosecution Exhibit P --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any objection, Counsel?
MR. HINDS:
No objection.
MS. OJEMENI:
Prosecution Exhibit P32 and 33; 31 has the K number KA 00 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you describe the documents first? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, it is a piece of document containing the account number of Kajelijeli, opened in the name of Joseph Nzirorera at the Bank of Africa, Benin soliciting for financial assistance with K number KA  --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those being the Prosecution number?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, Your Honour.  

KA 005100 as Prosecution Exhibit P31 and KA 005 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute.
MR. HINDS:
I think that is an existing exhibit, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So let that document be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit No. 32.  
(Prosecution Exhibit No. 32 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any date on that document?
MS. OJEMENI: 
There is no date, Your Honour.  Oh, there is a date.  It is dated 4th August 1997.
MR. PRESIDENT:
4th August 1997.
MS. OJEMENI:
Both of them are actually dated the same date, but different K numbers. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, yes.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Prosecution P33 is 005102.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  So let that said document be admitted as Defence exhibit - as Prosecution Exhibit No. 33.
(Prosecution Exhibit No. 33 admitted)
MS. OJEMENI:
Witness, during this period - 
MS. OJEMENI: 
Can I go on Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you on your last question? 
MS. OJEMENI:
I have four questions on this.  After that they are on different issues.  This one is another document that I seek to tender.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  How long are you likely to take? 
MS. OJEMENI:
I have three questions.   I am tendering this and then I have three questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you think you will take?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, It depends on how you the witness answers.  They are simple questions; I don't think it will take up--
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, if there are documents that we have had to read -- I don't think so far there has been any opposition to the documents, but I have to read them to find what they are about.  I don't know how much writing and it has to be translated from Kinyarwanda --
MS. OJEMENI:
I have only one document now. 

Your Honour, I have just one document left and I have given notice to the Defence that we will be tendering some of the documents that we returned copies to them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And then you say after that you have three questions.  
MS. OJEMENI: 
I have three questions on those different issues, but they are short questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, let's see.  
MS. OJEMENI: 
 I apologise, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you move on?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, just looking at this.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Give Counsel indications so that we can see whether --
BY MS. OJEMENI:
Q.	Witness, you have testified that you used this account to solicit for financial assistance.  Do you recall write -- sending an appeal to Madam Chirac?
A.	I remember that, and she replied to me.
Q.	And in that you stated that HCR sent you to Kinshasa because they alleged that you were intimidating the refugees.  Do you recall that?
A.	I remember that and I have explained that.  She also replied to me, especially that my family also wrote to her when they were still in the refugee camp.  These were unfortunate women who wrote to her; it wasn't me alone who wrote.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I have been told by Mr. Dusabe that this document which is about four handwritten pages on both sides is in broken French and it will take him 30 minutes to read it to me.  If the whole document is being submitted, I have a responsibility to read just what is completed on this and not just the summary.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, I do recognise my learned friend's concern but we had indicated to my -- to the Defence team that some of the documents that we kept the originals will be tendered in evidence and I had thought they would have been taken the pains to look at those documents.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Professor Hinds, learned Counsel for -- you are not -- you would like some time to know what the documents are about.
MR. HINDS:
Yes.  My team tells me that there are over 100 documents that were tendered to us.  This one -- I just need to, quite frankly, know what is in this before I consent.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Please, Your Honour.  We indicated the documents that we were keeping the original, and they are not up to 16.  We gave them a list and then we indicated the documents that we would be keeping the original for purposes of exhibits.
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, there were two lists, one was a list of documents that they had retained and then there was a list of documents, total documents.  With respect to the documents that have been -- I don't have in front of me right now, that list, but it does not matter.  The situation is that this list or this document has about four pages handwritten on both sides and my interpreter-translator tells me it will take him 30 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Okay.  In that case, Counsels, since these are the last documents you are addressing -
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In the light of what the Defence is saying, they would like to know what the contents are, we will stop here and then we can deal with this matter tomorrow and deal with the question of this document.  You are -- how many questions did you say remain?
MS. OJEMENI:
Three more questions, and I won't go beyond that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it will take us about half an hour, 30 minutes tomorrow morning and then we can have the re-examination and see how far we go.  
MS. OJEMENI: 
In that case, my learned friend will be referring to a copy of this document in his possession. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, let me just find it.  By tomorrow morning I would have read this and so I don't need to take up the Court's time, and so we wouldn't be dealing with the document, except if I am objecting to it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All right.  Then we will stop here and adjourn this -- do you have the document?  You have a copy? 
MR. HINDS:
Yes, we have a copy.  I am turning this back over to the --
Mr. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So in that case, we will adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning.  I think they will show you if - oh well, you will have to see it tomorrow.  Unfortunately, Accused Witness, you will see it tomorrow.  

So we will adjourn these proceedings until tomorrow, and we will come, depending on what Prosecution and Defence say, we will be addressing the document and the remaining few questions before the cross-examination is concluded.  So, until tomorrow at nine in the morning, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1807H)
