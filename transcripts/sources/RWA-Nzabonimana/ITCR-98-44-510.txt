P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.

And could we have the appearances of the parties for the record.

Prosecution, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The appearance for the Prosecutor is as follows:  
Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney; Memory Maposa, appeals counsel; Mr. Simba Mawere, 
assistant trial attorney; Mr. Elvis Bazawule, legal officer; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Ephrem Mutashya, language assistant; Déogratius, intern.  Thank you.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  On the Defence side this morning there is Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  The investigator currently in court is Justin Mugenzi.  
Célestin Kagango is not here at the moment, but he may appear on the bench later.  Fernand Batard is here.  Nathalie Leblanc, legal assistant, is here; and myself, Philippe Larochelle, in addition to the intern, Marion Vanier.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Madam Registry, could you pull the curtain on the left a bit further towards us.  Thank you.

Witness, we will continue with your testimony today bearing in mind the declaration you made yesterday to tell the truth to the Trial Chamber.

We are in open session.  Finish your answer, Witness.  Sorry to interrupt you.
THE WITNESS:
I crave your indulgence, Madam President.  I merely wish to say that I will continue to comply with the solemn declaration I made yesterday. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.

Counsel, we are in open session.  Is this where you would like us to remain?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
No, Madam President, Your Honours.  I would request for a few minutes, very few minutes, 
closed session so that we can work around some two names that I want to use.  And after that we can go into open session.  As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you arrange for a short closed session.

Members of the public, we regret that you have to leave now.  We hope it will be for a short time. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 4] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 2 by Kelly Surina)






















MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are now in open session.  Be careful not to mention the names of people and places except as we have agreed because the public is attending this session, and it will remain public.

Learned Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you.
WITNESS T110,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	Witness, good morning.
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	Witness, yesterday before we took the break, I asked you the question how long would it take for a person to fill 30 bottles of beer from a jerrycan.  Can you answer that question.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Before answering your question, I would like to backtrack somewhat.  Yesterday you put a question to me, and that question pertained to paragraph 14 of my statement where you claimed that somebody had -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the English interpreter would wish that the witness would repeat his answer because some bits are not very clear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we request you to repeat your answer because the interpreters did not clearly understand what you were saying.  Could you repeat your answer, please.
THE WITNESS:
Yesterday we were discussing a matter, and it was alleged that Nzabonimana had been approached by somebody, and I responded by saying that that was inconsistent with my statement.  And in my statement, I had mentioned that Nzabonimana had stopped by at the centre out of his own volition and he had not been prompted by anybody. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  Now can you answer the question that has been put to you by learned counsel.  Do you remember the question? 
THE WITNESS:
My apologies.  I had not quite understood the Prosecutor's question perfectly.  I would like him to repeat his question.  

BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you.  I will repeat, Witness.

The question is:  Can you tell the Court how much time it takes to fill 30 bottles of beer from a jerrycan of beer.
A.	Normally the owner of a bar has many bottles, and that number could exceed 30.  What the bartender does is that he fills the drinks in the bottles and keeps the full bottles pending the customer's order.

This means that a bartender would not fill bottles from a jerrycan only when the customer has placed an order.  The bottle is ready to be consumed because the bottling is done before the orders are placed by customers.  Otherwise, it would take a long time for the bartender to fill the bottles each time there is a customer order. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness, but you missed the question.  The question is:  How much time does it take to fill 30 bottles from a jerrycan of beer?  Can you answer that question, please.
A.	Normally, Counsel, beer sellers have other containers they use.  When they have to transfer the content of the jerrycans into bottles, what he first does is to empty the contents of the jerrycan into a basin.  And thereafter, he fills the bottles from the basin so as to save time.  So to answer your question, the length of that exercise would depend on the containers used by the bartender.   
Q.	Would you say that it would be about 20 minutes?
A.	Counsel, I realise that we are dwelling on this matter.  And I have said that a person who is filling the bottles from a jerrycan could use a bucket, for instance, by pouring the contents of the jerrycan into a bucket.  And it is much easier to fill the bottles from the bucket.

The length of that exercise would depend on the experience of the person carrying out that exercise.  As you are fully aware, people -- the bartenders do not have the same experience and do not use the same containers. 
Q.	Witness, you have worked at that centre.  And particularly, you are well versed with this matter, isn't it?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Objection.  That's not the evidence.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Well, the evidence is that he did spend a lot of time at the centre with one of his ********** at the centre who had a bar.  And I think this witness knows exactly how much time it would take.  He's not a stranger to this.  He's spent lots of time at those places.  He's familiar with what I'm asking.
And I want to guide the Court.  He's not assisting the Court.  I want his answer to guide the Court to know approximately how much time it takes.  So I think the question is proper.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
It is not because the evidence is clear that he has never worked there.  I have no objection that you explore as much as you want, how much time it takes to transfer the content of beers from one place to another, but please reflect accurately what the evidence is.  And he never said that he has worked there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Our recollection is that the witness would go there to spend time after work.  So he didn't work there, and that is not his evidence certainly.  And he has also said that it would depend on the experience of the person carrying out that exercise and the containers used.  And we do take note of his answer.  

Counsel, can you move on.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, indeed.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	So, Witness, when you said that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana gave 5,000 to buy a jerrycan of beer, what you actually meant was that he gave money to buy 30 bottles of beer; is that correct?
A.	What you have said is correct.  He gave money to buy 30 bottles of banana beer. 
Q.	Now, Witness, when the crowd gathered around Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, it is correct, isn't it, that you were not able to follow the individual conversations between the people who were in the crowd?  Isn't it?
A.	That is incorrect.  I followed all of the conversations that took place at that scene. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can we go into a short closed session.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 8] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 5 to 7 by Kelly Surina)





MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Both of you be careful, Witness and Counsel, as we are now in open session.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	And, Witness, when Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana left the gathering, people were still drinking the beer; is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed.  When he left, we were still there drinking. 
Q.	However, Witness, you agree with me that, while you were still drinking and before Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana left the trading centre, Maurice also left; is that correct?
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I think you're backtracking when you ask that question.  I think it could be split into two.  I would like to ask you to ask another question without necessarily tying it up to the other question or another question that was put to me before.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Now, Witness, you are here to assist the Trial Chamber to appreciate all the matters in evidence that have been heard here, and that will relate.  The question that has been put to you is a simple question.  Have you understood it or not?  If you have not understood it, it can be clarified.  But if you haven't understood it, we would very much appreciate if you could give us an answer to that question.   
THE WITNESS:
In my understanding, that is a question that has two parts, and it's a bit confusing for me when I find a question that has two parts.  I was simply asking him to split the question up and ask me a single question and later a second.  That is all I was asking. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Can you clarify the question.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, a few minutes before Mr. Nzabonimana left the trading centre, Maurice also left; is that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you answer the question.
THE WITNESS:
I thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the Kinyarwanda interpreter says the witness has mentioned a name he was not supposed to mention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  Just a moment.  Just a moment.
Can we go into a short closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 11 to 16] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 9 to 10 by Kelly Surina)


































MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We are now in open session.

And, Counsel, you may put your arguments.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes.  I object in the manner in which the Prosecutor is proceeding here.  This is not a quiz game.  This is a trial.  So to tell the witness, "Do you remember what you said at paragraph 13 of your 38-paragraph statement?" is wasting time and resources.

I think the Prosecutor should proceed in the same manner as he has always done and read the paragraph and ask the witness if he remembers stating that.  Otherwise, we're circling around and we're not just progressing in this cross-examination.  

So in all fairness to the witness who provided that very lengthy statement, I think we should proceed like that, and that will save everybody's time, and we will be able to come to the end of the cross-examination in the most rapid and efficient manner.   
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Well, I will rephrase my question, but this is a matter that we have ventilated before.  But in the interest of time, I will simply ask him a question and read the paragraph in question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Then we need not go further into this matter.

Registry, can you bring back the witness, and could we go into closed session as well. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 18 to 27] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Page 17 by Kelly Surina)










MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.       I think, Witness, we are now in open session.  
	A.       Yes. 
Q.       Witness, in *************, it is correct, isn't it, that you were accused of having ************************** that killed Tutsis; is that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, sorry; before the witness answers, what exactly is your question, because the way we see it in the CaseView and the way we heard it, we are not exactly sure what you said. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I see there's a misprinting in the live notes.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	My question is this:  Witness, in *************, it is correct, isn't it, that you were accused of having ******* ****************** that killed Tutsis; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I was accused of that fact, but details were not provided as to the persons who were killed and the persons to whom I had given beer. 
Q.	And, Witness, you then entered a guilty plea for a lesser offence for not assisting people in danger; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  And while you gave your confession -- and I want you to be careful not to mention which court did you have to swear an oath as you did before this Trial Chamber.
A.	My confession was contained in a letter which I had written.  And in that letter, I said that my confessions were truthful. 
Q.	Did you subsequently appear before a Gacaca court?  And, please, do not mention the name of that court yet, to confirm your confession. 
A.	Yes, I appeared before a Gacaca court. 
Q.	And before that Gacaca court, which you should not mention now, you misled the judges that, what you had told them in your letter and what you were confirming before them was true, isn't it? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Objection.  You wait before you answer, Mr. Witness.  

Can the witness be taken out?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry, after the curtains have been drawn, can have the witness out so that we can hear counsel.

Witness, could you leave now, please.  
(Witness exited courtroom)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Again, Madam President, the Prosecution is jumping the gun.  We don't know who was -- the confession addressed to.  There's no evidence that it was sent to the judges.  We know he signed a confession and then we are jumping already before the Gacaca court where it's a misleading confession.  I think the Prosecutor should take the witness up to that point and first ask him whether, indeed, the confession he had signed.  Maybe when he signed it and whether it was given to the judges and they had it in their possession.  There are many assumptions and things which have not been put into evidence and which the Prosecutor is relying here, that should be put before this Court first.  And so, I kindly request that he go slowly from the confession to the Gacaca court so that we can precisely know what happened in between these two steps. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, this objection is baseless.  And the previous question that we asked the witness was whether, subsequently, he appeared before a Gacaca court to confirm his confession, and he said he did.  And before that, he had written a confession which was sent to the Gacaca.  So this is a legitimate question and the objection is, to my view, and to the best of my knowledge and judgment, completely unfounded.  The proper ground has been given and this is just a follow-up.  So I do not see why my learned friend, if he has exercised his due diligence and judgment, should object to that question.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The answer was this from the witness.  "My confession" -- this is at 11:41:36.  "My confession was contained in a letter which I had written.  And in that letter, I said that my confessions were truthful."  This is a confession.  

	And the follow-up question, "Did you subsequently appear before Gacaca court?  And, please, do not mention the name of that court yet to confirm your confession.  Yes, I appeared before Gacaca."  

	So I think before the Prosecutor is asking that question, the question should be:  Was your letter filed before the Gacaca court?  Were the judges acquainted with the content of your confession?  We have no evidence of that.  So to ask him and then he can ask:  "Did you tell them you misled them in your confession?  And did you explain that your confession was misleading?"   Then it would be proper, the foundation would have been laid.  But before we have the evidence as to whether or not the confession made it to the Gacaca court.  He is jumping the gun.  Maybe the confession was only for the jail authorities, maybe the confession was for himself, maybe it was for the capita generale.  We have no idea.  I think the Prosecutor should simply establish the basis before asking the witness as to what happened with his confession before the Gacaca court so that we know that it actually made it out there.  And these confessions sometimes are refused, sometimes are rejected.  It's just going a bit too far, and it risks confusing the witness and bringing witnesses who have a limited or no value at all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, as a bench, we also have some issues which we want to be cleared up.  We heard from this witness that he confessed so that he could be released.  And he wrongfully implicated himself.  Now, are we talking about this same confession?  Would the letter which he says he wrote, to whom was it addressed?  You know, we need all those things to be cleared before we go to what you are going to, Learned Counsel.  So if you could take the matter -- those matters step-by-step, so that we all follow what exactly you are ventilating, Learned Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases, I will do that.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we have the witness back in Court here, Registry.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
	Witness, we will continue with your testimony.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, before you answer the question that I asked, I would request you to hold on until I have asked you another question first.  All right.  My question is this:  When you wrote your confession, what did you do with it?  And, please, I would appreciate if you do not mention the name of the court. 
A.	When the confessions were written, they were sent to a court. 
Q.	    And this is the confession that you have previously spoken about in Court; is that correct? 
A.	I do not know if we are talking about the same thing because I made confessions only once, and when you are telling me whether I am talking about the same confessions, I do not follow. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, thank you for that clarification.  We are talking about the same confession.  Now, when you went to court to confirm the confession, was it the same confession that you had written to the court? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Objection.  It should be broken into two. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The objection is overruled.  The witness can answer the question.  

Yes, Counsel.  

Witness, do you recall the question?  
THE WITNESS:
I wanted to ask Counsel for the Prosecution to repeat his question because I did not quite understand it. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  The question was:  When you went to court to confirm the confession, did you confirm the same confession that you had written to court earlier on? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are waiting for your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
I had written a letter and after that letter was written, I subsequently met with the deputy officer -- the prosecutor's office -- the deputy to the prosecutor, who made some amendments to the contents of my letter.  There might have been some mistakes in the letter.  And in my confession, I was saying that I had not assisted people in danger. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	And, Witness, can you confirm to the Court that it is with respect to that confession that you subsequently appeared before the Gacaca court to confirm it, isn't it? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I find your question complex.  One can only confirm something after it has been heard.  To tell you that I went to confirm my confession, I risk placing myself in a situation where I would have responded without being aware of the document you are using.  Maybe you have the contents of my confession before you. 
Q.	Please, Witness, it will help the Judges if you do not anticipate questions, but simply answer the question that is before you.  And the question here is:  Did you go to Gacaca to confirm that document -- that confession that you sent to it?  It's yes or no. 
A.	Yes, I appeared before the Gacaca court to confirm my confession and which was contained in the document that I had written. 
Q.	Yes, and before that Gacaca court in which you went to confirm your confession, you misled the judges to believe that you had spoken the truth, isn't it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, have you heard the question?  What did you tell the judges of the Gacaca court with regard to your confession?  
THE WITNESS:
As a matter of fact, I did not know the question was directed to me.  I did not understand it well.  If Counsel could kindly repeat or rephrase the question.  I did not know the question was directed to me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, the Trial Chamber would like to draw your attention to the fact that you came here to testify and to enlighten the Chamber about the events of 1994 in your area.  We would like to urge you to be attentive to the questions that are being put to you and listen to them carefully and answer them directly and as best as you can so that we can quickly come to the end of your testimony.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  But, at the same time, the Counsel for Prosecution should be advised to ask me a question once and for all, because on every occasion he doesn't put simple questions.  He puts underlying questions in a one question on top of another one, and which complicates matters for me.  And if the Counsel for the Prosecution could repeat his question, I would truly appreciate. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I will do so.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Before he does so, Witness, if a question put to you is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  If the Trial Chamber allows the question, it means it's proper.  But if you have not understood it, yes, you can ask for it to be clarified.  

Yes, Prosecution, can you put back the question to the witness. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I will, Your Honours.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I am now putting the question to you.  When you went to confirm your confession before the Gacaca, you misled the judges to believe that you had spoken the truth, isn't it? 
A.	I told them that I had spoken the truth and that is what I had written down in my confession. 
Q.	But the question is -- that I want you to confirm to this Court is:  You knew you were not telling the truth, isn't it?  You were misleading them.  
A.	No, I was not misleading them.  I was merely repeating what I had previously written down. 
Q.	And what you had written down was not true, was it? 
A.	As far as I am concerned, I took it that it was the truth.  But let me restate the fact that I had made it up so as to save my skin, so as to get out of that situation. 
Q.	That is the point, Witness.  You knew what you were saying was not true, isn't it? 
A.	Well, Counsel, this is my answer to your question.  It was fortunate for me that the events that were being dealt with had occurred in my cellule and that the perpetrators or those who had been held responsible for those acts were present and were natives of my cellule.  Therefore, it behooves the Gacaca judges who were well apprised of that case to ascribe the role and responsibilities of each and sundry. 
Q.	Witness, I will just do this one more time.  You knew what you were confirming before the Gacaca was not true, isn't it? 
A.	I stated that what I had said was the truth. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have noted the witness's answer.  Please move on 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, you lied before that court in order to gain advantage, isn't it? 
A.	It was absolutely necessary to fabricate stories so as to get out of prison.  So, somehow, I was compelled to do so.  And it seems that the law prompted me to do so. 
Q.	And now before this Court, you have come to fabricate yet more lies to get Callixte Nzabonimana out of prison, isn't it? 
A.	That is not the case. 
Q.	Right, Witness, now, I will move on to a slightly different matter.  When you came before this Court, you told the Court that you were not sure as to which party Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana belonged to; is that correct? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I stated that Nzabonimana was a member of the MRND.  But if I were to be contradicted, I would have no further evidence because I took it that he was a member of the MRND, because, at the time, it was ordinarily said that all authorities or officials were all members of the MRND, and that is what makes me to say that he was a member of the MRND.  But if you were to say the contrary, I would have no evidence to rebut his statement. 
Q.	Witness, my question was slightly different.  Please, pay close attention to the detail.  When you came to this Court, you said you were not sure; is that correct, as to what party Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana belonged to? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I stated that he was a member of the MRND party.  However, I went on to add that if I were asked to prove my point, I would not be able to do so.  But we all knew that he was a member of the MRND party, and that is what I have restated. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, when you spoke to the Defence about the membership of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana to political parties, you -- do you remember what you told the Defence? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe, Counsel, just put to him what he just said so that we can save some time.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lord, I do refer you to paragraph 7.   
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	And I will quote, Mr. Witness.  You talked to the Defence as follows:  "I knew Minister Nzabonimana, native of Nyabikenke.  He often ******************** a few times when he was going to his house in Kavumu.  He was an MRND member and had to have responsibilities within his party."  Is that correct? 
A.	That is, indeed, what I stated, but I think there's a small or slight addition; namely, that he held duties in that party.  And I believe that was an addition.  But for the rest, it's correct and, therefore, I would not like to have -- encounter any problems as a result of those or that addition. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, may I bring it to your attention that there's an error in the draft document that I sent to you.   And in the place of area it says, 'house'.  It should actually says 'area' and not 'house'.  So, that error was pointed to us by the Defence counsel and we referred it to the language section and, indeed, our language assistant confirms that it should not read 'house ' but 'area'.  That's why I read the 'area' instead of the 'house'. 
(Pages 28 to 34 by Judith Kapatamoyo)































	1215H 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right, we were about to point out the error.  But if the witness has understood we can proceed.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, let me also quote to you what you said yesterday with regard to the same point.  And those of us who have the draft transcript, it is at page 15 -- page 14, the transcript of 12th October 2010.  And at about line 10, I quote: 

"Concerning his political party, I am not sure.  But at the time it was said that all the authorities were of MRND party.  But I have no confirmation or assurance that he was of the MRND party."  

Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I had said.  
Q.	Again, Witness, in that testimony you were misleading the Court because prior to your coming to court you had revised with the Defence your statement, and in particular the paragraph that I have read to you; isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  That statement was read out to me and, indeed, we pinpointed a number of errors which were subsequently corrected.  
Q.	Witness, that was not my question.  My question was that yesterday you misled the Court knowing full well that you knew Callixte Nzabonimana was MRND because you had revised your statement previously with the Defence; isn't it? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  According to the wording of your question, I am bound to backtrack.  I have told you that Nzabonimana was a member of the MRND but I believed that questions would be put to me on the specifics regard -- to enable me to confirm, rather, that he was a member of the MRND, so I had to tender some reservations to the effect that I did not have any material evidence to prove that he was a member of the MRND, and that's it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I will move on. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, I do not want you to tell in open session where your current abode is, but can you tell the Court:  How do you make your living at the place of refuge that you live? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question.  Are you referring to my current abode, that is, where I live these days or are you referring to my habitual place of residence?  
Q.	I'm referring to your habitual place of residence in your country of refuge.  
A.	You see, when you are a refugee there are support organisations that lend us assistance.  Furthermore, when one is healthy you work to have a livelihood.  We take jobs and in return we are paid to feed ourselves.  
Q.	Now, tell us about the support you get from organisations.  Do you get monetary allowances?  And if so, how much? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Bodies like the UNHCR provide us with food supplies when necessary.  But they do not provide any money to refugees.  
Q.	Yes.  So you actually rely on food handouts from UNHCR; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And that is not an easy life, is it? 
A.	Well, you receive some assistance but you don't spend your whole day sleeping because if you're healthy you can go out and work and you are paid for such work.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, what trade do you practice in that country of refuge? 
A.	I do not run a business.  But, anyway, you can do some jobs; you can fell down trees; you can do some farming; there are lots of, you know, jobs or occupations in which you can indulge within, rather, and at the end of the day you receive a salary for such work. 
Q.	I take it that you do not have a trade for which you are trained and that you carry out temporary manual work; is that correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you would be lying to the Court to say that is an easy life, wouldn't you? 
A.	There is nothing difficult in that unless one is sick, because, you know, everybody cannot be a white collar worker working in offices.  You know there are a good number of people who earn a living from manual jobs and they do live well. 
Q.	Witness, how do you provide for your shelter?  Where do you shelter yourself?  Without giving the location, do you shelter yourself under the UNHCR or do you shelter yourself in a temporary arrangement where you live in informal settlements? 
A.	Counsel, we take care of our own shelter, we pay rents from our own pockets and it's not that complicated.  We work; we have a source of income which enables us to pay for our rent and to pay for our food. 
Q.	Witness, I put it to you that you find yourself in a very difficult situation in which, yet again, as you have done before, the truth is a commodity for advantage; what do you say to that? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to explain in clear and no uncertain terms.  I would be lying if I said that I find difficulty in feeding myself.  Furthermore, I cannot say that I'm a wealthy man as I speak.  But the point is, for the ordinary citizen, I would say I do not live in the city, I live in the rural area.  I have a regular house and we're used to living our rural life, and that is no problem to us.  I, therefore, cannot start exaggerating by saying that I am hungry where I am.  I would say I am well kept where I reside.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And I do apologise if that enquiry has caused you some discomfort.  I mean no disrespect whatsoever.  And I wish to thank you very much for answering my questions.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, I have no further question for this witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel, any re-examination? 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
No, Madam President, we have no further questions for the witness.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, the Judges have questions for you.  Listen carefully to the questions and answer them directly and briefly.  

Judge Rajohnson. 
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  

I have a question.  What was -- where was Mr. Nzabonimana sitting in the vehicle when you saw him alight from it? 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  Callixte Nzabonimana was seated in front while the gendarmes were sitting in the backseat.  When I say Nzabonimana was sitting in the front seat, I am referring to the seat next to the driver, that is, the passenger's seat. 
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Is it normal for a minister to sit in front of the car whilst the gendarme sits on the minister's seat in the rear? 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, as I stated at the beginning of my testimony, I was not attentive to protocol, but when I saw him pass by in our area, he was always sitting in the front passenger's seat and that is where he usually sat in that car. 
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
It is your evidence before the Court that -- that Rutongo secteur had four cellules; namely, Rebe, Rutongo, Butare and Rushoka.  Can you, in approximate terms, tell the Court the respective distances between the various -- the four cellules? 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to say that Rutongo secteur comprised four cellules as you have correctly pointed out.  And regarding Butare centre, which we have talked about, it was located at the border of Rutongo secteur.  And from that centre one would go down toward a river called Gasanze and after crossing that river, one would cover one kilometre to get to Rutongo cellule.  And by using yet another road, after one or two kilometres one would get to Rushoka cellule.  On the other hand, about a kilometre away -- or, let me say less than a kilometre, because there was only a valley, one would get to Rebe cellule.  And the distances I have mentioned are distances one would cover from Butare.  I am ready to give you further details, if you would so require.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Witness.  

Next question:  In approximate terms, could you give the population of each of the cellules?  Which is the largest cellule among the four cellules and what is the population of each of the cellules? 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I would like to crave your indulgence, because I find the question complicated.  And let me explain why.  When one has not been a figure of authority in a given cellule, one cannot say the population of every cellule.  And if I venture to answer your question, I might be telling lies to this Court.  So, I would say that I am not in a position to give you the data you are requesting me -- from me.  I understand very well, but that's it. 
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Were you very familiar with those cellules?  Otherwise, you perhaps can say how many houses are found in Butare, Rushoka or Rutongo -- or, at least you can be in a position to say how many hamlets are there in each of those entities or cellules. 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, Your Honours, I have never counted the households or made a census of the population in those cellules, that is why I am unable to give you figures.  However, I am able to give you, in approximate terms, the number of inhabitants of the secteur without getting down to the same figures of each cellule.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Very well, Witness.  Can you go on? 
THE WITNESS: 
We estimated the population of Rutongo secteur at 3 to 4,000.  But once again, that is an estimate because I have never conducted a census of that secteur so as to determine the exact figure or population.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, there's a translation error that has occurred and I would like to point it out in a closed session if I'm allowed to do that.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we will go into a short closed session for the reasons given by learned counsel for the Prosecution.  And we request members of the public to leave now.  We hope it will be for a short time. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [page 40] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 35 to 39 by Eleanor Bastian)
































MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Judge, you may continue.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

Regarding your position about the population of the secteur, do you believe that a reasonable person would believe that you would know everyone who was at the trading centre?  You know them because you asserted that you knew them, you knew -- you said, "We knew each other", yet you also say that there were 3 to 4,000 inhabitants in that secteur.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  It was not my intention to say that all the 4,000 people were at the trading centre.  But if we were between 25 and 50 people at that centre, it is obvious that we could have known each other.  I would say that among the elderly persons who were there, we could know each other without necessarily knowing the names.  But we could recognise each other and know our neighbours as people who lived in so-and-so an area.  And this was a custom.  People who lived in the same area or in the same secteur would know each other because we often met at various events, at meetings.  We could also -- or, possibly meet at that centre.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
It was your evidence that the minister did not utter any inflammatory statements.  On the contrary, he commended you for the prevailing security in your community and he encouraged you to move -- to keep it up.  So how, then, do you explain the killings and the genocide that occurred in your area? 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  A while ago I mentioned the minister's commendatory statements to us because we had ensured security.  He spoke with us because the situation was calm in our area.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Although I'm not very satisfied with your answer, I will make do with that.  

Last question:  You stated that you were safeguarding your security.  To safeguard your security and to ensure your independence, you had to plead guilty to crimes you had not committed and you further stated that you had been tried for failing to assist persons in danger.  I do not know exactly what the charge was.  But, be that as the may, I gather that you made up crimes; is that correct? 
THE WITNESS: 
That is about that, but although it's not exactly that.  I -- based on the offences held against me, I found something similar, and the crimes were almost similar although it was not exactly the same as the crimes or the charges for which I had been held initially.  So, if my understanding is correct -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Interpreters, are you done with the answer of the witness? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I believe so, Madam President.  Perhaps for the purpose of clarity, we could request the witness to repeat his testimony.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Judge, you may continue.  Sorry to interrupt you.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Thank you, Madam President.  

So, if my understanding is correct, you were at liberty to give an account of crimes which you, according to your own words, fabricated.  And this without prompting from anyone else.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  When the charges were held against me -- were read out to me, I realised that if I were to confess to the crime of supplying drinks to the persons who had committed the killings I would be in a position where I would not be able to find the persons to whom I had offered the beer, and I was -- I would also not be able to identify the victims.  And in such circumstances, I thought that it was better to plead guilty for failure in one's duty of care.  And even before the Gacaca court of the cellule I pleaded to the same crimes, but I did so for all and sundry to shoulder their responsibilities because those who had committed the killings were present.  And before the Gacaca court I furnished explanations that shed light on the situation and what had happened.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Last question:  So, I am still using, quoting your expression of inventing crimes.  So, did you also invent corpses? 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I believe that my answer was not properly understood.  I did not know the persons who had been killed, yet, the crimes were allegedly committed in my cellule.  So, I consistently kept my story so that the event can be placed at the place where the crimes were committed.  So it was important that I be brought before the Gacaca courts where the citizens knew what had happened and could ascribe the responsibilities of all and sundry.  And as far as I'm concerned, I didn't see anything wrong to plead guilty to any crime since light would be shed before the Gacaca court.  
JUDGE RAJOHNSON: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Thank you, Madam President.  I am done with my questions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Judge Rajohnson.  

Witness, I have three questions for you.  I will ask some of the questions in closed session.  But we could begin in open session.  

Now, when you appeared before the Gacaca court, were you a detainee?  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President.  When I appeared before the Gacaca court I had already been released.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  And regarding the centre which we have talked about, where Mr. Nzabonimana came and gave you beer, when did you arrive at that place on the day he came? 
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I might have gone to the centre in the afternoon.  But, since I wasn't keen about the time, I would say I got there slightly after midday.  I could have even gotten there at 1 p.m. 

And once again, I would like you to bear in mind the fact that these events occurred 16 years ago.  And given my circumstances of life, it is difficult for me to have a distinct recollection. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  I will put my last question in closed session because it arises from matters which were raised in closed session.  

Registry, can we go into closed session, please.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 44 to 45] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 41 to 43 by Eleanor Bastian)









MR. MATEMANGA: 
We are in open session now.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, registry.  

Witness, we have now come to the end or your testimony.  We thank you for coming to enlighten the Trial Chamber about the events that (inaudible) in your area in 1994.  We will have an opportunity to consider your evidence alongside all the other evidence that has been adduced before we come to a verdict, in the end.  We thank you.  We wish you a safe journey home, and you may now leave.  
THE WITNESS: 
I also thank you, Madam President.  

I thank you for accepting to hear me and I hope that my testimony would be useful.  But, I have another request to present to you, Madam President.  I am requesting your leave to greet Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, if Mr. Nzabonimana does not object, the registry will make arrangements for you to greet him at an appropriate time.  But for now, we request you to leave.  We thank you.  

The registry will arrange for you to meet him.  

The Trial Chamber proposes to adjourn these proceedings to three -- to a quarter to three to continue with the exhibits, and we hope that the parties are ready to undertake this exercise.  

Can we hear from the parties?  

Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Madam President, I was about to require that we resume at 3:30 to do that.  We are ready to meet with the Prosecutor, but we also need to have some lunch.  So maybe -- may I suggest 3 o'clock, that will give us enough time to have a decent lunch and iron out any difficulties we may have with the Prosecutor.  There is in the amount of maybe 15 documents on which we need to agree on the justification forms, and I'm pretty sure that by 3 o'clock we could come out here and file all -- all these exhibits as rapidly as possible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Prosecution, any submissions?  

MR. NG'ARUA: 
Your Honour, I will support my learned friend because we were supposed to meet this morning in anticipation that this witness would have completed his testimony.  But we can accommodate him and meet at three.  Is it 3:30?  At three, as he suggests, and finalise the matter.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  But before we adjourn to three, we would like a clarification on the issue of paragraph 7 of the witness's statement.  We are informed that the French version talks about "our house" and the English talks about "our house".  But we are told verbally by counsel for the Prosecution that it should read "area" and we want a clarification from the interpreters on this issue.

Could the interpreters read to us the paragraph 7 as it appears in the statement of the witness, please?  Or, somebody?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
To assist, maybe, Madam President, maybe I can read it out loud in French so that the record will contain an accurate English translation of the paragraph, as we have done in the past, if that suits all parties. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, you may go ahead, Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Paragraph 7:  "I know Minister Nzabonimana, a native of Nyabikenke, who would sometimes pass by *********** on his way to his house in Kavumu.  He was an MRND supporter.  And he must have had some responsibilities within his party."  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Well, a new matter has arisen because we have a new issue:  He was an MRND member, not supporter.  

Interpreters? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The French doesn't say.  It just says "MRND".  And it's not grammatical for us to just use MRND without adding either "supporter" or "member".  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So it could be both?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, Madam President.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV: 
With the help of English and French speakers on both sides and, of course, with the help of interpreters, we would need to harmonise the English and French texts.  So we would request their assistance in translating into proper English, first those four words "passe par chez nous".  Would that mean that he was passing by?  Would that mean that he was passing by our house?  Would that mean that he was passing by our area or through our area?  That's question number 1.  

And the second question:  "Il était MRND".  I cannot see the word "supporter" here.  Our reading is that he was the member of the party.  

Please, enlighten us on that.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Interpreters?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, we agree with Your Honour, that "member" seems to be the most appropriate word.  But as for the "chez nous" we are not quite sure what they meant.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
So what does that mean?  It could mean area or --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
It could mean area. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
-- or place?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Or place.  Yes, madam.  Not house.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  And the stopping, was it passing by or stopping?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Passing by.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Interpreters.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
May I submit, maybe for "Il était MRND", I think maybe to do justice to the text maybe "he belonged to the MRND" would be a correct reflection, maybe better than "member" or "supporter" which, indeed, are not in this text.  But this is my suggestion.  I -- I -- I leave it with the interpreters to enlighten the Chamber as to whether that would be better. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Interpreters?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Madam President, I think "member" is appropriate.  

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right, thank you very --  

Now we've eaten into the time of the peace talks between the two parties, the proceedings are now adjourned to quarter past three; a quarter past three this afternoon.
(Court adjourned at 1322H)
(Pages 46 to 49 by Eleanor Bastian) 































(Court resumed at 1525H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Are counsels ready for the exhibits for this afternoon? 
MR. MAWERE:
Good afternoon, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is ready.  And we also had a discussion with our colleagues, and I think they will be ready.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Do you have any agreement on who should present the exhibits first?  
MR. MAWERE:
Perhaps, Madam President, Your Honours, before we move to the bulk exhibits which are outstanding, the Prosecution would first seek to tender the statements relating to the witness we had this morning, T110.  We have served the justification note to our colleagues across the aisle, and they indicate they have no objection.  The statement is -- the original is in French with an uncertified English translation, and we have underlined the paragraphs that were referred to the witness during cross-examination.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, if you could switch off your microphone, please.  

Defence Counsel, is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Absolutely, Madam President.  We have no objection.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let us have the exhibits.  How many are they, Counsel?  If you could refer to them one by one.  
MR. MAWERE:
It is one statement in French dated -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to the statement of the witness?  
MR. MAWERE:
Yes.  It's a statement of the witness in French with an uncertified English translation.  There is just one document.  Accompanying it is a justification note dated 13th October 2010.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, this statement is of which date?  The date is not very clear from the statement.  If you have the date, please, could you give it to us. 
MR. MAWERE:
In fact, I actually notice that the copy that we have also does not have a date.  It was taken in 2010, 
but the date is not there.  I think they could have furnished us with another copy which has a date.  
My colleague will assist.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, the signed version is dated 12th January 2010.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Perhaps there should be a signed version which should be tendered, Learned Counsel, because this statement without a signature and without a date is rather like an anonymous document.  
MR. MAWERE:
Could we hand it in on Monday, Your Honours.  I think -- initially, we were given an unsigned one, and then later, we got a signed one.  I think we made an error and printed the unsigned copy.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  We will have it admitted on Monday before the witness is brought in.  
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Next.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  We have tried to make things as easy as possible.  We have provided each of Your Honours with a full set of all the exhibits which we intend to tender into 
exhibits, first.  Secondly, we have also -- for ease of reference, there is a list which is separated where 
you have each of these documents as well as its dates, its date of confession or when it was possible to identify that date, and there is a place where we can put the exhibit number that will be attributed to all of these documents as they are filed in.  

And, finally, I am happy to report that we have no contention with the Prosecutor and that all 
these documents can be admitted with the justification forms that Your Honours are provided with.  
The Prosecutor has received copies of these justification forms, and he will confirm with me that for each and every one of these exhibits he agrees with the justifications we have provided for their admission into the record.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution Counsel?  
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution confirms that we have ironed out all the issues and we are in agreement with the Defence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Now, these being Defence exhibits, Counsel, you will introduce one by one, and we assign a number, and then we have it admitted since there is no contention.  

Could we start -- it's difficult to follow all the justifications, but if you could briefly describe the exhibits for the record, please.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
And maybe just a bit of an explanation.  On the list you will notice sometimes we jump numbers.  The reason for that is that some of the exhibits were withdrawn and it would have become too complicated to create new lists every time.  But since these numbers anyway have no relevance because these exhibits will be attributed new numbers, I just wanted to clarify that matter so that Your Honours know what we are talking about.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, Counsel.  Let's proceed.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The first exhibit is number 1.  It is a written statement of Witness CNAP of 26 August 1998.  Both French and English versions are attached, and the justification is served along with the exhibit.  So the title of the first page will be alleged contradictions and omissions of Prosecution Witness CNAP as pointed out during his cross-examination by the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana on 10th and 
11th November 2009. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Slowly, Counsel, slowly.  Have mercy on the interpreters and recorders. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Most obliged, Madam President.  And my apologises to the court reporters.  

There are five justifications, and with each justification, there is a reference in the transcripts to link it with the case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, these are alleged contradictions and -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
And omissions. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And omissions.  All in one?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  There is one document listing the contradictions and omissions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But the statements -- how many statements are you admitting?  Because for the contradictions, we would need them to be underlined, and for the omissions, you would have to tender the whole document.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The documents are underlined.  Each of these documents is marked.  For example, if you go to the English version, you will notice that the relevant parts of the statements have been underlined.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But what I am saying, Learned Counsel, is that you would have to tender two versions of the statement, one to depict the alleged contradiction and another one for the omission.  Are you saying that you are tendering one document to show both?  Because that would be difficult.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
What we have is a first page or a title document where contradictions and omissions are listed and this accompanies the statement itself.  Of course, we cannot -- of course, we cannot underline omissions in a statement.  That is not possible.  But the omission is, nevertheless, mentioned in the accompanying document, and the omission -- the reference of the omission is referred to in the transcript.  And when it was a contradiction, these contradictions are underlined in the accompanying statement.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  You have prepared one justification for both.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, that is the case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
One further question.  You are talking about this being in both French and English.  Is -- the original is in French, I believe, but would the English version be an official translation and would one be required?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
What I can do for each of these documents -- here it's ICTR Prosecutor's statement.  So I believe that they are official translations because every time there is a certification that the translation was properly done and submitted to the witness.  

When we have both versions of a document, then, we, of course, have included both these versions.  Sometimes for some of the Gacaca documents, unfortunately, we don't have a translation, and these can be made once the documents are officially filed into the record. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  What is the date of the statement again?  28th?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
26th.  Just for ease of reference, we have -- on the justification sheet there is a description of 
the document.  And, for example, here it is the written statement of 26th August 1998 signed on 
9 September 1998, and you have the witness.  It is CNAP. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Let the written statement of Witness CNAP with the accompanying -- well, both in English and French with the accompanying justification be admitted as one document, one exhibit for the Defence, and it will be marked as a Defence exhibit.

Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 48.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 48.  
(Exhibit No. D. 48 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next documents are the minutes of Gacaca audience of Mporanyimigabo in Mugunga secteur.  There is a justification sheet as well as the original in Kinyarwanda of that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And for what reason are we admitting these minutes?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
These minutes are admitted because when he testified here, Witness CNBU involved -- implicated Mr. Nzabonimana, Mr. Karuganda and Mr. Kayiranga in certain events.  And when he testified in the Gacaca court, he did not so do, as we pointed out in the justification for the admission of that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the minutes of the Gacaca record of Mporanyimigabo, Mugunga secteur of -- of which date, Counsel? 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We have the year 2007. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Of 2007 in relation to CNBU be admitted as a Defence Exhibit D. 49.  

Registry? 
MR. MATEMANGA:
Yes, D. 49.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 49. 
(Exhibit No. D. 49 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
Learned Counsel, we have problems identifying the document in the big file.  What we have in tab 2 appears to be a record with a date 2006.  Are we looking at the right document?  

And perhaps as the documents are admitted, could the registry bring them forward for us to look at the copies to which you are assigning the exhibits.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Normally, if my orders were properly followed, the next document in line should be that one, and it is 
a document which starts with a -- as a title page called (French spoken), and it is indicated in 
Giko Gacaca.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Our concern is the date.  Judge T. will explain.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV:
And if you go further, then you would see at the top of the page the date 14th November -- it looks like it is 2006.  Isn't that the date?  And then above the seal there is something else which looks like a date, unless it is some serial number of the document, but it looks like a date. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And the date is contrary to what appears in the list which you have given us.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I realise that.  And to verify -- of course, these handwritten documents are not very easy sometimes to figure out.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV:
It takes a Judge to notice it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can we defer this exhibit while your team looks up this matter and proceed with the others.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I think we agree with the observation of Judge T.  I think it is indeed 14th November 2006 as a more accurate date.  And I thank you, Your Honour, for your vigilance.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The date is not 2007, but, rather, 14th November 2006.  Is that the case, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes, that is the case.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  That is noted.  
And, Registry, are we together?  If you could -- 
MR. MATEMANGA:
No.  No.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  That is why we need to see the exhibits you are marking as you mark them.  

Registry, where are you?  Have you found the document?  Maybe you could seek guidance from the Defence on the document, or you could come here and see our copy.  

Learned Counsel, you might have to amend your motivation document as it talks about 2007 rather than 2006, and you submit it.  In the meantime we will proceed.  

Next document.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next document is the written statement of Witness CNBU dated 4th October 2008 and signed on the same date, and there are contradictions between the statement and the testimony of the witness concerning the persons who were present when Mr. Nzabonimana stopped his car, the place where Mr. Nzabonimana stopped his car, the mention or not of the first attack, and the meeting where Mr. Karuganda, Munyabarenzi and Charles were present.  Both French and English versions are included, and the English version has been annotated.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of Witness CNBU dated 4th October 2008, both in English and French, together with a motivation are admitted as one document and as an exhibit for the Defence, and it would be Exhibit D. 50.  
MR. MATEMANGA:
Yes.  
(Exhibit No. D. 50 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let's proceed with the next one.  

Next, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next exhibit is the written statement of Witness CNAZ dated 11th September 2008 and signed on 9th October 2008.  And we seek its admission on the record for the ten reasons which each are contradictions listed on the justification sheet attached with the document.

The written statement of Witness CNAZ made on the 11th of September 2008 -- the statement is both in English and French -- with its motivation are admitted as one document and as an exhibit for the Defence, D. 51.  

Registry, that's that correct, the exhibit number?

MR. LAROCHELLE:

The date of the document is unknown, and the only version provided is the Kinyarwanda original.  It is provided with a copy of a justification sheet for the admission of that document, and it is an omission.  And the witness did not mention -- the accomplices of the witness did not mention Mr. Nzabonimana in the Gacaca information phase, and therefore, we seek its admission for the Defence.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The testimonies of CNAM's accomplices at the Gacaca information-gathering phase Takwe secteur of an unknown date in both English and French is admitted as a Defence Exhibit D. 53.  Is that the case, Registry? 
MR. MATEMANGA:
Yes, it is D.53.

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, is this one statement or various statements?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
This is one and only statement.  I think the witness was met on two different occasions and signed the statement on the second occasion.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So what is the date of the signing of the statement? 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
It is 24th September 1998.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let the statement of Witness CNAF made on 24th September 1998, both in English and French, together with its motivation, be admitted as one exhibit for the Defence, and it is D. 54.

The next document is the written statement of Witness CNAE.  It was signed on 19th October 1998.  We are tendering both French and English versions of that document, along with a justification sheet for its admission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of Witness CNAE, of 19th October 1998 in both English and French with the motivation are collectively admitted as D. 84.
(Exhibit No. D. 84 admitted, under seal)

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is the Gacaca information gathering book from the Kicyiro cellule.  We have date of 25th April 2005.  We are submitting the Kinyarwanda version of that document, and along with a justification sheet for its admission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Gacaca Kicyiro information gathering book of 25th April 2005, in Kinyarwanda is tendered as a Defence Exhibit -- with its motivation is tendered as a Defence exhibit, D. 85A.  We direct a French translation to be made of it and it will be 85B, and an English to be made of the French and it will be 85C.

Learned Counsel, before we leave these exhibits, we have noticed that the date you gave us is not the date that appears on the face of the record of this Gacaca book.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
We have noticed that.  We will correct the justification sheet because it runs from 7th June 2005 up to 2008, if we look at one of the latest pages -- at one of the latest pages.  So we will correct the justification sheet so that it reflects the first and last page of the document, so as to establish from 
the -- between which dates this information gathering phase took place. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  With that undertaken, we will admit the exhibit as already stated 85A, B and C.
(Exhibit No. D. 85A, D. 85B and D.85C admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is the transcript of a Radio Rwanda broadcast of 19th April 1994, and we are submitting both French, English and Kinyarwanda versions of that document, along with a motivation sheet for its admission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The radio transcript of Radio Rwanda, dated 19th April 1994, in Kinyarwanda, French and English, together with the motivation is tendered as one exhibit for the Defence, and it is D. 86. 
(Exhibit No. D. 86 admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honour, I've just been alerted by the Registrar that we have forgotten to put the statements of protected witnesses under seal.  
With your leave, what I think we should do is to maybe -- well, I will do it now as we proceed, but unless we shall, maybe point out immediately, which ones of these exhibits should be put under seal to ensure the security of their authors.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much, Learned Counsel.  That is a very important point which we have overlooked.  Yes, next, counsel.  We will revisit the statements after we come to the end, but from now on, take note so that we don't have to come back to these other statements we are going to handle subsequently.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next witness -- the next exhibit is the statement of Witness CNAA of 22 May 1996.  We are providing the French version of that document, along with a justification for its admission, and because it contains the particular of a Prosecution witness, it should be admitted under seal. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of Witness CNAA, signed on the 22nd of May 1996, in French is admitted as an exhibit for the Defence under seal, and we direct that an English translation be made of it.  The French version will be 87A and the English translation will be 87B, and both should be placed under seal, as they contain the personal particulars of this witness.
(Exhibit No. D. 87A, D. 87B and D. 87C admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is a letter sent by Witness CNAA to the Rwandan authorities on 20th August 2001.  We are providing French, English and Kinyarwanda versions of that letter, along with a justification for its admission.  Once again, because it is signed by a protected witness, it should be admitted under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
A letter written by Witness CNAA to Rwandan authorities, dated 21st August 2000 -- what is the year of the letter?  2001, in Kinyarwanda, French and English, together with the motivation are collectively admitted as Defence Exhibits 88, under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 88 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is a written statement by Witness CNAA, signed on 19th August 2003.  We are tendering both French and English versions of that statement, along with a justification sheet for its admission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement of Witness CNAA -- CNAA, signed on 19th August 2003, in both English and French, and accompanying motivation are tendered collectively as Defence Exhibit -- Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA: 
D. 89. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 89.  

Next.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Did we specify that it was to be under seal for 89?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Under seal, because it contains the particulars of this witness, who is a protected witness.
(Exhibit No. D. 89 admitted, under seal)
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is the report following the Gacaca information gathering phase in Kabgayi.  It is signed on 28th February 2005.  And we are submitting Kinyarwanda and French versions of the document, along with a justification for its admission.  I don't think it needs to be placed under seal.  Maybe the Prosecutor has submissions to be made in that regard.  There is no Prosecutor witnesses who are identified specifically in that document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
We concur -- we concur with the Defence. 
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV: 
Counsel, the document gives the span of dates between 28th February and 7th March 2005.  So it is not obvious that it was signed on 28th February, because so, if you look at the French translation, it reflects what the Kinyarwanda original says that the meetings were held at Gitarama prison from 
28th February 2005 to 7th March 2005.    So you should either give the date or give dates within which this statement was reduced.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Which we undertake to provide a correct justification document for that document reflecting the dates between -- in between which that information gathering took place.  So we will provide that document to the Court when we resume.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So what is the corrected -- what should the corrected version read like, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The correction -- the corrected version should read that the information gathering phase took place between 28th February and 7th March 2005.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right, with that correction, the document Gacaca information gathering phase, Kabgayi, is tendered in evidence -- in Kinyarwanda and French with the motivation, is tendered in evidence as 
Defence Exhibit 90A.  We direct that an English translation -- 
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV: 
The information gathering was regarding the events in Kabgayi, it looks like the document was produced at Gitarama prison. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Indeed, I read the first paragraph and between 28th February and 7th March 2005, prisoners in Gitarama prison held a gathering information session regarding events that occurred during the genocide in Kabgayi.  So I will basically reflect that in the amended justification sheet that will be provided for this last document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So with that correction from Judge T, then the title of the document should read "Gacaca information gathering phase, Kabgayi, at Gitarama prison, regarding events at Kabgayi held at Gitarama prison from -- held from 28th February 2005 to 7th March 2005."  Okay, the title is correct accordingly, and the exhibit is Defence Exhibit D. 90A.  And the English version when it becomes available, it will be D. 90B.

Yes, and Counsel, please be sure to give us the right titles for the documents.  
(Exhibit No. D. 90A and D. 90B admitted)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is the transcriptions of the testimony of Witness CNAA, in the case of 
Prosecutor versus Casimir Bizimungu, on 25th May 2005.  We are tendering French and English versions of that document, along with a justification sheet for its admission.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Is there any need for sealing this transcript?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The witness testified under a pseudonym, so it should be safe to assume that the same security that surrounded his identity in that case will not allow the identification of that witness by using those transcripts.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we noticed that the transcripts were taken in closed session.  So, perhaps we need to put them under seal.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, that will be safer to put them under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay, the transcripts of the hearing in Prosecutor versus Bizimungu, 25th May 2005, in French and English, are tendered -- and the motivation are tendered as one exhibit for the Defence, and it is D. 91, under seal, because they were made in closed session. 
(Exhibit No. D. 91 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is a letter sent by Witness CNAA to the prosecutor general of Rwanda.  It is dated 16th August 2005.  We are providing French and English versions of that document, along with its -- we are starting binder number 3, as it is now -- and it is accompanied by a justification sheet justifying its admission.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The letter of Witness CNAA, written to the prosecutor general of Rwanda on the 16th of August 2005, in English and French, together with its motivation is tendered collectively as Defence Exhibit D. 92 
under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 92 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next documents are the transcripts of the testimony of Witness CNAA, this time in Prosecutor versus Karemera, on 12th and 18th July 2007.  We are submitting both French and English versions of that document, along with a justification sheet for its admission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The transcripts of the hearing in Prosecutor versus Karemera, concerning CNAA's testimony on 
12th and 18th of July 2007, in both English and French, together with the motivation are tendered as Defence Exhibit 93.  
(Exhibit No. D. 93 admitted) 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is the written statement of Witness CNAA.  The statement was signed on 
2 October 2008.  We are tendering the English version of that statement as well as a justification sheet for its admission.  The document should be admitted under seal because it is a statement. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of Witness CNAA, signed on 2nd October 2008, in English with the motivation is tendered as an exhibit for the Defence under seal, and it will be D. 94A.  A French translation should be made of this statement and it should be 94B, and both should be under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. 94A and D. 94B admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The next document is a judgement rendered against Witness CNAA on 4th November 2008, in which CNAA listed his means of defence.  The document should be admitted under seal, as it contains the particulars of Witness CNAA.  And we are tendering Kinyarwanda, French and English versions of the document.  We are actually tendering Kinyarwanda and English version of the document, along with a justification for its admission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The judgement against Witness CNAA, dated 4th November 2008, in Kinyarwanda and English, together with a motivation are tendered collectively as Defence Exhibit 
D. 95A -- under seal?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
- - under seal, as they contain the particulars of this witness.  A French translation will be made and it will be 95B when it becomes available. 
(Exhibit No. D. 95A and 95B admitted, under seal)
(Pages 59 to 74 by Haruna Farage)



















1700H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next document is the guilty plea of Witness CNAA during the Gacaca information-gathering phase in the Nyamabuye cell.  It is dated 14th and 28th July 2005.  And we are providing -- we are tendering French Kinyarwanda and English versions of that document.  And we submit that they should be under seal because it, again, contains the particulars of Witness CNAA.  And we are tendering a justification sheet to justify its admission.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV:
Counsel, you got me, right?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV:
Okay.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So the confessions are of 15th April 2007, although I also see that it was made on 14th July 2005.  So I don't know if there is a translation mistake between the Kinyarwanda and the English versions.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What is the date on the Kinyarwanda version, Learned Counsel?  Is that the authoritative version?  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV:
The date on the Kinyarwanda version says 15 April 2007. That's the way it was translated into English and French.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
So again, we will correct the justification sheet for the admission of that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
With those corrections, the guilty plea of Witness CNAA in the Gacaca information-gathering phase of 15th April 2007 in Kinyarwanda, French and English, is tendered collectively with the justification as Defence Exhibit 96 under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 96 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next document is a pro justitia statement, dated 11th November 2001.  We are submitting Kinyarwanda, French and English versions of that document, along with a motivation sheet for its admission.  

It is 29th November, not 11th.  So we will make the corrections.  And it should be admitted under seal because it is the Prosecutor witness which -- who expresses himself in that document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  The written statement, the pro justitia of Witness CNAC, dated 29th November 2001, and provided in Kinyarwanda, French and English, is tendered as Defence Exhibit D. 97, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 97 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next document is the written statement of Witness CNAC, dated 20th August 2003.  We are providing French and English versions of that document, along with a justification sheet justifying its admission.  And we request that it be tendered under seal because it contains the -- it reveals the identity of Witness CNAC.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of Witness CNAC, dated 20th August 2003, provided in both French and English, with a motivation, is tendered collectively as Defence Exhibit D. 98 under seal. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 98 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next documents are the interview notes of Prosecutor Don Webster of an interview with 
Witness CNAC.  It is dated 2 -- 2nd July 2008.  And we are providing the English version of that document along with a justification sheet for its admission.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, your motivation reads 5 May instead of 2nd July.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We have taken note of the correction.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  With that correction then the interview note of Witness CNAC, dated 2nd July 2008, is admitted 
as -- in English it is admitted as Defence Exhibit D. 99A under seal.  We direct a French translation to be made thereof and it will be D. 99B, also under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 99A and D. 99B admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next document is the written statement of Witness CNAC of 11th November 2008.  We are tendering French and English versions of that document, along with a justification sheet for its admission.  And it should be under seal again.  I apologise.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The written statement of Witness CNAC of 11th November 2008 in English and French with a motivation is tendered as Defence Exhibit 100, under seal.  One, zero, zero. 
 (Exhibit No. D. 100 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The next document is the written statement of CNAJ.  It is dated 23rd March 2000.  It is tendered in both French and English, along with a justification for its admission and it should be admitted under seal because it contains the identity of Witness CNAJ.

2000. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
2000, in French and English, together with a motivation, is admitted as Defence Exhibit 101, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 101 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Next. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The last exhibit of these binders is the written statement of Witness CNAJ.  The interview was done on 22nd September of 2008 and the statement is signed 9th October 2008.  We are tendering French and English versions of that exhibit, along with a justification sheet for its admission.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement of Witness CNAJ, signed on 9th October 2008, in French and English with the motivation, is tendered as Defence Exhibit?  

Registry?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
D. 102. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
D. 102, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 102 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We now need to go back to seal the exhibits which were not sealed.  

Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  If we start from the beginning of the list, Exhibit D. 48 should be put under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Can I carry on?  D. 50, D. 51, D. 52, D. 54, D. 55, D. 56, D. 58, D. 59, D. 61, D. 63, D. 66, D. 67 -- 

Can I ask a few seconds to check whether the transcripts of Witness CNAK in Bizimungu contains closed session transcripts. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  As well you could check the transcripts of Witness CNAX, Exhibit D. 62.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The transcripts in Rukundo are actually from other witnesses, so I don't think they -- they were from the Father Dusard and Father Luis (phonetic).  They were from other people.  But CNAK, they are for the witness himself and I just -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, can counsel go a bit slower in his pace, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  The interpreters are pleading to you to slow down.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I heard their appeal and I will take heed of their notice.  And I apologise for my speed.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And after you are done, Counsel, you might have to go back to crosscheck, because you were rather fast with your narration.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Okay.  I'm told that both transcripts, Exhibit 68 and 69, are public.  So it is okay.  Then D. 70 should be put under seal.  D. 71 concerns the witness who came, and I remember that the questions might allow his identification.  So it would be preferable to put D. 71 under seal.  D 72, D. 73, D. 74, D. 75, D. 77, 
D. 78, D. 79, D. 80, D. 81, D. 83, D. 84, D. 87, D. -- well, after that, from 87, we identified as we were proceeding, the exhibits that needed to be put under seal.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, just to be sure, one last time -- one last time -- those exhibits that we did not seal in the beginning.  Repeat again.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Of course.  D. 48, D. 50, D. 51, D. 52, D. 54, D. 55, D. 56, D. 58, D. 59, D. 61, D. 63, D. 66, D. 67, 
D. 70, D. 71, D. 72, D. 73, D. 74, D. 75, D. 77, D. 78, D. 79, D. 80, D. 81, D. 83, D. 84.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Are there any exhibits from the Prosecution side?  

Are you done, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
One more, with your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The Gacaca -- I have copies here.  They are -- it is the information-gathering booklet, the one we left aside earlier on, on the Gacaca -- the information-gathering session in the Ruhango secteur.  There may be copies in your respective binders. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But what number was it?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We did not attribute it a number.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
On your list. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
You will find it between 70 -- number 27.  But you will find it between D. 70 and D. 71.  It is number 27 on the list I provided.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We didn't assign an exhibit number to it because we deferred it. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Yes.  I have here the justification sheet.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can you describe it again?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
It is the booklet of Gacaca information-gathering phase in Ruhango.  It was used, in fact, with all the witnesses that testified on the Ruhango events.  And I'm dealing here with CNAK, CNAJ, and T98 for the Defence.  And we used it at length when Witness T98 testified.  

And we were about to tender it into an exhibit at the end of T98's testimony, but we delayed that to a time where it would be marked, where all the extracts that were read to witness T98 would be indicated in that rather voluminous document.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Learned Counsel, what is the date of that book?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, again, it runs over -- it runs for a long time.  And what I will do -- because I realise that the justification I have here contains an erroneous date -- I will make sure to put the dates between which that document run and then that will make at least one exhibit whose justification sheet will not need to be corrected, and I will tender it when we resume next Monday, along with the document and the justification sheet.  That is my suggestion at this juncture.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So it is deferred for the second time?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
With my apologies.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  Is that the end, Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I'm very happy to announce that it is.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.  You've done a good job.  

Prosecution. 
MR. MAWERE:
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  That actually gave us the opportunity to obtain the signed copy of Witness T110's statement and we renew our application to tender the documents as exhibits.  

If registry could come and get the copies.  The signed French statement is dated the 12th April 2010.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Has Defence any -- 
MR. MAWERE:
The motivation remains the same. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  They should still have a look before we have reached the exhibits.  
MR. MAWERE:
I have given copies to the registry.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  As there was no objection from the Defence initially, and we have obtained a signed statement, the statement of Witness T110, dated 12th -- 
Which month, Counsel?  
MR. MAWERE:
The month doesn't seem very clear on the statement, but it was on the 12th day in 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
It's 12th January 2010.  The statement of Witness T110, dated January 12th, 2010, in both English and French, together with the motivation, is tendered as Prosecution Exhibit?  
MR. MATEMANGA:
P. 69. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 69.
(Exhibit No. P. 69 admitted, under seal)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Anything else?  
MR. MAWERE:
That will be all, Madam President, Your Honours.  Thank you very much.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The statement should be put under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of the witness.  
Thank you.  

We have now come to the end of the proceedings for this week.  We thank everybody for their contribution to the successful conclusion of this week's proceedings.  We will resume with these proceedings on Monday morning at 9 o'clock in the morning.  And we will begin with the deferred exhibits before the witness is brought in to testify.  

With that said, the proceedings are adjourned till Monday morning at 9 o'clock in the morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1722H)
