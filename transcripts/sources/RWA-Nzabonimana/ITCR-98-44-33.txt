         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Proceedings are called the to order.  Could 

         4        the registry please introduce the case coming before the 

         5        Trial Chamber this morning, please?

         6   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         7        the International Crimina Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         8        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston 

         9        Churchill Matanzima Maqutu, and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, 

        10        is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 24th 

        11        September 2002, for the continuation of the Defence case 

        12        when Defence counsel, Mr. Hinds, will continue the 

        13        examination-in-chief of DMR3, (DW6) in the matter of the 

        14        Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, Case No. 98-44A-T.  I 

        15        am most obliged, My Lord.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu, for the registry.  

        17        Can we have the appearance of the parties, starting with 

        18        the Prosecution, if we may, please, for the record.

        19   MR. FLEMING:  If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        20        trial attorney, appearing with Ms. Ojemeni, trial 

        21        attorney, and Ms. Marotine, case manager.  Thank you.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  May we also have 

        23        the appearance of the Defence, please.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Good morning, Your Honour.  Lennox Hinds, 

        25        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor 

        26        Bompaka, and with Mr. Emelien Dusabe, the interpreter.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  Interpreter, 

        28        could you please tell Witness DMR3 the following:  The 

        29        Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn declaration he 

        30        made yesterday and that he will continue with his 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                     24 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        evidence today on that same solemn declaration.

         2   THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, we were in closed session when we 

         4        adjourned yesterday for the reasons that we were given, 

         5        that is, that the nature of the evidence of this witness 

         6        cannot be given without risking disclosure his identity.  

         7        So, we will go back into closed session to enable 

         8        counsel to continue his examination-in-chief.  When we 

         9        get to a place where it is possible to get the evidence 

        10        in open session, the Trial Chamber will direct that that 

        11        be done.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Your Honour, before we go into closed 

        13        session, there is a matter that I want to bring up. 

        14        Well, we can do it in closed session, but it doesn't 

        15        require closed session for us to do this.

        16        

        17        It involves the request that I made --

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  We can hear this in open session and 

        19        then we can go into closed session later.  There should 

        20        be no confusion about this because it can be risky. 

        21        

        22        Yes, Counsel.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS:  It is a matter that is not only annoying,  

        24        but quite vexing.  We had requested to the victim and 

        25        witness protection programme, a request that witnesses 

        26        for Mr. Kajelijeli, after completing their testimony, be 

        27        allowed to visit with Mr. Kajelijeli pursuant to, at 

        28        least a decision and which we consider to be 

        29        jurisprudence of this Tribunal as evidence in the case 

        30        Prosecutor v. André Ntagerura, where Chamber III issued 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        2

         1        such an order; Judge Pillay did.  We made copies of that 

         2        decision available to Mr. Kiyeyeu and the Registrar.  

         3        

         4        But yesterday was a particular situation because we 

         5        didn't know what would be the outcome of 

         6        Mr. Kajelijeli's illness.  So, his second wife had 

         7        finished testifying.  We had made a request that she be 

         8        allowed to visit him.  What happened there was that we 

         9        were trying to get that visit completed in addition to 

        10        all other witnesses who had already testified.  But in 

        11        particular we were dealing with that particular 

        12        situation and we were told that the Prosecutor's office 

        13        needed to approve this.  All day went by, no approval.  

        14        All day.  The man is sick.  Why?  Why should we be at 

        15        the whim of the Prosecutor?  Why could not this Chamber 

        16        issue an order just like Judge Pillay did and so be 

        17        done, without the need for the Prosecutor?  And I am not 

        18        suggesting any bad faith or malice on their part.  They 

        19        may just have been very busy and couldn't just deal with 

        20        the issue in a timely way.  They may have been involved 

        21        in other matters; the person who was to make the 

        22        decision may not have been there.  I don't know what it 

        23        is.  The fact of the matter is, all day went by and he 

        24        was not able to get the visit.  We got an approval this 

        25        morning; it was handed to me that there is no problem, 

        26        the Prosecutor approves.

        27        

        28        But it is a situation where we felt there was no need 

        29        for the Prosecutor to be involved in this situation if 

        30        this Court had ordered that with respect to these 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

          KAJELIJELI                                     24 SEPTEMBER 2002



         1        witnesses who we know who are here, after their 

         2        testimony, they would be able to visit, which includes 

         3        all witnesses.  And if there were some special 

         4        applications that we wanted to make we will do so.

         5        

         6        So, I just raised that because we didn't know why there 

         7        wasn't the approval yesterday; there is approval today. 

         8        We thought it was a major issue with the Prosecutor's 

         9        office, but it is a situation which was very sensitive 

        10        given our client's health problems, and everyone was 

        11        concerned, and so on.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, we take note of that.

        13   MS. OJEMENI:  Your Honour, I would like to make a comment.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, please.

        15   MS. OJEMENI:  I would like to remind my learned friend, or 

        16        draw his attention to Rule 64 of the detention unit 

        17        regulations.  Indeed the application was -- our 

        18        attention was drawn to the application yesterday, and we 

        19        indicated that we would look into the matter and get 

        20        back to WVSS by this morning, which we have done.  It is 

        21        not in all cases that we would give our approval, and I 

        22        will reserve whatever objection we might have when the 

        23        case arises, but at the same time I would like to draw 

        24        his attention to Rule 64, and it is very clear.  I don't 

        25        need to waste the time of the Court by reading it now.  

        26        But he will have -- I just want him to look at it so 

        27        that when the issue arises and our attention is drawn to 

        28        the application he will know why.  That's all I have to 

        29        say.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT:  That is Rule 64 of the Rules of Procedure and

         1        Evidence or of the detention facility?

         2   MS. OJEMENI:  Rules governing the detention of persons 

         3        awaiting trial.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  All right.  We take note of the observations 

         5        of counsel, particularly counsel of the Defence.  There 

         6        is no specific issue being addressed before the Trial 

         7        Chamber now with regard to this particular issue.  I am 

         8        sure when this matter arises, or a similar matter may 

         9        arise, it may be examined by the parties, taking into 

        10        account the circumstances particular given to every 

        11        situation.  They should be able to reach some positions 

        12        which could serve to have a clear procedure in this 

        13        matter.  We hope that can be done, I am sure.  But if 

        14        there is any problem, issues can always be raised to -- 

        15        before the Trial Chamber for specific decisions if need 

        16        be, if we get there.  Okay.  All right.  We will now go 

        17        back to closed session to enable the witness to continue 

        18        his evidence for the reasons that have already been 

        19        given.

         1        1515H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  

         3        

         4        We are in open session, is that it?  Okay.  Right.  

         5        Professor Hinds, your next witness? 

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: The Defence calls RHU23.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: R?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: HU23.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: RHU23.  It's not Nzirorera?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, we are going to put Ms. Nzirorera on 

        11        after this witness.  We have scheduled him before -- we 

        12        had scheduled him before -- we had scheduled before, but 

        13        I have a discussion with Mr. Fleming yesterday, and we 

        14        prefer to put Nzirorera on after this witness. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Is that the position from the 

        16        Prosecution side? 

        17   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.  We had that discussion, I 

        18        think, at the beginning of yesterday in Court, and that 

        19        was position then.  

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, I see.

        21   MR. FLEMING: And, we don't object to this at all.  In fact, 

        22        we agreed to it then.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Now, there is a motion which has -- our 

        24        attention has been brought to a motion filed by the 

        25        Defence.  We can deal with it in two ways.  We can have 

        26        the response from the Prosecution to that motion, short 

        27        motion, and then the Trial Chamber can rule on that or 

        28        we can have it orally argued, and that's it.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I thought that we would deal 

        30        with it before Ms. Nzirorera testifies.  And if the

         1        Chamber wants oral argument on it, we are prepared.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't really -- the Chamber spoke 

         3        immediately to the parties.  Mr. Fleming? 

         4   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours.  The other reason why it 

         5        might be appropriate to have it heard then is that I'm 

         6        sure that Mr. Nzirorera's counsel would want to be heard 

         7        as well.  So, all three parties would then be 

         8        represented.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: For the motion.

        10   MR. FLEMING: Yes.  And I know he is not on the motion, but 

        11        it's a motion obviously which will be of great interest 

        12        to him.  So, I don't oppose that process.  I anticipate 

        13        that we would argue it orally at the beginning of his 

        14        evidence, subject to what Your Honours have to say. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: We can do that.  So, maybe tomorrow then. 

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  I mean, depending on this witness.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Can you bring in Witness RHU23, 

        18        registry? 

        19   MR. KIYEYEU: We are going to do so, My Lord.  We were simply 

        20        waiting for your directions.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: We were just -- well, noting that the 

        22        pseudonyms are quite complicated. 

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Do you want to know the thinking behind 

        24        this?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: No, no, no.  We just --

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, there are some witnesses who --

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Yes.  

        28        (Witness RHU23 sworn in Kinyarwanda)

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Witness RHU23, you have just made a 

        30        solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to

         1        how your evidence should be taken here, we will explain 

         2        a few essential elements.  You will be led in your 

         3        evidence-in-chief by the Defence, who are seated on this 

         4        side of the courtroom.  Thereafter, questions would be 

         5        put to you in cross-examination by the Prosecution, who 

         6        are seated on this side of the courtroom.  Yes, also the 

         7        Judges sitting in front of you may put questions to you 

         8        to clarify your evidence, if they will have such 

         9        questions to ask you.  

        10        

        11        If a question is put to you is not clear, or you do not 

        12        understand it, please say so, and such a question shall 

        13        be repeated or explained.  Yes, these are few essential 

        14        things we wanted to explain to you before you begin your 

        15        evidence.  

        16        

        17        Yes, Professor Hinds, please. 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  

        19        

        20        Before we begin, Your Honour, I think that we had 

        21        indicated to the Court that there was a witness who had, 

        22        because of his activities in Rwanda as a public speaker, 

        23        his voice is recognisable.  And we enquired as to 

        24        whether or not there could be alteration of voice.  This 

        25        is the witness.  In other words, if the witness would 

        26        prepare that he be able to give his testimony in open 

        27        Court, but his voice in and of itself, he believes might 

        28        disclose his identity because of the amount of public 

        29        speaking he has done, and we had enquired from the 

        30        registry as to whether or not there could be voice

         1        alteration.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  I think the Rules provide; I don't know 

         3        whether we have -- that was addressed. 

         4   MR. KIYEYEU: Maybe, if we had informed the coordinator -- I 

         5        was not aware of that, but there is a provision of 

         6        scrambling the voice.  Let me consult the technicians, 

         7        please, because I was not aware before we started.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Rule 75.  So, he is only worried about the 

         9        voice? 

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: There are some other concerns that he has 

        11        indicated he wanted to address to the Court directly 

        12        himself before he testifies.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: In open Court or that would be in closed 

        14        session, which is which? 

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think it will be better in closed session 

        16        since we may not have the voice alteration in place, and 

        17        he can deal with that right now.  But if we have the 

        18        voice alteration, he will address you directly of his 

        19        concerns.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We are informed by the registry that the 

        21        scrambling of the voice can be done, but the technicians 

        22        currently on board cannot do it.  They can make 

        23        arrangement and that can take time.  So, they just 

        24        suggest that the easiest way out is to go in closed 

        25        session, if the identity of the witness is to be 

        26        protected, and when they are ready they would notify us, 

        27        and then we can go into open session and adopt the voice 

        28        change.  That would be possible at that stage.  So, 

        29        instead staying these proceedings, for that reason, 

        30        we'll go in closed session for -- when they are working

         1        out on the possible voice alteration.  

         2        

         3        All right.  They will work it out.  There are quite a 

         4        number of other things to be sorted out.  So, we'll go 

         5        in closed session to enable the witness to begin his 

         6        testimony.
