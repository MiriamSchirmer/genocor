MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, every one. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday the 4th of July 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44(C)-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Fry. 

Appearances the same as -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Regrettably not in our case.  I've been told this morning that in fact Andreas O'Shea, co-counsel, of course, for Rwamakuba, isn't here today because he's been struck by an amoebic bug or virus and he's in hospital this morning.  I understand that he is there as a result of falling ill yesterday.  I only heard this morning.  He was good enough to contact someone here at the court, but displayed extraordinary reticence in not contacting me.  As far as I know, he is, as they say, "as well as can be expected," I hope to make contact with him today.  But he is not with us today, and I suspect he won't be with us for several days but we'll have to see.  Otherwise, the Defence team is as -- as before.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  Well, we are sorry to hear those bad news, and we do wish him speedy recovery.  

Now, Mr. Hooper, this is another Monday morning, and -- so I ask again about Mr. -- Dr. Rwamakuba.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I haven't been in contact with him at all since last week.  There was no telephone link between us on Friday or Saturday, and I didn't visit him Friday.  Our time was taken up with other things, and I chose not to visit him on Saturday because I had, I thought, other things which merited attention.  So I haven't seen him, in fact, and I can't tell you what his response or attitude is since I last saw him last Friday week.  I would hope to see him later this week.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We do think it's important that the invitation to attend court is renewed.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Despite his expressed reticence.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS: 
I can hear, but not very well.  You should speak louder.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could you please go and increase the volume on the witness's headset now?  
THE WITNESS: 
I cannot hear very well.  The voice I hear sounds very distant.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
He is listening to the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry --

Well, Mr. Witness, this is another attempt to find out, can you hear better now?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

This morning, you are going to continue the evidence that you began on Friday.  You will be giving evidence under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you commenced your evidence on Friday.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand.  But I should like to point out that the document bearing my -- the particulars pertaining to my identity is incomplete.  I should like to be shown it again so that I can add an item that wasn't there before. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, you can manage that?

MR. NIANE: 
I think it was already placed under seal, so it is with the registry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar, would you assist, please.  
THE WITNESS: 
Do you speak Kinyarwanda?  Bring someone to me who can speak Kinyarwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. NIANE: 
Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS: 
It is with respect -- in respect of my profession.  It said that I was **********************************, but, in fact, I am principally *********************.  That is what I wanted to correct.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, yes, the reason why we give you this document so this matter could be addressed in writing was to protect your identity as a protected witness.  And it was to avoid you having to give evidence of those details which would be accessible to the public.  So during the course of your testimony, you would be expected to refrain from making statements about yourself which could reveal your identity to anyone listening or reading the transcript of the evidence.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS: 
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both lawyers will be trying to prevent any unintentional disclosures, and you will also have to be alert to the way in which you answer questions that are put to you.  

Now, Mr. Registrar, should I order the deletion of his occupation from the -- put it under seal or it's not --  it's still innocuous.  

Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. NIANE: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may take the witness now.  
MR. NIANE: 
Thank you.  


WITNESS GAC
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. NIANE: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will begin by asking you if you were -- went to school -- if you've been to school? 
A.	Yes, I have been to school. 
Q.	And how many years did you do? 
A.	I was in primary school for six years, which means that I learnt how to read and write, but only in Kinyarwanda. 
Q.	And have you ever met investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have met them. 
Q.	And on -- when you met them did you make a statement? 
A.	Yes, they wrote down my statement. 
Q.	Did you at that time sign your statement? 
A.	Yes, I did sign it. 
Q.	Have you testified before the Gacaca courts? 
A.	No, not yet. 
Q.	Have you ever testified before ICTR? 
A.	You mean this Tribunal where we are now?  
Q.	Yes, indeed.  
A.	Yes, I have already testified before this Tribunal. 
Q.	Do you remember the date on which you testified? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you remember against whom you testified? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who was it, please? 
A.	It was Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda. 
Q.	And today against whom are you going to testify? 
A.	André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Do you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I knew him briefly. 
Q.	Have you ever heard him being talked about? 
A.	You are asking me if I heard people saying what about him?  
Q.	I'm just asking if you heard talk about him? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever seen him? 
A.	Yes, I have seen him. 
Q.	On how many occasions have you seen him? 
A.	Four times. 
Q.	Fine.  In that case, let us proceed in chronological order.  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	When did you see him for the first time? 
A.	I don't remember the exact date, nor do I remember the year, but I saw him at a place called Rutunga. 
Q.	In what circumstances did you see him? 
A.	I found him there and some people had come and were curious to see him.  I asked who it was and I was told it was André Rwamakuba.  He was with Munyazesa, and he was at a place where a school was going to be built at this place called Rutunga, and he had come to place the first stone in the construction of that school. 
Q.	And on that occasion what did he do? 
A.	To my knowledge, he didn't do anything.  I didn't see him do anything because I left the place immediately -- forthwith. 
Q.	You say he was with Munyazesa.  Who was Munyazesa? 
A.	He was the minister of primary and secondary education. 
Q.	Were there many people present at that event? 
A.	No, very few people.  It wasn't a meeting, as such, or a rally.  There were a few teachers there and the people I have mentioned. 
Q.	You said in the beginning that you cannot exactly remember the date, but can you somehow tell us when it was in relation to in respect of April 1994? 
A.	It was before 1994. 
Q.	And the second time, you saw him where? 
A.	I saw him at a political meeting in Kayanga. 
Q.	Where exactly in Kayanga? 
A.	But I have just told you, it was at a place where the meeting was held. 
Q.	Please listen carefully to the question.  You said that the meeting was held in Kayanga, but at what exact place in Kayanga? 
A.	It was in the courtyard of Kayanga school. 
Q.	Who had organised that meeting? 
A.	Faustin Twagiramungu. 
Q.	Were there other political figures apart from Faustin Twagiramungu and André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Yes, there were many of them, but I did not know their names.  There were people from four different communes, approximately, who are gathered at that place. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of that meeting? 
A.	The meeting was held during the multi-party politics time.  And, in my opinion, this was in preparation for the war. 
Q.	Were speeches made during that rally or meeting? 
A.	Yes, of course, there were speeches that were made. 
Q.	Can you tell us who were the personalities or people who took the floor to give speeches during that rally? 
A.	I will tell you what I know, and I will begin by citing the name of Twagiramungu.  I will also mention Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba.  As for the other persons who made speeches, I do not know their names. 
Q.	Let's begin with Rwamakuba.  
A.	Very well.  
Q.	What did Rwamakuba say during -- when he made his speech? 
A.	I only heard one thing that he said and then I left immediately thereafter.  He said, "According to you, who are those who are many more than the others; is it the people who have tinned roofs or those who have thatched roofs?"  That he asked again, "If you were asked to burn down the houses of people, which houses are with thatched roofs would it take much time --
MR. HOOPER: 
Before we move on, would it be possible to have that portion of his evidence translated again because I certainly do not feel I'd gotten perhaps an accurate translation -- well, may have got what the witness was saying.  I'm unclear.  Could we have that portion of his evidence again, please?  It was rather disjointed.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, can you repeat what you've just said in the interest of the Defence? 
A.	He asked the people the following question:  "If you were to make a comparison between people who have houses that are roofs with thatches or with tinned roofs who are many?"  And he was told that it is people with thatched roofs.  And then he said again, "Would it take a long time to burn down the houses that have thatched roofs?"  And he was told, no, that won't take much time.  Now, when I heard that, I left and went home with other people who felt that they were targeted by those statements. 
Q.	That was the second time.  How about the third time, when did you see him for the third time? 
A.	I saw him when he was at a place called Kantanbana. 
Q.	What did he come to do there? 
A.	I don't know why he was there.  But when I saw him, he was conferring with somebody who later on became an Interahamwe.  But while they were conferring we did not know that that person was a member of the Interahamwe, it was only later that we realised that, indeed, he was an accomplished Interahamwe. 
Q.	Do you know the person with whom he was conferring? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who was that? 
A.	The person was Etienne Kamanzi. 
Q.	Who was Etienne Kamanzi? 
A.	He was a nurse. 
Q.	Did he come alone to see Etienne Kamanzi? 
A.	I do not know when I saw him at the location.  And when I saw him, he was conferring with Etienne in front of the said Etienne's residence. 
Q.	For how long did their conversation go on? 
A.	No, I can't tell.  I was with other persons and when we got to where they were, we stopped, and since Kamanzi knew us, he began to converse with the -- with Rwamakuba in French.  And since we did not understand French, we couldn't follow what he was saying and therefore we carried on, you know, going where we were going.  
Q.	You said a while ago that Etienne Kamanzi was a nurse.  Where exactly was he a nurse? 
A.	He was a nurse at the Kayanga health centre. 
Q.	According to you, how did he come to Kayanga? 
A.	Who is it you are talking about?  
Q.	Rwamakuba. 
A.	Each time that he came, he came aboard a car. 
Q.	Did you see the car? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you describe the car? 
A.	It was a white sedan. 
Q.	At what time of the day exactly did you see him in front of Kamanzi's house? 
A.	I can't remember but it was during the day. 
Q.	Without giving me a specific hour, was it in the morning, in the afternoon or in the evening? 
A.	It was around midday.  I could see that it was at a -- around midday. 
Q.	And the fourth time you saw him, where exactly did you see him? 
A.	The fourth time you said?  Are we talking about the fourth time that I saw him?  
Q.	You said at the beginning of your testimony that you saw Rwamakuba four times.  You described the four times -- the first three times that you saw him.  Now I'm asking you about the fourth time that you saw him, please.  
A.	The fourth time he passed by us -- by where we were standing in the road going towards a pub.  We passed by the residence of the person that he used to come to see, and we saw Rwamakuba standing there in front of his residence.  That was on the day following the death of Habyarimana. 
Q.	Who is the person that he used to come often to see? 
A.	That was Kamanzi. 
Q.	And what was he doing in front of Kamanzi's house? 
A.	Well, they stood there together. 
Q.	And did you remain there for a long time? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What happened when you saw him with Kamanzi? 
A.	When we arrived there, we realised that he had opened his car and he was giving him machetes.  And he asked him, "Where are you going?"  And Kamanzi told him, "I'm going to the health centre."  Rwamakuba told him, "You are going to the health -- you're still going to work to the health centre?"  And Kamanzi replied by saying, "There were people who had been beaten up who were at the health centre that I'm going to attend to."  Then Rwamakuba told him, "But you are going to give treatment to the Tutsis?"  And he said, "I'm going to give drugs." 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, I'm trying to keep a note.  I can't keep up with that significant passage of evidence.  Can I invite the Prosecution to have the witness go over that or repeat.  I'm quite happy with the repetition of what has just been said, but I just need to keep a note of what has been said.

Mr. President, I don't know if you can assist because you've got the advantage over some of us of having the -- or you may have, anyway if it's working, the contemporaneous transcript.  No?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not working today.  I don't have access today.
MR. HOOPER: 
No.  All right.  Then, can -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the witness -- maybe it might be best if the witness repeats it.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  

I've gone as far as:  "They were in front of Kamanzi's house.  When we arrived there, we realised he'd opened his car" -- and I am not sure -- "and he had machetes and A.R. asked him where he was going."  That's my note but it may not be accurate.  I don't think it is.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you go more slowly for the Defence and repeat what you have just said concerning the meeting between Rwamakuba and Kamanzi when Rwamakuba found him in front of his house, please? 
A.	Probably, you may ask the counsel for the Defence where he wants me to begin. 
MR. NIANE: 
Counsel, can you tell us exactly where you got, you know, where you couldn't find your words any more so that the witness can continue giving his testimony?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just a minute, Mr. Prosecutor.  Mr. Prosecutor, I think it will be sufficient if you will just ask the witness to recap his evidence as to what happened when he saw Rwamakuba and Kamanzi at that time.  Just ask him to give his evidence again.  
MR. NIANE: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you repeat your answer concerning the meeting between Rwamakuba and Mr. Kamanzi on the third occasion that you saw them -- or that you saw him? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, it is the fourth occasion.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	The fourth time.  
A.	On the fourth occasion when I saw him, he came on board a car and he bypassed us on the road and he was moving towards Kamanzi's residence.  We followed on foot, and when we got to Kamanzi's residence, because his residence was on our way, we found Rwamakuba with Kamanzi, and the two of them were moving towards the car.  He opened the car, the door of the car, and he asked Kamanzi where he was going and Kamanzi told him he was going to the health centre because there were Tutsi wounded persons who were suffering lots of pain.  And Rwamakuba asked him, "You mean you still -- you are still treating Tutsis?"  
MR. HOOPER: 
Can we just split it up a bit so that we can keep a note of each little bit, just a gap between the evidence just -- would certainly assist me.  I've got as far as "And the two were going towards the car.  He opened" -- and I didn't get what it was of the car -- "And André Rwamakuba asked where he was going" -- and then after that I haven't kept up.  The "The two were going towards the car, he opened --" 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you repeat slowly, beginning from when you said Rwamakuba talked to Kamanzi when Kamanzi was going towards the health centre? 
A.	I am waiting for the counsel for the Defence to finish taking his notes and when he would have been done, he probably should advise me.  

Kamanzi told Rwamakuba that he was going to the health centre where there were Tutsis who were suffering unbearable pain.  And Rwamakuba asked him, "You mean you are continuing to give treatment to the Tutsis?"  And he told him, "Wait, I will give you medicine that you are going to administer to them -- or to give them."  And immediately, he started giving him machetes. 
Q.	Did you see the machetes? 
A.	I saw them.  The events I have just told you about are events that I witnessed with my own eyes. 
Q.	Where were the machetes? 
A.	The machetes were in the boot of the car. 
Q.	Witness, we're going to talk about the dates once again.  You said you saw him after the genocide -- after the 6th of April.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think there was a (Overlapping microphones) ... I myself don't recall that date, the 6th of April.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, Mr. President,
THE WITNESS:  
I did not give any date.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, he did.  He said, "The fourth time he passed us by where we were standing going towards the pub" -- translation in English -- "This was the day after the death of Habyarimana.  Well, they were in front of Kamanzi's house."  You did give us a date on that -- on the fourth occasion, quite clearly.  
MR. NIANE: 
Mr. President, I merely want to go back to the problem of dates so that the witness can tell us exactly on what date he saw them.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Excuse, me, this isn't cross-examination (overlapping microphones) ... on their way to a pub.  So he has given us a date as to this.  If you want him to change the date if he's gone on script (sic), I understand the difficulty.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I don't think that is what happened.  The counsel put the -- used the term the 6th of April.  The witness had not said what was the date on which President Habyarimana had died, and my only comment to him was perhaps the witness had not given a date, but you are describing events.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I am.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I've jumped ahead.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, that's all.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  
MR. NIANE: 
Thank you, President.  

BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, we are going back to talk about the date.  When exactly did you say you saw him? 
A.	Don't hold it against me, if you see me bending my head, it's because I have some problems with my neck.  I told it was on the day following the death of President Habyarimana who was commonly known as Kinani.  So it was on the day following the death of Habyarimana and that's the day on which we met him. 
Q.	Was that the third or the fourth time? 
A.	I don't quite recall any more. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to ask you a question.  Are you feeling all right?  
A.	I am ill, but I think I can continue to give testimony. 
Q.	Thank you.  So you state that you saw him on the day following the death of the president, but can you tell us on what date precisely? 
A.	I think you yourself pointed this out yesterday when I came here, I asked on what date were we on.  Even if you ask me about the date after -- you ask me the date today, I won't be in a position to tell you.  But if you tell us on what day it was, I won't be in a position to tell you.  I have spent quite some time here, and I have been ill and I think I have lost the notion of time.  I, therefore, cannot put a date -- - give a date on the day of that meeting because I can't recall.
Q.	We are going to continue.  So you saw him with machetes.  Where exactly were those machetes? 
A.	Those machetes were in the boot of the car where victors (sic) that are bought are generally put.  And then that place in the car is usually closed. 
Q.	How do you know that it was machetes? 
A.	The vehicle was parked on the road, and when he brought out the machetes, I saw them.  And there was a woman who passed by who was also given machetes. 
Q.	Which woman are you referring to? 
A.	It was a certain Mukarulinda. 
Q.	Who gave the machetes to the woman? 
A.	It is Kamanzi who gave her machetes.  The woman had just told her (sic), "Now, listen, I also have six Abakiga who can work; give me machetes."  
Q.	How many machetes did Kamanzi give to the woman? 
A.	Six machetes. 
Q.	Was Mr. Rwamakuba present when Kamanzi was giving the machetes to the woman? 
A.	Mr. Rwamakuba was still there.  When we saw machetes being distributed, we continued on our way. 
Q.	You said that Rwamakuba was there when Kamanzi was giving the machetes to the woman.  What was his reaction? 
A.	Rwamakuba was just standing there.  He didn't say anything.  And when we got there, he didn't say anything.  It is when we left that they probably continued to do what they were doing, that is, after we had passed by and gone. 
Q.	You told us that the woman gave machetes to six Abakigas.  Who are the Abakigas?  What is an Abakiga? 
A.	The Abakigas are Rwandans who are natives of Adukiga which is situated -- located in Byumba and Ruhengeri.  These are people who had come to our region from their own region, fleeing the war or the combat that was being waged by the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Why did the woman give the machetes to the Abakiga? 
A.	She distributed the machetes to them because it was necessary at the time to do so. 
Q.	What do you mean by the statement "it was necessary"? 
A.	I understand that the massacres had been planned and that is why the machetes were being distributed.  Those machetes were designed for killing people and, indeed, the machetes were used to kill people. 
Q.	Are you aware whether the Abakiga used the machetes to kill people? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how did you come to know about that? 
A.	I know it because on the day that they started attacking people with machetes, those Abakigas went towards the Rutunga trading centre where there were many refugees, and then they came back with a sizeable group of other refugees.  The policeman called Nyarwaya shot in the air and he told them, "You may begin."  So they began burning down houses, looting; but at the very beginning, they assaulted neighbouring persons at Mukalinda (phonetic). 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, I didn't catch all that, again.  Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should try to control the pace at which the witness gives his testimony.  It is too fast.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Can you answer the questions one by one?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Overlapping microphones)
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, we will have to go back a little bit.  
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President -- 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	I had asked you if you knew if the Abakiga had used the machetes to kill people with.  Give us a short and a precise answer.  
A.	I know that the Abakiga used the machetes to kill people.  
Q.	Do you know the people who were killed by those Abakigas? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And who were those persons?
A.	If I were to give the names of those persons, won't that be a risk?  You said that I should exercise some caution in order not to reveal my identity.
Q.	You are very correct.  I am going to rephrase the question since we are in open session.  What is the ethnic origin of those who were killed?
(Pages 1 to 13 by Gifty C. Harding)
































1000H 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	What is the -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Would it be possible before we move onto the specifics of who would be killed, we could complete what he was saying before.  I got as far as "Nyarwaya shot in the air and said, "you may begin." But before that -- and something had happened before that, and I didn't get it.  I didn't get the last two or three sentences of his evidence before we came to the specifics of who may have lost their lives.  So,            I --  thank you.  
MR. NIANE:
I think you didn't understand, when he talked about Nyarwaya he mentioned a policeman.  He had not started giving the names of the victims. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I appreciate that.  The problem is, when the witness gave, effectively, a paragraph of information about whether the machetes had been used to kill the people, he went quite swiftly through that.  And the consequence of that was that I wasn't, for one, capable of keeping up to write a note of what he was saying, and I have missed some of that testimony as the result.  Following that testimony, he was then asked if he knew the people who had been killed.  Before we get to that, could we just backtrack to the point where he said Nyarwaya -- and I don't think he specified he was a policeman, but Nyarwaya, who we know is the brigadier policeman, "shot in the air and said --" and my record is "you may begin."  I don't think that is an accurate note of what Nyarwaya allegedly said from the lips of this witness this morning.  So, if we could go from there, just to the conclusion of that, it would greatly assist me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. NIANE:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have to take into account that in leading the evidence, it is no use if people don't actually get it.  And in a trial of this nature, it is important for the Accused to hear the testimony that is being adduced against him.  Now, in this case, we have the added problem that the Accused is not actually in court, and his counsel has to hear the testimony that is being adduced.  If -- even if you think Mr. Hooper is slow in recording the testimony, one still has to ensure that the testimony is heard by the Accused.  So you have to adjust to your pace to accommodate that position; do you understand?  
MR. NIANE:
Understood, Mr. President, but before coming back to the question I should like to make a remark in respect of what Mr. Hooper has said.  The witness, in answer to the question put to him, did answer that the six Abakiga did take part in the massacre, and it was Nyarwaya who shot in the air and thereby gave the starting signal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What Mr. Hooper is complaining about is that he did not get a note of what the witness was saying, and he suspected that the note that he took may have been inaccurate.  So he was requesting that you assisted him in asking the witness to repeat the question so that he could make an accurate report of what the witness actually said.  So, that is all he is trying to do up to now.  

And I think that in a trial of this nature, it is important that you ensure that the Accused hears the testimony that is being adduced against him.  And all that seems to be required is that you control the speed at which your witness gives his evidence. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes.  It may assist if I just read the note I have got, so that you don't need necessarily to go through it all.  "I know it because the day they started attacking people, the Abakiga went towards the Rutunga trading centre and came back with a sizeable number of refugees.  Nyarwaya shot in the air, you may begin --" but my note gets less and less accurate as it goes on through that passage.  And that is as much as I have got.  Thank you.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, what happened when Nyarwaya shot in the air?  Please speak slowly so that everyone can take note.
A.	The assailants smashed in the doors of the traders at the trading centre, some started looting, others set fire to houses.  The young people from Mukarulinda's house that I mentioned to you, attacked their neighbors.   
Q.	Please speak slowly, Witness.  
A.	It was at that place that the massacres began.
Q.	You spoke of shops being looted and houses being set on fire, who did those shops and houses belong to? 
A.	If you want the names, give me a piece of paper and I will write them down. 
Q.	No, I don't want the names, I want to know the ethnicity? 
A.	They were Tutsi. 
Q.	Who were the perpetrators of the massacres? 
A.	Hutu. 
Q.	According to you, who gave the order to carry out those massacres? 
A.	It was Nyarwaya, but he himself had taken part in a meeting the day before where the instructions were issued. 
Q.	And who issued those instructions or orders? 
A.	I don't know who issued the orders, if they were Interahamwe, policemen, conseiller who took part in that meeting.  And they were told not to reveal who had issued the orders or what sort of orders had been issued to them. 
Q.	Did you take part in that meeting yourself?
A.	No, I couldn't take part. 
Q.	Then how do you know it? 
A.	There was a conseiller who was our neighbour.  When we heard that there was a meeting, we asked him what had been said at the meeting, and the conseiller told us that they had been told that whoever revealed what had been decided at the meeting would be the first one killed. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I just interrupt at this stage?  This evidence of this secret meeting, I'm not aware of any mention of this in the witness's statements.  Is this something that has just emerged in the witness box or is it something the Prosecution were aware the witness was going to touch upon before he came to the witness box this morning?  I think I should know that.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor did not know that the witness was going to mention these facts.  The witness is merely giving additional information.  I don't think these are new allegations or accusations; it is merely details that the witness is giving.  And I think this is not only authorised by the rules, but the President has said that in our questioning of the witness he can give additional information.  It has nothing to do, for example, with new charges.  He is merely giving details in respect of his statement. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well, but I point out that I have absolutely nothing of an Abakiga attack, nothing of Nyarwaya, nothing of a secret meeting. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecution, I do not understand.  As yet there was an objection on the grounds of admissibility; this was, indeed, about the issue of disclosure.  And the counsel had inquired whether there was advance notice of this information which was not disclosed.  That is what the question was.
MR. NIANE:
I think that in this statement there is mention of the six Abakiga who were staying with a lady called Anatalie.  I invite my learned friend to re-read the statement, last page.  He does mention the six Abakiga staying with the lady, and the lady had asked for six machetes because the six Abakiga were ready to start work.  That is what is in the statement. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I have read the statement and I am aware that that is in it.  I repeat, I heard nothing about an Abakiga visit to Rutungo; I've heard nothing about an attack on Rutungo trade centre, I've heard nothing about the looting and the burning of house in the centre; I`ve heard nothing of the return by that group with more refugees; nothing about Nyarwaya firing a shot in the air; and nothing about a previous meeting or a neighbour of this witness who was constrained not to tell this witness about events because he would be the first to die if he did so.  

And my request to the Prosecutor is, did you, the Prosecutor, know that any of that was going to be touched upon by this witness this morning?  That is my question.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I did answer Defence counsel that the Prosecution did not know that the witness was going to speak of those matters.  And I added that the witness is only giving additional details, which is not at all forbidden -- prohibited by the statutes.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you for the reply.  
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, may I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course, you may continue, Mr. Prosecutor.  I must say though, that I think the Statute does require that the Prosecutor discloses the testimony that is going to be adduced during these trials.  So that just the blanket statement that additional information could be given, is not quite an accurate statement of the law.  Now, what the witness is entitled to do is to fill out with some details the statement that he has already -- that has already been disclosed.  So, the additional information to be admissible would have to be information which details information about the notice that has already been given.  But I don't think that you can say that they can just give any additional information at this stage.  That would not be an accurate statement of the law, as I understand it.  But as of now, there has been no objection to the admissibility of what has transpired up to now, and I'm not making any ruling, so you may proceed. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, at this stage, I should very briefly like to intervene to explain what happens sometimes with our witnesses.  It is certain that when we go to see them we do discuss those statements in general terms -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry, if this is going to be said, can the witness remove his earphones please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Ms. Fall, I don't think it is necessary to argue this at this stage.  And there has been no application made at this stage.  And I have told Mr. Niane that he can continue. 
MS. FALL: 
It was merely to say that when we receive additional information, we prepare a will-say that we disclose to the Defence before (unintelligible), because I shouldn't like to you think that the Prosecution obtains information that we do not disclose.  Every time we obtain additional information, we provide it to the Defence by way of a will-say in compliance with what you have said.  And if we did not provide a will-say, it is because we did not obtain any new information from the witness beforehand.

BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, apart from the six Abakiga, do you know if anyone else was issued a machete or received a machete?
A.	On that day I did not see anyone else receive a machete, but when the killing began, we saw that everyone was provided with a new and newly sharpened machete. 
Q.	You spoke of massacres, where did those massacres take place? 
A.	There were massacres throughout that place. 
Q.	What do you mean by "throughout that place," can you specify sites where massacres took place? 
A.	Well, for example, in the secteur, massacres began at the same time; I would say that the first person killed lived very near the health centre. 
Q.	And at what point did -- on what date did those massacres take place? 
A.	It is on or about the 13th, one-three. 
Q.	Why do you say the 13th? 
A.	Because it was on that date that I noted -- I observed massacres began to be perpetrated in our area. 
Q.	Can you remember exactly where on the 13th massacres occurred? 
A.	The massacres began in Kayanga. 
Q.	Witness, you spoke of the patients that had been admitted to Kayanga health centre.  Those patients were of what ethnicity? 
A.	They were Tutsi, but they weren't killed on that day.  In fact, the first person to be killed on that day was an inhabitant. 
Q.	Please answer the question stage by stage.  Just answer the question, what was the ethnicity of the patients?
A.	I have answered it to you that they were Tutsi. 
Q.	And what happened to those patients? 
A.	They had been beaten by the Interahamwe of the area and that place was named *********. 
Q.	I asked what happened to them.  Do you know -- I asked what happened to them, do you know what happened to them? 
A.	They were subsequently killed.  It was after the 13th because the killing went on until the end of the week. 
Q.	At the beginning of your testimony, you spoke of medicine that Rwamakuba had promised Etienne to give him medicine to treat the Tutsi, the injured Tutsi at the health centre; is that correct? 
A.	In that specific context, he meant to kill them, that is what the medicine was supposed to be and, indeed, they were killed subsequently. 
Q.	So you confirm that in speaking of medicine, Rwamakuba meant to kill them? 
A.	Absolute -- absolutely, that is what I am asserting and I confirm. 
Q.	Do you know -- do you know whether during the genocide certain public figures, authorities, continued to come to the commune? 
A.	At that time, we could no longer see the road because we were in hiding, the massacres had begun.  But according to the information that came to us, we learned that certain authorities would come, that there were military vehicles that passed, but please understand that I did not witness that.  We heard that in our hiding places. 
Q.	Do you know where that lady called Anatalie is now? 
A.	She died in prison -- in a prison somewhere. 
Q.	Do you know why she was imprisoned; why she was detained?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Please proceed.
A.	She was accused of having committed massacres and she was being prosecuted for that. 
Q.	Have you any news of Etienne Kamanzi? 
A.	You mean news about Etienne at that time or now?  
Q.	I mean now, do you know where he is now? 
A.	Yes, at present Etienne is in prison. 
Q.	Why is he in prison? 
A.	He is accused of massacres. 
Q.	In 1994, where did Etienne Kamanzi reside? 
A.	He resided at a place called Kantabana. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I`m sorry, Mr. President.  Maybe they can repeat that.
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Where is that exactly? 
A.	Kantabana as I have just said, at that exact location. 
Q.	Are you a member of the Ibuka? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecution, could you get some assistance in spelling that place name, please?  
MR. NIANE:
Could the interpreters please spell out the name in response to the President's question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  The witness says he can read in Kinyarwanda, he should spell it. 
THE WITNESS:
Could I be provided with a piece of paper so that I can write the name down?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But why can't he spell it in Kinyarwanda?  He has already said it, and he said he can read and write in Kinyarwanda. 
THE WITNESS:
You asked me to write the name of his hill of origin?  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	I asked if you knew where Etienne Kamanzi lived in 1994.  Please write it down. 
A.	I have done so.  I am through; I am finished.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I should like -- I should like to ask the witness to retain the sheet of paper because I have questions to put to him which will necessarily involve other names.
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, is that place name on the list of names circulated by the Prosecutor.
MR. NIANE:
Assuredly so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is its number?  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, could you please repeat the name of that place? 
A.	Yes, Kantabana.
MR. NIANE:
It is number 52 on the list.  Mr. President, 52 on the list of names.  

Can I continue, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can continue.
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, I'm sorry because we are going to have to go into events that might be painful for you, but you must understand that in the interest of justice the information is necessary to the Court. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Excuse me, did we get an answer to the question on Ibuka? I don't think we did, just before we go on.  Ibuka, there is a pointed question as to whether he is a member or not.  I don't think the witness replied, and if he did, I didn't get his response, sorry. 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Witness, are you a member of Ibuka? 
A.	No. 
Q.	I will proceed.  I said that we are going to talk about things that would be quite painful to you.  At this stage I would merely like to know if you lost members of your family during the genocide? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, how much longer are you going to be?  
MR. NIANE:
If it would please the Court, we may take a break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of course that is what I was leading to, because it is now when we would normally take -- but still, do you have an idea of how much longer you are likely to be?
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I cannot say exactly how much time I will take, but I don't think we will take much time.  In any case, I will take much less time than I have taken already. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will break for about 15 minutes now. 
(Court recessed from 1037H to 1104H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can resume now, Prosecutor. 
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, before we took the break I asked you a question concerning members of your family who were victims of the genocide.  Can you please write down a few names on a piece of paper before you?
MR. NIANE:
Registry, apparently, I think the witness says he is done. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I wonder if the document can be photocopied, under seal, of course, and provided to us.  And it is a different style of writing, it's not a criticism, but I can't read all of it clearly.  Perhaps the Prosecution at some time can clarify what the spelling is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar has indicated that the Court would make the photocopies as matter of routine. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you. 
MR. NIANE:
I have already seen it.  I would like that document to be entered in the file as a Prosecution exhibit and be placed under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence, placed under seal.  

The exhibit number, Mr. Fry?  
MR. FRY:
P.  50, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P. 50.
(Exhibit No. P. 50 admitted, under seal)
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, apparently the witness wants to say something. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, you were saying that this list is confidential and now I am hearing the -- I'm hearing that the counsel of these persons who were for the accused is asking for a copy, so I don't know how this list will continue to be very confidential.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel is representing the person who is accused in this trial, and he is governed by the laws governing the way in which the trial is conducted.  The obligation to retain as confidential applies to him equally as to the other persons taking part in the trial.  So, showing him the copy of the list is within the definition of confidentiality.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood you, but he has already seen the list.  And now he is also asking for a copy of the list and that is what is bothersome to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is very normal procedure in a trial.  He needs to have access to facilitate his asking you further questions about the matter.  And that is the purpose that he has a copy to assist him in his duty representing his client.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood very well.  Mr. President, can you reassure me that he is going to return the copy after having asked me questions concerning the list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I can assure you that the Court ensures that everybody participating in these proceedings conforms with the rules that we have laid down.  And I am certain that these rules will be sufficient to observe the rules which we have set up for the protection of your identity.  I don't think you need to have any fear on that account. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President -- thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, when members of your family were being killed, where were you? 
A.	I had hidden myself near my residence. 
Q.	Where exactly in your neighbourhood? 
A.	I was in the sorghum farm located near my residence. 
(Pages 14 to 23 by Donna M. Lewis)


































1115H
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	For how long did you stay in that sorghum farm?  
A.	I remained hidden for a day.  
Q.	Were you alone in that sorghum farm?  
A.	At the beginning I was alone, but subsequently, I met other persons who were also going towards different directions and later I was with three other persons.  
Q.	Do the names of those three persons feature on the list that you have just given to the Court?  
A.	Are you talking of three persons?  Which three persons are you referring to?  What I can tell you is that at the beginning we used to meet each other, but at various moments people went their different ways.  But I would like to make it clear that I remained with only one person and we stayed together, but the name of that person in question is not on the list that I have just handed over to the Court.  
Q.	Now, what became of that person?  
A.	This is a person that I met, and at the time an Interahamwe talked to the Umukiga who said that he was going to the secteur bureau in order to receive instructions that were being given, and that Interahamwe stated or said that there were persons living in the house near that house where I was hiding in a sorghum farm -- the person with whom I was hiding explained.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Prosecutor, can you control the pace of the testimony? 
MR. NIANE:
I hear you, Mr. President.
BY MR. NIANE:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you go over more slowly, and I think this has been repeated to you on several occasions.  Can you try to be slower in your speech?  

So, I was asking you with whom were you when you were in hiding and please give me a very brief answer.  
A.	Since this has to do with the person with whom I have family ties, I would like to request that the sheet of paper be given back to me so that I can write down his name on it.
Q.	No, I did not ask for his name.  I asked you what became of that person, is he still alive?  Do you have any information concerning that person now?  
A.	I did not quite understand your question.  Mr. Prosecutor, that person is still alive.  
Q.	After leaving the sorghum farm, where did you go?  
A.	Well, there is a person that I met on the road and that person went and hid me.  
Q.	For how long did you hide yourself?  
A.	He hid me for that day and the night. 
Q.	When did you go back to ***********?  
A.	I returned to *************** at the end of the war.  I therefore left my hiding place and subsequently, we had to flee and we fled from that region and after the war I returned to **********.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Mr. Witness, your evidence is now going to continue, but you will now be asked questions by the lawyer representing the Accused, and you will have to answer his questions.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hooper, you may proceed.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I am going to pass you a list with names on it and what I would like you to do is, without speaking the names out loud, I would like you to put a cross against any person whose name appears on that list, that you know.  So you can see the names there, look at them -- take your time, and if you know anyone or think you do, just put a cross in the column to the right of the name to indicate that you do.  Thank you.  
A.	But the list is not clear to me. 
Q.	In which respect?  
A.	You know, at this time of the day, I don't quite see very well, just as I don't see well in the night.  I think I have a little problem with my sight.  
Q.	You seemed to see all right with the Prosecution, has it suddenly come to you, this difficulty?  
A.	No, at that time I didn't have to read anything, rather, what I did was to write something.  If I am not requested to read out any names, I won't have any problem.  
Q.	Well, you are going to have to be able to read the names, sir, in order to put a cross against them.  If you know them, can you read the names; they are in quite big print?  Can you read those names?  
A.	As you know, my sight is not good.  I don't see very well.  There are letters that come after another and it is all confusing to me.  
Q.	I don't want to embarrass you, sir, but as I understand it, you had six years of primary school education, and you have demonstrated this morning that you can write, so you don't have a reading and writing disability, do you?  I will tell you what we can do.  I will get an interpreter from the booth, if he can lend himself to us, he can come to the witness box and he can whisper in your ear, with your microphone off, the names, one by one, and you can then indicate that in way.  Would -- do you think that would be a satisfactory solution to the problem?  
A.	Are you talking about an interpreter?  I thought this is something confidential.  Now you are talking about an interpreter, are you certain that that interpreter does not know those persons?  This interpreter is a Rwandan, I am sure, so I don't know if you would trust that person.  
Q.	You understand you are here to help the Judges in this Tribunal.  Are you really doing your best this morning to do that, or is it perhaps, that you are being difficult?  
A.	I am here to assist the Court.  I am not trying to complicate things for whoever, let alone for the Judges.  I am merely not very well and I cannot -- I am not in a position to read the document that you have put before me. 
Q.	And in what way are you not well this morning?  
A.	Now -- well, I have many problems that I have to grabble with, that to the best of my knowledge, I did not come to consult a doctor here.  I am telling you right now that I have a problem with my sight and I cannot read the document that is before me, and I think I will stick with that at the moment.
Q.	You are familiar with the workings of the Court here, aren't you?  You have been here before and given evidence, haven't you, in another case; is that right, in the case of Kamuhanda?  
A.	Yes, but I would like to say that when I came to testify in that matter I was never asked to read out names that were written down on a list as you are doing now.  
Q.	You gave evidence -- so that we are clear about this, of Kamuhanda coming to your area the same time that you gave evidence here about his distribution of weapons; that was right, wasn't it?  That was your evidence.  
A.	Today I have nothing to say concerning Kamuhanda.  
Q.	I think you will find out.  I will be asking you some questions about that, including this one.  

Did you know that the Chamber came to the conclusion that your evidence was not truthful?  Did you know that? 
A.	I don't know anything about that.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to point out that on a different occasion, I said something concerning the credibility of the witness and I was asked to limit myself to the paragraph, and right now, I see that Counsel Hooper is referring to the decision of the Chamber that has to do with the credibility of the witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed -- yes, indeed, I am in a different position to the Prosecution.  I am not producing this witness as a witness of truth.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	He weren't aware, sir, that on -- in respect of your -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I have a -- 
MR. NIANE:
The Prosecutor would like to add that it is not up to the Defence to assess the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

I was about to say that we are going to allow the question, because this is a cross-examination by the opposing counsel, but we will expect you to keep the required limits, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You gave evidence, and the Chamber in its judgement, declared that it did not find your evidence "credible", that was the word that was used, "not credible."  Now, you are saying that no one told you that -- that you have come here in Arusha being here, as you said, these many days, and no one from the Prosecution has ever discussed that with you in anyway; is that what you are saying?  
A.	Concerning the Kamuhanda trial, and then we talked about it last time around, that is when I gave testimony -- I gave evidence at the time.  Now I have just learned from you that you are talking about things concerning the Kamuhanda case, otherwise, nobody has talked about that -- those facts to me.  
Q.	Well, I will come to that in due course.  

Do you know or did you know a man called Jove Mbagiriye (sic), and I will spell it, M-B-A-G-I-Y-E?  Did you know anyone by that name?  
A.	It's Mbagariye.  You are saying Mbagiye, but I know Mbagariye.  I think you are making a mistake, 
	Jove Mbagariye M-B-A-G-A-R-I-Y-E, spelling from the Kinyarwanda booth.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you know that person, but where is that person today?  
A.	That person is no longer alive. 
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances of his death?  
A.	I couldn't tell you for the very simple reason that I myself don't know. 
Q.	Was he ***************?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Have you never asked about him?  
A.	No, I merely learnt of his death. 
Q.	And when learning of his death, when and in what circumstances did you learn it took place?  
A.	I merely learnt that he died.  I had no need to be any further concerned or look into the -- look any more into the circumstances of his demise. 
Q.	And did he die a natural death or was he violently killed?  
A.	I merely heard that he had died, but not how he died.  So I cannot provide you any further information on that point.  
Q.	Did you play any part in his death?  
A.	No. 
Q.	He died in April of 1994, did he not?  
A.	I cannot confirm that inasmuch as I wasn't there when he died, but how did you hear about it, Counsel?  
Q.	From his son, who witnessed his death.  

So, I am not getting no reply, I don't know if there was a response.  
A.	Yes, I answered your question, and I was waiting for your further questions.
Q.	Have you spoken to the son about how his father was murdered?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Gacaca opened court proceedings, that is, in Rwanda; haven't they?
A.	The Gacaca courts-- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I will start again.  The Gacaca court proceedings haven't yet started, you told us, but is it right to say that the exercise of gathering evidence and information has started; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that exercise has begun.  
Q.	Have you provided such information or evidence to the person responsible for gathering it?  
A.	No, I have not provided any information. 
Q.	Have you provided any information or evidence at any time in respect of any matter to the prosecutor in Rwanda?  
A.	No, no.  
Q.	Do you intend to participate in Gacaca?  
A.	Very much so.  
Q.	I understand from what we have been told that that would be possibly later this year; is that right?  
A.	I don't know.  I don't know the date or the month.  
Q.	But whenever it does take place, these would be very public hearings, won't they?  
A.	Quite.  
Q.	And you will be there standing up and telling everyone, all the local population, all your neighbours, what you saw, who did it; who was responsible, pointing the finger at people, and all that would be in public, won't it?  
A.	Yes, that is how things will be done.  
Q.	You won't be writing names on bits of paper then, will you?  
A.	I don't know the exact procedure that would be followed by those courts, whether it is in public -- yes, it certainly will be in public, but if it is a proceeding that requires us to write names on pieces of paper, well, that is also the way things will be done.  
Q.	But you know, don't you, that names won't be written on bits of paper; you have to speak out in front of everyone in public, that is the nature of Gacaca, isn't it?  
A.	I cannot assert that 100 percent; there are people who have been trained to conduct the Gacaca proceedings, and it is those people who will be telling us how to proceed.  
Q.	I am going to come back to this list later, at about quarter past 12:00, and we will deal with it then if necessary, with Mr. President's advice and consent in a closed session, so that you don't feel constrained in any way.  

Were you ever a member of the Parti Liberal?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Prior to the 13th of April, had you heard any shooting, firing or gunfire?  
A.	Yes, I did hear gunfire.  
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances when you heard it?  
A.	At that time, there were fire shootings at Tutsis -- firing at Tutsis who had taken refuge somewhere.  
Q.	And when was that, please?  
A.	It was about the 12th. 
Q.	Now, in your evidence, we have one clear certain date, don't we, and that's the 13th of April, the day that you were forced to flee; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And that is the self -- same day that the killing started in Kayanga; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And the 13th, for reference, was a Wednesday; is that correct, or have you perhaps forgotten that?  I have a calendar in front of me, so I am helped by that.  Do you remember it was a Wednesday, and if not, will you accept that it was a Wednesday?  
A.	If you tell me that you were there, then I will accept that your date is the correct one or accept your suggestion as to what the day was on that date.  
Q.	Well, you know I wasn't there.  
A.	No, I am not certain of it.  I can't be certain that you weren't there.  
Q.	Well, that makes two of us, as I am not certain you were there either.  Were you there on the 13th?  
A.	You are asking me if I was present?  
Q.	Yes.  Were you present or had you already left the area?  
A.	There is no doubt on that score; I was present on the spot.  
Q.	When you fled, did you flee with your wife?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Why did you leave her?  
A.	The Interahamwe said they would not kill the women, which is why the women didn't leave.  They began by killing the men and the young men -- the adult men and young men.  
Q.	This is something you have never mentioned before.  When did the Interahamwe say that?  When did you learn and how did you learn that, that they weren't going to kill the women?  
A.	I heard them say so the day the massacres began, and I should like to add that you cannot blame me for only saying that now because I just said it in response to the question you put to me, which was -- and it was the first time that question was raised.  
Q.	That's fair enough.  Did your wife, in fact, escape?  
A.	No, she did not flee.  And if you are a bit patient, sufficiently patient, I can explain to you what happened to her, if you will allow me to do so.  
Q.	I will come to that.  I just want to know this:  Did she survive?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, you have given two statements to the Prosecutor, the first statement you gave was on the 26th of June of 1999, and it was a fairly long statement detailing events and what happened in your area and focussing on Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  Do you remember making that statement in 1999?  
A.	I remember, but I asked you not to take me backwards and put me -- and just put questions to me on the matter in hand.  
Q.	I am not going to do that.  I am going to ask you quite a lot of questions about that statement and about your previous testimony, but at the moment, I am merely asking you; do you remember making that statement in 1999?  
A.	Yes.  I did answer, yes.  
Q.	And, it is right, isn't it, that at no time in that statement do you make any reference at all to André Rwamakuba?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And why was that, as he seems to have played such a significant role in the events, according to your present testimony?  
A.	I didn't mention him because no question was put to me about him.  
Q.	And so when you saw the investigators in 1999, is it your evidence that at no time in your conversations with the investigators did you even mention his name?  
A.	His name was never mentioned in the course of the interview.  
Q.	And not mentioned by you either, that is the point; you never mentioned him yourself?  
A.	No, not at all.  
Q.	Now, in 2002, you gave evidence in this case, in the case of Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, and you gave evidence in *********** of that year.  Now, before giving evidence in the Kamuhanda case, would I be right in saying that you would have met the Prosecutor or the investigators on several occasions, both in Rwanda and again here in Arusha, before you gave evidence?  Would I be correct in saying that?  
A.	No, it was not true that I met him on several occasions.  
Q.	Well, how many occasions have you met them, that is before you gave evidence in Kamuhanda?  
A.	I would ask you to distinguish clearly between the trials so that I can fully follow you.  
Q.	Let me put my question again.  In 1999 you provided a statement -- in 2002 in *********, you give evidence here in Arusha.  Between 1999 and *********** 2002, on how many occasions did you meet with the investigator and/or Prosecutor, in respect of the case of Kamuhanda?  
A.	I told you before that I wouldn't like you to put to me questions in respect of Kamuhanda.  You should put questions to me in respect of Rwamakuba.  I think you have forgotten what I said before.  
Q.	Well, you know now what I think everyone now knows, and that is, that the Chamber found you were not truthful when you gave evidence in Kamuhanda.  I can assure you I am going to ask you quite a few questions about it.  Now, can you answer this one:  Between 199 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it is the role of the Judges here to decide whether the lawyer goes outside what he is permitted to do.  If he asks you questions that are against the rules which govern the trial, we will not allow him to do it.  So it is our job to decide what are the permitted questions.  Up to now, we have not decided that he has asked any question which is improper, and you will have to answer his questions.  If you are uncomfortable, you can make an appeal to the Chamber and we will decide whether it is proper or not.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I understand, but as you yourself have observed, I can't read, I have difficulty in reading.  I am somewhat ***********, and it is the first time I appear before you.  And inasmuch as -- in view of the time that has passed since I testified in that Kamuhanda trial, I may have forgotten certain things.  It might therefore be difficult for me to answer that sort of question, and I should like to add that counsel for the Defence is referring to documents before putting his questions, and I am convinced if he did not have those documents before him, he could not put those questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think we will just have to proceed and see how well we get on, but I can assure you that we will try to ensure that nothing unfair happens during your testimony.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And my question was -- and I think we can all understand the difficulty of lapses of memory over so many years.  But my question is this:  How many meetings did you have before you gave evidence in the Kamuhanda case with the Prosecutor or with the investigator?  
A.	I met them once.  
Q.	Is that the time when you gave the statement?  
A.	Yes, I met them a second time here in Arusha.  
Q.	So that is twice; is that right?  
A.	I think you are complicating matters for me.  
Q.	Well, the Prosecution will have a record and I dare say they can let us have it of the meetings that they had with you between the time you made a statement and the time you gave evidence.  But, however many times it was, would I be right in saying that no opportunity or at no occasion did you mention the name Rwamakuba; is that right?  
A.	I have already acknowledged that when we were discussing Kamuhanda or Kamuhanda's trial, I never mentioned the name of your client.  
Q.	When was the first time you mentioned the name of Rwamakuba in the context of events in Kayanga? 
A.	I talked about him for the first time when questions were put to me concerning him for the first time. 
Q.	And would that be as a result of a meeting between you and investigators for this Tribunal that led to a statement by you dated the 8th of November of last year? 
A.	Please try to explain further to me because I don't quite understand you.  
Q.	Well, I have a statement that's dated the 8th of November 2004, in which you refer to Rwamakuba.  Was that the first time that you mentioned his name?  
A.	Yes, that was the first time.  
Q.	And why was it that the investigators came to see you on that occasion?  
A.	I did not know how things happened.  They are still there, you can put the question to them.  I saw them come to see me and that is all.  
Q.	What happened?  Did they just come and knock on your door *********** and say "Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Can you help us about André Rwamakuba?"  What happened?  
A.	I met them, they asked me how I knew that person.  Insofar as I was concerned, I met them -- I gave a statement to them in that connection.  
Q.	So they met you and asked you how you knew Rwamakuba.  How did they know that you knew Rwamakuba?  
A.	I didn't ask them to tell me how they knew that I knew him.
Q.	But from what you say, they arrived at your door with an expectation that you could help them in their inquiries about Rwamakuba; is that right?  
A.	No, they never came to my house.
Q.	Well, where did you meet?  
A.	I met them in Kigali -- at Kimirongo, rather.  
Q.	Was that at the hotel?  
A.	No, I had gone to consult a doctor -- to see a doctor.  
Q.	In Kigali?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So you go and see a doctor there -- a United Nations doctor; is that right?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	That's one of the Prosecution -- isn't it, that you get some medical -- free medical attention; is that right?  
A.	I went to ask for medical attention; I didn't go to pay the doctor a visit.  
Q.	And did you see a doctor?  
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	And was that before or after you made a statement?  
A.	Before. 
Q.	And then you made a statement, but the doctor isn't interested in Rwamakuba.  How did your statement come to be made?  
A.	The doctor treated me.  I didn't give a statement to the doctor.  
Q.	Exactly.  So how did you come to make the statement.  Who asked you to see them and when did you see them?  
A.	Somebody that used to work or was working at that place. 
Q.	So how did the name "Rwamakuba" crop up?  
A.	Well, his father is the one who gave him that name.  
Q.	Well, you ask a silly question.  How did the name "Rwamakuba" crop up while you were being seen by the doctor?  
A.	It was necessary for investigations to be carried out on people who had committed massacres and some people testified in respect of those persons.  
Q.	You will understand, you take yourself from ********** down to the Kigali city to Remera, to ask to see a doctor because you are unwell or something, and he sees you -- the doctor sees you.  When the investigators appear -- when did you start giving this statement on Rwamakuba?  How did it happen?  Did you go and see them and say, by the way, I just remember there was another chap there at the time called Rwamakuba?  Did someone come and see you and said, "Hello Witness GAC, can you help us about Rwamakuba?"  How did it happen?  
A.	They asked me if I knew something about Rwamakuba related to the massacres, and I gave them the statement that you have.  
Q.	So how did the investigators come to be talking to you at all when you went down to see the doctor?  Was that by arrangement, had you agreed to go and see them?  We are only talking of November last year, can you help us?  
A.	There were people who were responsible for welcoming us at that place, so I was welcomed by those people and this coincided with the investigations that were being carried out and those persons that we are talking about, and when they put a question to me, I told them what I knew.  
Q.	How many days have you been here this time in Arusha?  
A.	How am I going to know this for Christ's sake? 
Q.	How many days?  
A.	Let me see -- three weeks, if I am not mistaken.
Q.	And you get what -- your board and lodging here on $20 a day, is that right?  So you have just over $420 or you'll get $420 for being here, cost free; is that right?  
A.	I don't know.  I don't know if what you are saying is the truth -- is true is correct.
Q.	Do you get $20 per day when you come here?  There is nothing wrong with that.  
A.	I don't know anything about that.  I know, in any case, that I have been accommodated at a location where I see nobody.  I am well accommodated; I am fed, but I haven't been told anything concerning money yet.
Q.	Well, did you get paid when you came in the Kamuhanda case?  
A.	No, I wasn't given money.  
Q.	Now, may I ask you this:  How much a week do you earn as *********** in Rwanda today?  Would I be right in saying it is not very much, is it?  It is a very poor country, very difficult to earn money, and can you help us?  If it is not embarrassing for you, how much you earn in a week or earn in a year as a farmer?  
A.	I earn lots of money.  I am not in a position to give you a figure.  
Q.	I understand the average wage in Rwanda is half a dollar a day.  I don't know if you know how much a dollar is, but if you do, would that sound about right to you?  
A.	I just know what the value of dollar is as such. 
Q.	How much would you think someone would earn -- ********** would earn in Rwandese francs a day, if he was lucky, 2,000, 3,000?  
A.	The ******** works for himself and he is not even in a position to know exactly what he earns.  You yourself, if you look at what the ******** does in Rwanda, you wouldn't be in a position to assess his income per day.  
Q.	I think I understand and I appreciate that's the position, because ************************************************************************************* whatever or whatever else he might need.  There is not a lot of money moving about in the farming business, would that be fair to say?  
A.	No.  
Q.	I think I can't take that any further.  

I want to come back, sir, if I may, to the lists and I am going to -- you have the list in front of you.  I am going to deal with this by talking of the names and subject to the views of Mr. President, maybe it is not necessary to go into closed session, but it might be in the circumstances, we should.  And I know it is just past the time I said I would raise this matter, and I just thought that this witness would likely be twenty minutes all together, maybe a bit longer than that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will be approximately 20 minutes in the closed session.  

MR. HOOPER:
Yes, basically, I am going to ask him about the list, maybe there will be one or two other matters that would come to mind that I will ask him about, but it's just to go through the list, and I don't think that should take very long, but sometimes it might.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we will go into a closed session for the rest of the session before our lunch adjournment.  
MR. HOOPER:
Alternatively, I could deal with it at 2 o'clock.  I can deal with it at 2 o'clock.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You intend to start it at 2 o'clock?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, so I will carry on in open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I have cancelled that order.  We will remain in open session until our lunch break, and we will address the closed session matters when we resume at lunch time -- when we resume at 2 o'clock.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, we are still in open session, Mr. Witness, I will come back to this list at 2 o'clock.  And I want to ask you, please, about the statement you have given, and the evidence you have given in this case this morning, and let's start with -- you say, your knowledge of André Rwamakuba, the Accused in this case, and you say that you have met him or seen him on four occasions, and I am going to explore each of those occasions with you.  

The first time you told us was at the stone laying for Rutonga primary school, and you've told us that he was there with the minister called Munyazesa M-U-N-Y-A-Z-E-S-A.  And when was that, sir, in relation to 1994?  How many years or year -- or months or weeks, whatever it was?  Was it before April 1994, that you were present at the Rutonga primary school and you say had an opportunity to see 
André Rwamakuba?  When was that?  
A.	I do not recall what year it was.  
Q.	Was it five years before, for example?  Give us a hint.  
A.	That was before 1994, I do not recall the year.  
Q.	Was it, for example, six months before April of 1994, or was it five years before April of 1994?  
A.	I cannot help you there.  You can only talk about events -- about the person with whom you witnessed the event.  Now, that event took place, I can't remember exactly when it was.  
Q.	Well, it is not a question if you are remembering exactly when it was; it is not remembering when it was at all; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And what were you doing at the primary school?  
A.	I was just passing by, I didn't have any work to do at that location.  
Q.	So you become attracted -- did you, by the -- by what -- what attracted you into going and seeing what was happening?  
A.	I did not go there.  I passed by that place because that place is by the roadside.  
Q.	Were there any school buildings there at that time at all?  
A.	There were old buildings that were used as a school and those old buildings were destroyed and new buildings were built.  
Q.	Well, at that time had the old buildings been destroyed and had the new buildings being built, or were they yet to be built?  What was the position that you remember?  
A.	The new premises were, first of all, built and then the pupils were transferred to the new buildings and the old buildings were destroyed. 
Q.	Sir, when you saw, you say, Rwamakuba, had the new buildings been built?  
A.	No, the new buildings hadn't been erected as yet.  
Q.	And the old buildings, they were still standing, were they?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Didn't the new buildings occupy the same site at the same situation as the old school, or was it a different site?  
A.	Those buildings were built at a different spot, because I told you that after building the new billings the pupils were transferred to the new building and the old ones were renovated. 
Q.	Right.  But the new site is at the side of the road; is that right?  
A.	It's very close to the road.  
Q.	And on this particular day, were any new buildings or buildings standing on this site?  
A.	I have replied that there weren't. 
Q.	So we have an empty building site by the side of the road on this day; is that correct?  
A.	I have told you that there were old buildings that were used as the school -- that were used for the school.  
Q.	My misunderstanding.  I thought you said that was a different place on which the pupils were later transferred.  It is the same site, is it?  What did you see, sir?  When you got there and you are watching from the road; what did you see?  
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	What did you see? 
A.	I saw Rwamakuba and Munyazesa. 
Q.	Were they standing up or sitting down?  
A.	They were standing up. 
Q.	Was anyone sitting down at all?  
A.	Nobody was sitting down.  
Q.	Were they making a speech or what?  
A.	You will understand that they were speaking, and, besides, I did not stay at that scene for long.  I knew why they came to that place and I continued going about my business.  
Q.	So, how long were you there for?  
A.	A very short time.  
Q.	What was the position with Rwamakuba?  Did you ask someone who he was or what?  How did you come to know it was Rwamakuba?  
A.	I asked someone. 
Q.	"Excuse me, who is that man there?"  Is that what you asked?  
A.	I asked that person:  "Whose car is that?"  And he told me, "That is the minister's car, and that is the minister who has made it possible for us to build a new school."  And I asked him, "Which minister?"  And he said, "It is Rwamakuba, the one you are seeing there."  
Q.	So he was a minister, was he? 
A.	Who is it you are talking about, there were two personalities?  Who is it you are talking about?
Q.	The man whose car you saw, the Minister Rwamakuba.  You understood him to be a minister at the time?  
A.	I was told that he was working in the ministry of health.  
Q.	I understood you to say -- it was translated to me a moment ago that you asked who the man was.  I asked you, "Did you ask who the man was?"  You said, "I saw his car, and you asked who he was, and you were told he was a minister, "Rwamakuba was the minister," or did I mishear you or misunderstand you?  
A.	I was told it was the minister, Munyazesa, who had come to launch the construction of the school building at that site.  
Q.	All right.  Well, I may have got that wrong, and I am going to -- it's now the lunch adjournment, I think, and I am going to look at the transcript and see what you did say just a moment ago, and we will come back to that --
MR. HOOPER:
If that is appropriate, Mr. President, after lunch.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's now 12:30.  We will resume at 2 o'clock after lunch.  

Mr. Witness, I would just like to remind you that during this adjournment, as on any other adjournment while you are giving evidence, you remain under oath as a witness, and you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you, Mr. President.
(Court recessed at 1236H)
(Pages 24 to 37 by Sithembiso Moyo)  
(Court resumed at 1410H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  We will now resume our session. 

Mr. Hooper? 
MR. HOOPER:
Good afternoon.  

I request that we go into closed session at this stage, so that I can put questions that this witness may be sensitive to and might possibly lead to his identification by his replies. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how long would that be, Mr. Hooper, approximately?
MR. HOOPER:
20 to 30 minutes, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 39 to 43] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).

1520H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I don't propose to go through this with you, but the very first anyone heard of power, MDR or MRND Power or liberal Power or any other power, was at the end of October of 1993 after prime minister or President Ndadaye had been killed in Burundi.  So, are you saying that this meeting was indeed held after that man's death, after Ndadaye had died and power, as a word, came into use?  What are you saying? 
A.	I heard about the death of Ndadaye, but in short, I will say I don't know much about it.  However, in various locations there were rallies, people came together in small groups little by little, and young people were selected.  These people were called the power.  So the older people stayed in another wing of the party, the older wing, whereas the younger people were asked to join the power wings. 
Q.	And can I ask you, this coalition meeting that you reckon happened, what was that that they were doing there? 
A.	Agathe was taking part in the meetings.  Listen, before, things were all right.  They were just fooling us. 
Q.	Why was Faustin Twagiramungu there, a well known moderate, a man who wanted discussions with the RPF, who'd became prime minister under the RPF, what was he doing at this meeting? 
A.	He was doing what I told you he was doing a moment ago.  And afterwards, we saw him implementing this. 
Q.	What did he implement? 
A.	He taught the Hutus to kill the Tutsis, and the Hutus did, indeed, kill the Tutsis.  What else do you want to know about that, Counsel?  
Q.	This is Faustin Twagiramungu you are talking about, is it?  
A.	It is he and many others.  If you ask me questions about a particular person, then I will tell you about this person.  They all worked together. 
Q.	And, Agatha, she was in on this too, was she, the poor woman who was murdered on the 7th of April? 
A.	At that time, we did not know exactly what they wished to do.  They said that if President Habyarimana were not in office, the country would be at peace.  You yourself will have realised that Agathe paid dearly for what she said, and that didn't take long to happen. 
Q.	And you still maintain that Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, a member -- active member of the MRND, was present at this MDR meeting; is that right? 
A.	I confirm that he was at that location, and I am ready to say this again in future. 
Q.	And he spoke, is that right? 
A.	Yes, he took the floor. 
Q.	And what did he say? 
A.	Don't ask me what he said. 
Q.	Well, what did he say? 
A.	I have already explained what he said and you have the documents which contain what I said. 
Q.	What did Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda say at this meeting that you heard him say? 
A.	Okay, I'm waiting for you when his trial will start.  I can't answer the question now. 
Q.	You recall waiting for what, sorry?  I misheard you.  
A.	I have told you that I'm making a date with you for when his trial will start.  When his trial does start, then I shall be prepared to answer this question. 
Q.	But you've given evidence in his trial; we'll be coming to that in a moment.  You have already given evidence, haven't you?  It's Kamuhanda we are talking about, sir.  
A.	I grant you that I said that I gave testimony in Kamuhanda's trial but please don't toss me here and there.  I am not feeling very well; try to be nice to me.  Put direct questions to me.  I am prepared to answer you and even if Kamuhanda were here present, I would still be prepared to answer you. 
Q.	In your evidence, this morning you said that you only heard one speech, I understood, and then you left immediately.  It's Rwamakuba who spoke and he said -- and I didn't quite understand -- but it was about tin roofs and thatched roofs.  You told us that that's something Rwamakuba had spoken about when you gave your evidence this morning.  Is that right? 
A.	You have not yet read exactly what I said.  I cannot agree what with you have just said because you might use it to distract the others by claiming that this is what I said.  If my statement was taken down incorrectly, I am prepared to correct it.  However, if you read the transcript to me and I find that what I said was taken down correctly, then I will take your word for it. 
Q.	Well, I don't have the transcript, but in fairness to you, can you tell the Chamber again now, what it was that you heard André Rwamakuba say at that meeting?  What was it that you remember him saying? 
A.	How do you think that the Judges, who are here before us, have forgotten what I said?  They haven't asked me to repeat it.  But if necessary, I shall repeat what I said because I still remember what was said.  So please do not try to lead us into error by claiming that the Judges have forgotten what was said.  How could they?  
Q.	No, I am asking you to repeat it for me.  Can you please repeat it now?  Thank you.  
A.	I told you this: He asked the people this: "Between the people who have houses with corrugated roofing sheets and those who have thatched roofs who are more?"  And he was told that the corrugated iron -- roofing sheets were more numerous.  And he asked: "If I ask people with metal roofs to burn down the houses of people who have thatched roofs," but as there were not many of such houses, I understood that he was saying, "If I were to order today that Tutsis be killed from now, would you think -- did you think that there would be survivors?"  So when I heard him say this, I went back home. 
Q.	So that was quite a terrible thing for him to say; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  You yourself understand that. 
Q.	And hearing it, you left.  You went home at that point, is that right, having heard those words? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	I suppose -- were you shocked by what he said? 
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Why, in your statement six months ago, do you write this: "I know what Rwamakuba spoke at the meeting, but I no longer remember what he said."  Why do you remember now what you'd forgotten just six months ago when you made you statement?  
A.	I had very little time when I was giving my testimony.  Today I have present and I have remembered that.  But you will agree with me that I never said that I would never remember what had been said.  Even today if I remember some details, I will give them.  You know, there are so many stories that one knows. 
Q.	Or is it something you've just made up? 
A.	No, this is not an invention.  I did not invent anything, and I believe that the events that took place are not inventions.  You yourself can know that.
MR. HOOPER:
I see the time, Mr. President, I'm moving on to a slight -- a different portion of the evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll take a short break, about 15 minutes.  
(Court recessed from 1533H to 1556H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we resume our session now.  

Mr. Hooper any problem?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, sorry, just waiting for you to blow the whistle.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought I had done that already.
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Okay.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we leave -- or still dealing with the Kayanga, just briefly, what was it that Faustin Twagiramungu said, do you remember? 
A.	I'm going to give you an answer by telling you what he said at the beginning of his speech.  I didn't listen to his entire speech, though.  If you ask me what he said that wouldn't be fair. He came, people applauded, drums were beaten, women expressed their joy, and before sitting down he looked at the crowd and then he said: "There aren't many people here."  And the young student who had just come from Burabuturo said, "The people you are seeing here are the only people who are still members of the MRND."  That is what Twagiramungu said and that I heard, so don't ask me what he said thereafter. 
Q.	I wasn't -- sorry.  
A.	And Twagiramungu said, "I will tell you just one word.  If there are still members of the MRND here, I'm sure that they are going to leave." 
Q.	Sir, I thought you said that he'd been told that it was -- this was all the members of the MRND that there were.  I thought you just said that.  Did I misunderstand it? 
A.	Yes, that is what I told you. 
Q.	Well, was it an MRND meeting or an MDR meeting, which was it? 
A.	It was an MDR rally. 
Q.	Why the reference to the MRND?  I don't understand, sir.  
A.	These were just people of the MRND who were curious as to how the meeting would -- the rally would go on. So they stood off to the side.  Amongst them was a consellier of the secteur, and they stood off to the side from the other participants who were the members of the MDR. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about evidence you've given on a previous occasion and that is in the Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda case.  And you don't have the documents I have, but others do.  And for their reference, in the English version it's the transcript for the ********************* 2002, ICTR, Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  It's at page 90 of that transcript, and I'm going to be looking at pages 90, 91, 92, 93, 94 of the transcript.  And just to put it in context, in that case you gave evidence, didn't you, in relation to Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda?  And you may recall that you were asked rather similarly to what you're being asked today, the opportunities you'd had to see Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda.  And you told the Chamber on that occasion, in 2002, that you'd seen Kamuhanda on several occasions.  Your first opportunity was seeing him drive to his parents' home, who lived in Gikomero commune, and your second opportunity was at a -- can you remember what your second opportunity was to see him, to see Kamuhanda? 
A.	I shall not answer questions about Kamuhanda.  You have the answers that I gave at his trial.  What is more, I did not come here to give testimony at his trial and I am going to say -- not going to say anything in the absence of Kamuhanda.  And I think you lied in -- by saying that the Trial Chamber had rejected my statement.  I do not know where you got that one from.  Put questions to me about Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Well, I will come to -- I will read the -- what the Trial Chamber said in its judgment about you, sir, when they rejected your evidence as not credible.  But before I come to that, I have my duty to so and I suggest that you are -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether the Defence can read the Trial Chamber's conclusions regarding the credibility of the witness.  I think if they wish to read anything, then they have to read everything with special emphasis to the -- on the point where the credibility of the witness is challenged.  However, I do not know whether Mr. Hooper is allowed to read that portion out to this Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper, I would think that you couldn't put the judgment to the witness.  You could put his previous inconsistent statements.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, very well.  Very well, it was in fairness to the witness, but I will do that.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm coming to your transcripts, sir, not the judgment, and I'm coming to what you said about Kamuhanda.  And I'll ask you again, in the Kamuhanda case -- I've asked you what was your second opportunity for seeing Kamuhanda, whether you remember what you'd said on a previous occasion.  Can I have your answer, please? 
A.	I shall not answer that question.  If you wish, you can ask Kamuhanda to come here.  I notice that he, unlike Rwamakuba, is not afraid of debates.  To if Kamuhanda is in this Court, then I shall answer the question in his presence. 
Q.	In the Kamuhanda case you came to the Chamber and tried to mislead it, didn't you?  You came to the Chamber and told untruths, didn't you? 
A.	I did not lie.  I was not in your home in Europe when these happened -- when these events happened, so you cannot say that I told a lie about the events that occurred in Rwanda. 
Q.	Well, let me ask you about this, and as you are reluctant answer my questions, I will read the transcript, parts of the transcript, right?  And I'd like you to listen, please, it will be translated to you.  These are your replies, and in conclusion I will put a question or questions to you:  "Can you say the next time that you saw Kamuhanda after that date, please?"  Answer: "I saw him in Kayanga in the course of a meeting:  Question: "And what sort of meeting was it, please?"  Answer: "It was a political meeting."  Question:  "And do you know what the politics of the meeting were, to what party?" "It was a meeting," you said, "of the MDR party."  Then you were asked how long before '94 that meeting was, and you said that's a long time.  And eventually the Prosecution put to you, at page 19, "Was it more than five years prior to 1994?"  And you said, when you were asked to specify, "I think it would be rather adventurous on my part in I were to answer that question.  I have sworn to tell the truth and I don't want to betray the oath I have taken."  You then went on to say that you were -- "I was at the meeting for a short time" -- page 92 -- "but I was not a member of that party."  Can you tell the Judges, please, how it was you saw Mr. Kamuhanda and how you knew it was Mr. Kamuhanda?"  Answer: "During that political rally, there were leaders at the highest level of the party who'd been invited to the rally, and in the course of the rally, those was a master of ceremonies.  He was an intellectual.  He introduced the guest to the population, and he did so in turn.  And he introduced everyone, all of them, to the population, right up to the chairman of that party in that -- in the person of Twagiramungu, alias Rukokoma," and you spelt it, both words.  "By your answer, do we take it that Kamuhanda was introduced to the crowd?"  Answer: "Absolutely, yes, and Twagiramungu.  Twagiramungu, alias, Rukokoma, told the population that in the event that there was a problem they can turn to Kamuhanda, and Kamuhanda could represent validly, properly when he, Twagiramungu, wasn't there."  

Just pausing there.  Did Twagiramungu say those things about Kamuhanda? 
A.	I shall not answer that question.  You said that you were going to read for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, go ahead, read. 
Q.	Ho, you --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the purpose of cross-examination at this level is to test the quality of your information and accuracy in these proceedings.  The law permits questions to be made about previous statements that you'd given in related matters.  Now, that is a related matter and certain questions relating to previous statements that you'd given are permissible.  So you will have to answer them because it will assess us -- assist us to determine the quality of the information you are giving here.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS: 
I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, did Faustin Twagiramungu, Chairman, President of the MDR, introduce Jean De Dieu Kamuhanda, member of the MRND, and say those things? 
A.	Yes, he introduced him to the crowd, and said the things that you have just read out. 
Q.	But just before the break when I was asking you about what Twagiramungu had said, that had slipped your mind, had it, that he'd introduced Kamuhanda and told the people that if they were in need of anything that they could look to Kamuhanda.  That was something you forgot, is it? 
A.	No, I hadn't forgotten, but I did not have the intention to tell you that.  I'm going to tell you why.  I told you how far I went in terms of my education.  When you began to put questions to me, you did not tell me that we were going to examine these various documents.  As you know to what level of education I reached, you are trying to confuse me by bringing out these documents.  You did not tell me beforehand that you were going to use these documents in your cross-examination. 
Q.	You see, what I'd suggest, sir, is it is incredible that Faustin Twagiramungu would be introducing a member of an opposing party in this manner.  It didn't happen, did it, sir? 
A.	It took place.  Can you read an article somewhere that says that this is not possible?  I am telling you things that I was an eye witness to.  You weren't there.  All you are doing is gathering information, but I am telling you things to which I was an eye witness. 
(Pages 44 to 49 by Gifty C. Harding)






1615H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And at no point in your account before the Chamber in ********** of 2002, do you mention the name of André Rwamakuba as being present at that meeting or saying anything, let alone saying anything that shocked you and caused you to leave.  It is something that you have made up recently, isn't it? 
A.	My answer to that is that I am not fabricating anything.  This is the truth, pure and simple.  You have put this question to me in this court and I answered that you did not put a question to me about this.  Could you show me a passage where I -- a question about him was put to me and where I was unable to answer?
Q.	Can I come to the third time that you say and claim that you saw André Rwamakuba, and we now move to the events after the death of President Habyarimana.  And you told us that this was a place called, as I wrote it down, Kukakubanza, is that right?  Is that the name of the place where you saw          André Rwamakuba for the third time? 
A.	Yes, that place bears the name that you have just read out. 
Q.	And when was this, please? 
A.	I think we have already discussed that point, and I told you that I no longer remember when that had occurred.  I gave you an example.  I told you that recently I was told to write down the date on which I arrived here and I was unable to do that, and it is the gentleman who is directly opposite me whom I asked about the date.  And this was about something that had happened just the day before, or the day before yesterday. 
Q.	And how long did you spend with the gentleman the day before yesterday? 
A.	Whom are you talking about?  I don't understand you. 
Q.	Well, you just said that you gave an example of having to write something down the day before yesterday.  Well, you weren't in this court, were you, so who were you talking with the day before yesterday?  Do you know?  Is he in court today? 
A.	Yes, this person is in court.  I said it is this gentleman who is directly in front of me.  I can see him.  There he is.  And you were there and you saw it. 
Q.	All right, so it is about the details, all right, sorry.  The fourth time you saw André Rwamakuba, you told us, was the day after President Habyarimana had been killed and that was when he had machetes and he was distributing them; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  And this happened after Habyarimana's death. 
Q.	I think you told us it was the day after Habyarimana's death; is that right? 
A.	That is not correct, no.  Very well, what I understand is that you said it was the day after the death of the president, but I know what you are driving at.  But what I mean is around the 10th, the 11th, the 12th or the 13th, it was one of those dates. 
Q.	Maybe you got your story rather mixed up this morning, perhaps, because you didn't have a very firm grip on it.  So let's go back to the third opportunity that you saw André Rwamakuba at the place called Kukakubanza.  You told us you didn't know when that was.  In your statement, let me remind you, you say it was the day following President Habyarimana's death.  And we all know that he was shot down on the 6th of April, so that would make it the 7th of April which was the Thursday.    
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you all right?  I notice that you are lying on the desk.  Are you all right?  
THE WITNESS:
No, I'm not well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the matter?  
THE WITNESS:
I don't feel very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the matter?  
THE WITNESS:
I have a pain in my neck and I feel slightly nauseous.  You see me bending over, that is because I feel pain in my neck.  And it didn't start today; I have been feeling this way for some days now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it going to affect your ability to continue?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  I'm going to try and be patient.  We should try to go on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you very much.

I'm sorry for interrupting, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	So was this third occasion, indeed, the day after the death of the president, as you say in your statement? 
A.	It was not on the 7th, no.  I realise that when he was speaking to me, when I was not feeling very well it is possible that I didn't give an exact answer.  I remember that it was between the 10th and the 13th and not the day that follows the 6th of April immediately. 
Q.	Let me see if I can help you.  Your evidence is that you see Rwamakuba twice after the president's plane -- his death; is that right? 
A.	The occasion which comes clearly to mind is just one. 
Q.	But you told us of two this morning, so what`s happened between this morning and this afternoon? 
A.	I changed nothing.  This morning I was asked how many times I had seen him and I said four times.  And I think I have explained the circumstances under which I saw him on each of these four occasions. 
Q.	Well, we dealt, of course, with the school, Rutunga.  We have dealt with the party rally that you told us about; so that is two.  So there are two to go.  So when was the third time and when was the fourth time?  It is your evidence.  Let's describe the third time, that is the time before the last time; when was that?  Where was that? 
A.	Are we referring to the third or the fourth occasion?  
Q.	Third occasion.  
A.	I told you that I didn't remember. 
Q.	Well, just briefly, tell us what happened on that third occasion? 
A.	I found them talking at Kamanzi's.  When we made as if to approach these two people, Kamanzi knew me very well, and he began to speak French, so we went on our way.  I cannot tell you what was being said because I do not speak French. 
Q.	Thank you for that.  And what sort of time gap was there between that first time -- that third time and the fourth time; one day, two days, three days, a week, what sort of time was there that elapsed between that third and the fourth time you saw Rwamakuba? 
A.	I can't estimate that time.  I have told you this.  I was not in a position to estimate that sort of time frame.  I cannot give you any figure whatsoever with regard to hours or weeks. 
Q.	Well, tell me this, why is it that only six months or so ago when you made your statement you said this: "The third time I saw Rwamakuba was on the day following President Habyarimana's death."  You were very precise in your statement.  What has happened over the last six months? 
MR. NIANE:
Mr. President, I would just like to say something in regard to the chronology that the Defence has adopted.  We were referring to the fourth time, now he has gone back to the third time.  I think this approach is likely to seek to perturb the witness.  I think we started with the second and the third time, then he started with the fourth, and now he has returned to the third.  And he is still putting the same questions to the witness. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I think the witness knows where we are.  And he has introduced in his evidence this morning as the third time, we are revisiting that now.  And he told us how he came upon Kamanzi and Rwamakuba talking.  Kamanzi knew him very well, he then started speaking in French.  And the witness couldn't hear and carried on on his way.  We are talking of that occasion.  That is the third occasion. 
THE WITNESS:
A while ago you put a question to me in response to which I gave a detailed explanation to the effect that it was on the day after the president's death.  But this, you will understand, that the period from the 10th to the 13th is near that date.  And within that particular period things -- matters came to a head.  And it was observed that the situation was deteriorating on a daily basis. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let's try to stay focused on this third occasion when you saw Rwamakuba and Kamanzi talking and they went into French and you carried on your way.  In your statement, you talk of the third time that you see him, and you say this; "I saw Rwamakuba on the day following President Habyarimana's death."  That is third time.  Today you are saying that you can't remember, you can't begin to give us a date.  And I'm asking you, why, when you made your statement just six months ago, were you able to be so specific and today you do not know?  Can you answer that question, please?  
A.	I will explain to you by saying that during that period when events were occurring, we were witness to very serious events.  Habyarimana had been killed, and some time had elapsed and there were massacres.  Now, when you loose a family member under such circumstances, it is difficult to forget that period in time. 
Q.	It is difficult to forget, which is why I am asking you why is it that you are able to specify six months ago that you saw André Rwamakuba just the day after the president was killed, and today you can't?  
A.	Regarding the day on which I saw him, I said that I couldn't remember.  I never remembered the exact day, the precise day on which I saw him.  I told you when I saw him, and I could situate that event in time, but I can't remember the exact day or date. 
Q.	Well, let's move on.  On that third occasion, what was the position?  Did you -- did you find Kamanzi and Rwamakuba talking as you made your way along the road?  Did you come across them, the two of them stood there talking or what, or did you see Rwamakuba arrive or did you see Kamanzi arrive?  What was the position? 
A.	I told you that I saw them together, they were standing and they were conferring.  That is what I said. 
Q.	So I take it that means you didn't see either one of them arrive?  They were already talking when you arrived on the scene, that's right? 
A.	That is correct.  I found them together.  They were standing up, and they were conversing.  That is it. 
Q.	And where was this?  Where were they?  Were they at Kamanzi's place, his house or what? 
A.	They were in front of Kamanzi's residence. 
Q.	And where did Kamanzi live?  Could you see his house from where they were? 
A.	Yes, very clearly.  I could see his residence.  And then I told you that he was living at Kantabana and even his house is still there today. 
Q.	So for those of us who are not familiar with the area, this is nowhere near the health centre; is that right?
A.	That is correct.  I realise that you yourself you know the area, Counsel. You talk about others who do not know the place, but then the two locations are -- sites are not close to each other. 
Q.	They are about three kilometres apart; is that right? 
A.	Well, I can't tell.  I don't know if the distance between these two places is three kilometres.  I don't know if you can confirm that yourself. 
Q.	It would take you 20 or 30 minutes to walk it; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Maybe a bit longer, but that sort of distance.  And is it right Kamanzi's house is set back from the road in banana trees, you cannot see it from the road, can you? 
A.	No, that is not how it is.  If you are on the road, you can look at the entire house.  There is no obstacle between the house and a person who may be standing on the road. 
Q.	And how far set back from the road do you say Kamanzi's home is? 
A.	It is very close.  The distance separating them is about ten metres, or a little more.  It is between ten and 15 metres, so to speak. 
Q.	Your distance judging has obviously improved since this morning.  You don't think it is much more than that, more like 50 metres and hidden by banana foliage? 
A.	No, the distance separating them is not 50 metres and there is no farm -- banana farm there either.  Do you know that area well, Counsel?  It would look as if you want to give a lie to what I just said.  I don't know if you know that place very well. 
Q.	You live next door, don't you, but again out of sight of one another's houses?  You are neighbours aren't you, you and Kamanzi? 
A.	No, that is not true.  I did not live near Kamanzi's residence.  I do not know if this is allowed, I asked a question as to whether you knew the area, if the two houses were facing each other.  I asked you if you knew the area.  I don't know if I am allowed to ask such a question in this courtroom. 
Q.	And you told us this morning that you don't know how long Rwamakuba was there; that is right, is it? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Because, obviously, you hadn't seen him arrive and you didn't see him leave because you had carried on on your way; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Let me read a passage of your statement to you again dealing with this same occasion, "The third time I saw Rwamakuba" you say it was on the day following President Habyarimana's death.  "He came in a white car.  I don't remember the make of the car.  He parked the car in front of Kamanzi's house which is located along the main road.  He then hooted the car's horn.  Kamanzi came out.  And they started talking.  Out of curiosity, like all of the villagers who were there, I moved closer to them.  However, Rwamakuba and Kamanzi started talking in French and, therefore, we didn't understand their conversation.  The two men then left Kamanzi's house in Rwamakuba's car." It is a totally different story, isn't it, or an extremely different story I should say.  In your statement you say you saw him arrive.  In your statement you say you saw him go.  How does that fit in with your evidence today of coming across the two of them talking and you carrying on and not seeing either one of them leaving?  It doesn't fit at all, does it, sir?  Which statement is true, which account?  Which story is true, or do you claim is true?  
A.	I will point out the contradictions that you claim to be contradictions and I will explain them to you. 
Q.	And this was an account you gave just six months ago.  Why is it so different?  Can you tell the Judges why it is so different, please? 
A.	I believe you talked about that.  You told me that this was not written down.  And I told you that at any moment that I would remember a detail, I would be in a position and I had the right to point that out.  And that is why I gave the answer that I gave to the Chamber.  If, subsequently, there was another element that would come back to mind, I suppose that you are not going to say that it is not true.

1645H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But you are in a strange position, you see, of actually forgetting the story, and I suggest that's because you don't have a grip on it because it is untrue.  So you have no picture in your mind to fall back on, and you end up saying what comes to hand.  Why is it today, sir, that you are saying that you happened upon these two standing by the roadside and passed them by, and just six months ago you are giving details of cars arriving, cars hooting, people coming out and cars driving away, again.  Which story is true?  Did you see the car arrive then?  Is that what you are saying now? 
A.	I would like to tell you that I am telling you what comes to my mind without -- but I am not telling you what just happens to come to my mind.  I asked you if you have been to that place to be able to talk about the events.  If you wish, you can come and meet me at my home and we can talk about it again.  You are doing all in your power to discredit me, but you will not succeed.  I am telling you about events that are true.  
Q.	So why have you told two different stories in six months?  
A.	But where is the contradiction, Counsel?  I have told you that I saw them on four occasions.  I have given two versions because those were two different occasions. 
Q.	I will pass on to the fourth time.  Now, you have told us that the killings started in that area on the 13th, and I quite accept that that is the case, and I quite accept that you suffered loss, terrible loss.  How long before that day, the 13th, the Wednesday, how long before that was this last time that you saw Rwamakuba in your evidence, can you help me with that, please?  
A.	But the last time I saw him was between the 10th and the 13th; that is what I told you.  I believe that this is the umpteenth time that I am talking to you about this.  I am sure that you are going to come back to this in a few minutes and you are going to make comments to the effect that there are contradictions here and there.  
Q.	You see, this morning you told us that this fourth time he passed by us when we were going towards the pub, and this was the day after the death of Habyarimana.  So, you haven't been clear in your evidence about it, and I am asking you if you can clarify the position, and you say, well, it was the 10th or the 11th; is that right, a few days before the 13th, in any event, that you saw him for the last time?  
A.	But that is what I said.  That is exactly what I said.  
Q.	Did you see him arrive on that occasion?  
A.	I told you that he was passing just by me and I was on my way on the road and he passed by while I was on the road.  I told you this already and you are coming back to it, maybe you want me to contradict myself, it would appear to me.  
Q.	Sir, did you see him stop the car or park the car or what?  
A.	I saw him.  He passed by where I was and then he branched off towards Kamanzi's residence, and I have mentioned this to you on several occasions.  I am sure that in a few minutes you are going to point out contradictions this way and that, and at other times, you said that I had lost many of my family members.  Did you per chance learn that this or that member of the family killed himself and that he wasn't killed?  
Q.	I said that -- I think we can all understand, sir, your loss or your terrible loss, is not an excuse for making up a story.  
A.	I am not inventing anything.  You are the one who is inventing things.  You are talking about things that were reported.  I am talking to you about things that I was witness to -- who lie to you.
Q.	You just told us, may I say, just for the first time, something about Rwamakuba deviating off towards Kamanzi's house, and what do you mean by that?  
A.	Don't you know how, when you are riding in a car, you branch off; you leave the main road -- he was moving towards Kamanzi's house, that's it, Counsel.  
Q.	Was he still on the main road or just on the side of it?  Where was this now?  
A.	He came by the main road, from the tarred road.  I suppose you know the area.  So that is a road that he used.  
Q.	There is no tarred road there; is there?  Where is he?  Is he on the road, the main road that runs from Rutonga to Kayanga or has he driven off the road and gone somewhere else?  Just help me with that because I am unclear what you are saying.  
A.	I am explaining things to you, but you don't want to understand.  You are already at Rutongo.  Actually, there is no relationship between Kamanzi's house and Rutongo.  He came by the main road and moved towards Kamanzi's residence.  So what is the difficulty in that?  
Q.	What's difficult for me, sir, is I am unclear whether he has turned off that road to drive along a track, for example, to Kamanzi's house or whether you are saying he has just stopped his car on the side of the road near Kamanzi's house.  Which is it?  
A.	The car stopped in front of Kamanzi's house on the road we are talking about.  
Q.	And then when you came along by that time, Rwamakuba was out of the car; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And I am just reading my note of what you said this morning, which isn't clear.  "When we arrived there, we realised he had opened his car and he had machetes."  Is that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And what happened then?  
A.	Then the machetes started being distributed.  
Q.	I have got a note here that what happened then was that Rwamakuba asked where Kamanzi was going, and you said that Kamanzi said he was going to the health centre where the Tutsis were suffering unbearable pain; is that right, Kamanzi said that?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And Rwamakuba said, "You mean you are giving treatment to the Tutsis, wait, I will give you medicine that you are going to administer to them."  And he then started giving machetes out; is that right?  Was that the order of things that you remember that -- 
A.	That is true, indeed.  
Q.	Sir, it wasn't clear.  Did you see the machetes before Rwamakuba started talking about medicine or not?  
A.	Yes, I had seen the machetes before he made a statement.  
Q.	And where were they, these machetes?  
A.	Those machetes were bundled up in the bags, which were in the car.  
Q.	It wasn't the case that one of the bags of machetes was on the ground, did you see that?  
A.	Yes, I was witness to that.  
Q.	So, which was it?  Were these machetes in the car or on the ground?  
A.	There was a bag that was already on the ground and other bags were still in the car.  
Q.	And who were you with, yourself, at this time?  
A.	I was with a certain *************.  
Q.	Anybody else?  
A.	No one else.  
Q.	And also while you are there, you told us of this woman called Anatalie Mukarulinda, who is dead, and her request for machetes for her six Abakigas who could work.  That is something else you stood and listened to; is that right?  
A.	Yes, I was witness to that and I heard his statement.  It mustn't be said that that was reported to me, but rather, I was a witness to that.  
Q.	And you were, as you said, within earshot; you stood there listening to all this and seeing all this; is that right?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And, presumably, people there knew you were Tutsi; is that right?  
A.	Yes, they knew I was Tutsi.  
Q.	And then the time came when you left -- was that before Rwamakuba had driven away or after he had driven away?  
A.	I told you that I left them at the scene.  You should also take note of the fact that when I heard and saw what happened, I continued on my way.  I did not just stop there, as it were.  
Q.	Now, at no time in your statement did you ever refer to the fact that André Rwamakuba was, at that time, a minister in the government.  Did you know he was a minister in the government?  
A.	He became a member of the Abatabazi government.  That is when I knew it clearly.  
Q.	When did you find out that he had become minister in that Abatabazi government?  
A.	I heard it on the radio. 
Q.	It is not something you have ever mentioned to anyone, is it?  
A.	I didn't say all I knew.  There is some information which I gave and some which I didn't.  Since you started examining me, all I have done is answer your questions.  I have received the instructions from the President of the Trial Chamber to the effect that I should only answer the questions that were put to me, and so far, that is what I have done.  
Q.	So you are saying that you knew that he was a minister, but you withheld that from the investigators and from the lawyers who saw you here before you gave evidence and from your evidence this morning.  It is something you have kept to yourself, is it?  
A.	I did not have the opportunity to tell you, just as I have a lot of information which I have yet to give so far.  If I were to tell all I know, it would fill pages upon pages; it would be a whole book.  
Q.	So you were with *********** and nobody else and then you left; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Let me just read a bit of your statement out to you again.  Again, a statement only made six months ago.  "When I saw the machetes, I left the place with three other Tutsis who were there.  They were  **********************************************************************************************(By order of the Court this name has been extracted and filed under seal) ********************** -- I should ask that to be struck, I am sorry, twilight zone.  
A.	You did it deliberately, Counsel.  You knew perfectly well that you shouldn't divulge this information.  I think you should be held accountable for anything that happens to me, if anything does happen to me.
Q.	Well, I am sincerely sorry.  I blurt that out, but it was a mistake and I would ask you to accept that that was a mistake because, of course, you are a protected witness, and it should be struck from the record.  

Now, tell me this.  Those three people that you were with, why have you forgotten that you were with them today?  How could you forget, given the relationship that you had with two of them, who were then killed within a couple of days of this?  How could you say that you were only with a man called ***************?  
A.	That is because you didn't put questions to me about that.  
Q.	Oh, yes, I did.  I asked you who you were with, you said *****************.  I asked you if you were with anybody else, I think, twice, and you said no.  And there we are, you are with two of the most significant people in your life, and I suggest the reason that you haven't mentioned their names was that, this is again, part of the story you have made up.  You couldn't forget them, sir, could you?  You couldn't leave them out of your evidence if what you are saying is the truth; could you, sir?  
A.	I tell you in truth that I am telling you the truth, but you, on the contrary, you say that you were mistaken and that you went beyond the Trial Chamber's instructions in giving information -- in divulging information that you were not supposed to divulge.  Would you then admit that it was an error on your part, or perhaps, if we follow your line of logic, you did not forget; you did so deliberately.  If you can claim that I have invented or fabricated all I have told you -- 
Q.	Why would you just tell us you just were with ***************, when you were, in fact, you now say, with the two other people as well?  Is it something you forgot? 
A.	At that precise location, I was with **************, but there are other people who were not far from there who witnessed the same incident.  And there were Interahamwe, like the man you are defending, but when I witnessed that event, I was with that man, ***********, whose name I have mentioned.  
Q.	But, we can see what your statement says and I am not going to revisit that.  You go on to say here, "The massacres at the health centre took place on the 13th or the 14th of April, that would be, if my memory serves me well."  Does your memory serve you well?  Was it the 13th or the 14th that the massacres at the health centre took place?  
A.	Listen carefully.  Listen carefully to my testimony and ask for explanation, if you do not understand.  I told you that the first victim lived not far from the health centre.  This was on the 13th.  This was the first person to be killed by assailants on the 13th.  
Q.	Now, I would like to ask you, pertaining to the Kamuhanda matter because the events that occurred there, which are relevant to this case, on your evidence -- you gave evidence in the Kamuhanda trial that Kamuhanda came to a bar called Damien's place -- also called Daniel's place in the case.  This was in Katanga trading centre and that you were in this bar when Kamuhanda distributed guns and hand grenades to Interahamwe who were in the bar, and you've provided the Court with the list of the seven names of people that he provided grenades and guns to.  Do you remember that that was your evidence?  
A.	I do remember.  
Q.	Now, guns and hand grenades are very, very dramatic weapons, indeed, compared to machetes, and there you are in the bar when you witnessed all that, and you go into great detail in your evidence in Kamuhanda about what you saw.  

Now, the Chamber disbelieved you on that, but I am not concerned with that.  What I am asking you is in this:  On your story, when did you say Kamuhanda came to Daniel's bar and distributed guns and grenades?  When was that in relation to the events that you've described in the case of André Rwamakuba?  Where does it fit in?  
A.	I don't remember the date, but you should have it because you have documents in front of you.  All I can tell you is that I was there and I was an eyewitness to the events.  
Q.	Well, was that before or after you saw André Rwamakuba, you say, with the machetes at Kamanzi's house?  Was it before or after?  Simple question.  
A.	It was during the same period.  Their paths crossed; one would come today and the other one would come the next day.  You know, other people did come to our region and these people -- we did not know them.

1715H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm just asking you about these two significant parts of your history, your story.  Can you remember this incident at Daniel's bar?  Is it something that still lives in your memory when Kamuhanda distributed these grenades and these guns?  Can you remember it? 
A.	I do not remember the date.  You have documents that you're consulting and which are giving you access to the details that you're using in your questions.  I don't have these documents, you know.  My memory is not like a document of several pages, which you flip through as you do when you flip through the pages of the documents that you have before you.  
Q.	But you have your memory, you see.  You have your picture in your mind of these events that you say you experienced.  When was the first time that you knew, for example, that any weapons were being distributed, whatever form they were?  When was the first occasion that you were a witness to any distribution of weapons? 
A.	But I have told you about when I witnessed the distribution of weapons.  I didn't have to note down the various dates on which I saw the different distributions.  It was not a song or a refrain or a chorus that I had to write down in order to remember.  I didn't write it down.  
Q.	I'm -- I'm not asking you now, you see, about dates or anything like that.  I'm asking you simply this:  Was it that you saw, first of all, machetes being distributed?  Or did you see hand grenades and guns being distributed?  Which came first, surely you remember that? 
A.	I told you that it was during the same period.  It was some time before the massacres began and the people who were distributing weapons did not all come on the same day.  Some would come on one day and others would come on another day.  
Q.	Well, let me ask you this:  What other distribution of weapons did you witness other than Kamuhanda and guns and grenades -- André Rwamakuba with machetes?  Those two, did you witness any others and, if so, can you tell us about them please? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, there was some mention of distribution of guns.  The French interpreter just cut in.  It seems that there was an error on the part of the French interpreter, as I understand it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems that there is a need for clarification, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me put the question again, Mr. Witness.  You have given evidence in Kamuhanda, of his distribution of guns and hand grenades.  There's one distribution.  You have given evidence in this case, Rwamakuba distributing machetes.  That's the second distribution that you've witnessed.  What other distributions in this time did you witness? 
A.	I told you in response that during that time I did not move far from my home.  We had received instructions that we were not to leave our village of origin.  
Q.	Well, I take it that answer implies that these were the only two distributions of weapons that you yourself witnessed; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	So which of them came first, guns and grenades or machetes? 
A.	Counsel, I told you that these two distributions occurred during the same time -- at the same time and right now as I'm speaking to you I'm not in a position to give you the chronological order of these distributions.  
Q.	You were a Tutsi man with a Tutsi family, who were deeply vulnerable in the circumstances that you found yourselves and, indeed, you lost family.  If you'd seen guns and grenades being distributed you would have gone and told them, wouldn't you?  It's something you wouldn't forget.  If you'd seen machetes being distributed, you'd had gone and told them.  And you would have seen the guns and grenades -- was a terrible escalation, and you're telling us you can't remember which came first? 
A.	But I didn't inform -- I hadn't informed my family because we were not at the same location.  The chronological order is of little importance.  We were at various locations and we were monitoring the situation closely to see how we could survive.  We knew that we were the targets and that we might be killed at any moment.  
Q.	And that's the point.  You were monitoring the situation, so when you found guns and grenades being distributed, didn't you go and tell your family?  You were monitoring it, you were the only member -- only other Tutsi there, on your evidence, when you saw Kamuhanda with the guns and grenades, are you telling us you didn't go and tell anyone? 
A.	We used to talk about ourselves -- amongst ourselves.  Since we didn't go to the same bars and cabarets, we used to talk about our own experiences and what we had seen, and we used to talk about the various events that were taking place around the country. 
Q.	After you saw Rwamakuba and the machetes, you went off for a drink, didn't you, on your evidence? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	You didn't go to tell your family or to warn anyone, did you? 
A.	It was something ordinary.  We thought that it was in the order of things.  These people had nowhere to go.  This is something that was going on.  It was like a plague that had struck the country and when you witnessed such an event, you did not have a choice -- you had no other choice than to go out and take a drink to lift your spirits. 
Q.	You said in Kamuhanda that you witnessed the entire distribution of the weapons there to the various Interahamwe who received them -- that's the distribution in the bar.  That the people there, the Interahamwe, asked Kamuhanda if they were to start work immediately and he said they were to wait for the signal and the scheduled date.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened.  
Q.	You said that Kamuhanda then left for Kayanga where you heard he'd distributed machetes to the population; is that right? 
A.	No, I cannot tell you that things happened the way you say they did.  This is something I learnt of as I did not go with him.  
Q.	Before we rise for tonight, I just want to deal with one matter that you dealt with in Kamuhanda, and again, it's dealing with the transcript in your evidence.  

You've given evidence prior to the part that I'm going to read of Kamuhanda coming to the bar, Daniel's bar, with a list of names of seven people there who received guns and grenades and how you, a Tutsi, remained in the bar listening and noting everything and seeing everything that happened.  You're then asked about this:  "Do you know a man called Etienne Kamanzi?"  You answer, "Yes, I knew him. During this period did you speak to or see Etienne Kamanzi?  Just pausing there, he of course is the man who you say is with Rwamakuba on these two occasions, that's correct, isn't it?  We are talking about the same man, is that right?"
A.	Would you be so kind to repeat your question, Counsel?  I didn't understand it.  
Q.	In the Kamuhanda case you're asked about and you answer questions about a man called 
	Etienne Kamanzi, and you said that you knew him.  And I'm just asking you is it correct that that is the same Etienne Kamanzi that you refer to in your evidence in this case?  
A.	Yes, it is the same person.  
Q.	And I remind you that you're talking of the day that you had witnessed Kamuhanda's distribution of guns and hand grenades in the bar, Daniel's bar.  So the question was:  "During this period did you speak to or see Etienne Kamanzi?  Answer:  We saw each other that very evening and we had a conversation.  So where did you, that evening -- where did you see Etienne Kamanzi, please?  I saw him at a place called Ntaruka."

Now, Mr. Witness, tell me this:  After you saw Kamanzi with André Rwamakuba on the fourth time that you saw André Rwamakuba, did you see Kamanzi again after that? 
A.	I saw Kamanzi every day.  We are not close neighbours, but we're neighbours after all, so we used to go for a drink to the same -- we used to go to the same bar for a drink.  And on the eve of the massacres, I saw him for the last time -- that is, I met with him, I saw him on the eve of the massacres.  However, before the massacres I used to see him practically everyday.  
Q.	So you last saw him on the eve of the massacres; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is the last time I saw him face to face.  From that day till this day, I've never seen him.  
Q.	And was that the day that Kamuhanda had distributed guns and grenades?  
A.	I really do not remember correctly.  I think I need to think about it before I give you an answer.  
Q.	Yes, well, you think about it.  
A.	You want me to think about it now? 
Q.	Yes, please.  
A.	No.  It's not possible.  I can't go back because afterwards you might put a question to me that might place me in some jeopardy.  
Q.	Well, you surely wouldn't forget something like the distribution of guns and hand grenades.  I'm asking you was that day the last day you saw Kamanzi?  Now, if it was, then the distribution of hand grenades is obviously -- and the guns -- is obviously the day before the massacres start on the 13th, given your evidence a moment ago.  That's right, isn't it, because you told us you last saw Kamanzi the eve of the massacre and the massacre, you tell us, is the 13th and I accept that.  So you last saw your neighbour, Kamanzi, having a drink the night before; is that right? 
A.	It is correct.  It is correct and I have not forgotten anything.  You're asking for too much detail, Counsel.  You're very demanding.  But, my occupation does not give me the sort of training required to be -- to note -- to take down dates and minutes and all small details as you would have wished me to.  That depends on what is of interest to me.  
Q.	You see, in Kamuhanda you had no hesitation in saying -- of talking about the distribution of the guns and the grenades in Kamuhanda and going on to say that you'd seen Etienne Kamanzi that very night.  And, that was your evidence of ********* 2002, your memory was much better then, was it? 
A.	Yes, you might put it that way and I would add that today I get the impression that I'm giving testimony in two different trials.  But that was not the case before; it was just one trial.  
Q.	Well, let me just finally perhaps this evening ask you this:  What happened that night when you saw Kamanzi?  This last time you saw him, the eve, the night before the massacres start?  What happened? 
A.	There were intrigues and petty quarrelling and from the way he behaved I gathered that he wanted me to understand that it was all over for me and that the following day it would be over.  
Q.	All right.  That's a flavour of what happened, but what actually happened when you met Kamanzi that night? 
A.	That is not record of what happened (sic).  You have the documents before you, you have the transcript.  You said that Kamanzi came and that there was a fight between people of the Twa ethnic group who lived there.  Kamanzi thought that people had been -- had begun to cut others with machetes and he came there with a new machete.  I don't know what you want.  Do you really want me to go into such detail?  It's going to take us too long.  
Q.	Yes, you gave evidence in Kamuhanda of how he arrived and you said he had a new machete, sharpened with a machine.  And you said this:  "No, he didn't tell me anything further, but those who were present were surprised to see him with a new machete and asked him where he'd found such a machete that had been sharpened and he replied, 'So you don't have one?' And they said, 'No, we don't have.'  So he told them, 'Go to the secteur office or go to the secteur and they will be given to you' and it was on that day that I saw him for the last time."  You added, "It was the bureau of the Kayanga secteur."  Is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what happened.  If everything I said was written down, then you will see that I fought with Kamanzi because we were struggling over the machete in question.  Besides, I did not mention the name Daniel.  He asked me what I was doing there as a Tutsi and I tried to seize the machete from him and we fought.  I don't want us to dwell on this because you're not treating me very well when you put a question to me and then you return to it again.  I think I gave sufficient explanation during that trial.  
Q.	And in all this talk of machetes and Kamanzi and getting machetes, no mention at all in your evidence of André Rwamakuba; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	I never mentioned Rwamakuba's name at the the time because nobody put me any question -- put any question to me about that.  I suppose it is because it is not you who put questions to me at the time.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
I've got a little bit more to go, but probably not tonight.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before we conclude, I would like to ask Mr. Hooper to give me the reference in the Kamuhanda case from which he extracted the last statement -- the last witness statement that he read.  
MR. HOOPER:
****************** 2002 and in the English 96 -- page 96, 96 onwards.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the adjournment now. 

Mr. Witness, you can hear me? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're going to commence or continue your evidence tomorrow morning.  As I mentioned to you at lunchtime, during this or any adjournment while you are a sworn witness, you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand? 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have understood.  I shall not discuss my testimony with anyone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Well, we will take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.
