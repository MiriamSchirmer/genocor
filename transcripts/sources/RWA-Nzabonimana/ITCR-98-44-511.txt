P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open is session, today, Monday the 18th of October 2010, for the resumption of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, good morning to the Chamber, and to the registry, to the parties, and to the witness.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Takeh Sendze, Maria Wilson, and Sunkarie Ballah-Conteh.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours.  Dior Diagne of the Senegal bar representing Mr. Karemera's interests, assisted by Fatou Ndour, Bernard Munyanziza.  And we would like to greet all those present in the courtroom.  Thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning to all.  Chantal Hounkpatin for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  With me, my assistants:  Marina Yetongnon, Jean-Chrysostome Ntirugiribambe, and Jean-Paul Simbizi.  My co-counsel, Frédéric Weyl, will be joining us hopefully during this week.  That is my wish.  And I am sure that you are fully aware of the situation of the transportation sector and the airports in France.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think that the Prosecution would like to extend special greetings to Mr. Karemera, who seems to have joined us this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We also welcome Mr. Karemera.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning to the Bench. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you having difficulty in hearing?  
THE WITNESS:
Well, Mr. President, the volume is not high enough for me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe the registrar can assist.  

Can you hear any better now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, too.  

Miss Hounkpatin, what's the status of this witness's protection?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No, Mr. President, I was going to request that you confirm from Mr. Jean Ghiste himself whether he would like to testify in his own name with his identity being disclosed.  He has already appeared as a witness before this Tribunal and in this case, and so I would like that you enquire from him directly, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, at the request of the Defence, we made a protection order in your favour for purposes of your security -- 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I wish to confirm what Ms. Hounkpatin has just said.  I do not request any special protective measures because I do not have anything to hide.  I have already testified in my own name, and I wish to do so again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You testified as a non-protected witness before?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, that is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's never been a protection order made before, on your behalf?  
THE WITNESS:
Not as far as I know.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we revoke the protection order made previously, and you are now testifying as an unprotected witness.  
THE WITNESS:
That is fine with me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, before your testifying, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
JUDGE KAM:
Mr. Witness, we would like to point out to you that your solemn declaration was incomplete.  Please, would you repeat in order to be as complete as possible.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Your Honours, rather than read out the whole declaration, which is quite lengthy, we would request that he be allowed to do so piecemeal.  And I would like to ask Mr. Issa also to avoid putting my witnesses through that whole exercise here.  Thank you.  
(Declaration made by Jean Ghiste in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Now, Mr. Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel -- counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
JEAN GHISTE,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, I would like to mention some housekeeping matters before we delve into the crux of the matter.  

Like me, you are a French speaker, and so when I put a question to you I would like you to take two minutes -- a two-minute break -- well, two minutes might be too much, but observe a pause to enable the interpreters to interpret what you are saying or what I have said, to be completely processed before you speak.  Otherwise there would be an overlap between the interpretation of my question and the beginning of your answer.  This causes a difficulty with the clarity of the record.  

So I urge you also to speak slowly and clearly so that the court reporters may be able to faithfully transcribe your testimony.  
Finally, if it is possible, I would request that you spell out the proper nouns that you will be referring to in your testimony.  That would be useful.  But, if possible, I would also be spelling out some of the names that I have before me as I listen to your testimony.  

Now, I don't know whether Mr. Issa has placed before you your personal identification sheet.  
A.	Yes.  Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Can you cross-check whether the information on the sheet is accurate?  If that is the case, please date the document and sign it.  
A.	It is done.  
Q.	So, is that correct, Mr. Jean Ghiste?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
If that is the case, then, Mr. President, I would like to request that the document be produced into evidence as D. NG135, I believe.  If that is correct, Mr. Issa.  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, that is correct, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG135 admitted) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I do not know whether the stenotypists have the document.  But, if not, Ghiste is spelt G-H-I-S-T-E.  Ghiste.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, the document that has just been produced seems to indicate that you were a diplomat in Burundi, in Bujumbura.  Did you occupy the same office for Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, that is correct.  But I could provide details as to the Belgian diplomatic system so that we have a better understanding of my duties and my role.  
Q.	Yes, indeed, that would be interesting, if you were to tell the Court about the complexity of Belgian institutions.  I hope that you would use words that are simple enough to enable us to understand how you were wearing those two hats at the time.  
A.	In the federal republic of Belgium, you have states which are referred to as federated entities, and regions, and states.  And each region -- each segment has its own jurisdiction, be it in intelligence, economics, audiovisual, and what have you.  Now, these matters of jurisdiction may be exclusive and related to state duties.  In the area of international relations, there is corresponding jurisdiction for each of these entities.  

Now, in my case, I was accredited as a diplomat of the country with federal jurisdiction, but representing the francophone community of Belgium in Burundi and Rwanda.  So I was accredited as a diplomat in both countries.  So I had a dual capacity.  And I hope that I am slow enough.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, you are speaking at a good rhythm.  
A.	So I had a dual capacity in terms of representation, to the extent that within our embassies there is a role of general representation within the area of cooperation and training for both countries.  This means that in both countries we assigned a number of trainers in universities and technical institutions and other institutions.  In various ministries we had a number of advisers.  And my role was to coordinate some 100 technical assistance staff across the two countries, at a rate of about 50 per cent for each country.  

Do you have any further questions about my duties, Counsel?  
Q.	No, thank you, Mr. Ghiste; your explanation is clear enough.  

At what point in time did you take up your office?  
A.	I took office on the 1st of December 1982.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"1992", rather; correction from the interpreters.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Now, could you tell the Court whether, prior to 1 December 1992, you had had opportunity to travel to those two countries, specifically to Rwanda which is the country we are interested in?  
A.	In 1992 I travelled to both countries on a number of occasions to prepare for my assignment.  I worked with several ministers in charge of international relations for Belgium over previous years, and during that time I had travelled on mission to lay the groundwork for the cooperation work that we were developing.  So I headed a number of economic delegations.  And so as far as the French-speaking Belgian community is concerned, I also travelled on mission in that connection.  That was between 1990 and 1992.  
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, you have mentioned a time frame during which you were in contact with Rwanda.  Would it be correct to say that it was during or shortly after the October 1999 (sic) war?  
A.	Shortly after, in 1991.  
Q.	Was this in 1991 only, or 1992 as well?  And, as best as you can recall, would you tell us at what times over that period you travelled to Rwanda.  And can you tell the Court how long you stayed on each of those trips, as far as you can recall.  
A.	In 1991, end of April/early May, as far as I can recall, about one week I spent there.  Then in 1992 there was a mission in the spring as well, on behalf of the French community.  And then several missions, preparatory missions ahead of my permanent assignment.  
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, could you tell the Court the names of the Belgian ambassadors who were in place during the time you were working?  
A.	Counsel, I would like to say that as far as my diplomatic status went, I was under the authority of the ambassador.  And for the other assignments on behalf of the French community, I was answerable directly to the minister of international relations in charge of Belgian francophone cooperation.  But I would like you to be more specific in the question that you are putting to me so that I might provide as specific an answer as possible.  
Q.	Yes, I will do so.  But I was waiting for the interpretation to be complete.  

I thank you for the clarification you have made between the two supervisory authorities you had.  Now, I would like you to tell us the name of your ambassador, and then the name of the minister.  
A.	The ambassador at the time, and he was in office until April 1994, was Johan Swinnen, Mr. Johan Swinnen. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Spelling:  J-O-H-A-N for Johan.  Swinnen:  S-W-I-N-N-E-N.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you; please proceed.  
A.	My minister, my supervisory minister at the time was Mr. Michel Lebrun.  I will spell that out:  L-E-B-R-U-N.  L-E-B-R-U-N for Lebrun.  
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, let us now talk about your duties during the first phase of your assignment, that is, between December -- although you had travelled to the country before that time.  So from 1992 up to the 6th of April, let us focus on that time frame.  

You just reminded me a while ago that this was after the October 1999 -- 1990 war.  During that time, did you notice or did you observe that Rwanda was a peaceful country without any problems?  
A.	Well, Counsel, we have to answer that question with different shades of meaning, because I cannot say yes or no, because I was acting in a double capacity.  I had, on the one hand, to be aware of the situation in the country, and then also in relation to the security of the people or persons who were under my responsibility.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the interpreters, it is extremely difficult to interpret with the interferences.  We have a technical problem, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you interrupt the witness one minute, please.  

There is a problem with the audio system which the registrar is investigating.  So if you will just pause one moment, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the staff in the communication booth have promised to look into it immediately.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we continue in the meantime?  

Thank you, Mr. Registrar, for your speedy investigation on the matter.  

The problem now seems to have been addressed and we can continue.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, please continue with your answer.  Would you want me to remind you of what you last said?  
A.	No, it's not necessary.  
Q.	Very well.  
A.	So, in this context, I noticed that the country was looking for some equilibrium amongst the various political parties.  There was a willingness to evolve from multiparty -- a multiparty situation to a democratic process.  And this encouraged my government to cooperate and to develop such cooperation so as, on the one hand, to meet the needs for training, and also to support the local resources, the local capabilities in various areas.  

Am I answering your question properly?  
Q.	Yes, the answer is acceptable.  

In that context of instability and insecurity and also, as you just said, in the context where there was an evolution towards democracy, you -- or, rather, in which specific area did you intervene?  Can you tell the Court whether your aides, your assistants intervened?  Because you mentioned the areas in which you operated, namely training.  Now, the question is:  Can you explain and give some examples of areas in which you operated and which you intervened?  
A.	Minister Lebrun had various qualities, or attributes.  His attributes included teaching and scientific research.  In the context of a visit in Belgium, a visit by a member of government who was minister of primary and secondary education, that minister, namely Mrs. Agathe -- 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We're sorry, there was --
MR. PRESIDENT:
We had another technical problem; the microphone of the interpreters was off -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President, we are -- we are sorry about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... accordingly.  I am sorry.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  But from what point should I start all over again, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The last question.  The last -- I think if you can just put your last question again, the witness can answer that and we will take it from there.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Very well, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	My last question was that Mr. Ghiste should tell us the areas in which he intervened or operated in Rwanda.  I am summarising; I have difficulties repeating exactly the same terms I used in my previous questions.  But this was the purpose, the essence of my question.  The areas in which they operated or intervened in Rwanda.  
A.	So I would like to recall that -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think what we missed was the mention of Agathe Uwilingiyimana and his reference -- the witness's reference to that person.  So if he can begin his response with that, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution.  But my question was that, and his answer indeed made reference to Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  So the witness was going to proceed to give that answer.  

So here is the answer.  
THE WITNESS:
Minister Agathe had come to visit Minister Lebrun in Belgium in the course of 1992.  And Minister Agathe had presented the difficulties that they faced in the area of training teachers, in -- with -- with children who were partially or who were not fully going to school.  And the determination of the two ministers was to address this issue as quickly as possible by providing support in that area in particular.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	To be more specific, Mr. Ghiste, did you ever have the opportunity of visiting the sites of the camps of displaced persons in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, on several occasions I did that.  And Minister Lebrun made an official visit on the invitation of the minister of primary and secondary education.  That was in early May 1993.  During that visit, various sites of camps of displaced persons were visited.  At that moment it was decided jointly that there should be some specific action -- 
Q.	I'm sorry.  Before you continue with your answer, I have two questions which would lead to the answer you have just given.  

First of all, can you situate the displaced camp -- the camps of displaced persons you visited inside -- in Rwanda, as far as you can remember?  At least mention one or two of such camps, camps of displaced persons.  
A.	When the minister -- when the Belgian minister visited Rwanda we visited a number of camps, including one of them which was very important.  I do not remember the name at present, but I may remember it subsequently.  This camp was located around or near Kigali. 
Q.	The camp around Kigali, how far away was it from Kigali? 
A.	Well, at about 10 kilometres. 
Q.	The Nyacyonga camp; does that ring a bell?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Apart from that camp, did you visit any other camp inside Rwanda?  I mean camps of displaced persons.  
A.	Personally, yes, around the Byumba area.  
Q.	In those camps, what was the condition of the children who were there?  Could you give a brief description of their conditions -- a brief and realistic description of their conditions?  And please pause between my question and my answer.  It appears I am not -- I am the one not observing the pause.  
A.	Well, I will try to be a little bit more disciplined than you are.  

The purpose, when we became aware of those children who had dropped out of school, the concern was to give those children the possibility, the opportunity of writing the end of primary education examination.  That was the first objective.  

Furthermore, we also thought we should give them some opportunities.  In the very precarious situation we thought we should, well, organise them, and that is how we put in place an operation referred to as the -- the hope operation, the hope operation in the camps of displaced persons.  The purpose of that operation, during the summer of 1993, that is, more precisely, in July and August, the idea was to bring young Belgian teachers and young instructors specialised in various areas.  And this operation, this programme, took place from the second half of July right up to practically the end of August.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  Regarding that programme, did you have a document -- or, did you obtain a document which shows your participation in that programme in the displaced -- or, camps of displaced persons?  And if yes, what was the nature of the document?  
A.	Yes, indeed, I was going to mention that, because sometimes images can be more eloquent than speeches.  And, as you know, I came with a video which was shot on the spot at the time referred to.  The video was shot both to reflect what was done in Belgium, and also to give more life to the programme.  

I would be very pleased if the video can be viewed.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Oui, merci.  

Mr. President, I would like to show some images of this video.  The video had been given to me by Mr. Ghiste.  It is a VHS video document.  And I have explained to you, unfortunately I was not able to disclose it to you in time.  But I spoke with the Prosecution this morning and they do not have any objection to having some of the images shown in order to illustrate the humanitarian activities that were carried out in the camps of displaced persons in July 1993.  I have made the necessary arrangements with the technicians' booth, and our attention will be drawn to the relevant passages of this video, if you authorise us to view it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

In the projection of this video, you would notice that Mr. Ghiste appears on it. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Well, he -- Mr. Ghiste says while he was much younger.  And counsel says -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
He's still young.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Brussels, 23 May 1993, letter from the minister of international relations to the minister of primary and secondary education.  

"During my visit to the camps of displaced persons, you suggested -- and other leaders of various projects suggested that I undertake or carry out humanitarian activities for children in displaced camps.  This activity focused on two areas:  First of all, to enable them to catch up on the courses that they missed, so as to enable them to write the national examination in September of that year.  On the other hand, the other activity was to provide or to carry out social and cultural activities for these children in these displaced -- in the camps of displaced camps, within the context or scope of its duties and in the spirit of partnership. 

"As nestled in the heart of central Africa, here is Rwanda, the country of a thousand hills.  Agriculture, livestock breeding, fisheries are the main activities carried out.  The main population of this country is concentrated on the hilltops, and it is therefore a rural population.  Some of the members of the population for the last three years have been harassed.  Most of the country has been ravaged by civil war.  Since October 1990 the people have been running away from the war by abandoning their areas of origin, and since the end of 1991 camps of displaced persons have been receiving people in the number of about 6,000 people, spread over camps out of the contact areas.  Attempts to return to their lands have been increasing, but insecurity is still prevailing and the difficulty to provide food aid and medical aid for some of the displaced persons prevents some of the people to come to the camp.  

"The international community, thanks to various NGOs has gone to the spot to make up for the various shortcomings.  And this aid should continue beyond the time when the displaced persons would return to their areas of origin.  

"In these camps, the fate of children is particularly at risk, in particular from the point of view of their going to school and the daily activities.  Quite often they are without parents and without family care and they are left to their own.  

"Michel Lebrun, minister of international relations of the French community in Belgium was sensitised to these problems during his trip to Rwanda in April 1993.  By setting on the spot about 20 instructors and teachers for the French community of Belgium, the French community of Belgium, for the first time, expressed a wish to develop humanitarian activities in favour of displaced children in the form of a partnership and in the form of -- a new form of cooperation.  Three priority activities in this programme:  The training of trainers with the sharing of experience between young Rwandans and young Belgians; direct support to the population through some activities on the ground; and lastly, an evaluation which should lead to a longer term activity by sensitising other partners of the international community, Belgians, and Rwandans, so that this programme should evolve on a longer-term basis.  

"But I think the prime minister, who is the initiate of this project, and Mr. Lebrun, would better than I explain the major aspect of this programme.  

"Madam Prime Minister."  

"During his trip to Rwanda at the end of April this year, Minister Michel Lebrun, minister of international relations of the French community of Belgium, was particularly touched by the fate of children who were in the camps of displaced persons.  Two problems arose.  The first:  Going to school or the lack of school opportunities of children since there have been no classes for about three years, practically, because of the war.  Secondly, the isolation from -- cultural isolation, because most of these children have been abandoned to themselves.  

"Mr. Lebrun, following various suggestions, took the initiative of carrying out humanitarian activities during this summer.  This activity -- the first objective of this programme is to enable the children to catch up on the courses they have lost.  And the second objective is to develop activities, entertainment activities, recreational activities so as to enable these young people to acquire a better knowledge of themselves.  The originality of this initiative lies in the common or joint training of traders, both Belgians and Rwandans.  So the multiplier effect of this programme will be of greatest importance.  

"Lastly, while it is true that a number of NGOs like the Red Cross, Caritas, the MSF, et cetera, have been meeting urgent needs like providing food, health care, hygiene, very little is done regarding training.  And it is particularly important for the population in the displaced camps to take advantage of all the humanitarian aid provided."  

"On 19 July 1993, 22 young Belgians landed at the international airport in Kigali.  Eleven teachers and eleven instructors were selected by -- out of about 100 candidates as a result of their experience, but also as a result of their human touch and the diversity of their background.  In fact, one -- some of them are artists, sportsmen, musicians, doctors.  We met them on their arrival in Kigali and we obtained from them their first impressions."  

"In terms of objectives, I think I hope to achieve two mains goals:  First of all, exchange experiences with Rwandan colleagues -- Rwandan colleagues with whom I will have to work.  I think there is a lot to be learned, and perhaps there is also a lot that we, too, can give out."  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, we have just seen the introduction to this video.  In fact, it relates to the work that you carried out on the field in the month of July -- the months of July/August 1993.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	This partnership -- first of all, can you orally tell the Court the conclusions of this programme and the decisions that were made for the continuation of the programme in the context of humanitarian aid?  
A.	Counsel, this cooperation -- this operation, rather, was a pilot operation, a pilot programme.  It was indeed modest, or small, in view of the needs that were present at the time.  The objective we had in mind was to render the programme sustainable and to go much further in meeting the needs that were expressed. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, within the framework of such cooperation or cooperations, was it -- were there any agreements signed between the various partners to enable you continue with the operations, particularly mindful of the fact that this was during the multiparty era?  And did you have the assurance that the work for the benefit of the displaced persons was going to be sustainable?  
A.	In any event, we had started to jointly think about these issues.  And, as far as I can recall, the atmosphere was very conducive for long-term sustainable activity.  But you may want to know that in other sectors, and in the education sector in particular, we had an adviser at MINIPRISEC, and all of these things were gradually being set up in a very congenial atmosphere, I must say.  
Q.	MINIPRISEC is an abbreviation meaning ministry of primary and secondary education.  MINIPRISEC, it's spelled M-I-N-I-P-R-I-S-E-C for MINIPRISEC.  
A.	Counsel, may I add something?  
Q.	Please do.  
A.	There was an evaluation at the end of that operation.  
Q.	Yes, that indeed is the question I was going to put to you.  
A.	The purpose of that evaluation was two pronged:  On the one hand, to identify areas of improvement; and, secondly, to seek the opinion of the competent authorities within the country in order to be able to put in place mechanisms for the continuation of the project.  

In that connection, and with the assistance of the Belgian embassy which I reported to in respect of my diplomatic duties, we sought to sensitise and educate various political parties about our objectives.  
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, let me put some questions to you in relation to that evaluation, and the conditions in which various political parties and a number individuals, particularly the one who is of interest to me, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

So let me start by asking you whether you know -- or, you knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	I did not know him before the operation.  
Q.	Can you explain to the Court the circumstances in which you met him, and how you got to meet him in person and to have a discussion with him?  
A.	Yes, I can.  Now, I was saying that I did not know -- in fact, I did not know Ngirumpatse very well.  However, the Belgian embassy, to be more specific, the chargé d'affaires, since the ambassador was absent at that time -- and I'm referring to Philippe Colin.  Let me spell out that name -- 
Q.	Colin is spelled C-O-L-I-N.
A.	Mr. Philippe Colin had accompanied me over a number of days as we toured the various camps to see the results and understand the problem at hand.  So he decided to organise a meeting with Mr. Ngirumpatse, who, at the time, had become the chairman of his party.  And that meeting was to take place at his home at -- over a meal.  Three persons were present at that dinner around the 18th of August 1993.  

Am I going too fast?  
Q.	Please mention the names of those who were present.  
A.	Apart from the first secretary of the embassy and Mr. Ngirumpatse, those in attendance included the person who was in charge of the Belgian francophone community as an external representative on behalf of all Belgian NGOs specialised in that area.  And that person's name was Alain De Brouwer, who came on a mission from the 9th to the 19th of August.
Q.	(No interpretation)
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Rather, I can see the stenotypist does not have the sound; there is no interpretation.  I am spelling out the name Alain De Brouwer.  

Alain is spelt A-L-A-I-N.  De Brouwer.  D-E for De, Brouwer:  B-R-O-U-W-E-R.  De Brouwer, Alain De Brouwer.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, please continue.  
A.	It was on that occasion that I met maybe for the one and only time Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Although I met him on and off -- or I came -- our paths crossed, should I say, every now and then.  But that meeting sought to deal with the goals of the Belgian embassy, namely, to explain what we were doing, particularly through the francophone community, by way of providing some assistance.  And so we sought to evaluate that first mission and to lay the groundwork for an extension of the work.  

And the second objective of the embassy was also to provide me with information through Mr. Ngirumpatse about the political situation in the country, as he tended to do regularly through the embassy because we were very close to the signing of the Arusha Accords, and so it was a briefing on what the prospects and how things were happening.  

And I hope that I am not going too fast.  
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, as far as you can recollect, during that conversation with Mr. Ngirumpatse at which you dealt with the topics you have just mentioned, how did he come across to you?  Did he refuse to implement the Arusha Accords, or did he indicate that his party was not willing to implement the Arusha Accords?  And would you please just give the Court an overview of the very important discussion you had with him? 
A.	I think that to be specific in answering your question, one must state clearly what I was able to observe, as well as what information I gathered from the embassy in relation to the political situation in Rwanda during that summer, the summer of 1993.  You see, things were not simple.  There were a number of political parties in place, there were some internal problems, and although the impression of progress could have been observed, it appeared to be taking place in a disorderly manner.  This is what my impression was.  And I am going to answer your question.  

During that in-depth discussion with Mr. Ngirumpatse, my initial feeling was that he was a man who was very thoughtful and thorough, and who didn't speak without minding his words.  And I felt that he had two concerns, and these are the things that stand out in my memory.  First of all, a desire for true dialogue between political parties, and not confrontation.

THE WITNESS (continued):
He also came across to me as being fully aware or conscious of the weaknesses embedded in the ongoing developments.  I was able to gather a lot of information from that discussion, and he came across as a very objective person.  The outstanding point that I remember is that he appeared to be a man of dialogue with the opposition and with other parties.  He did not underestimate the challenges of the times.  

So, in broad strokes, those are the points that stand out in my mind and in my recollection.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  Could you please briefly -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have one -- a few concerns with the witness's response to the last question.  And I'm sure Ms. Hounkpatin is going to suggest that I can address them in cross-examination, but I wanted to raise them at the first opportunity.  And the first is that we received a will-say statement from 
Madam Hounkpatin yesterday -- as late as yesterday afternoon, and this was the second will-say.  There was a previous one that had been served on us some months ago, and this is the first time that I've been made aware that this witness met with Mathieu Ngirumpatse and had what he has described as a substantial conversation with him.  

And I think if we're going to be affected in -- in how we conduct the disclosure, the Defence should have put us on notice about this conversation, which the witness himself has characterised as substantial.  So that's a disappointment, but we'll deal with it as we move forward.  

And then the second thing is that the substance of the witness's response to the question, to me, is unsatisfactory.  I heard Madam Hounkpatin ask him what Ngirumpatse said, and what we got in response was his impressions and his assessments -- or his comments about his perceptions of what was going on in 1993.  

So I'd appreciate it if Ms. Hounkpatin can ask him specifically what Mathieu Ngirumpatse said so we can hear what the Accused said and not what the witness's impressions of the situation were in 1993 -- are.  
THE WITNESS:
Can I answer, Mr. President? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  You may proceed.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
First of all, let me say to the Prosecutor that sometimes you need to talk at length with the witnesses to discover some important aspects of their testimony, and I am sorry that my will-say did not convey this information to the Prosecutor earlier on.  

I myself only became aware of the significance of this -- of that meeting late yesterday.  And, as I already mentioned, I got to Arusha later than him, and it is for these reasons that we were not able to make the necessary disclosures in a timely manner.  

The same argument applies to the video cassette.  In that connection, therefore, I crave the indulgence of the Bench in relation to this matter of disclosure.  

I would also like to ask Mr. Ghiste to tell us clearly, and as far as he can remember, what Mr. Ngirumpatse said and also, if possible, to do so right away.  But, if necessary, I could outline the various issues that were raised during the discussion and then the witness could provide the answer from Mr. Ngirumpatse -- if the Bench would allow me to proceed in this manner.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, why can't you simply let the witness say what issues were discussed, and if you put it to him, that would be leading him.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Very well, Mr. President, that is how I will proceed.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, what topics did you discuss during that meeting? 
A.	Well, let me say that I fully understand what the Prosecutor is referring to, particularly in relation to the details that I have not yet provided.  But I was speaking previously about my impressions and my feelings, and so now I would like to be a lot more specific.  

Let me recall that the goal of the embassy was also to give a picture of the situation in the country after the Arusha Accords, mindful of the new view of the future involving new political parties that would be part of the management of the country.  

I cannot claim to provide an exhaustive answer, but as I was saying, Mr. Ngirumpatse expressed himself in such a manner that led me to think that he stood for political dialogue between various political parties, because he said that there were a number of challenges -- significant challenges within various political parties but that his desire -- his personal desire as the chairman of his party was to stretch out a hand of dialogue and to avoid confrontation.  That, in itself, would have weakened or undermined a proper unfolding of our operations.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, talking about political parties, which political parties did you and Mr. Ngirumpatse talk about at the time?  Do you remember which political parties were active on the political scene in Rwanda, and which political party was he most concerned about? 
A.	Well, I am not naive when it comes to politics, but I know that there may be statements and hidden agendas, and yet they are undisclosed goals and objectives.  So let me answer your question.  
The MDR had just experienced a deep crisis during that summer.  There were problems in the PL, in the PS -- is it social or socialist?  I don't know if it's social or socialist party, PS.  

Now, my understanding of the atmosphere, mindful of the information available and the contacts at the time, led me to notice that people were not trusting each other and particularly had to be wary in relation to the arrival of the various expats.  I don't know if you want me to go into more detail, but let me say that I was an external observer and it was not for me to be involved in any manner whatsoever in the businesses of Rwanda.  

I was not acting under any federal jurisdiction in relation to my task on behalf of my country.  My duty was to fully understand the political environment in which I was working in order to be able to find the most appropriate channels of cooperation, and to provide security for the people who were under my responsibility, I had to understand somewhat the political atmosphere.  

And, now, if we were to talk about Mr. Ngirumpatse in the context of the discussion we had on that day, let me say that, as far as I can recall, he underscored all the problems that arose at that time within the context of the ongoing processes.  He did not give me the impression that he had answers to all those problems at that time.  When I talk about impression, Mr. Prosecutor, it is in relation to what he was saying.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Ghiste, I don't think that you're providing a bad answer, and please do not think so either.  What we want is simply for you to mention the topics that you dealt with.  For example, you have already told us that you talked about political parties.  Now, what did he tell you about the MDR?  
Did he give you his impression on the situation within the MDR?  Please give us a brief answer.  
A.	Yes, of course, he did.  He gave me what his impression was on the various political parties, but, clearly, the MDR appeared to be the most divided party at the time.  
Q.	Did he tell you, as you have already mentioned, that it was his desire that the parties come together and be united in order to obtain peace within the country?  Is that what he said?  Is that part of your discussion with him? 
A.	The answer clearly would be yes, and that seemed to be at the very heart of his own political strategy.
Q.	Now, in relation to the political violence, did he tell you that he agreed with the ongoing political violence or did he condemn it? 
A.	Once again, I was not under the impression that I was dealing with a belligerent person.  Whatever he said seemed to point to the fact that he was trying to address that challenge which, may I say, was not an easy one.  

Once again, I think I'm going too fast.  But, clearly, Belgium insisted on the implementation of the Arusha Accords which had just been signed as we all know, and that was the position of other embassies as well.  So those of us who had chosen to -- 
Q.	Well, Mr. Ghiste, in his capacity as chairman of the MRND, did Mr. Ngirumpatse tell you that the MRND disagreed with the Arusha Accords and that they would not implement it? 
A.	No.  I never heard any such statement from him, not at all.  
Q.	During that conversation did he tell you -- or did he indicate in any way whatsoever that the MRND would do everything to ensure the implementation of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I think he did.  That is what I think I remember.  And, once again, the concern of the ambassador or the chargé d'affaires when he brought us together was to give us an opportunity to hear what the determination of Mr. Ngirumpatse was.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  Now, let us return to the purpose of your stay in Rwanda.  Did Mr. Ngirumpatse in that connection agree with the implementation of the humanitarian assistance programme to youth and children in the camps? 
A.	Yes, absolutely, he did.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I have a series of questions now relating to the 6th of April, but, maybe, as I look at the five remaining minutes, I would like to ask for that time to put together my questions so that I may be able to conclude my examination-in-chief this -- this morning.  So if you were -- we were to take the morning break five minutes before the normal time, that would make it possible for me to proceed as indicated.  Thank you.

And before that, Mr. President -- I'm sorry, maybe I spoke a little too fast.  I would like to produce the video which we watched a short while ago as D. NG136, if Mr. Issa has no difficulty with that numbering.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG136 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we can take our morning recess now -- our mid-morning recess.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1102H)  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, we shall now proceed, but before I talk about the events from the 6th of April, I would like to ask you to answer two questions in relation to your discussion with Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Question number 1:  Did Mr. Ngirumpatse, during that meeting with you, express any opinion on the political bipolarisation and the strengthening of the RPF military potential? 
A.	What do you mean by "bipolarisation", Counsel? 
Q.	We have made significant strides in our examination, but we did not delve into the details of the political scene in Rwanda at the time.  You will tell me if I am mistaken, but it would seem that, on the one hand, you had the MRND and then on the other, there were opposition parties -- opposition parties to the MRND, and I'm referring to the era of the multiparty politics prior to 1994.  

So this is around 1993.  And within the opposition political parties, there were a number of factions that supported the RPF, while others did not understand how it is that some of them could support the RPF, which was supporting war in an era of democracy.  Is that clear enough? 
A.	Well, if I have understood you, what I would say then is that, during those discussions, we talked about the factions within the various political parties, including those which supported the RPF.  

Now, a question for you, Counsel:  When you talk about supporting the RPF, what do you mean? 
Q.	The RPF was a political party, yet it was involved in war.  It stood for democracy while fighting the war.  Now, among the opposition dem -- opposition political parties, there was a group that supported that vision of the RPF which stood for war and democracy at the same time.  

Now, if you did not deal with that issue, just tell me that you did not talk about it.  If you talked about, then you tell the Court whether you discussed it or not. 
A.	Now --
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)...to the form of that question.  Could Madam Hounkpatin rephrase the question before the witness is allowed to answer.  The witness is supposed to give his evidence, not the Defence team.  And the notion that the RPF is a party at war and was conducting war and democracy at the same time is not an appropriate proposition for this Defence team to put to this witness.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I did not tell the witness that the RPF stood for war and democracy at the same time.  I simply described what we have observed throughout our deliberations here in respect of what happened on the Rwandan political scene and the existing political parties and their inclinations. 
THE WITNESS:
Now, when you use the word "affinity" or "inclination", then I can understand you, Counsel.  Now, there were affinities or inclinations in a number of parties towards the RPF, but I have no specific answer to your question because I know that, in the discussions with Mr. Ngirumpatse, we had a broad overview of issues.  And, in any event, I was personally aware that the various parties, as was common knowledge, were all experiencing difficulties and, in that context of mutual caution, there were situations where so-and-so was said to be in this and that context, and so I don't have any specific answer to provide.  

But, in our overview of the situation -- our broad overview of the situation, I was under the impression that the opinions expressed were quite objective.  In any event, we may look at the reports that I submitted to my hierarchy, which are much more detailed than what I may have in memory right now.  

Such an exercise might require a lot more elaborate research, but as the Prosecutor alluded to a short while ago, I am really not in a position to provide a verbatim report of what we discussed during those meetings.  What I could attempt to do, if this were an important question, would be to provide further detail.  Otherwise, we may need to rely on the reports that I submitted at the time.  

Now, as for the second part of your question as to the strengthening of the military potential, I really do not have any recollection of that point.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  Now, was Mr. Ngirumpatse concerned about defending or protecting the Tutsis who were members of his own political party in view of the developments in the political situation at the time? 
A.	Well, I could be more assertive in my answer by saying, yes, I heard him say so.  Not only from his mouth, but from other persons, such as, the chargé d'affaires of the Belgian embassy who had briefed me somewhat on Mr. Ngirumpatse and on his nature -- or his position and what he was trying to do.  
So I heard from him and from other sources that such was the case.  And this was an issue of concern for me as well.  And when I was on mission -- am I going too fast? 

During my first mission in 1991, I met many witnesses, many people, some who had been imprisoned and others as well, and my concern was to fully understand what was going on.  Now, during that meeting I put similar questions to him, and so my answer to your question is yes.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  On the 6th of April 1994, where were you? 
A.	I was in Bujumbura.  
Q.	What were you doing?  And can you tell the Court the circumstances in which you were informed of what had happened to the presidential plane on that day when, as fate would have it, two presidents were on that craft.  
A.	It was a very special day which is forever present on my mind.  On the 6th of April in the afternoon, I was at home with my adolescent children.  We were sharing a meal with my wife and a friend who worked at the Belgian embassy.  I received a phone call from my son who was 15 years old at the time, who told me, "Papa, many ministers have been trying to reach you."  

At that point I interrupted my meal and we left our friend's residence -- or, rather, from our friend's residence we called the Belgian embassy.  And it was Easter holidays at that time, and the ambassador was absent.  The first secretary was travelling somewhere within the country, and I was able to get an attaché of the embassy in Kigali by phone.  

Let me specify again -- or, rather, let me just specify that my son had told me that they had been trying to reach me as soon as possible because it would appear that there was a problem with the 
presidential plane.  So when I was able to get Mr. Lange on the phone from Kigali, he told me, "Yes, I have just learnt that there has been an accident.  We do not know what the details are.  We cannot get any closer, but I -- all I know is that the situation is extremely confusing."  

So we called --
Q.	Well, Mr. Ghiste, at what time did you have that telephone conversation with Mr. Lange who was at the Belgian embassy in Rwanda?  At about what time?  You may not be extremely specific, but just -- just give me the time.  
A.	Around 9 p.m., 2100 hours.  
Q.	Please proceed.  
A.	Let me open a parenthesis to explain my state of mind at that time.  I was concerned for Burundi, first of all.  Several rumours had it that a coup d'état was likely to take place because there were problems between the president of Burundi and his chief of staff.  

That afternoon, when I returned to my office, I remembered -- I remember seeing persons in military attire surrounding the centre of the city downtown.  At that time I thought it was a simple military exercise.  

But now let us return to the evening.  After talking to the person in charge of the telegraph services at the Belgian embassy in Kigali, and after he told us that there had been a plane crash and that he did not know whether there were any survivors and that the situation was serious -- and, as I said a short while ago, I was very concerned both for Burundi and for Rwanda regarding particularly the families and the persons who were under my responsibility.  So we suspended our meal, and I went back to my home in the suburbs of Bujumbura, on the other side of Bujumbura.  

At that time two government ministers had already come to seek refuge because they were very concerned.  They had just come back from the airport.  And a number of people who felt that they were in danger because of the possibility of a coup d'état in Burundi, those people came to my home, just as had been the case when the coup d'état took place in October 1993.  

So as I just said a short while ago, my first concern was regarding the safety and security of persons working with our cooperation services.  I, therefore, quickly proceeded to find out where this staff in Bujumbura was located.  I asked them to remain in their homes and wait for orders.  

I used the telephone to contact other technical cooperation staff who were present in Rwanda at the time.  They did not know much about what had transpired.  There was general confusion.  And so I also ordered them to remain in their homes.  

During the evening the United Nations in Kigali issued an advisory for all expatriates to remain in their homes.  Throughout that evening of the 6th of April, if I were to provide a clear answer to your question, I was gathering information, but that information was fragmented.  And so around midnight I called the prime minister hoping that she would be able to give me information -- additional information.  And I'm referring here to the prime minister of Rwanda.  

She told me that she wasn't any more informed than I was, that she was very worried because the representative of the European Union, Mr. Booh-Booh -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS:
-- had wanted to go to the place of the accident, but was forbidden from doing so.  

She also told me that she wanted to go to the radio as quickly as possible to try and bring the situation under control.  

She told me that she had just called Colonel Luc Marchal of UNAMIR asking for protection.  So we agreed that the next day, in the morning, we would have another telephone discussion.  

The next day in the morning, that is, in the morning of the 7th of April, I tried to call her again, given that I was very worried about the lack of information on the situation.  No one answered the phone call.  The telephone lines at the prime minister's residence were dead.  

And we all know what happened at that time.  So that's my answer for the 6th of April.  

BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  I need some clarification from you following that narration.  Please tell the Court which ministers -- which two ministers came to seek refuge -- or asking for hospitality, to use your words, at your residence.  Can you tell the Court when they reached your residence?  Was it before your return or after you returned to your residence? 
A.	The two ministers were the minister of higher education and scientific research with whom I had permanent contact.  And the other minister was the minister of culture and audio-visual matters.  

By the way, for reasons of security as well, some persons were also at my residence.  Let me recall that people were worried at that time.  So at that time the ambassador, chief of protocol for President Ntaryamira, was already residing at my home.  

It may be interesting to note also that during that evening, towards the end of that evening, I received a phone call from the presidential palace and he was the one on the line.  I did not quite understand because, ordinarily, he travelled with the president.  But he called me because he had given his seat on the presidential plane to another minister who was part of the delegation.  

And that is how things happened.  There were other persons who came, but I don't know whether those details will -- would be useful or relevant in this case.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Ghiste, allow me, however, to ask you whether, in addition to those personalities from the Burundian government who sought refuge at your residence -- were there other persons?  You mentioned one or two of them who sought refuge at your residence on that day following the attack on the plane. 
A.	I knew President Ntaryamira very, very well.  Even before he became president of the republic, I had personal and ongoing contacts with him.  So his wife called me to ask whether members of his family could be -- who were at the presidential palace could be received at my residence, including one visitor.  So they also went on to seek refuge at the French embassy at the residence of the 
French ambassador. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, you said that in the afternoon you saw soldiers moving in Bujumbura town.  And when you heard of that attack, you had fears.  Can you please be more elaborate on what you saw as movements by soldiers.  What was the reality?  Please be very brief to enable us to understand the context of these two countries whose heads of state had been killed.  
A.	Earlier on I mentioned that I had personal contact with the president of the republic.  He had expressed a wish to see me in order to talk unofficially about the situation and his worries.  I said this earlier on.  
There was major tension -- great tension between the -- the army headquarters and himself.  As a matter of fact, since President Ndadaye was inaugurated, there was the determination to change the army, its composition, and so on.  
So he talked to me about this meeting in Dar es Salaam.  As everyone knows, I believe that meeting, as a matter of priority, dealt with the security situation in Burundi and in the sub-region.  He had to participate -- or, rather, various heads of state had to participate in that meeting, including the 
head of state of neighbouring Congo, which then was called Zaire.  At the very last minute, President Mobutu declined to attend the meeting.  

I do not know any more than that.  I know that there are various theories -- various hypotheses that have been put forward regarding this matter.  But that said, I -- I think the answer remains open.  
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, it is, therefore, on the morning of the 7th that you resumed your quest for information regarding Rwanda.  You tried to respond to the invitation extended to you by Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  You were unable to get in touch with her.  But later on were you able to get in touch by telephone with other people in Rwanda?  And if yes, can you tell us what your approach was.  What did you do on the day of the 7th of April? 
A.	Obviously, I cannot go into all the details because I'll have too much to say.  But on the whole, telephone communication came to an end during the day -- telephone communication with Kigali came to an end.  I thought of a possible repatriation or a possibility that some of my cooperative staff go to Bujumbura.  I was looking into how I would receive them.  And we organized -- together with my aides or collaborators at that moment, we organised ourselves to be on duty 24 hours out of 24.  
Q.	At what point in time did you receive the information regarding the death of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana? 
A.	I would like to point out that I was in permanent contact with our embassy, the Belgian embassy in Bujumbura.  And it was at the end of the day -- at the end of the afternoon, that is, in the beginning -- at the beginning of the evening that we received information -- official information regarding what had happened both to the prime minister but also to the ten Belgian soldiers who were there.  The press -- the international media, the Burundian media also repeated the information throughout the evening.  
Q.	What did your supervisory authorities do regarding that situation?  First of all, between the 
7th and the 9th of April, were you aware -- did you have any precise knowledge of what was happening in Rwanda?  And what were the channels by which you received whatever information you may have received? 
A.	Information was always partial, not complete.  There was very pre -- little precise information.  There was a great deal of confusion.  

What was the second part of your question, Counsel, please? 
Q.	The channels through which you received whatever information you may have received.  
A.	There were NGOs which could still contact by radio.  They could still contact some people in Rwanda, and those NGOs, individually, made available a series of information.  There was also the first refugees who arrived in very, very precarious situations in Burundi, the refugees who were able to run away from the country.  So this information was not complete.  We had very little information on how the situation was evolving.  
Q.	During the 72 hours were you informed of the killings -- the massacres that were taking place in Rwanda and where? 
A.	As a matter of fact, the refugees also explained in their confusion what had happened.  They said there were people who had been killed.  They said they had escaped or tried to escape from the situation.  But, once again, we did not have very clear information.  We knew that the situation was -- I don't know how to put it -- was deteriorating very quickly.  
Q.	Were you informed of the resumption of war by the RPF at any point in time during the 72 hours referred to? 
A.	Yes, through diplomatic channels but also through the media.  
Q.	Did that add to the confusion and the difficulty of being aware of the real situation prevailing in Rwanda? 
A.	I cannot answer that question precisely.  It would appear that, as far as telecommunications into Kigali was concerned, yes, that was linked to the resumption of war.  
Q.	Did you have the opportunity of returning to Rwanda during the period referred to -- that is, during the first month that followed the attack that caused -- or in which the Rwandan and Burundian presidents were killed? 
A.	During the month of April, that is, after the 7th of April, I went to Rwanda for the first time on the 9th of April.  A convoy -- the first military convoy, not a humanitarian convoy -- the first convoy of refugees, expatriates left Kigali on the 9th of April and they went through Butare.  I will try not to go very fast for the -- for purposes of interpretation.  

So I travelled on the 9th of April to the border area -- the Rwandan border and I was able to get to Butare.  I would like to recall that I had a number of trainers who were in Butare university.  I wanted to find out what their situation -- security situation was because I must also recall that, at that point -- at that point in time, there was no guideline from the Belgian authorities -- from the Belgian minister of foreign affairs for an evacuation.  The only guidelines or instructions we had was to be cautious.  

So I reminded my staff, whom I was able to get in touch with in Butare, that they had to be cautious; that they had to stay home; that they had to wait -- wait for instructions; that they had to be attentive -- had to be alert.  And for those of them who wished, they could return to Bujumbura where we had made arrangements for them to be received.  
Q.	On that morning of the 9th of April, when you decided to go to Butare, did you go there alone or were you accompanied by other people? 
A.	I was in constant contact with the French-speaking journalist from our country and also the Dutch-speaking journalist from my country, who were in charge of providing information -- providing media coverage.  And that -- on that morning, I was waiting for a journalist from a newspaper in my country and also a journalist from -- François -- who was the journalist of the French-speaking 
Belgian radio and television network who was covering all the events and the entire situation in Africa.  
I was waiting for information from him.  

So I went to receive them at the Bujumbura airport.  I invited them to have breakfast at my residence, and I told them, "Well, I have decided to go to Butare.  If you want to accompany me, you can do so."  And that's what they did.  

So I left in my vehicle for the Rwandan border.  My 15-year-old son also accompanied me.  And immediately after leaving Bujumbura, the road meanders towards Bugarama, that is, on the hills, the neighbouring hills, and we were extremely surprised to notice -- to -- to find out that there were humanitarian convoys from Rwanda at that moment, as well as United Nations' convoys, 
Doctors Without Borders, and other NGO convoys specialised in providing emergency or relief aid.  
In fact, that situation was incomprehensible as far as we were concerned.  

Precisely at that moment when difficulties were evolving in the country, it was surprising to see that humanitarian organisations were the first to leave the country.  We found this quite shocking.

1145H
THE WITNESS (continued):  
So we were in Butare, and I was saying that I was able to meet some of my staff.  The journalists, some of them, had already been there.  Journalists expressed the wish to continue to Kigali -- in any case, try to continue to Kigali, but in any case they remained on the spot.  

I returned after receiving the first convoy and the people who felt they were in danger.  I received them in my residence.  I joined them at the Belgian embassy in Bujumbura early in the evening, and there I organised their being received.  I organised a reception of people who were in the cooperation mission and also people -- others who wanted to return. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	At this stage, in order not to forget, I would like to spell some of the names that you use in your evidence.  You talked about Booh-Booh.  B-O-O-H -- further away -- B-O-O-O-H (sic).  
	Ntaryamira, N-T-A-R-Y-A-M-I-R-A.  Braeckman, Collette, B-R-A-E-C-K-M-A-N.  François Reyckmans, R-E-C-K-M-A-N-S (sic).  
A.	Minor error in that name:  R-E-Y -- 
Q.	I take that again:  R-E-Y-C-K-M-A-N-S.  Reyckmans.  Thank you.

Mr. Ghiste, this humanitarian convoy which left the site where it had to intervene, the fact that they left surprised you.  Would the fact that they left -- was it a normal thing?  Was it normal for humanitarian organisations to be the first to leave?  Or what explained their conduct? 
A.	I didn't find their conduct normal at all.  And for the journalists who accompanied me, they were more than surprised. 
Q.	These humanitarian associations, these NGOs, to the best of your knowledge at the time, were they the targets of acts of violence that were taking place, were any acts of violence the cause of them being the first to leave? 
A.	No, I'm not aware of that.  In any case, not at that point in time.  They were not the targets of acts of violence.  I know that there were problems later on in some places.  I cannot specify which places from memory. 
Q.	Did -- as a tactical cooperation staff of the Belgian mission, did you receive any information to the effect that the situation had become -- or worsened to such a situat -- to such a point that even humanitarian organisations had to leave, and that even you had to get ready to leave Rwanda? 
A.	I said a while ago that there were no instructions from the ministry of foreign affairs, and generally the minister of foreign affairs is very cautious.  There was no instructions for us to evacuate -- to leave.  And I would like to point out that in Butare the situation was absolutely calm at the time I was there.  All the information I was able to obtain -- all the rumours I had from various sources indicated that the situation was calm. 
Q.	When you returned to Rwanda on the 9th of April in order to go to Butare, did you have to go past roadblocks?  Did you see roadblocks set up?  Roadblocks at which you were checked.  If yes, tell us which roadblocks.  
A.	Still - or, rather, at that point of time, there were no roadblocks.  I am referring to the period -- or, rather, to the area between the border and Butare.  There were already roadblocks between Kigali and Butare.  But from memory, I cannot tell you.  I cannot tell you -- or, rather, what exactly they were, but people in the convoy explained to me without being very clear. 
Q.	So you were told that there were roadblocks between Kigali and Butare.  You didn't have to go past them.  Did you have the opportunity of going to Kigali during the time frame referred to? 
A.	Can you specify the time frame, please?  
Q.	At the beginning of my question I mentioned a period starting from the 5th of April going to about mid-May -- the beginning of mid-May? 
A.	Yes, I went to -- around mid-May I went there, around the 16th of May.  
Q.	You went to Kigali? 
A.	No, that was impossible. 
Q.	Well, let me clarify my question.  My question was to know -- first of all, you were told that there were roadblocks between Butare and Kigali.  And my question was to find out whether you had the opportunity of going right up to Kigali and whether you did go past roadblocks personally.  Were you in Kigali? 
A.	In mid-May at the request of Caritas, the head of Caritas for Rwanda and Burundi who lived in Bujumbura, together with a third person, that is, Mr. Paul Antheunissens.  Perhaps I should spell that name. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
THE WITNESS:
Antheunissens.  A-N-T-H-E-U-N-I-S-S-E-N-S.  Paul Antheunissens.  

And Dr. Jean François Rupoll -- R-U-P-O-L-L -- who was on duty before the events of 6th of April in Kigali as the doctor in charge of the medical section of the Belgian embassy, and who was on holiday in Belgium on the 5th of April and the days that followed the 5th of April.  He wanted to place -- place himself at the disposal of the embassy by coming to Bujumbura, since it was impossible to go directly by flight to Kigali -- by air to Kigali.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, this travel in mid-May was not for Kigali.  We'll come back to that.  But my question was to know whether you went past roadblocks on your way to Kigali and whether at any point of time you reached Kigali during this time frame referred to? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Very well.  
A.	Well, I've not answered. 
Q.	Please, go ahead.  Answer the question.  
A.	I was waiting for translation.

I went to -- I went to the top of the hills of Kigali, three of us.  But it was impossible to go right up to Kigali because fighting was raging in Kigali at that time.

Now, in answer to your question regarding the roadblocks, yes, there was a number of roadblocks. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  You said there was a number of roadblocks, how many did you cross?  
	And -- and was -- was the manner of control to which were subjected -- can you describe the people who were manning the roadblocks and what they requested of you? 
A.	To be clear I have to give some details before I answer your question, so I repeat, that journey was organised by Caritas International and the purpose of it was to try bring food aid to the population.  

On that occasion also it was thought that we should see with our own eyes what the situation in Rwanda was because the information we received was confused, incomplete and it would appear the situation became more and more -- or was becoming more and more difficult for the population.  So the objective -- our objective was not to count the roadblocks, but to cross them, to go past them.  

However, the -- the condition precedent was the following, and as the Tribunal is aware, on the eve of the attack the Belgians were targeted.  The -- it was thought that they were those who perpetrated the attack.  So it was dangerous to be a Belgian national.  Caritas, who had organised the travel, had ensured that at the Rwandan border we would have a document indicating that we were 
Swiss nationals.

So who was at that roadblock, or those roadblocks?  Well, the information we had was not very reassuring.  There were people who were in a situation of disorder.  They had limited weapons or guns, clubs, rudimentary weapons, but people who seemed to be looking for people selecting -- making selections amongst those who were passing by the roadblocks.

Was that your question?  
Q.	Yes, that was the purport of my question.  It was to know whether you were able to cross the roadblocks without difficulties.  
A.	Yes, we had some escort, a small escort, but I was not aware of it at the beginning.  That escort had been negotiated for by Caritas.  It was negotiated by Mr. Paul Antheunissens.  So there was a vehicle with two or three soldiers, including Colonel François.  François was a soldier of the FAR.  That facilitated our crossing, but sometimes it was necessary to negotiate somehow.  It was not always easy to cross the roadblock.

Am I not going too fast for the interpreters?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
No.  That's -- we are comfortable with the pace. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, at those roadblocks, and you have described those who were present there, you said you passed with the help of an escort made up of FAR soldiers.  Did you observe those -- did you notice whether those who were crossing the roadblocks were under the control of soldiers?  Or did the soldiers also have to negotiate in order to cross the roadblocks? 
A.	They were not at all under the control of soldiers.  At some point in time it was easier to cross the roadblocks.  But on several occasions Colonel François had to negotiate. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, do you remember the name -- the surname of Colonel François? 
A.	No, I don't. 
Q.	If I were to suggest a surname, would that help?  I don't know whether this is the good approach in the common law, but I have a surname here.  There are several Françoises, and there are several Françoises who must be colonels as well, but there is one François Munyengango.  Is that -- does that ring a bell? 
A.	No, quite honestly, I do not remember.  But, yes, we'll keep François.  But I can look up that name, but I think Mr. Antheunissens himself can be able to find that name because he's the one who organised this. 
Q.	Very well, very well.  Now I would like to proceed without delving into the crux of that excursion, which took place during that mission.  Was that mission a unilateral arrangement by Caritas?  How did you become aware of the mission?  And how did you become part of it?  How did you participate in it? 
A.	Let me backtrack somewhat.  All of us here must be aware that from October 1993 the situation was particularly difficult in Burundi.  

Before the 21st of October 1993, that is before the coup d'état, all activities, I mean all usual activities, were interrupted, so much so that my cooperation mission was no longer operational.  The universities were closed.  Ministries were shut down.  Secondary schools were closed.  The entire school system was paralysed.

Then some humanitarian organisations, like the Red Cross and Caritas, and other organisations like the FAO, UNICEF and what have you, quickly got together to try to provide a humanitarian response to this situation.  We decided to attend their meetings in order to determine how we could make available our own resources, including human resources, as a contribution to the organisation of these humanitarian activities or actions.  

This was difficult.  The needs were enormous.  But we worked with UNICEF, with the FAO, with the Red Cross, UNICEF and with Caritas.  And it is within that context that we were able to find volunteers.  Volunteers who were not forced to, but who volunteered to do work other than their normal activities.  And that is how we put together a team to service those various activities.  And it is through these events in Burundi that we were able to contribute to the humanitarian actions.

Now, when things happened in Burundi after the 6th of April, my first concern, as I have already mentioned, was to ensure at the time of those events, and I'm referring to the events in 
Rwanda -- correction.  My first -- correction -- rather, my first concern, as I said, was to ensure that the families under my responsibility were safe and secure.

When the orders were given to evacuate by all possible means, we proceeded to do so, and I was hoping that we would be able to be part of the humanitarian action as soon as things allowed such participation.  So the mission had as its objective to quickly determine what nature or manner of contribution we could make.

Does that answer your question, Counsel?  
Q.	It is a very broad answer.  But let me put another question to you about political developments in Rwanda.  Did you at any point in time become aware whether or not a government was set up; and if so, on what date? 
A.	Well, as you may easily imagine, I closely monitored developments, general developments and 
	political developments in particular.  

Around the 8th or 9th of April -- and as we continued to monitor the situation, we had learnt that the interim government was going to be set up, that fighting had continued, so you must be aware too that on the 16th of April arrangements for a national burial for the president of the republic had been organised in Bujumbura.

On that occasion there were several foreign delegations in attendance, including the 
minister of foreign affairs who had been recently appointed in Rwanda, and I'm referring to 
Jérôme Bicamumpaka.  

I met him at the funeral and the attendant reception.  I did not know him very well, but I had met him previously in Kigali during the summer of 1993.  We actually shared lunch with him, to be more specific.  So we had lunch, and during that lunch I put a number of questions to him about the situation.
Well, you know that at such receptions it is very, very difficult to -- rather, during the funeral I -- I asked him whether he would be in town the day after, that is, on the 17th of April.  And I invited him to my home for a more in-depth conversation to deal specifically with those humanitarian issues at that time.  

So that was the first contact that I had with a member of the interim government. 
Q.	On that 16th of April had you received any instructions from your supervisory authorities to have dialogues with members of the interim government, or had you suspended any contact with the 
	interim government? 
A.	The interim government had just been formed, I believe, on the 9th or the 10th.  I heard various interpretations or assessments of the setting up of that interim government, but we did not have any specific instructions by the 16th of April regarding that interim government, at least not to my knowledge. 
Q.	When you received the minister of foreign affairs, did he ask you whether it was possible to contact Belgian authorities, and did you allow him to do so? 
A.	That is a very good question, which must be answered with several shades of meaning.  Let me remind you of the complexity of our country.  It is the Belgian ambassador who deals with foreign affairs through the ministry of foreign affairs and government, so that was outside the scope of my attributions.

And by the way, that was not my concern at the time.  I was concerned about understanding what was unfolding on the ground in relation to the people or to the population.  

When Mr. Bicamumpaka was at my residence -- and there is evidence of that in the transcripts of this Tribunal because I had already testified about those specific events -- he asked me to contact a 
number of persons whom he knew, particularly Mr. Alain De Brouwer.  I did not hesitate to offer him an opportunity to call him, because I had his telephone number, so he was able to call Alain De Brouwer from my home.  Furthermore, he told me about the problems he had getting in contact with a 
number of countries, including Belgium.  

Now, while I told him this was not a matter within my purview, I, however, proceeded to contact my authorities to inform them about the request he had made in relation to the community government which I was answerable to.

So during the morning I was able to contact my minister and report promptly to him about the situation.  And it was for him to decide whether or not to contact the minister of foreign affairs of Belgium or other authorities in our country.  

My concern was consistently within the framework of my competence and in collaboration with my supervisory authorities to engage in humanitarian work at that time. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, when you travelled in May with Caritas International, were those trips organised by 
	Caritas International at its own initiative or at the behest of the interim government? 
A.	The goal sought by Caritas was to use its Catholic network, which was quite elaborate, on the ground at the time to facilitate transportation for humanitarian purposes.  

Mr. Antheunissens told me that the interim government had asked Caritas to make a contribution.  What Caritas asked for, against its contribution, was that the humanitarian transportation facilities be provided safe passage to their various destinations.  Some of the appointments that Caritas had made within that context was to meet the government, and specifically the prime minister of Rwanda. 
Q.	Before you travelled in the month of May, within the context of that specific mission, did you meet Minister Habineza, a minister of the interim government?
A.	Yes, he was the minister of social affairs in the interim government. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us in which context you met him and what discussions you had with him and whether there were any other persons in attendance? 
A.	Well, thank you for raising that question about that meeting.  

On the 30th of April, Mr. Antheunissens received the minister of social affairs and Mr. Bicamumpaka at his office.  

Following that meeting, which I did not attend, he called me on the phone and suggested that I spare a few minutes of my time to meet him to discuss prospects about what could be done.

On that very day the boss -- the big boss of Caritas International was to arrive in Bujumbura, so I suggested to Mr. Antheunissens that we meet in the evening because I was not available during the day.  I suggested that we share the evening meal at my residence with the international boss and the minister.  And that was how we got to meet. 
Q.	Can you give us the name of the boss of Caritas International? 
A.	Yes, but I might not be able to spell it.  His name is de Mare -- de Mare -- de Mare -- small D-E -- and then maybe Antheunissens can spell for us -- M-A-R-E.  D-E-M-A-R-E, something like that. 
Q.	What is his nationality? 
A.	Belgian. 
Q.	So you met the two ministers, or was it just one minister? 
A.	One minister, the minister of social affairs. 
Q.	Now, briefly, what did you discuss and what conclusions did you come to during that meeting?  Please, proceed.  
A.	Thank you.  The Caritas officials on that occasion recalled that it was necessary for assistance to be brought to Rwanda -- to be channelled to Rwanda and it was necessary for that to be made possible.  

And so there was also need to be reassured that the interim government will facilitate such an operation.  And as far as I can recall, there was also talk about bringing pressure to bear and to do everything possible to stop the killings that had been the subject of discussions on a daily basis.  So that, in broad strokes, is what was discussed.  

Now, as for the menu of the day, I'm not able to tell you because I have forgotten what it was. 
Q.	No problem, Witness.  The menu, you might be able to provide it otherwise.

Now, the request for organising the humanitarian assistance came from the interim government through the minister of social affairs, Jean Habineza, and was made during that dinner; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is how the issue was discussed.  But Mr. Antheunissens had also already had contacts -- and I'll wait for interpretation.  Let me repeat, that is the manner in which the issue was raised during our discussions.  But Mr. Antheunissens had already had prior contacts with members of the government.  No, rather, it's the other way around.  Correction.  Mr. Antheunissens had scheduled a meeting or a trip between the 30th of April.  And we went on that trip together.  And it was during that visit by the minister of social affairs that we made plans for Mr. Antheunissens to travel to Gitarama in order to meet government officials and push forward as quickly as possible any matters for a number of measures to be implemented. 
Q.	Now, let us talk about the mission of the 16th or 17th May, is that the date? 
A.	Rather, 15th, 16th and 17th of May. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Q.	Can you tell the Court how that mission was conducted, and focus specifically on aspects that involved you.  

Now, if we start on the 15th, could you tell us who was part of the delegation that travelled to Rwanda? 
A.	The head of that mission was the leader of Caritas, Mr. Antheunissens.  We accompanied him.  Dr. Rupoll, I recall, was the chief medical officer at the Belgian embassy.  And I was also part of that mission.  

Now to understand how we could make a contribution to that operation, we needed to find out how and also see for ourselves how things were happening on the ground.  So the answer is that it was at the initiative of Caritas, yes. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, maybe you don't want to give us all the details of your trip of the 15th, but I would like you to tell us at what time you left Bujumbura, what obstacles you ran into and how you overcame them, and as you have already mentioned there were some roadblocks.  But just give us a picture of -- of how things unfolded. 
A.	Well, I will not revisit the issue of roadblocks.  I have already dealt with that.  But one of the objectives of the mission was to visit the camps of these displaced persons and to see how things were happening there.  

So we went to the crater in Kigali and saw a number of refugees.  Dr. Rupoll was able to meet his counterpart.  The minister of health of the country who was -- who had already been part of the 
interim government.  We had -- we also had contact with the prime minister and other persons whom I'm no longer able to identify because there was a lot of interaction here and there at various offices and in the location where the meeting took place at the technical school.  

In general terms, because I do not have any minutes of the discussions here, although those minutes are available, what was discussed in broad strokes was to try to understand what the 
interim government was able to control, how it would be able to act in order to provide security for our operations.  

These were concerns that all three of us expressed, particularly with regard to the stopping of the killings because we were all frightened by -- by the horrible things that were being said.  

So my feeling at that time was that the government was not efficient, very poorly organised, and that it did not have much power or control over the events. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, your meeting with members of the interim government, where did it take place and in which city? 
A.	In Gitarama. 
Q.	In which city in Gitarama?  In what specific location in Gitarama was the interim government located? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's answer was inaudible, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Do you remember the name of the minister of health? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Murambi".  Maybe it is not for me to answer on behalf of the witness, but that is what he said.  I would simply ask him to confirm.

THE WITNESS:
That is what I said.  Murambi is the name I mentioned. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Did you meet the prime minister on that occasion? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The identity of the prime minister?
A.	Kambanda.  
Q.	How long did the meeting last?
A.	Half an hour, more or less. 
Q.	What did you discuss and what measures were taken to facilitate your actions or activities? 
A.	I don't have a specific or conclusive answer to your question.  Maybe Mr. Antheunissens could have more to provide.  But the -- there were some improvements at the displaced persons camps which we visited.  

By the way, it would not have been possible to stop any of us from saying that government had to do everything to stop the killings with the assistance of the army, with the assistance of the regular 
armed forces.  So we had the impression that we had listened -- we had been listened to and that our message had been understood, hopefully.  But then you know what happened thereafter. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Now, Mr. President -- Mr. President, I look at the clock and maybe this is a good time for the 
lunch break.  

When we resume I would not need much more time, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  We'll take our luncheon adjournment now.
(Court adjourned at 1235H)
(Pages 28 to 37 by Melissa Hook)











(Court resumed at 1400H) 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon to everyone.  
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Ghiste.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	I hope you have recovered or rested.  We will proceed with our work.  

Could you tell me, when you went to the camps in May 1994, whether the refugees you found there and to whom you lent assistance were solely Tutsi refugees or whether you had another assessment of the situation.  
A.	On the hills of Kigali, I remember that it was a camp where there were Tutsi as well as Hutu.  However, in Gitarama, when we saw the refugees who were at the diocese, they were seemingly, basically, and solely Tutsi. 
Q.	Can we say that your intervention helped in providing assistance to the population that was in distress irrespective of their ethnicity? 
A.	It was obviously our sole goal, namely, to lend assistance to the best of our resources -- and modest resources for that matter -- the entire population that was in disarray at the time or that was on the move. 
Q.	Can we take it that the interim government, therefore, wished the resumption of humanitarian assistance for the benefit of the displaced population? 
A.	From the three members of government I met -- firstly, Jérôme Bicamumpaka, then the minister of social affairs and the prime minister -- what I saw was their resolve was along those lines. 
Q.	And once you got on the ground, is it possible for you today to say what impediments, real impediments that stood in the way of the government to provide assistance beyond the fact that all international humanitarian bodies and perhaps national bodies had withdrawn?  What was the concrete problem or difficulty which you encountered as you tried to distribute the assistance? 
A.	The first course seems to me at the time to be the disorganisation.  Lack of resources, lack of real oversight, lack of coordination, as well as the lack of external support.  For some time there were some initiatives which I will call virtually personal initiatives.  These were persons who tried to implement actions at the personal level, and we got to hear about it from Bujumbura.  

But as you stated, the global pullout and the lack of the response from the international community, I believe it must be said in no uncertain terms that it did not favour the provision of concrete assistance.  And I had the distinct feeling that the country was indeed abandoned. 
Q.	In your work as a diplomat, were you informed of efforts deployed by the interim government to secure a ceasefire with the RPF? 
A.	There were basically individual accounts that were my sources of information, and that was voiced in the course of our meetings with members of government.  But it was also voiced through -- or during the evening of 15th of May when we were invited for dinner at Kabgayi with the authorities of the diocese who had made some radio statements as their own contribution to the end of those killings.  And you know what happened subsequently a few days later after we had passed by. 

Be that as it may, there was a resolve to protect the Tutsi population.  It was obvious that there was a resolve to protect Tutsi refugees who were at the diocese.  And when I later learnt that everything was not as perfect as we had wished, there was indeed some effort made in that regard. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry to interrupt, but by my count, this is the third time that the witness has given a response to an answer with a tail or the tag that "we all know what happened afterwards", as if it's not worth providing that portion of his answer.  And, quite frankly, with regard to his last comment about the 15th of May, I don't know what the witness is referring to.  So if Ms. Hounkpatin could explore that with him and find out what he is referring to is something that we should all be aware of, that would be helpful.
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, do I take it that -- is it a question directed to me or to counsel?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, the question was directed to me.  

But, Learned Colleague, I believe that in the course of your cross-examination you would have an opportunity to seek further information.  I believed that the witness mentioned the murder or massacre of Tutsi refugees at Kabgayi after they had left.  That is not an answer I prompted.  To him it was a logical flow in his answer.  And if you find any problems with his answer, I do not quite understand 
the -- where you are heading to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think he was just asking for clarification.  The witness made a statement that "everybody knows what happened after", and he thought that that was an ambiguous statement because he wasn't sure what the witness was referring to.  So he suggested that you could prompt the witness to just explain what he thought everybody knew. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, therefore, could you avoid ellipses but state what was obvious.  
A.	The murder of the persons I had met, namely, priests who were at Kabgayi, that is what I believe is public knowledge, and that is why I did not find it necessary to emphasise the point. 

I believe that is the clarification you were looking for. 
Q.	Yes.  Mr. Ghiste, that is important because it is sometimes important to state the obvious, and that you have done. 

Now, if it is to your knowledge, could you tell the Court:  How were those killings perpetrated after you had left? 
A.	Well, it was acknowledged that it was a blunder by the RPF army.  It was stated, it was officially acknowledged as a blunder of some sections of the army. 
Q.	So you are indeed referring to killings committed by the RPF.  Whether they were blunders or not, these killings were committed by the RPF, is that what you are telling the Court? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I heard at the time.  That is what was said in all the embassies, and that is what was on the news. 
Q.	Witness, let me backtrack somewhat.  Did you get to hear at the time radio broadcasts from members of the interim government for the purpose of ending the killings?  Did you hear them firsthand?  Or did you, as you explained in the course of your testimony, receive reports which bore that fact? 
A.	I heard nothing firsthand because I was not around at the time.  However, I clearly heard rebroadcasts of messages or portions of messages that had been sent through the media.  It was on the air.  It was public.  I believe everybody who was in Bujumbura, like myself, at the time was privy to such broadcasts. 
Q.	And to the best of your recollection, can you state the wordings of those messages? 
A.	No.  Obviously, I cannot give you a word-by-word recap.  But these were calls for calm. 
Q.	Mr. Ghiste, calls for calm do not mean clearly an end of killings.  Could you be more specific and more concrete?  
A.	I am not in a position to state word for word what was said, but I heard from the rebroadcast of those messages -- of some of those messages from which I gathered the resolve of the leaders or members of government to put an end to the killings in the various areas. 

But, please, do not ask me to name the areas because it's not very distinct in my recollection. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  Did you feel, on the basis of all these facts, that the government was in a position to exercise the duties for which it had been established? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question.  Could you kindly rephrase your question.  
Q.	Yes.  I would like to know if whether after you had left, and on the basis of all what you have just mentioned in your testimony, do you feel that the government was able to exercise the duties for which it had been established? 
A.	The answer is clearly no.  You are asking my view. 
Q.	Very well.  

How would you describe the prevailing situation in Rwanda at the time? 
A.	It was anarchy.  It was total disorder and with a total lack of authority. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Ghiste.  I am done with my examination, and I would like to thank you.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I am done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin. 

Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions for the witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
No, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecution.  

And I'll invite the Prosecutor to commence his questions. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon to everyone.  

And a good afternoon to you, in particular, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:  
Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, earlier this morning before we even took the luncheon recess, I had circulated a number of documents by email to the Defence and to the Trial Chamber coordinator, and I have hardcopies to make available to the Chamber through the registry now.  I have already given hardcopies to the Defence and to the interpreters. 

And then if Mr. Issa could assist me once more.  I didn't make enough copies of one particular document that may become necessary, but I have two French copies for the Defence team and then two English and one French for the Court.  

And I can put everyone's mind at ease by clarifying that I don't think I will get through all of these documents, even though the package seems substantial.  But I can't restrain myself from complaining once more that the will-say statement for this witness indicated lines of enquiry that weren't addressed, and his testimony included substantial testimony that we had no way to expect because it wasn't included in his previous trial testimony and it wasn't mentioned in the will-say.  But I don't see it as a problem now.  I will just move ahead.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were posted to Burundi starting on the 1st of December 1992; right? 
A.	That's correct, Counsel. 
Q.	And prior to that you had only made one or two trips to Rwanda, the first of which was in 1991.  
A.	Let me supplement by stating that, indeed, the official missions I had undertaken were in 1991 and 1992.  But in the course of 1992, I made many trips, especially in November and October 1992 in Rwanda and Burundi.  And these were very short visits or trips. 
Q.	So you would agree that your direct firsthand observations about Rwanda are limited to probably not more than a dozen or so trips of two or three days each over the course of 1991 to 1994.  Would that be an accurate summary of what you told us in your direct examination? 
A.	I'm sorry.  I did not quite understand the number of trips.  Could you kindly repeat the question.  
	Thank you. 
Q.	Actually, Mr. Witness, what I'll do is simply rephrase the question.  

You were posted to Burundi.  So Burundi was where you resided during your term of duty in the Great Lakes region; right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct, Counsel. 
Q.	But your responsibilities also included Rwanda.  And to be effective you made several trips to Rwanda during the period 1991 to 1994.  
A.	When I was posted permanently, that is, from the 1st of December 1992, I made many long trips and stays in Rwanda, and specifically the long stay I mentioned this morning with the work in the camp of displaced persons, which took place in July and August 1993. 
Q.	And your trips to Rwanda, even including this long trip that you are now referring to from mid-1993, were specifically in relation to cultural cooperation and cooperation in matters of education.  That was your expertise, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	In other words, all the duties of the Francophone community in Belgium entailed priority areas in education and training, generally speaking, in terms of support by the provision of staff in cultural matters, as you have stated, in audiovisual matters.  In various areas, which are quite many.  In health regarding prevention.  And the areas go way beyond what you have mentioned, but you have already stated that those were the areas that we covered predominantly at the time.  That was just part of my duties. 

The other part of my duties, as I did explain this morning, had a diplomatic coverage, namely, official representation of French-speaking Belgians.  So there were two missions in Rwanda, namely, the diplomatic representation of Belgium. 
Q.	Well, thank you for your explanation, Mr. Witness.  But what I would like to suggest to you is that your work was not that of a political analyst.  I don't get a sense that you were trained in political analysis.  And even though you characterise yourself as a diplomat, your diplomacy really dealt with matters of education and culture and audiovisual documentation and things of that nature.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	I fully agree, Counsel.  I have never mentioned that I was a political expert, for that matter.  That said, my political duties toward my authorities was to keep them apprised of the political situation of the countries falling under my coverage. 
Q.	But can we agree that making periodic missions to Rwanda, which may have been as many as two or three days a month over a period of one and a half years, is not a very broad basis from which to make conclusion or draw conclusions about Rwanda's political development? 
A.	I find your question restrictive, Counsel, because -- and, first and foremost, I was -- I did not stay for 
	two or three days over a period of three months.  These were trips that were highly variable which sometimes lasted one week, sometimes longer.  

And, furthermore, regarding my knowledge and my observation of developments in the country, it was generally related to our embassy in Rwanda and the various officials I met, namely, members of government with whom I had cooperation ties. 
Q.	But there were other members of the diplomatic corps of your country that were more specifically tasked with following political developments in Rwanda, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	I absolutely agree.  That was their duty.  Perhaps I answered too fast. 
Q.	Based on my readings of the Rwandan conflict, in addition to the testimony of witnesses and document in this trial, it would appear to me that the international community was not very well informed and was not very well prepared to deal with the Rwandan conflict.  And here I am talking about the war and genocide in Rwanda in 1994.  Would you agree with that very general statement? 
A.	If I have to answer generally, I would say that my feeling from that standpoint is dual.  I think the international community was following closely what was happening in that sub-region and in particular in Rwanda.  The international community in general encouraged the Arusha Accords. 

I would further say that the management, as you say, the management of what happened in 1994, is perhaps what lacked appropriate adaptation to the situation. 
Q.	Well, would you agree with the statement that there was a lack of responsiveness to the Rwandan crisis?  And when I say the crisis, I'm talking about what transpired after the 6th of April 1994.  And that the lack of responsiveness from Belgium and France and the US was because they did not fully understand or appreciate the complexity of the problem? 
A.	Regarding the complexity of the problem, certainly.  

But regarding the second part of your question, were they armed?  Were they prepared, from the political point of view, to anticipate -- to foster a prevention?  I believe that is the meaning of your question, Counsel.  Am I correct?  
Q.	In part, Mr. Witness.  What I'm trying to suggest to you is that you were the man on the ground, and based on your direct evidence this morning, you seem to be suggesting to the Court that you understood the situation on the ground and you reported it to your country, which was your responsibility as a diplomat.  And what I find a bit curious or problematic is that there were people who were better trained and more directly tasked with observing the political situation, and they had problems appreciating its complexity.  So why should your testimony or your opinion on these matters carry much weight?  

You weren't a political analyst.  It was not your responsibility to monitor the political situation.  Those that had that responsibility didn't do a very thorough job.  Why is your testimony on these issues of value? 
A.	You know the famous saying, Counsel, "Do not hope to act." 
Q.	Maybe you can repeat it again.  I will listen to it in French.  I didn't quite understand the translation.  If you could just kindly repeat what you just said one more time.  
A.	Yes.  It is a saying which I was referring to, and it is that it is not necessary to hope in order to do anything.  What I mean by that is that I was fully alive to the inadequacies.  I did not have to make any political decision.  And my influence, as you rightly pointed out -- well, first of all, I was somebody on the ground.  Therefore, I did not have a responsibility which -- apart from the information which I could forward to my superiors -- my community superiors and my diplomatic superiors -- that information which I transmitted did not have sufficient weight to change their views and enable them to take decisions which in my view were more worthy of the international community. 

I do not know whether I am sufficiently clear or whether you would seek further clarification.  Please be kind enough to specify exactly what you expect to hear from me. 
Q.	We have your response, Mr. Witness.  And I am satisfied with your response.  I'll just move forward. 

But isn't your testimony before this Chamber today intended to convince the Court that, from your position on the ground in Burundi, you had a clear grasp of what was going on in Rwanda, and specifically what was going on with Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Certainly not.  Certainly not, because I cannot claim to have an analysis, as you said a while ago.  I cannot claim to have a complete analysis of the complete situation.  

On the contrary, I underscored the complexity, the difficulties with which the situation was fraught.  And I emphasised that point.  I said humbly that I tried, together with other partners, to devise solutions, modest, limited solutions.  But, in any case, I made an attempt to do something.  I tried not to remain inactive, passive.

1445H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And what about your testimony concerning Mathieu Ngirumpatse in particular?  Isn't the purpose of your testimony before this Chamber to exonerate him for the killings that took place in 1994? 
A.	As I mentioned to the Defence on several occasions -- and the Defence perfectly is aware how much they had to insist for me to come -- I said that I would come on condition that I would say what I saw, what I know, and nothing more.  What I do not know I do not say it.  

Therefore, my purpose here as a witness is to contribute at my level as much as I can to shedding the light that you request of me within the limits of my ability and nothing more than that. 
Q.	So if we go back to your testimony about meeting Mathieu Ngirumpatse for dinner along with Alain De Brouwer back on the 17th of August 1993 -- I think you gave us the specific date of your dinner meeting.  You told us that you knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse was in favour of the Arusha Accords because of your conversation at dinner back in August of 1993.  Reflecting now on all of the disappointments with the implementation of the broad-based transitional institutions in January, February, and March of 1994, do you really think a dinner conversation right after the Arusha Accords were signed is sufficient basis to try to convince this Court that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was in favour of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	That is for the Chamber to decide.  I'm not here for that.  But I will endeavour to be more complete in my answer, Counsel.  

I gave you the context, the precise context, of the meetings I had.  Moreover, I also told you that other people, other officials, in particular of the Belgian embassies, spoke to me about the political landscape in Rwanda, the political conditions in Rwanda.  

And I'm not here to exonerate anyone whatsoever regarding what I do not know.  All I said, Counsel, is what I heard.  What I do not remember I do not say it.  I do not testify to it.  I'm also testifying to what I was told. 
Q.	Well, if we look at this issue of context, your conversation took place in August 1993, which was before there was a split in the MRND party -- in the MDR party -- excuse me -- before the split became formalised or public or apparent, in October or July of 1993; right? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then there was the split in the PL party that really didn't become a big issue, at least in terms of implementing the broad-based transitional institutions, until late 1993 and the beginning of 1994.  That too is true, isn't it, the conflict between Landouald Ndasingwa and Justin Mugenzi for leadership of the PL?  Wasn't that something that really came to a head at the very beginning of 1994 or tail end of 1993? 
A.	I believe a while ago I clearly said that I was here in the month of July as well as the month of August and that, moreover, I had to give a green light to the broadcast (sic) right up to the 
	last moment.  Therefore, I had to have very precise information on the risk of instability, the risk of insecurity in the country.  

And I can tell you that, as regards the MDR that you made reference to, everything happened during that period.  I mean the split.  I mean internal difficulties.  And my interlocutor -- I mentioned him at length this morning -- was, in particular, an important person, who at the time I started my minister the -- he was the minister of primary and secondary education.  A few days subsequently that person became prime minister.  Therefore, I was, rather, to some extent aware of the political situation at that time.  

As concerns the PL there were many rumours that circulated.  There were not only rumours.  The various chancelleries -- chanceries (sic) had information.  It was not for me to verify such information.  The various embassies had information.  But I was not totally unaware of the political situation in Rwanda, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, thank you, Mr. Witness.  I appreciate that.  But I'm referring to your assessment of Mr. Ngirumpatse, because you told us your assessment was based on your conversation with him in August of 1993 during a dinner meeting that you had on the 17th of August.  And what I'm suggesting to you is that the political developments after that were really what were of significance in order to make the statement that you did that Ngirumpatse favoured the Arusha Accords.  

Did you speak directly with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in January of 1994 or February of 1994?  
A.	Not at all.  I have said so.  I spoke to him only once. 
Q.	And given your appreciation of the political situation, generally speaking, as you've just described it, don't you think that the political developments after August of 1993 would have a bearing on whether Ngirumpatse supported the Arusha Accords in January of 1994 when the parties had to actually assemble a government? 
A.	Like other observers, I followed the situation and had regular information -- I repeat -- information particularly from our embassy.  

I know that the situation was difficult.  I know that there were divergent declarations.  But when I talked to you about Mr. Ngirumpatse, I spoke to you about him in a very precise context or in very precise circumstances that prevailed in August 1993.  I did not make any reference to what happened subsequently.  
Q.	And that's the problem I -- and that's the problem I have with your testimony on that point, Mr. Witness, and that's what I'm trying to suggest to you, that your conversation with Ngirumpatse in August of 1993 means nothing in terms of whether or not he wanted the Arusha Accords to be implemented in January of 1994, because so much had changed politically between August of 1993 and January of 1994.  
A.	I understand that there were many changes during that period.  I also know that there were major difficulties.  There were assassinations in February.  

I also know that situation was not comfortable in the country, particularly at the time our minister of foreign affairs visited Rwanda, Mr. Willy Claes.  That was in the course of February 1994.  During that time I went to Kigali and there were many points of interrogation.  
Q.	Yes.  But those points of interrogation didn't concern Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Your conversation with him in August of 1993 is no basis or is not a very strong basis to suggest that he favoured the implementation of the broad-based transitional government in January 1994.  Can we agree? 
A.	I would say that in August 1993 the country succeeded in agreeing on the Arusha Accords on the negotiations which were difficult.  This is an outcome that was not negligible.  That was a stage which was attained.  

It happened that subsequently the situation became more difficult.  But that does not take away anything from what had already been done right up to the point of negotiations, the negotiations of 1993.  
Q.	All right.  I'll move on, Mr. Witness.  I think -- I think you understand the point that I'm making, and I think I understand the limitations in your response.  So we can move on to something else.  

If we look at the period after the 6th of April 1994, your direct personal observations about Rwanda are limited to the two missions that you took:  The first one on the 9th of April, where you got as far as Butare; and then the second one that you took from the 15th to the 17th of May, where you stopped off or spent some time in Murambi.  Other than those two occasions, you had no other direct experience of Rwanda; isn't that so?  
A.	During that period, as I said, I was supporting those who were working on our cooperation mission.  So that was my first responsibility.  

I did that visit in April.  I ended it on the 13th (sic) of April.  And I asked my superiors at the time:  "What do we do?"  

I made suggestions to the -- my superiors.  I said that it was now necessary for us to get ready to try, as we did the previous year in Burundi, to provide our support to various organisations, international organisations, which were ready to go forward in providing aid, assistance to the population.  

I believe that was my main concern.  And I think I told you that.  That objective -- 
Q.	Excuse me -- 
A.	Yes.  Please go ahead, Counsel. 
Q.	I'm -- I'm not trying to stop you from giving us information, but I just want to focus us a bit more.  

You mentioned the date the 13th of April.  Am I to understand you were in Rwanda from the 9th to the 13th of April 1994?  
A.	No.  I'm sorry.  No.  I went on the 9th of April, and I returned on the 9th of April.  
Q.	And you mentioned something about the 13th of April.  Was that -- did I mishear, or is that something that you included in your response? 
A.	The 16th of April, that was the funeral of President Ntaryamira in Bujumbura, and there I met the minister of foreign affairs who was representing the country at the time. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Because I'm trying to clarify through your -- your own voice, Mr. Witness, when you were, yourself, on the territory of Rwanda.  And what I understand is that on the 9th of April you made a one-day trip and you got as far as Butare, and then on the -- from the 15th to the 17th of May, you made another trip and you spent most of your time in Murambi.  Other than those two occasions, you had no other direct experience of Rwanda; right? 
A.	A brief clarification, Counsel.  On the 9th of April, I went there for the first time for one day.  I returned in May, in mid-May, between the 15th and the 17th of May.  

I did not limit myself in Murambi.  Quite the contrary, I only went through Murambi.  My objective was not to stay in Murambi.  My objective was to have an idea as clear as possible on the situation.  Therefore, I make it clear that it was between the 15th and the 17th of May and the 9th of April.  Apart from these dates I no longer returned to Rwanda. 
Q.	So we can agree that most of your information about Rwanda after the 6th of April 1994 comes to you from second-hand sources.  It's from other people, the people that you interacted with in Burundi.  You mentioned various ministers and refugees and NGO personnel.  Those are the persons that informed you about what was going on in Rwanda for the most part; isn't that true? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed.  Partially, those persons and entities.  And, once again, let me restate that I was permanently informed, apart from the media, by the embassy of Belgium in Burundi.  
Q.	And it would appear from your testimony this morning that one of your most significant informants about what was going on in Rwanda was the minister of foreign affairs, Jérôme Bicamumpaka, the minister with the interim government, who you met on two occasions:  Once at the funeral for the Burundian president on the 16th and then the next day when you invited him to your home.  
A.	Rightly so.  Regarding Mr. Jérôme Bicamumpaka, I received him after the 16th whilst we were at the funeral with all the delegations, with the French (sic) authorities and foreign dignitaries.  And on that occasion I met in passing, as it is customary in such places, the minister of foreign affairs.  Since I wanted to have more detailed information on the situation, I invited him to come for breakfast the next morning at my home, and that is what happened. 
Q.	Well, when you met -- or when you invited Mr. Bicamumpaka to your home and in the course of your conversation with him, didn't you discuss with him your impressions of the interim government based on the information that you had received up to that time? 
A.	Obviously, Counsel.  But the concern -- and the main concern of Mr. Bicamumpaka was to get the country out of isolation and also to be able to have contacts, specifically in Belgium.  And he asked me while I was -- while he was at my home to call somebody -- telephone somebody he knew, and that I did.  And this person is Alain De Brouwer, whom I knew because I had met him on several occasions.  And through Mr. Alain De Brouwer, he took some contacts, I believe -- or made some contacts, and Mr. Alain De Brouwer briefed him comprehensively on all the contacts he had made on that occasion.  Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  We're going to get into that conversation in a few minutes.  But let me ask you this, Mr. Witness:  Wasn't it your impression on the 17th of April when you met with Bicamumpaka that the interim government was involved in the massacres, and didn't you ask him that?  And, in fact, didn't you tell him that you thought the interim government was responsible for the killings based on what you had heard up to that point? 
A.	Counsel, at that time a few days after the interim government was sworn in -- because that was on the 9th and the 10th that things were put in place -- he himself, as minister of foreign affairs, I believe, only took duty only a few days before he travelled to Bujumbura.  And we still had very little information in Bujumbura on the part -- or the duties of the interim government on its resources and its capability.  

And so all the information -- all the information regarding the interim government, information and rumours -- because both were always very related.  And the information came gradually.  And I heard on that day that the government was striving to organise itself to take control. 
Q.	Let me try and shorten my question, and then maybe that will assist you in answering it directly.  

Didn't you tell Bicamumpaka that the government was not doing enough to stop the killing?  
A.	Counsel, come on.  How do you want me to tell him that when I couldn't establish such allegations?  
Q.	You testified -- you testified in defence of Bicamumpaka back on the 28th of January 2008 in his trial, didn't you? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And don't you recall being asked questions of this nature back on the 28th of January 2008? 
A.	A lot was discussed about Mr. Bicamumpaka.  But it goes without saying that my testimony -- and I believe it's in your custody and you know exactly what I testified at the time.  And I do not think that I am saying something different today. 
Q.	Well, let's have a look at how you discussed these issues back in January of 2008.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
And here I'd refer the parties to excerpt number 2 in my bundle.  It's the witness's trial testimony on the 28th of January 2008.  It's from pages 15 to 22 in the English text and 16 to 23 in the French text. 

If Mr. Issa could hand up this excerpt to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And you spent a great deal of time discussing this before the other Trial Chamber.  I'm not suggesting to you that we can sum it up in one question and in one answer.  

But if we look at page 22 at line 7 in the English text, the question that's put to you is, "Did you tell him", him being Bicamumpaka, "that at least the government appeared not to have done enough to put an end to the massacres?"  

And your answer:  "Yes.  Undoubtedly." 

If we look at -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	It should be on the last page of the document, Mr. Witness.  You've got the French text.  It's on the 
	last page of the little excerpt that I've -- I've assembled.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So I'll put the question to you again.  Didn't you confront Bicamumpaka when he was dining with you in your home with your impression at the time that the interim government was responsible for the killings and not doing enough to stop them? 
A.	I think, Counsel, since this morning I haven't said anything different underscoring the power that that government seemingly wielded.  I had only questions.  I did not have any answers.  And there is no paradox in all of this.  It is consistent with what I have said.  And I may be emphatic if you want further details.  

And I believe that, Counsel, you understood correctly that my concern was obviously that one, although I was not a stakeholder who had to deal with those issues.  But going by -- if we had to do something, we couldn't act in that atmosphere of total insecurity.  And it was, therefore, a matter that was on the top of the mind of each and every observer who wanted to help the country at the time.  Don't you believe so?  
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you look through the -- the portion of the transcripts that I've given you, I think you'll agree with me that when you addressed this issue back in 2008 -- 
A.	Oui. 
Q.	-- your opinion, as you explained it to the Court, was that you didn't know why the interim government was powerless and you queried whether it was incompetence or lack of ability or whether they even had the intent that the killings should continue.  Yet today you're telling us that it was simply a matter of anarchy, which is quite different from what you were saying back in January of 2008.
A.	I did not need to cross-check the material -- I don't need to check the transcript of 2008, and I can tell you that it is consistent with my account today.  I mentioned incompetence and powerlessness are lingering questions because I do not have any answers.  I -- and I do -- still do not have such answers.  

And what I observed in the course of my trip of May to Rwanda was the fact that there was lack of organisation.  When I talk about anarchy, I'm talking about anarchy in the country where there was no authority and, seemingly, there was no real control over the situation.  

I did not see people, soldiers, or gendarmes handle a number of problems.  There were none.  At any rate, I did not see them.  I am not saying something different.  I might be using different words today, but that's it.  Anarchy in my -- to my mind is still consistent with what I testified to at that time.  

I hope I'm not going too fast for the interpreters.

1515H
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, let's look at this excerpt.  And if we could start on the first page, there's a portion where I've highlighted to make it easier for you to find, in the middle of page 15 in the English text, in the middle of the first page in your French text, where you ask yourself:  "Did the government have the means to enforce government policy?"  Your answer to yourself:  "I obviously have no opinion to express on that subject." 

Then we go on, there's a question from Judge Short because you talk about the inactivity of the government.  And Judge Short comments to you on the bottom of page 16 in the English text:  "In other words, you are saying that you were concerned about the massacres and the fact that the massacres were not being stopped but were in fact being exacerbated.  And in that context -- is it in that context that you said the rumours in the reports that you were getting indicated that the government was being inactive in dealing with that situation.  Am I correct in understanding your testimony about the context in which you used the word 'inactive'?"  And your response, Mr. Witness:  "Indeed, I think you have properly interpreted my thoughts."  

Aren't you saying here that it was the government's inactivity, which was deliberate, which was leading to an exacerbation of the massacres?  
A.	Counsel, are you now going to put words in my mouth?  It is true that there are some -- so many question marks.  But powerlessness, it was obvious that the government was powerless.  Why was the government powerless?  I do not know if any study has been made so far about that.  But the question still stands. 
Q.	Then you're asked about -- and this is a Defence counsel that is examining you:  "Did you hear of any broadcast made by interim government members calling for an end to the killings?"  

And your response at the bottom of page 17 -- the question is put to you on the broadcast:  "Did they not come to your attention?"  Your answer:  "No.  I did not hear them myself."  

Didn't you tell us this morning that you heard broadcasts of the interim government ministers calling for an end of the massacres? 
A.	I said specifically -- and that can be found in the transcript of my testimony of this morning -- that I heard extracts, and that, furthermore, I heard about it being said.  And those are the two points I made.  And this morning I repeated that I never heard directly those messages. 
Q.	If we do go to the bottom of page 18 in the English text.  And all of this is -- is marked, I believe, in the corresponding French text where the Defence attorney is picking up on Judge Short's question to you and asks you -- and here I'm paraphrasing because I don't want to have to read the entire thing -- that acknowledging all of the limitations and difficulties surrounding your sources, was it the impression you gained that the interim government was capable of activity but not exercising that capacity.

And your answer on the following page 19 at the top:  "I'm not going to give you my opinion, because I do not have any in this connection.  I don't even need to have an opinion.  What I'm saying simply is that the facts -- the information I just received as others received such information.  And from the information, indeed, one could have the feeling that there was some difficulty or incompetence or something else which I do not know with regard to implementing a number of actions which were necessary at the time for the country.  Don't ask me why.  I don't want to say something I don't know."  

Don't you think that the tone and the substance of your response back in January of 19 -- of 2008 is significantly different from what you told us this morning? 
A.	I have not been able to locate the French text you have mentioned. 
Q.	I don't think I've said anything that was incorrect, Mr. Witness, or else the Defence would clearly jump up and correct me.  So you can just listen to how I have phrased the question. 

But Mr. Gumpert is -- is picking up on Judge Short's question to you, and expanding upon it and you're refusing to express an opinion.  And what I'm suggesting to you is that's quite different to what you told us a while ago, which was that your opinion was that there was anarchy and incapacity on the part of the government.  
A.	I'm trying to locate the exact extract bearing my answer. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Counsel, if I can be of use to Mr. Ghiste, it is the transcript of your testimony of 28th January, and you turn to page 18, one-eight, line 4, where you have Mr. Gumpert's question:  "Are you there?"  "Yes", says the witness.  And the entire discussion is found in that paragraph up until the next page. 
THE WITNESS:  
So, Counsel, if you would allow me some time to read, I would give you an answer. 

So, Counsel, regarding the first part, I'm going to give a specific answer to a long question -- a short question. 

"The message is broadcast by the ministers, did you hear about them?  Did you hear them yourself?"  And my answer was: "No, I did not hear them myself."  And that is what I said this morning. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think you have read enough of your previous testimony to simply respond to my suggestion, that back in 2008 you wouldn't express an opinion about whether the government was capable of managing the situation or not.  Yet today you seem to suggest that there was chaos and the government was unable to respond. 

We can agree that those are two different responses; right? 
A.	Not at all, Counsel.  It's the same answer using different words, and I made a statement in the form of a question. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  The Chamber will have an opportunity to look with greater deliberation at what you said back in 2008 and compare it to today and will draw its own conclusions.  But I would like you to look at your page 21 in the French text at line 12, which in the English text is page 20 at line 1, where you're asked by another Defence attorney, again in relation to the interim government:  "Did it appear from where you were sitting that the information you had, contradictory as it was, that the government was trying to do the best it could to grapple with the problem of the massacres?"  

I understand there's a technical problem.  No?  Okay.  

So once again to you, Mr. Witness, you have found the portion, I have identified it to you by page and line; page 21 in the French text, line 12, page 20 in the English text, line 1.  
A.	Okay.  
Q.	"Did it appear from where you were sitting that the information you had, contradictory as it was, that the government was trying to do the best it could to grapple with the problem of the massacres."  And your answer:  "I never said that.  I know nothing about that."  
A.	Did I say something else today, Counsel?  
Q.	Well, my impression from your testimony this morning, Mr. Witness, was that you were suggesting that the government was incapable of responding, that the situation was so chaotic and the government was so disempowered that it was unable to respond.  And I'm suggesting to you that you didn't have quite the same opinion back in January 2008 when you were answering similar questions. 

But what I could do at this point is simply request that this portion of the transcript be offered in evidence, and then the Chamber at a later time can compare your two responses on the same question and draw its own conclusions.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Admitted in evidence. 
MR. MJUI:
That document will be P. 541.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
(Exhibit No. P. 541 admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, when you met with Bicamumpaka on the 17th -- 16th and the 17th of April, you didn't know anything about the note verbale that he had addressed to the international community on behalf of the interim government, did you? 
A.	No, I had no knowledge.  I only learnt about it on that day. 
Q.	But since the 17th of April 1994 you have become aware of its contents, if only because you were cross-examined on it extensively when you testified in Bicamumpaka's trial; right? 
A.	I didn't understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	You didn't know about the note verbale back on the 17th of April when you met Bicamumpaka, but since then you've become aware of it; right? 
A.	I was privy to an extract during my testimony. 
Q.	Your government, Belgium, was very much upset by that note verbale; wasn't it? 
A.	Obviously I cannot answer in the stead of my government. 
Q.	You were a diplomat representing your government in Rwanda in 1994 -- in Burundi.  And my question to you is about a note verbale that in the ordinary course of business should have come to your attention back in April of 1994.  

Now, if you're willing to say that you didn't know about it back then, you should at least be willing to tell us what the response of your government was.  
A.	I'm sorry, Counsel, but it is very hard to understand the structure of the Belgian federate -- federal government.  I did not have at the time access to all foreign affairs documents.  Therefore, it is logical that somehow I did not know about that document and that I did not have subsequent knowledge -- we did not receive information that landed directly at the embassy.  For instance, we received information subsequently, but we did not have the documents.  And I'm referring here to the representatives of French-speaking Belgium.  

Be that as it may, at the original and community level we did not have access to documents in the custody of the federal government.  And this is part of the misunderstanding that occurred subsequently after my trip to Rwanda. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I think you're extending the discussion on this particular point, because these are issues that you confronted in your examination back in January of 2008, and I can't believe that you don't recall this particular discussion in your examination back in 2008, much less if not from 1994 itself.  

Didn't Belgium refuse to grant audience to Bicamumpaka as minister of foreign affairs when he went to Belgium? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Didn't you know that back in 1994, that Bicamumpaka could not meet with anyone in Belgium because the Belgian government refused to even grant him audience?  
A.	It was not to my knowledge when it happened and I would not have been informed at all.  And less so on the 16th and 17th of April. 
Q.	I wasn't talking about the 16th and 17th of April, I was talking about during 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:  
But, in any case, Your Honour, I see the time.  Perhaps we can stop now and I will try to complete as -- as expeditiously as possible tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Webster. 

We'll take the adjournment now.
