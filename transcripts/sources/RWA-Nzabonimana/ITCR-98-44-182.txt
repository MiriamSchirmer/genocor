P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 14th of October 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera, et al, case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Appearances?  
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honour, Mr. Webster leads the Prosecution.  I appear, Iain Morley, to assist.  We are assisted, behind me, by Takeh Sendze, case manager.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For Karemera?  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I am Moussa Felix Sow, co-counsel for Mr. Karemera.  I'm assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva, and Dior Diagne, who is present in The Hague.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I am Frédéric Weyl, co-counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I am with Anita Guissé from the Paris Bar, who is our legal assistant, and Chantal Hounkpatin, who is in The Hague to observe the proceedings with the witness.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  Peter Robinson for Joseph Nzirorero.  I'm assisted by Leopold Nsengiyumva, Russell Hopkins and Gina Mensah-Datsa, who is copying the last of my exhibits and should arrive in a few minutes.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thought that we should start now.  The registry has made a test, and they think that all of the exhibits have been faxed into the same room with the witness, that it does not create any interference with our ability to proceed.  So we will proceed now.  

Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honour, Your Honour may recall yesterday that although the Prosecution closed its examination-in-chief, Your Honour very kindly allowed an opportunity to deal with the Petit Kigali video, and with Your Honours permission, that is what I propose to do with the witness, if we are on line to The Hague.  Thank you.

EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  My name is Ian Morley.  I'm assisting Mr. Rapp.  Mr. Rapp is not present today in court, and I'll be asking you some questions today about a video.  Do you understand?  
A.	Yes, sir, I do.  
Q.	In previous testimony, you mentioned that you have had an opportunity to see a video entitled Le Petit Kigali; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And you have also mentioned in previous testimony that that is the location which you have visited in 1994; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I went to that place in 1994. 
Q.	We are, in a few moments, about to show you three clips from what is a video which lasts about three hours.  Each clip will last about two minutes.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	At the end of each clip I will ask you some additional questions about what can be seen on the video.  Do you understand? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  We'll begin with the first clip, please, from what is marked as CD-ROM, part A, in relation to the Petit Kigali video at minute 5 minutes and 30 seconds.    
MR. MORLEY: 
	Thank you, Mr. Sendze. 
	(Video clip played) 
MR. MORLEY:
	Your Honour, we're going to try again.  The system was set up this morning.  Sometimes when we go on line to The Hague, because of buttons pushed in another part of the room, it affects the way the signal goes from Mr. Sendze's computer to Your Honour's video screen.  

If I can ask Mr. Sendze to go back to where we are going to start.  If I can also ask those in the audiovisual control booth, if you've been pressing any buttons, can you undo them so that we can go to show the video.  And I'm looking at the audiovisual booth to see whether or not anybody can give me a signal.  

Instead of a signal, everybody has run away.  I've got a signal.  
Mr. Sendze, could you start again, please.  
(Video clip played) 
MR. MORLEY:
This always happens.  I'm looking across the audiovisual booth to see whether they understand what the problem is.  Everything was up and running this morning.  
THE WITNESS:
I wish to know if we are in closed session or in open session.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour may recall that the closed session ended yesterday.  It was always proposed to play the Petit Kigali video in open session.  I'm assuming that we are in open session, so subject to Your Honour's views. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we are in open session.  We can confirm, Mr. Witness, that we are in open session.  
(Video clip played)
MR. SENDZE:
I'm sorry, I started from the wrong clip.   
(Video clip played) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	May I inquire, Witness, did you see the video clip which has just been played? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You will have noticed that there were a number of people in uniform.  Did you see those people in the early part of the clip? 
A.	Yes, I saw them. 
Q.	What sort of people were they?  Were they army, police, Interahamwe, what? 
A.	Looking at the video, I could see people from the army and the national gendarmerie, as well as civilians and Interahamwe. 
Q.	Is that a scene that you've encountered before, a mixture of army, police, civilians and Interahamwe, when you have been at the Petit Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  I was familiar with that type of scene where there were people from the army, civilians, Interahamwe. 
Q.	The clip then moved on to a section where there were some ladies reclining on beds.  Is that a scene that you've seen at the Petit Kigali before? 
A.	I went to Petit Kigali in 1994.  I did meet those women and I recognised, on one morning, two women.  One was the wife of the owner, and her sister.  That was in April 1994, when I saw them. 
Q.	From the presentation of the ladies who are lying about on the beds, can you help us with their ethnicity, please? 
A.	Those women were Tutsis. 
Q.	Can you help us, please, without wishing to embarrass you, what was their role at the Petit Kigali where the police, the army and the Interahamwe would assemble? 
A.	Could you please repeat that question, Mr. Prosecutor?  
Q.	Without wishing to embarrass you, what was the role of these Tutsi women who were at the Petit Kigali where the police and the army and the Interahamwe would assemble? 
A.	There were some Tutsi girls at the Petit Kigali.  They were brought in by Interahamwe to be protected.  They were being hidden, not in the Petit Kigali itself, but there was a building next door where the young brother of the owner lived.  There was a cellar in that building and that's where the girls lived and stayed.  Some of them had been there long before the 6th of April.  Others were brought to be protected after the 6th of April.  According to what some friends said, friends who visited the Petit Kigali, who spent the night there, according to what they said, some of those girls served as their wives. 
Q.	When you say that "some of those girls served as their wives," what does that mean, please? 
A.	I mean that it was not their legitimate wives, those girls they had brought from town.  They were Tutsis.  They brought them to hide them at the Petit Kigali and they used them to make love to them. 
Q.	What would have happened to them, do you think, if they hadn't been cooperative about becoming people's wives, as you put it? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to object to that.  It's speculation beyond this witness's knowledge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  We don't think the question, as you put it, is really permissible.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps I can put the question in this way.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	As Tutsi women during a period in Rwanda when many Tutsis were killed, why were they not killed? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  This witness doesn't know that.  It's calling for speculation, information outside his personal knowledge.  
MR. MORLEY:
We don't know that yet, and it may be apparent to the Tribunal that this is a witness who has familiarity with this location, and from his background has familiarity with what was taking place within the country and particularly within Kigali.  He's in a position to answer that question.  It's not speculation.  It's within his knowledge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
My problem is that I think you have to develop, you have to let him say -- he's used certain verbs already and your question is not consistent with the verbs he has used already.  So I think you have to let him develop his testimony. 

MR. MORLEY:
I'm moving on to other verbs, Your Honour; at least, I'm looking for other verbs. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm saying you're not cross-examining the witness; you're leading him in-chief. 
MR. MORLEY:
I haven't asked him a single leading question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I didn't say you asked a leading question.  I was -- you see, he said the girls were brought there to be protected, and I'm just saying that if you're going to lead on to try to get him to develop that further in a different way, you should not ask questions which appear to be cross-examining questions.  This is an examination-in-chief.  That's what I was driving at.  So you have to develop your issue a little bit more carefully.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry if it appears that I'm cross-examining with open questions.  I, perhaps, can ask this question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	What was the price of their protection? 
A.	The price to pay -- in fact, was that they weren't protected for nothing.  If they didn't give those who brought them there what they wanted, they would have been thrown outside and been exploited by the Interahamwe outside, or killed.  So those girls had to accept any request made of them by those who were protecting them. 
MR. MORLEY:
I hope that satisfies Your Honour and my learned friend Mr. Robinson.  With that said, we're going to move to the next clip.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, Witness, we're going to show another clip.  Before we do so, I'm going to turn to His Honour the Judge.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, the next clip, it occurs to me, as the result of something Mr. Webster has mentioned to me, ought to be in closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm assuming that this clip perhaps depicts someone who is going to be a witness here, and if that's the case, we have no objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we have to accept the discretion of the Prosecutor.  We move into -- now, the third clip, is it also going to be for open session or closed session?  
MR. MORLEY:
The third clip will be in open session and will conclude my questions, whereupon Mr. Robinson will begin his cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we go into closed session for the second clip. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 7 to 8] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 6 by Karen Holm)
































(Video clip played) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Witness, did you see that clip?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	At the beginning of the clip there was a young man at the back of a pickup truck.  Can you help us with, from the clip that you've just observed, what is it that happened to him, please? 
A.	That young man, it would seem he was Inyenzi, a soldier of the RPF who was captured in the city of Kigali and he was brought to the Petit Kigali for judgement.  I believe he was killed after being taken out somewhere.  And it was the people who were at Petit Kigali who said that there was a parcel for him, which meant that the man was dead. 
Q.	Can you help us, please, so that we understand the idiom.  What did it mean to suggest that you were giving someone a parcel?  What is the parcel referring to, please? 
A.	The plot is the place where he was executed. 
Q.	Did you hear anybody on the video saying that the young man had been given a parcel? 
A.	Yes, there was a major who I recognised, a major in the army, who said those words. 
Q.	Can you give us the name of that major, please? 
A.	That major was referred to as Morgan, but I think his name was Habyarimana. 
Q.	Remembering the faces of the people on the video, can you please tell us which person was Major Morgan?  Thank you.  
A.	Morgan was the man wearing a beret and in camouflage, and he was also dressed in camouflage.  He was in the gendarmerie and then he was in the Presidential Guard.  Then he worked in the area known as Kibungo as the area commander of that location. 
Q.	To assist Their Honours, there was a person who walked in the gate toward the end of the clip, in camouflage uniform, wearing a light-coloured beret, and the camera spent some time on his face and a number of soldiers saluted that person.  Do you remember the person I'm describing from the clip? 
A.	Yes, that is the same person known as Major Morgan. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honours' leave, that concludes the Petit Kigali clips and with that I'll sit down and Mr. Robinson will, no doubt, begin.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend Mr. Webster has helpfully reminded me that with regard to the Petit Kigali video -- I'm not quite sure what status it's in at the moment, but I would ask that the video, CDs A to D, so that's four CDs, be admitted before the registry, marked for identification.  Your Honour has seen some clips, and in due course the video will be produced by an investigator.  Alternatively -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was the ruling we made yesterday. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, that's what I'd thought Your Honour had said.  So perhaps I speak prematurely, but it may assist Mr. Webster and therefore I'm asking Mr. Fry whether that gets a "P" number or an "I" number.  
MR. FRY:
I believe it's "IP.", Your Honour. 
MR. MORLEY:
Could we have the number, please?  Is it IP. 1?  
MR. FRY:
I believe it's IP. 1, but I'll have to check with my assistant and inform the Court later. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well, that can be done later.  Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted for identification.  
(Exhibit No. IP. 2 for identification, admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Witness, your examination by the Prosecutor has been completed.  You will now be required to answer questions put by the representatives of the persons accused in this trial.  The first person who will be examining you will be the representative for Joseph Nzirorero, Mr. Robinson.  And he will now commence his inquiries.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  At this time I would ask the registry to distribute to the Prosecutor and the parties the copies of the exhibits that I'm going to be using during examination of this witness, and I believe I can begin my cross-examination now, and when I reach the first exhibit, we'll see if I have been received in The Hague and we can proceed. 

CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  So, Mr. Witness G, I say good morning to you, and my name is Peter Robinson.  I'm the lawyer for Mr. Nzirorero and I'm the person who's been making you take off your headphones for the last week. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The registry from -- the registry wishes to speak, Mr. President.  

MS. TALON:
We have indeed received the exhibits, but we have just received them so they need to be photocopied and the witness cannot have them as yet because we have not done with the photocopying as yet.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, could you inquire whether it is possible for that process to take place while Mr. Robinson commences his cross-examination?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I know that we're about to bring up the copies from our side in Arusha and I'm not sure if Ms. Talon could inform us whether we could make the copies while Mr. Robinson proceeds.  

Ms. Talon, do you hear me?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, if time is needed, could we have an estimate of how much time is required?  
MS. TALON:
That's all right.  We can have the -- it's okay, we have just received the documents.  So we are ready to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Talon.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if we could just let the people in The Hague know that they can distribute the documents to counsel or Mr. Lombardi, but they should just be given to the witness one by one at the time that they're presented.  They're not to be given to the witness before then.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Has the registry in The Hague heard Mr. Robinson's method of procedure?  
MS. TALON:
Yes.  Yes, Mr. President.  And there is a last part of the documents which will be ready in a few minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think we probably could start and see how we proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And good morning, Witness.  Can you hear me?  
A.	Good morning.  Yes, I can hear you. 
Q.	Okay I'm going to introduce myself to you again.  I'm Peter Robinson.  I'm the lawyer for Joseph Nzirorero.  As I said, I'm the person who's been making you take your headphones on and off for the last four days and hopefully we will not have too much of that process, but I have a number of questions I'm going to ask you.  And my first question is whether or not during the unique party system the MRND was a party that brought together everyone, Hutus, Tutsis and Twa.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when it became part of the multiparty area, is it true that the MRND continued this objective and it was a party that brought everyone together, Hutu, Tutsis and Twa?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And is it also true that between 1992 and 1994, the MRND did not change its objectives? 
A.	No, it changed. 
Q.	Between 1992 and 1994, was the MRND still a party that brought together the Hutus, Tutsis and Twa, although many Tutsis had preferred to move to the PL party? 
A.	I could say that in the MRND most Tutsis had joined the Liberal Party, but there were two, three or four still in the MRND. 
Q.	And is it true that the MRND did not change its objectives from 1992 to 1994 and in fact always maintained its objectives; that is, it was a party that brought together all of the ethnic groups? 
A.	Theoretically, it had the same objectives, but practically, and this was not written down in any document, there were categorical changes within the MRND. 
Q.	Now, directing your attention to November of 1991 at the time that the Interahamwe was formed, first of all, can you tell us what the word "Interahamwe" means? 
A.	Interahamwe means people who have the same objective, who walk with one step. 
Q.	Did it ever mean people who kill together or people who attack together? 
A.	No, that's not it. 
Q.	And when the Interahamwe was formed, was there any intention that anyone in this group would kill? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And when it was formed, did the people in the Interahamwe hold anti-Tutsi views? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, the first meetings of the Interahamwe took place in a building owned by (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And he was a wealthy businessman in Kigali who owned several properties, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you know his ethnicity? 
A.	He was Tutsi. 
Q.	And the person who was chosen to be president of the Interahamwe, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), you've told us his ethnicity was Tutsi as well, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And one of the councillors for the Interahamwe committee, (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal), do you know his ethnicity? 
A.	Sir, are we in open session or closed session?  
Q.	We're in open session.  
A.	Perhaps we should revisit whether or not we should say those names.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was just going to direct that the names should be put under seal and you should refer to the individual by number. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, number 11, do you know his ethnicity? 
A.	Number 11 was a Hutu. 
Q.	And number 2, was he married to a Tutsi woman? 
A.	Number 2, yes.  Yes. 
Q.	And numbers 4, 5 and 9 each had Tutsi mothers, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And each of these people were also professional, educated people, were they not? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	Most of them had university educations, correct? 
A.	That's true. 
Q.	And several had studied abroad, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, when the Interahamwe was formed, other parties had already formed their youth wings, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And these youth wings were threatening MRND members in order to get them to join other parties, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And these youth wings also resorted to violence on some occasions correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And they used what was known as kubahoza tactics, correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And could you tell the Trial Chamber what kubahoza means? 
A.	At that time kubahoza was a means of forcing somebody to leave the party they were a member of, to join your party. 
Q.	And in addition to forcing members of the MRND to join other parties, did the opposition parties also force officials like bourgmestres and conseillers who were members of the MRND to resign their posts so that the posts could be taken by members of the opposition party? 
A.	I don't believe it was in their power to do so.  Members of the opposition at times terrorised people who held those positions, but they did not have the right to remove anyone from their post. 
Q.	When the Interahamwe was first formed, the idea was presented by Desiré Murenzi, correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that Mr. Murenzi was a moderate, a very intelligent and professional individual, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was a person by the name of Anastase Gasana involved in the formation of the Interahamwe, to your knowledge? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, at the time the Interahamwe was formed in November 1991, can you tell me who was the chairman of the MRND in the préfecture of Kigali-ville? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And from your knowledge of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, he was a diplomat, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	He was intelligent, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	He was a very kind person, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	He was a talented musician and sung in choir groups, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you ever have any indication from Mathieu Ngirumpatse that he wanted to exterminate the Tutsis? 
A.	No. 
Q.	At the time, November 1991, when the Interahamwe was formed, who was the national chairman of the MRND? 
A.	Juvénal Habyarimana, who was chairman of the MRND and president of the republic. 
Q.	And President Habyarimana was in favour of unity among ethnic groups, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	He had many Tutsi friends himself, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as far as you know, he was never in favour of extermination of the Tutsis, correct? 
A.	To my knowledge, yes. 
Q.	And he never incited people to commit genocide, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, in fact, I had true, is it not, that the -- that the genocide would never have occurred if he had not been assassinated? 
A.	I can't tell you.  I was not the one who organised it and I didn't know what people's intentions were. 
Q.	Did you have any indication whatsoever when President Habyarimana was alive that he favoured people to commit genocide? 
A.	I told you that I cannot tell you what President Habyarimana thought.  The fact of the matter is, that when he was alive, there were killings of Tutsis. 
Q.	And were those killings of Tutsis killings that he favoured or had anything to do with, as far as you know? 
A.	For me, no. 
Q.	Now, in November of 1991 when the Interahamwe was formed, Mr. Nzirorero had nothing to do with that, correct? 
A.	I don't know what you mean by "involved."  The idea did not come from Murenzi, it came from the central committee of the MRND.  Murenzi was not the one who came up with the creation of the Interahamwe.  He worked with those people.  Nzirorero was one of them. 
Q.	And by the central committee of the MRND, you're speaking of the group of 55 people, five from each préfecture? 
A.	I don't know if I had two or 10, but I know at one point it was 10.  What I mean to say is that Murenzi was not the only one who had the idea.  There were others with him who made the decision. 
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorero was not secretary general of the MRND until July 1993, correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, the Interahamwe meetings, once the group was formed in November of 1991, took place on a weekly basis, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I think you told us that that was on Wednesday evenings; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you attend those meetings regularly? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you know a man named Ahmed Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	Can you please repeat that name for me?  
Q.	I'll spell it in case my Kinyarwanda is not very good.  The last name is M-B-O-N-Y-U-N-K-I-Z-A. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm rising to my feet at this stage.  I have no objection to the line of questioning.  I'm just wondering whether it should be in closed session.  We've just had reference to the Wednesday meetings and we're now dipping into a relationship with someone, and I'm inviting my learned friend and Your Honour to consider whether we are trespassing at this stage dangerously close to having to have material in closed session.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I assure you, Mr. President, we're not anywhere close to that.  If the witness would take off -- I could explain to you more if the witness wasn't listening, but if you would just bear with me, I don't think we're anywhere near a closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Continue for now. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness G, can you tell us, do you know a person named Ahmed Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And this is an individual who claims to have been the president of the JMRND for Kigali-ville préfecture during the period of December through May -- December of 1991 through May of 1992.  Does that refresh your memory or ring any -- does that help you tell us if you remember such a person? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was there an organisation known as JMRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, as far as you know? 
A.	The JMRND association was the JMRND Interahamwe. 
Q.	Was there ever another organisation simply known as JMRND that was comprised of other individuals who were not part of the Interahamwe? 
A.	To my knowledge, the MRND only had one youth wing, which was the JMRND Interahamwe za MRND. 
Q.	Now, I want to return to these weekly meetings on Wednesday evenings and ask you if at any meeting weekly meeting, Mathieu Ngirumpatse ever talked about exterminating Tutsi.  
A.	No. 
Q.	In fact, during this period, for example, February 1992, there was no talk of exterminating Tutsi by anyone at Interahamwe meetings, correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	There's no doubt about that, is there? 
A.	I don't understand how you can hold an Interahamwe meeting and talk about killings of Tutsis at a time when the chairman of the MRND himself was a Tutsi. 
Q.	And anyone who would claim that they were present at a meeting of the Interahamwe in February of 1992 and hear Mathieu Ngirumpatse talk about exterminating Tutsi would not be providing accurate information, correct? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm going to object to that question before the witness answers it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
The reason for the objection is two-fold.  Perhaps the witness might take his headphones off, please.  And can that be confirmed as having been done, please, in The Hague?  
MS. TALON:
Yes, it has been done.  Yes the witness has removed his headset. 
MR. MORLEY:
The first reason for the objection is that the context in which that question is being put, as it were, to use Mr. Robinson's frequent word "foundation," is not at all clear.  An answer from the witness, for example "no," that is to say, if the witness was to agree with Mr. Robinson, it may not reflect at all the context in which the evidence was given by the other witness.  So it amounts to potentially misleading testimony to get one witness to try to contradict another witness based on an incomplete understanding by the first witness of what it is that the second witness said.  And that's the second reason for the objection.  

It is generally -- I anticipate Your Honour is familiar with -- an unattractive approach to try and get witnesses to contradict one another, to put to a witness what one witness has said because of the difficulties of failing to put the entire context in testimony of the other witness, to try and attempt to get the second witness to contradict the first.  What Mr. Robinson can quite properly do, and no doubt has been doing, is establish, for example, Mr. Ngirumpatse did not say in a meeting in February of 1992 that the Tutsi should be exterminated, and it then becomes a matter of comment for Mr. Robinson later to address Your Honours on the consistencies or inconsistency on the part of the first witness.  

To attempt to get the first witness -- the second witness to contradict the first witness without the second witness having the entire context of the testimony of the first witness is an inappropriate what the way of questioning.  That is my respectful submission.

1130H
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  My question is -- I'm not asking whether the one witness is telling the truth or not; my question was whether that information that I presented to this witness in cross-examination was accurate, and that the witness can either say yes or no.  All I'm trying to do is cement, so that there is no wiggle room for the Prosecutor, the fact that this witness is positive that the meeting that I'm describing to him in my question did not occur in that manner, and I think I'm entitled to nail that down.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think you are entitled to nail it down, but we -- we also feel that the -- that there's a -- well, to use the phrase Mr. Morley used, that the idea of asking one witness just to comment on an extract from another witness's testimony, has problem for us.  So if you could find another way of addressing the question, it would be preferable.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay, if the witness could be asked to put the headphones back on, please.  
MS. TALON:
Yes, Mr. President.  The witness has his headphones on again.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, the proposition that Mathieu Ngirumpatse talked about exterminating Tutsis at a Wednesday night meeting of the Interahamwe in February 1992 simply never happened, as far as you are concerned, correct? 
A.	For me I didn't attend that meeting. 
Q.	Now, did you attend meetings of the Interahamwe Wednesday night membership on a regular basis? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And let's say, during February 1992, would you have attended all of the meetings during that month? 
A.	I cannot confirm that, but I attended many of those Wednesday night meetings. 
Q.	Was it likely that you attended at least three out of four meetings in a given month? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, during this period when the Interahamwe were having their Wednesday evening meetings, did a singer by the name of Simon Bikindi attend any of those meetings? 
A.	I know very well that Simon Bikindi attended some of the Wednesday meetings. 
Q.	And did this individual ever introduce a song that was "Let us exterminate them" at the Interahamwe meetings as a song to be sung by Interahamwe members in 1991 and 1992? 
A.	As far as I know, I never had to learn any of Simon Bikindi's song during any of the meetings. 
Q.	Now, do you know an individual named Gaspard Ukwizagar?  And I'll spell the last
	name: U-K-W-I-Z-A-G-A-R.  
A.	I know the person known as Gaspard Ukwizagar, but I never saw him attend any of the Interahamwe meetings. 
Q.	And did he or any of the individual -- well, did anyone at any Interahamwe meetings display an axe and offer to provide this axe in large numbers to the Interahamwe membership? 
A.	Truly, no. 
Q.	Was it necessary to undergo military training in 1992 before you could become a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	Was it necessary to undergo military training in 1992 before you could become a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No. 
Q.	In fact, there was no military training of Interahamwe in 1992, correct? 
A.	As far as I know, no. 
Q.	Was Désiré Murenzi ever replaced by Augustine Ngirabatware in his role with the national Interahamwe committee?  And Ngirabatware is spelt N-G-I-R-A-B-A-T-W-A-R-E? 
A.	Murenzi was never replaced by anyone. 
Q.	And, finally on this subject, did you ever hear of a plot to kill this individual, Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, by the Interahamwe? 
A.	I told you that I never knew this gentleman. 
Q.	Are you -- 
A.	I don't know how I can therefore answer your question. 
Q.	Well, I know you didn't know him personally, but I'm wondering if you ever heard that anybody from the Interahamwe or Mr. Ngirumpatse himself was trying to kill this Ahmed Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	I never heard of this name at any meeting. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I would like to ask us (sic) if we could take our morning break and then I'm going to have a brief motion to be heard the week before we continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, if it's not too inconvenient, it might be preferable if you make the motion so we could think about it during the break.  What we could do is ask the witness to remove his -- his headphone.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
If you'll just give me one minute to call up the rules in my computer. 

Okay, thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, at this time, based on the answers that you've now heard from Witness G that relates to the testimony that you heard from our first witness, Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, I'm going to ask that, Pursuant to Rule 91(B) that the Chamber direct an amicus curiae to investigate the matter whether there is sufficient grounds for instigating proceedings for false testimony against Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  

Rule 91(A) says that a Chamber, proprio moto, or at the request of a party, may warn a witness of the duty to tell the truth and the consequences that may result from a failure to do so.  (B) says that if the Chamber has strong grounds for believing that a witness has knowingly and willfully given false testimony, it may either, one, direct the Prosecutor to investigate the matter with the view towards and preparation of an indictment for false testimony; or, two, where the Prosecutor, in the view of the Chamber, has a conflict of interest with respect to the relevant conduct, direct the registrar to appoint an amicus curiae to investigate the matter and report back to the Chamber as to whether there are sufficient grounds for instigating proceedings for false testimony. 

Now, you've just heard from Witness G's testimony that directly contradicts the most serious allegations made by Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  And I tell you that that is just the tip of the iceberg.  There are in exhibit 40 names in -- which Mr. Mbonyunkiza said were present at these meetings in February 1992 when Mr. Ngirumpatse said they should exterminate the Tutsis; when Mr. Bikindi said they should sing the song; when the axes were presented by Gaspard; and when you had to go into membership -- military training before you became a member.  And I can represent to the Trial Chamber that there are now, at last count, 12 witnesses who are prepared to refute that account of Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  And I think that there are now serious grounds for believing that what you have heard over the first weeks of this trial is perjury, plain and simple.  And I'd ask that you order, pursuant to Rule 91(B)(ii), that an investigation commence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friend's motion is very premature.  We haven't finished the evidence or even the cross-examination of the witness to whom he refers.  There has been no evidence presented by my learned friend, either on a voir dire, or as part of the Defence case, to show direct contradiction.  The exact circumstance in which the present witness, G, contradicts the other witness, Mbonyunkiza, is not entirely clear.  That is to say, it is not established categorically that subsequently from what G says that Mbonyunkiza must be lying.  

There are all sorts of possibilities which exist as to why there may be a difference between the two men's testimonies, not least being that the timings are wrong.  It is my respectful submission that 
Mr. Robinson is understandably excited about the differences he seems to be trying to elicit from the witness.  That is the cut and thrust of cross-examination; that is what we are here for, but it doesn't automatically lead to applications to treat previous witnesses as perjurers, particularly when there's been no additional evidence pulled, and those previous witnesses have not even finished yet.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Is there any reply?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I don't have anything to add to my submissions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We'll -- we'll take a short break now.  
(Court recessed from 1148H to 1215H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, on resumption, Mr. -- can the witness remove his headphones again, please.  

Yes, we have a decision on the motion.  We can be as brief as the movers and rebutters of the motion. We deny the motion.  It's impossible for us to initiate the proceedings under Rule 91(B) every time there is a contradiction of testimony, and we think that the motion is premature and that other things need to be done before we could be justified in embarking upon this procedure.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

I would just ask my friends from the Prosecution to consider -- I know it's an instinct to lead to the Defence of a witness, but I would ask them to consider over the next period whether they would wish to withdraw this witness.  But I understand your ruling and would be prepared to go forward.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could the witness's headphones be put back on, please?

Mr. Witness, just as an explanation, a legal submission was made and we gave a ruling on it.  It was something -- sorry.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, just as an explanation.  A legal submission was made and we gave our ruling on it.  Under our normal rules of procedure, we -- it's not something which is necessary or desirable for the witness to be a party to.  But now we can proceed with your testimony.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness G, my next question to you concerns the same period from November 1991 through 
	May of 1992.  Was the principal job of the Interahamwe committee to support MRND rallies which were held?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did that involve arranging for transportation of MRND members to these rallies, as well as providing animation at the rallies? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you attend many rallies in Kigali of the MRND during the period November of 1991 through May of 1992? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you give us an approximate number -- I know it's impossible to recall exactly, but can you give us an approximate number of the rallies that you would have attended from the time the Interahamwe was formed until the time of the MRND congress at the end of April 1992? 
A.	I believe that I went to two rallies. 
Q.	And at either of these rallies, did you ever hear anyone call for the extermination of the Tutsis? 
A.	Do you mean of the MRND or of other parties?  
Q.	Of the MRND.  
A.	No. 
Q.	And, in fact, there were Tutsis who attended MRND rallies, people such as Claver Kamana, K-A-M-A-N-A; Jacques Rusirare, R-U-S-I-R-A-R-E, to name a few? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, did the Interahamwe also adopt the cloth or clothing of the MRND as its uniform? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was there anything militia-like or military-like about this uniform when it was adopted by the Interahamwe as its clothing? 
A.	No.  The uniform the Interahamwe wore was the MRND uniform. 
Q.	And other parties had uniforms as well, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'd ask if the registrar could bring me Exhibit ID. NZ2, which is the clothing that was previously shown to the first witness and given that designation.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, permission granted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I'm going to ask for help from the video technicians.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And since we are not together in the same room, I'm going to ask you -- I'm going to hold up, firstly, a shirt.  It's a small person's clothing and also the trousers.  And I'll ask you, Witness G, does this appear to be the clothing of the MRND which was worn by Interahamwe? 
A.	I told you that there was no difference between the Interahamwe uniform and the MRND one.  It was a party uniform and what I'm seeing from you looks like that uniform. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness G.  And the clothing that I have in front of me has an insignia and it says "1990, 7th congress" on one side, and on -- it also says -- I don't know if you'll be able to see this, but it says, "MRND 15th anniversary, 1975 to" and it cuts off.  So, does this, what I'm holding up, appear to you to be the same as what the Interahamwe were wearing? 
A.	What you -- what you are showing me looks like the uniform.  I don't know about the writing.  The uniform, I'd first say I think they were made abroad, but later on, they were made in Rwanda by a textile factory.  I'm not sure if the words on that uniform are the same that existed on the uniforms in -- later on in '93 or '94. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  And you remember we saw the videotape of the president's wife in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992.  Was she wearing what you understand to be the uniform of the MRND? 
A.	When I saw the video, to me, that was the MRND uniform. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, turning to the period in March of 1992, did you hear about some killings that had occurred in a place called Bugesera? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber where is Bugesera within Rwanda? 
A.	Bugesera is in Kigali-rural préfecture.  Perhaps it's east; at any rate, it's in the Kigali-rural region. 
Q.	And is it an area that -- how many kilometres from the centre of Kigali would that be? 
A.	About 50 or so kilometres. 
Q.	Were the Interahamwe involved at all in the killings in Bugesera? 
A.	I cannot confirm that.  As it turns out, however, people said that it was the Interahamwe who carried out the killings in Bugesera. 
Q.	Was that ever discussed among national committee members or at meetings of the Interahamwe to send Interahamwe to Bugesera to kill? 
A.	I was not aware of that. 
Q.	And, in fact, when you heard about these killings in Bugesera you were surprised, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And so, is it fair to say that to your knowledge, the Interahamwe were not involved in the killings in Bugesera? 
A.	To me, following the investigations conducted by the prosecutor's office, the prosecutor's office never concluded that the Interahamwe were involved in the massacres in Bugesera. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not, that other youth wings often tried to blame killings on Interahamwe? 
A.	With regard to that, I can tell you the following as I have been saying the past few days:  Every time something happened, parties would try to throw negative things on the backs of other parties.  But with regard to Bugesera specifically, I can talk about the prosecutor's office.  The prosecutor's office conducted investigation which was inconclusive. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Now, at this time, I would like to ask the people in The Hague to show you a document which is number 2 in the package which has been faxed to The Hague and at the every -- well, it has K number 0502772.  And I have extra copies if this -- if anyone in the courtroom has not received it from CMS this morning.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, do you have that document in front of you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Do you recognise it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And could you tell us what it is? 
A.	I believe that this is the first document drafted by the Interahamwe.  The subject of the document is "Faustin Twagiramungu."  He was president of foreign affairs for the party.  They say in the document that he is not capable of leading the MDR party because he was not able to manage the Steer company, his own company, and that he was seriously in debt, and that consequently he was not a credible person.  That's all. 
Q.	And do you recognise the signatures on this letter as being those of the executive committee of the Interahamwe -- excuse me, of being those of the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time, I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ5. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ5 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, we don't have a copy of this document in English and so we're going to go through it so that those of us who don't speak French can understand its content.  First of all, you told us the letter was addressed to Faustin Twagiramungu, and what party was he connected with? 
A.	He was from the MDR. 
Q.	And the letter begins with a -- something that's all in capital letters.  Can you read that for us? 
A.	"Do you believe that the acts of vandalism and violence that you praise will build your country in your place?"  
Q.	And then just skipping the next sentence but going on to the third paragraph beginning with the word that looks as -- looks like "revenant", can you read that paragraph, please? 
A.	"Getting back to your defamatory allegations with regard to the Interahamwe za MRND, which were vulgar, during your comments about the unfortunate events in Bugesera, press conference MDR, PL, PS of 9th March 1992, we should like to inform you that we have informed the prosecutor's office about your speech which was of a nature to incite unrest and bloody confrontations among political factions." 
Q.	And so from reading this paragraph, does it appear that Mr. Twagiramungu had had a press conference, perhaps with others, on the 9th of March 1992, at which he was blaming the Interahamwe for the Bugesera killings? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And this letter from the Interahamwe committee was reacting to that allegation, correct? 
A.	They were reacting to those allegations and also to what he had said when he said that they were going to attack the Interahamwe.  And what -- his gesture that day, he meant, in fact, they were going to cut their throats. 
Q.	And the letter describes the allegations about the Interahamwe's involvement in Bugesera as being defamatory.  And so, can we gather from that, that the members of the Interahamwe committee were denying that the Interahamwe were involved in the killings in Bugesera? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, the letter goes on to speak about Mr. Twagiramungu and his capability to manage the country or his party; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And just without taking the time to read the entire letter, I wonder if you could just summarise the remainder of that letter for us, give us -- give the Trial Chamber the gist of what is being said in this letter? 
A.	May I have a few minutes to read the letter again, because it's been a long time since I've seen it?  
Q.	Yes, certainly.  
A.	For the remainder of the letter, I can tell you that the Interahamwe committee were trying to show the population, and especially people from the MDR, that Faustin was not the best representative politician for that party.  And so they should be careful and get -- set him aside as quickly as possible, because he was director general of that company and the way he managed that led to its almost going bankrupt.  They are showing that when he was manager of an international transportation company, Steer, there were huge losses in 1985 and '86 when he was manager or director.  

As a result of all of that, they believed that this is not someone who should be given important responsibilities.  First, he is not a good manager; second, he evaded his -- paying his taxes.  He had a Mercedes Benz which had been licensed in Burundi.  He wanted to pass it off as a vehicle he didn't have to pay taxes to customs on.  So they are telling the population, "If you trust this person as the head of the MDR you must believe that he will ruin the country.  He is not a credible man." 
Q.	Thank you, Witness G.  And then turning to the last -- the second page of this document, the very -- underneath the signatures there is the postscript, and if you could read that postscript to us, please.  
A.	"Dear friend Faustin, to speak of your familiar language -- (no interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters are having difficulties.  We are having to look for a word in the text.  

Could the witness be asked to begin that from the beginning so that we can try and then render it in English.  It's a bit difficult; there are certain words which we do not have readily in our vocabulary.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, the interpreters didn't catch that, so I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to ask you to read that again.  So could you please do that?  
A.	"My dear friend Faustin, to use the language which is used between people who are familiar with themselves, you should be at -- ready when you depend on the good offices of our friend Said --"  and this is a code name for somebody in the RPF -- "when you make a report to him on the demonstrations of the 8th and of 15th January 1992.  The liquidity gap in the -- in the -- the failure of the head of the organisation of a said leader of the MR -- MDR that you are, would it justify a betrayal of your own country?"  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, maybe in future we could have better preparation if we're given the text in advance.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you very much for making the best efforts.  It's no problem.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	There is also one line at the bottom of this postscript that seems to read out "très bientôt Mr. NTAK", could you tell us what that refers to, Witness G? 
A.	I can't answer that question because I do not remember. 
Q.	And then in the text there is a name, code name, called S-A-I-D, what does that refer to? 
A.	Counsel, I no longer remember. 
Q.	In any event, was the gist of this that (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) were accusing Mr. Twagiramungu of being in collusion with the RPF? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did the RPF also infiltrate the territory of Rwanda and commit killings which they tried to blame on the Interahamwe? 
A.	I don't remember very well.  
(Pages 18 to 26 by Gifty C. Harding)





	1245H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, during this period were (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) under the impression that it was a tactic of the RPF to commit killings and blame them on the Interahamwe or the MRND? 
A.	You know that there was the war, which was provoked by the RPF in 1990 and which ended on the 30th of October.  And I think that around February or January 1992, the RPF attacked the north of the country and a lot of damage was created in the north, and all this was attributed to the RPF.  So all this were the gaffes, apparently, that the RPF was alleged to have been made up to April 199 -- '92. 
Q.	And returning to the subject of your letter and the -- what we spoke about earlier, the killings in Bugesera --
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  I know this is difficult for my learned friend, Mr. Robinson.  A little earlier I stood to my feet on the subject of closed session.  Three questions ago there was the use of the word (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) and unhappily, as I was patiently waiting for Mr. Robinson to notice me just a moment ago, we've had the repetition of the word (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal).  

Your Honour knows the sensitivity.  I would invite Your Honour to strike the word (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) from the question -- three questions ago and the question which just began a moment ago.  

Mr. Robinson will understand why I'm on my feet.  Can we, please, be careful. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is so ordered.

Mr. Registrar, that's -- that's clear enough.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, with respect to the events of Bugesera I'm going to read you a sentence and -- two sentences actually, and ask you to tell me if this is accurate as far as you're concerned. 

"Beginning with the March 1992 attacks in Bugesera, Interahamwe militia began to play a role as well as in leading civilians in the violence.  The skills they had developed for attacks on political opponents were now put in the service of attacking victims chosen on the basis of ethnicity."  

Is that accurate, as far as you're concerned? 
A.	I don't know how to answer you, but what I told you about what I knew about the Bugesera killings, I'm going by what was said by the Office of the Prosecutor, because it opened the file -- the case file, and the case wasn't finalised in terms of determining that it was, indeed, the Interahamwe that were involved in the Bugesera killings. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel please inform us as to where that quotation came from because we'd like to be efficient in our job?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  That quotation is from page 12 of the report of Alison Des Forges in the case of Bizimungu.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness, I want to ask you maybe a little bit more precisely about two elements of -- of that.  First, it's said that the Interahamwe played a role in the Bugesera attacks, and I understand that you're saying that as far as you're concerned, that's not true? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then it goes on to say that beginning in March of 1992, the Interahamwe now began attacking victims chosen on the basis of ethnicity.  And, I take it that that's not true as well, correct? 
A.	I don't have this document.  Please tell me what you have.  I don't have this document.  I haven't read it.  Please, don't ask me these questions. 
Q.	Well, let's forget about the document then, and I'll just ask you a question as to whether in March of 1992, the Interahamwe was engaged in ethnic killings?
A.	As far as I know, until March 1992, I didn't see anything the Interahamwe did in terms of attacking Tutsis. 
Q.	Now, I'd like to turn to the period in the end of April of 1992, when the MRND held its national congress.  Did you attend part of that congress? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were you aware of some of the resolutions which had been offered at that congress and adopted? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I'm going to ask now that you be shown the contents of Tab 230, which the Prosecutor had previously deposited in The Hague, and perhaps that could also be -- those of us in -- in Arusha can look at that as well.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. President, on the English version I'm going to be directing the witness's attention to page K0356692, resolution number 4, and try to find that in the French also.  On the French this will be on page K0356679. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, if you can find -- have someone find for you, out of Exhibit 230, page K0356679.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, at this time, Mr. President, I'm going to ask that -- whether the Prosecutor would agree that 
Exhibit 230 or Tab 230, the transcript of the hearing of the -- of the meeting of this national congress may be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ6. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, please.  Everything in these binders we want to get into evidence.  

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We only admit Tab 230 at this time.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could counsel kindly repeat the reference for the English version?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, the English is on page K0356692; and again the French, K0356679. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, there is also a video of the MRND national conference, and I would ask that that video be admitted as D. NZ7.  I'm not going to -- I was going to play it, but given the witness didn't attend, I think I'll just ask that it be admitted, and perhaps with other witnesses it can be played. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is one of the Prosecution exhibit numbers as well?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, it is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which one is that?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I believe it's also part of Tab 230. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, now the -- the documents that are Tab 230, are there three separate documents translated into three translations? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, there's Kinyarwanda, English and French within this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we have this as 230A, B, C. 
MR. ROBINSON:
6A, B and C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
230 -- sorry, 6, I do apologise, D. NZ6A, B, C.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ6A, D. NZ6B, and D. NZ6C admitted)

MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, should the video have the same number or should it have a separate number for clarification?
MR. ROBINSON:
It's up to you, but if you want to make it 6D, that would be okay.  But I think there's actually three videos -- three CD-ROMs in this set.  So I don't know whether that will confuse us even more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, what do you suggest?  Mr. Registrar.
MR. FRY:
Maybe we can keep everything under D. NZ6 with letters following for each different part.  That might be easier. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  

So ordered. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness, directing your attention to point 4, resolution number 4 of this MRND congress, is that familiar to you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And is that the resolution that authorised the expansion of the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes, it was during the congress of March or May 1992 that it was decided that the Interahamwe be established at préfecture and commune levels. 
Q.	So item number 4, which reads, "That the members of the national congress commend the founders of the Interahamwe organisation and requested that this organisation should be established in all préfectures and even communes and, if possible, affiliated to the MD -- MRND party."

Was that resolution adopted as far as you know? 
A.	I don't know how you want me to supplement what they decided.  You have read what they have said and I am sure you understand exactly what they wanted to say.
Q.	Yes, I -- I do understand, thank you very much, Witness G.  At the point of this transcript the resolution is being offered and I just want to know whether it's your understanding that the resolution was, in fact, adopted.
A.	I did say that after this congress there were Interahamwe established at préfecture level.  Before that congress, the Interahamwe were only in Kigali town. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  Then, if you could turn to number 15 of the resolution, which is on 
	page 356681 of the French, and 356694 of the English.   I'm going to read you the resolution. 

"The members of the national congress strongly condemned troublemakers and their allies who sowed divisions among Rwandans, as was the case in Bugesera, Magina, Kibilira, and elsewhere." 

Were you aware of the adoption of this resolution by the MRND national congress?  
A.	No, this is the first time I'm reading this. 
Q.	And now turning your attention to number 11, which is on page 356680 in the French; 356693 in the English, I'm going to read this to you.

"The national congress expressed its support for the talks between the government of Rwanda and Inkontanyi.  It called on the latter to lay down their weapons and to adopt political pluralism, which is a better road to democracy. 

"The congress also reiterated its support for the decision to repatriate Rwandan refugees, and thus resolve this issue once and for all." 

And can you tell us whether or not you were aware of this resolution being adopted by the MRND congress? 
A.	Unless you want me, as the president of the republic did, to say that this was a piece of paper, this was adopted by the congress, and what -- and what remains is for us to see whether it was implemented. 
Q.	And the Inkotanyi that's referred to, can you tell us what that word means? 
A.	The problem there is that they had attacked Rwanda, and when they lost on the 30th of October, they tried again to attack Rwanda.   And in these attacks there was always the displacement of people who were suffering from the effects of that war, because they were using firearms. 
Q.	Was the Inkotanyi another name for the RPF? 
A.	When they attacked Rwanda, they were the ones who were calling themselves Inyenzi--Inkotanyi.  The two words went together. 
Q.	So it's true then that Inkotanyi and Inyenzi were terms that the attackers gave to themselves, correct? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Now, this resolution 11 also talks for support for repatriating Rwandan refugees and resolving this issue.  What does this refer to?  What was the issue about Rwandan refugees, as you understood it? 
A.	You know, these are discussions which started well before 1991--1990.  They had always asked to come back into Rwanda and each time they tried to come back into Rwanda by force, they were unable to do so -- to succeed.  And each time there were meetings in Uganda and elsewhere so that these people could be admitted back. 
Sometimes the Rwandan government would use terms like Rwanda was too small to be able to admit back these people who were living outside.  But the -- the fact of the matter is whether Rwanda was small or not, the country was for everybody and everybody had the right to come back.  But, in all, all these discussions didn't come up with much in terms of success. 
Q.	Is it true that in 1990 -- or 1989 or 1990 people who were Rwandans who were living in Uganda were facing pressure to leave that country? 
A.	They were living in Uganda.  I don't know what the policy of Uganda was.  I don't even know how things went -- went about.  But what I know is that they wanted to come back -- to come back home, be it by force or any other means. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much, Witness G.  

Now, I would like you to take a look at document number 5 and this is also - 
MR. ROBINSON:
I have other copies available if people need them in the courtroom, but it was distributed this morning. 
MS. TALON:
This is the registry, The Hague.  We would like to know whether document number 5 is in Kinyarwanda, in English or French?
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, this is a document in Kinyarwandan, which bears the K number K0007416. 
MS. TALON:
Is that a three-paged document, is that right? 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, I see you have the document in front of you and I'll ask you if this document reflects the result of the elections at the 1992 MRND national congress. 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ7. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ7A, D. NZ7B and D. NZ7C admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, turning to the second page of this document at the very bottom, does it reflect that 
	Juvenal Habyarimana -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the registrar advises that it's number 8. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that we were at 7.  We decided the CDs were going to be part of 6 and therefore it should be 7. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's been accepted now. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness G, on page 2 at the bottom, second page of this document, does it reflect that 
	President Habyarimana was elected -- or Juvènal Habyarimana was elected president of MRND? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And on the third page of the document, in a somewhat closer election, does it appear that 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse defeated Edouard Karemera for the position of secretary-general of MRND? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And looking at the first page of the document with respect to the members of the committees from each préfecture, the very first one, the préfecture of Kigali, does it appear that the highest vote getter, the person with the highest number of votes for Kigali prefecture, was Jacques Rusirare? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And he was of Tutsi ethnicity?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And for Kigali rural préfecture, the next one down, does it also reflect that Désiré Murenzi was elected to the national committee -- the central committee? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then for the préfecture of Gitarama, number 4, Claver Kamana, was he also of Tutsi ethnicity? 
A.	As far as I know, yes. 
Q.	And turning on the second page, for the préfecture of Ruhengeri, does it appear that Mr. Nzirorera was also elected to this national committee? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And, finally, on the -- going back to the first page, for the Butare préfecture, the second name on the list, Mr. Rumiya, R-U-M-I-Y-A, was he also of Tutsi ethnicity? 
A.	That could be Tutsi.  In the event --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't quite understand what the witness said.  

I'm sorry, Your Honours.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Could you repeat that answer please, Witness G, the interpreters didn't catch it? 
A.	You had asked me about Rumiya from Gitare préfecture -- Butare préfecture.  He was elected during that period of time, and you are asking whether he was Tutsi.  Yes, he was Tutsi and I said that he paid for it in April of 1994 because he was killed for the fact that he was a Tutsi. 
Q.	Now, after this congress of April 1992, is it true that members of the national committee of the Interahamwe helped establish the Interahamwe in the other préfectures?  
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel?  
Q.	After the April 1992 congress, did members of the Interahamwe national committee help establish the Interahamwe in various préfectures?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And can you tell us what the committee members did to help establish the Interahamwe in those préfectures?  
A.	What I can give you is for Gisenyi préfecture when the Interahamwe of the national committee left for the establishment of the Interahamwe, when they got there, it wasn't in order to help in the establishment, it was only so that the members of the committee of the Interahamwe in that préfecture be introduced.  

The committee that was leading these people as well as the members -- what I mean is that the préfectures themselves would organise the elections and then the national committee would be invited, so that the members of the Interahamwe -- committee members of that préfecture be introduced to the members of the national committee. 
Q.	And did this process of beginning the Interahamwe in the different préfectures take place in other places besides Gisenyi? 
A.	I told you that all the préfectures started to create Interahamwe units after the congress, and the initiative of inviting the national committee was implemented in all the préfectures.   And I do recall that there were delegations of the national -- of the provisional national Interahamwe committee, who went to practically all the préfectures for the introductions to be made. 
Q.	And how many préfectures did you yourself visit during the period after the 1992 congress when these Interahamwes were being set up? 
A.	I think I visited three préfectures and two sous-préfectures -- or sub-préfectures. 
Q.	And did you visit Ruhengeri in connection with the establishment of the Interahamwe? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet again.  It's the usual problem, and at this stage, I'm going to invite that we go into closed session, please. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, much of the -- this same testimony was given in open session during the Prosecution's case.  I don't think that whether or not he attended any of these meetings is of any -- would -- would reveal his identity, and obviously we need to have his personal recollections in order to proceed. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, the reason why I asked to go into closed session -- and it would only be for a moment --it's simply to articulate what is gathering as a body of material out of the mouth of Mr. Robinson.  

I can't articulate that in open session, because if I do so, I will compound the problem I'm trying to stop.  I would ask that I can address you in closed session briefly, unless Your Honour can see the point I'm making clearly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we propose to do is (inaudible) for the luncheon break.  We can now let the witness start his luncheon break now and we can discuss this matter briefly before we take our adjournment. 

Mr. Witness, we're now going to allow you to start your luncheon adjournment now.  You will resume at the usual time, bearing in mind that during this adjournment you do not discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  But you may -- you may go for lunch now. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, now we will go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 36 to 38] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 27 to 35 by Jean Baigent)

















(Court resumed at 1541H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can resume.  

Mr. Robinson, with regard to the objection that was raised just before our lunch break, we've decided to let you continue in open session.  We think that the slips -- that they were slips unintentional, but in the final analysis, the intention is not enough.  And if we -- if it happens that the impression is given that he was a member of the -- you see, I almost did it myself.  But you understand?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I do.  I understand.  I'm doing my best.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, may the record reflect Mr. Rapp has now come back into court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar, if you could just monitor my statement and make certain that anything that needs to be redacted is redacted -- and the previous matters just before lunch, the matters to which objection had been raised.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Also, Mr. President, I just wanted to let you know my client is not here at the moment.  They had a problem with his lunch, and he -- it just arrived.  And so he's having his lunch in the anteroom but he said it was okay, we could go ahead in his absence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  That's okay with us, too.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  So, Witness G, are you able to hear me?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  I'd like to ask you then if after the national congress of April 1992, you ever had occasion to attend a function in the préfecture of Ruhengari concerning the establishment of the Interahamwe in that préfecture?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you know who was the leader of the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri préfecture?  
A.	Interahamwe or member of the préfecture?  
Q.	I'm asking you, for example, if you know who was the leader of the Interahamwe for Ruhengeri préfecture.  
A.	No.  
Q.	And it's true at this time that the president of the MRND for Ruhengeri préfecture was Casimir Bizimungu; correct?  
A.	When I went to a rally in Ruhengeri, in around November 1992, Casimir Bizimungu was the MRND coordinator for Ruhengeri.  
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, did the national committee of the Interahamwe send a delegation to Mukingo commune concerning the establishment of Interahamwe there?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, is it correct that the Interahamwe in the préfectures were never controlled by the national committee of the Interahamwe in Kigali?  
A.	It is true, in the préfectures, the Interahamwe did not fall under the national committee.  They fell under the préfectoral committee.  
Q.	And even after 6 April 1994, there was no national structure of the Interahamwe whereby the members of the national committee could tell the Interahamwe in another préfecture what to do; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, I would like to direct your attention to an event which took place near the end of May 1992, and if you could take a look at Exhibit P. 10A, which is a letter of the national committee of Interahamwe that was originally located at tab 55.  

Witness G, do you have that in front of you?  
A.	Not yet. 

Which exhibit?
MR. ROBINSON:
It's Exhibit P. 10A, and it was originally in tab 55.  It was shown by Mr. Rapp to this witness on the 10th of October.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have it with me.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Now, we saw a little while ago a letter to Faustin Twagiramungu by the Interahamwe national committee, objecting to some statements made by him as the leader of the MDR, and is it true that this letter was another letter of the Interahamwe committee protesting against acts of another party, the PL?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And looking at the first paragraph of this letter, does it indicate that the committee is deeply concerned about the acts of violence by the PL party against the Rwandan population, particularly, members of the MRND?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And in the second paragraph, does it refer to an announcement by the PL that it was going to postpone its normal political agenda in favour of an open war against the MRND?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And does the second paragraph also refer to a public declaration by Justin Mugenzi during a PL rally in which he is quoted as saying that I would like to inform, our party decided to postpone all political programmes to wage a war against MRND?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And then does the letter go on to indicate some examples of violence by PL youth against MRND members?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	For example, the second paragraph from the bottom, does it indicate that on the 23rd of May, in the presence of Mr. Mugenzi, himself, the youth of the PL, armed with stones and clubs, attacked members of the MRND in Kimisagara secteur of Nyarugenge commune and that many members were seriously injured and taken to Kigali hospital?  
A.	I'm following you.  
Q.	And does it also indicate that on the following day, Sunday the 24th of May, two members of the MRND were beaten to death at the -- near the roundabout in Kigali?  Do you see that in the letter?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And that members of the MRND, while going to a public rally in Butamwa (phonetic) were attacked by PL youth at a place called Gitikinyoni; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And finally that while returning from this meeting, the same PL youth had attacked or put a trap at Mount Kigali against MRND members?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And was the national committee of the Interahamwe asking the prime minister, to whom this letter was addressed, to urgently address this problem of PL violence against MRND members?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, after -- this letter is dated the 27th of May 1992.  Were you aware of a rally held on the 28th of May 1992, by the MRND, which began near the roundabout in Kigali and proceeded to the roundabout in front of the office of the prime minister?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you, yourself, attend that event?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And during that event, is it true that members of the PL youth again attacked the MRND members?  
A.	I believe that it was not only the PL youth.  It was all opposition youth parties -- PSD, MDR, and JL (sic).  
Q.	And were you present when Mathieu Ngirumpatse addressed that gathering of people in the roundabout by the prime minister's office?  
A.	Yes, I was there.  
Q.	And did Mr. Ngirumpatse say anything about exterminating Tutsis?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now I'm going to ask that you be shown another document, and this is number 6 in the packet that was faxed to The Hague this morning.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If that could be placed before the witness and if anyone else needs copies of that, I have some.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And if you could just take a few minutes to read that document to yourself to familiarise yourself with it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And while he's doing that, Mr. President, I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the registry and CMS and also the people in The Hague for a very good job they did in getting my documents to be put in front of the witness and be used so efficiently.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, this is a document that's dated the 29th of July 1992, and it's three pages, and it's in Kinyarwanda.  So my first question to you would be whether or not you recognise the contents of this document.  
A.	At first glance, no.  
Q.	Why don't you take a few minutes then to read the content of the document, because I want to ask you if you're familiar with the events that are described in it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  Whilst the witness is reading through the document, there's a small amount of unease.  We have a document which is in Kinyarwanda, which I anticipate no one at our end, and perhaps on Your Honour's Bench, will be able to read.  It's not in French or English, and I'm just wondering whether Mr. Robinson has a translation of that document.  We don't know what it is, what it says, and we don't know what the witness may be able to say about it because we can't, as it were, take a different view, because we don't know what's in it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I don't have a translation of the document.  I have some notes that my team has provided which contain some points that are -- that they think are pertinent to be raised within the document, but I don't have a translation of this document.  This is a document we obtained from the Prosecution, as you could see from the K-number.  And if you could see from the last page also, it's a communiqué from the JMRND Interahamwe of Kigali.  And so if this witness is able to recognise it, I will try to admit it.  If not, I'm simply going to ask him about some of the events without necessarily referring to the document.  
THE WITNESS:
Counsel, I cannot continue to read the document as I do not recognise it.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Well, let me ask you then, in the end of July of 1992, do you recall there having been problems that MRND members had faced with respect to attacks by other -- by members of other parties in the following places -- Kigembe commune in Butare, Burenga (phonetic) commune in Kibungo, Taba commune in Gitarama, Nyakizu commune in Butare, Nyakabanda commune, Rwamatamu (phonetic) commune in Kigali, Gikondo and Kimicyanga (phonetic) communes in Kigali?  Do you recall incidents in which MRND members were assaulted or their properties were destroyed or vandalised by members of other parties during this period?  
A.	Can you specify which periods, Counsel? 
(Pages 39 to 43 by Wendy Molnar)
























     1600H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	The period leading up to the 29th of July, 1992.  So let's say approximately the month of June and 
	July of 1992? 
A.	I will tell you, after the youth wings of the parties were created, there were problems within those youth wings.  Every time there was a rally or any type of meeting, there were always clashes.  This includes the MRND, the PL, the MDR, the PSD, all of them.  There were always people who were hurt during those clashes.  If you were established in the zone, in an area in Kigali where there were many Interahamwe and you belonged to a different party, you would have some problems, and vice versa.  If you were at a place where the opposition had control, you would have problems.  Sometimes people had to move places to join their own.  So this did not only occur within the MRND, but also within the opposition.  People in the opposition had the same types of problems.  I'll stop there. 
Q.	Do you believe that the events that I listed for you, which I described in the document that was before you, are events which, in fact, occurred? 
A.	There are certain events that took place in various areas, in the areas mentioned in this communiqué.  But you must understand, if you look at an MRND communiqué, you must realise there may have been another communiqué from a different party describing the same things. 
Q.	So what you are saying was that all the different parties were accusing each other of being responsible for a violence during this period, is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And looking at this document that's in front of you, which on the third page is signed "JMRND Interahamwe I Kigali" and bears the -- bears a seal at the bottom that seems to read "Interahamwe's MRND".  Does this appear to you to be a communiqué which was issued by the national committee of the Interahamwe in Kigali? 
A.	The stamp is there, yes, but the document is not signed.  So for me, this means it's not official. 
Q.	And do you have any recollection at all of such a communiqué being issued? 
A.	That's asking me a bit too much.  I can't quite remember. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, I want to move forward to something I think you do remember, which is the meeting in Ruhengeri stadium where President Habyarimana gave a speech on the 15th of November 1992, and I am going to ask you about that meeting in detail, and the first I would like to discuss with you, the speech that was made by Casimir Bizimungu.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Mr. President, at this time, in tab number 231, there is contained several different translations of -- transcripts of the speeches that were made in this Ruhengeri meeting.  So the first thing I would like to do is offer as Exhibit D. NZ8, the speech of Casimir Bizimungu in its original Kinyarwanda as D. NZ8A, and then in French as D. NZ8B, and then in English as D. NZ8C, and I will note that the English translations of these speeches came just within the last day or two and we were supposed to be inserting them in our binder at tab 231.  So I am not one hundred per cent sure that that has been accomplished for everybody, but I would like to offer at this time those three transcripts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
They are admitted in evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ8, D. NZ8A, D. NZ8B, D. NZ8C admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am going to offer a shortcut and, if it's a problem, then we can go and do this the slow way.  If you will excuse me for a minute.  That's tab 231 in case I misspoke.  Normally the way I would do this is we would play the CD-Rom that contains the speech of Casimir Bizimungu, and we can do that -- we are prepared to do that.  But I am thinking that, instead of taking the time for you to just sit here and listening to something in a language that none of us really understand, that I could put the transcript before the witness and ask him -- have him read it for a few minutes and ask him questions based upon the transcript, as opposed to taking the time to let the witness listen to the tape.  So I'm proposing that as an alternative, but if someone sees a problem with that, then I can play him the entire speech and I can ask him about it afterwards.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, has the tape been admitted into evidence?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Yes, it has. 
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honour, we respectfully agree with Mr. Robinson's suggestion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are permitted to proceed in that way. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  And so if the witness then could have placed in front of him, from tab 231, pages K0356631 to pages K0356642. 
THE WITNESS:  
	Are you going to ask me the questions today or tomorrow?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thankfully, we are not working on Saturday, but I am going to ask you the questions today. 
MR. MORLEY:  
May I, as I am on my feet again, just establish that when pages are being taken out of the binder in The Hague, that they are then being put back in the binder in The Hague.  I have noticed, and I worry about these things, perhaps out of too much caution, that if pages are coming out, and they don't go back in, we are going to have an awful mess. And I am just trying to establish that if pages are taken out, they do go back in.  Thank you.
 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope that those responsible have heard you (inaudible).  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness G, we are asking you to do a lot of work here to save us some time.  What we are asking you to do is read this to yourself and then I'm going to ask you some questions about it, rather than us taking the time in Court to play the whole video; do you understand that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Thank you.  So take your time and let me know when you are ready.
MR. MORLEY:
Again, your Honour, I find myself on my feet.  A short point of housekeeping.  My learned friend has invited that the document in tab 231 become D. NZ I think 8, he mentioned.  I believe that tab 231 may already be in evidence as P. 11.  Now, as a matter of housekeeping, it may be that it makes perfect sense for there to be a separate file of exhibits which reflect what my learned friend is defending want in exhibit bundle, so that effectively the same document gets exhibited under the Prosecution heading and under the Defence heading.  But it may be that that is not the way the Trial Chamber wants to work and once the document is in, it retains its original first allocated exhibit number.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Okay.  Mr. President, the transcripts are not in evidence.  P. 11 is -- just contains A through F, the CDs.  There is no transcripts as P. 11, so I think at this point maybe we will come up with some other time, but as of right now, my practice is if something is already in evidence, I don't need to put it -- give it my own D. NZ number.  I can use the Prosecution numbers.  But because that is not in evidence yet, it is being done in this way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the witness need to read the whole document before you can ask him your question?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
I don't believe it is really necessary.  I mostly want to make him comfortable that I am asking him questions about what's in the speech, but I think I can start.  At least if it is necessary for him to consult the text, we can do that.  Would you prefer me to do that, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I -- well, I hope if the witness can answer the questions you put to him. 
MR. ROBINSON.
Okay.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, I am going to interrupt your perusal of this document and see if I can draw your attention to some points that I want to ask you about.  During his address to the members of -- to the people who were at the rally, is it true that Casimir Bizimungu made reference to the fact that there were more than 400,000 people now displaced in Rwanda as a result of the war, and that alone there was more than 100,000 of those people in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I believe so, yes. 
Q.	And as part of his speech, did he call on people to assist these displaced persons? 
A.	Of course. 
Q.	And did he also address the Arusha Accords? 
A.	You know, I haven't read the whole document. 
Q.	Let me see if I can try to direct you to the place where we can, in the Kinyarwanda text, where we can find some of the things that I am going to ask you about? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, (inaudible).
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President, I do apologise and I also request Mr. Robinson to excuse me, but there are problems into French which Mr. Robinson cannot determine the translation which has come regarding the number of displaced persons mentioned in the document is not correct in the document and this can lead to misunderstandings and Mr. Robinson wouldn't be able to hear this because he is on a different channel.  This is on the French channel. 

To be more specific, Mr. President, the interpreter indicated when Mr. Robinson was talking about 400,000 displaced persons, the interpreter said 4,000, and when he said 100,000 displaced persons in Ruhengeri, the interpreter said 1,000. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is -- that is a translation error.  Mr. Registrar, perhaps you could direct that the transcript be corrected. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
I think I had better ask the question to the witness again since he is listening to the French. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness G, I am going to direct your attention to the Kinyarwanda page K0356634.  I ask you to take a look at that.  Do you have that? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	If you look in the middle of the page, there is about five small lines where he is addressing "The chairman of the MRND, the national secretary, distinguished guests."  And then the first paragraph after that.  Does it indicate that, "Today seems to be a day of rejoicing, but we regret to say that Rwanda now has more than 400,000 war displaced and Ruhengeri préfecture alone has more than 100,000 of them."?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And does he go on to ask that the people who are displaced be assisted by other Rwandans as well as the international community? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Then if you can turn to page K0356635, and this is on the English of K0358497, and right above the one sentence where it says, "Members of the MRND," there is a paragraph there and I am wondering if you can tell me if, whether or not in that paragraph, he is speaking of -- actually, excuse me, I think I may have the wrong -- I have the wrong Kinyarwanda page.  If we could turn to page -- for Kinyarwanda K0356637.  And is it possible that -- actually, let me ask you to turn to page 6636 on the very bottom.  I think I am having a little difficulty doing some Kinyarwanda translation, but does it indicate there on the last three paragraphs of 6636 that, "Integration of the Inkotanyi soldiers into the national army, the resettlement of displaced persons and repatriation of refugees are difficult issues, but if we work ardently and have a clear vision, the agreements we reach would be acceptable to all parties involved, and that he advocates strongly the swift return of peace, but for this to happen, no parties must have hidden agendas, as they sometimes tend to forfeit the country to the Inkotanyi, and at this time we have a feeling that their agenda seems to be contrary to democracy.  The people behind such an agenda want to secretly mount a coup d'etat and introduce the type of dictatorship they condemned in the past."  Do you see that language as part of his speech? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, may we suggest that Mr. Robinson provide the interpreters with a reference for the other languages the document appears in, because we have them in the booth but we cannot follow.  We are not with him.  I am sorry to interrupt.  The witness has answered "yes". 
MR. ROBINSON:  
I will do my best.  This is going to be -- now, turning to the Kinyarwandan, on page K0356638, and on the English K0358498.  Does Casimir Bizimungu indicate, "We want elections, we want elections, we want elections."?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could we have the French reference please, thank you.
"Yes" says the witness. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
It is going to take me a while to come up with a French reference.  I think that's -- I am doing the best I can,  but we will be here a long time if I have to cross reference three languages.  So I will try to do my best to read slowly in English and the people in the French booth can try to translate orally.  But if I have to look through three languages at the same time, we will be here all day. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, after that, did Casimir Bizimungu introduce the dignitaries who were present at the meeting in Ruhengeri, and specifically, you can look through the names on the following pages? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not Mr. Nzirorera was in attendance at this meeting in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I don't think so because I didn't see him on the -- even on the video cassette, I didn't see him. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, we are going to turn to the next speaker, Robert Kajuga, and at this time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. President, I would ask that the transcript of the speech of Robert Kajuga be admitted as DNZ9A for Kinyarwandan, 9B for French and 9C for English, and these are also found within tab 231? 
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honour, I have risen to my feet I hope briefly to make I hope a small objection in respect of my learned friend's recent questioning.  I wonder if the witness could take off his headphones please.  And can it be confirmed that his headphones are off, please?
MS. TALON:	
Yes, he no longer has them on. 
MR. MORLEY:  
The Prosecution are anxious to have all these various documents in as exhibits, so we are ad idem in that respect.  However, there is a certain unease about the procedure which has just been adopted a moment ago.  My learned friend Mr. Robinson has drawn the witness' attention to sections of the speech of Mr. Bizimungu and he has got the witness to confirm that the speech, which is in evidence in its entirety, contains certain lines.  That's all very well.  We can see that.  Once the speech goes into evidence, it is, on its face, available to be read and it doesn't require the witness to read it.  Your Honour, and your Honour's colleagues can read it.  We can all read it.  I was anticipating that my learned friend Mr. Robinson, after eliciting certain tracks from the Bizimungu speech, was then going to ask the witness to comment on what it was that Mr. Bizimungu was trying to express to the gathering, because Mr. Robinson would have laid foundation for the elicitation of the comment.  But what seems to be happening, and I'm sure Mr. Robinson will correct me if I'm wrong, is he simply using the witness to read to Your Honours sections of a speech which, for example, Mr. Robinson could read to your Honours during the course of his closing address, and I invite the Chamber to say that that isn't really an appropriate use of cross-examination in Court time.  If Mr. Robinson is not seeking to elicit a contextual comment from the witness, it's a bit pointless getting him to read out what's already in evidence.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Mr. President, I will take Mr. Morley up on his offer to correct him if he is wrong because what I intend to do is ask the witness to comment after all of the four speeches are brought to his attention and then I am going to have -- we are going to discuss the meeting in general.  So I didn't ask him any questions right now about this, but I am intending to. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, it should be obvious to you there are differences of opinion as to how you should proceed, so maybe you should reconsider your approach and see if you can address this issue in a more succinct manner. 
MR. ROBINSON.
Okay.  I have to agree my experiment wasn't very satisfactory.  Even the witness is not able to come to enough familiarity with the material in a short enough time to be conversant with it, so I will change my approach and see if I can do a little better.  What I would like to do first, if you could rule on the admission of the proposed Exhibit DNZ9A, B and C which are the three transcripts of the speech of Robert Kajuga contained in tab 231. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is also connected to the (inaudible) which is admitted by the Prosecutor?  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Yes, it is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ9A, D. NZ9B and D. NZC admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thankfully, Mr. Kajuga's speech is only four minutes and I think the best thing to do now is to play it on the video and to have -- ask the witness to have in front of him -- placed in front of him that portion of 231 that is in Kinyarwandan for Mr. Kajuga's speech, which is at pages K0356602, and if the Trial Chamber wishes to follow along in English, it would be at K0358506, and in French at K0356599.  So I would ask that those documents be placed -- the Kinyarwandan document be placed before the witness, and if the witness could let me know when he has that. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
The document has to be identified.  There's someone here who would like to go to the restroom.  No, in fact, it's not -- that's not the issue.  There is a terrible odour in this room of paint or some type of chemical product, and it is making us all sick to our stomachs.  I've had a headache for about an hour now, and I would ask if we could take the normal break now.  It's half past.  We would like to go outside to get some fresh air because it is becoming very difficult for us.  This is Counsel Chantal Hounkpatin speaking, Mr. President.  The witness also would confirm as much.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
Mr. Lombardi for the OTP confirms the same, and it is true that the odour is becoming quite unbearable. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson (inaudible)... you are being displaced.  We will take the break now. 
(Court adjourned from 1639H to 1654H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, during the break we got some further information as to the state of affairs at The Hague, and that has led us to conclude that the most appropriate response should be to take the adjournment now.  So we have decided to adjourn the day's proceedings now and resume on Monday -- Monday morning.  I hope, Mr. Robinson, that does not interfere with your cross-examination too much.  By that time we should probably be able to proceed -- to proceed.  I don't think it is possible to proceed now. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Yes, it is no problem.  Yes, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
Just to confirm, what courtroom are we in on Monday morning?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we resume in courtroom 2 on Monday morning.  

Now, Mr. Witness, we are going to take the adjournment now.  I remind you that during this, as in all of the adjournments, you are still a witness and you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. SOW:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have just spoken with Dior Diagne.  She has indicated to me that they are still having issues with the security services in The Hague.  I simply wanted to point this out for you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  Perhaps you can address the Registry immediately afterwards and we can see what administrative services can be taken to assist with the matter. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1700H)
