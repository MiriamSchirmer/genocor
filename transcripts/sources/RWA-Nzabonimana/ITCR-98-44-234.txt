P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, 13th February 2006, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  Could we have appearances now, please, starting with the Prosecutor?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to the Defence and to the registry, and Happy New Year to everyone.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, Iain Morley, Gregory Lombardi, Gilles Lahaie, and the record should also reflect the presence of Massamba Ndiaye and our ALO, Takeh Sendze.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Webster. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I do apologise.  Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Could we have the Defence, please, starting with Karemera?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I am Dior Diagne, lead counsel for Karemera.  My co-counsel, Mr. Felix Sow, is not present.  He will be joining me later.  I should also to -- present my New Year greetings to Your Honours, to the Prosecution, to the interpreters, to the registry, and to all the other Defence teams.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning to the Prosecution team.  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen in the registry.  Good morning to the interpreters.  I present you also with my somewhat delayed best wishes for this year.  My name is Chantal Hounkpatin, lead counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse, with my co-counsel Frédéric Weyl and my assistant -- I'm sorry, the name has escaped me - Anta Guissé. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, members of the Trial Chamber.  I'm Peter Robinson, representing Joseph Nzirorera, along with our legal assistant Leopold Nsengiyumva.  We no longer have the services of our intern, Russell Hopkins, who left on Friday, and I would like to express our appreciation for the great work that he did for our team.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not going to say, "Thank you, Mr. Webster."  Yes.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, my compliments.  I should like to begin this year as we ended the previous year.  Our best wishes would not be complete unless addressed to the entire staff of the court, of the Trial Chamber, which includes, of course, the court stenographers.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Well, I, too, would like to say thank you to all of you for your warm greetings as we commence the second trial session.  For our part, we look forward to a continued good working relationship which we enjoyed very much in the first session, and we look forward to a fully functional relationship as we try to move forward with these proceedings.  

The first order of business that we have to address, the motion for continuance for a stay of proceedings which have been filed, and these are matters which are preliminary to any other activity which we can undertake.  We think that we should address them as soon -- immediately.  Thank you very much.  

Now, we have been seized of both the motion presented by Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, and we have also seen the response from the Prosecutor.  What we thought would be probably the most effective manner of addressing this matter is that instead of asking the parties to reiterate their written arguments, we thought that we may be able to elicit further information which would assist us in our decision-making process by asking a few questions to the Prosecutor.  The Defence will, of course, have an opportunity to respond if they wish to.  

Now, I have to comment that the Defence for Karemera, who has not filed any particular motion up to now, but we would feel that, if they wanted to, they should take part in these proceedings, to the extent that they're able to, and join in responses, if they wish, to the submissions put forward by the Prosecutor in response to the questions that we raise.  So, if that procedure is acceptable -- of course, if there are any questions that we do not ask which any party thinks should be asked, and that would mean on either side, we would welcome those questions being addressed.  So, if that suits the parties, we could proceed in that manner.  

Now, the first question has to do with Witness Mbonyunkiza.  Nzirorera claims that the witness created a list of persons who he claims attended MRND meetings in February 1992.  Now, some of these people have been allegedly contacted by Nzirorera, who have indicated that they have given statements to the OTP contradicting Mbonyunkiza's testimony, which have never been disclosed to the Defence.  Does the Prosecution have any comments on that allegation?  There were a list -- I think I've counted -- if I'm not inaccurate in my calculation, I think I've counted 60 witnesses on this list.  I don't think it's necessary to name them, but I think you have the names.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin, Your Honour, by reminding the Court and the parties that we addressed this issue when Mr. Mbonyunkiza was on the stand.  My recollection is that during his cross-examination, Mr. Robinson raised the same concerns, and we interrupted that cross-examination and one of my team members went and did his ZY-search, and I don't think my response is going to be any different today than it was back in October.  Yes, maybe one or two of the persons on that list have spoken to the OTP and have made statements, but they are not exculpatory within the meaning of Rule 68.  A number of the people on the list, we have no record of any conversation with them and OTP investigators.  So we see this as another fishing expedition.  

It's a question that Mr. Robinson has raised several times, and it simply finds its way back into the present motion.  I could go name by name, but I think I would have to do that in closed session because it would reveal aspects of our investigators and details about individuals that should not be in the public domain.  But I feel comfortable giving the Court my assurance that none of the witnesses on that list provide Rule 68 material.  And the Prosecutor will simply live with the impact of our decision not to disclose any of that material if it should arise at a later point.  There is one particular witness that perhaps I could discuss with the Court, but it cannot be done in open session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
When you say you can discuss it, to what end?  What would be the purpose of the discussion?  
MR. WEBSTER:
To simply amplify what I have just said.  It would not change my response, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it would be more effective to deal with these matters seriatim.  So, Mr. Robinson, do you have any responses to the submissions made by the Prosecutor on question 1?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I do, Mr. President.  Well, look it, I'll give you an example.  Jean Habyarimana, one of the people on the list, he was in Kigali prison he was the president of the MRND for the préfecture of Kigali during -- he succeeded Mr. Ngirumpatse.  He was one of the people who Witness Mbonyunkiza said was at that meeting.  So I have spoken with him.  I've been myself to Kigali prison in November, after our session ended, and I asked him, "Have you been interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor?"  And he said, "Yes."  And I asked him, "Did you talk to them about whether Mathieu Ngirumpatse, or any of the accused, made statements calling for the extermination of the Tutsi during any time during the entire period of any of these events?"  And he said that, "I have told the Office of the Prosecutor that no such statements were made."  

So, that's just one example.  I don't know what more I can do.  And he's told me the dates he was interviewed by the Prosecution.  Now, I suggest that you order the Prosecutor to provide to you, in camera, any statements that any notes, investigators' notes, whatever information it has from those people I've listed in my motion, and you decide for yourself.  Maybe the OTP didn't write down information that doesn't help their case.  I find it hard to believe that the investigators wouldn't do that, but maybe that's one explanation.  Or maybe Mr. Webster's view of what is exculpatory is so narrow that a review of the information in camera would result in its disclosure.  But I don't know what more I can tell you, other than that's the situation.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just make one brief comment in response.  This is one of the witnesses that I would have to discuss in closed session if I wanted to go into detail, but I could limit myself at this point to saying we've done a ZYFIND search in my office.  A ZYFIND search under his name has not generated any documentation in terms of a witness statement or an investigator's notes.  Nothing has been memorialised, as far as I know, and I'm relying on the services of our Evidence Unit to indicate to me what exists in our ZYFIND database.  But what I know about this particular witness and his relationship with Mr. Robinson is that this is the witness that Mr. Robinson's team uses as an interpreter in the prisons, and we have allegations that in the process of investigating his case, he has exposed the identity of some of our other Prosecution witnesses in the context of the prison, simply because he relies on Jean Habyarimana to translate French statements into Kinyarwanda, in order for him to interview other witnesses.  So, with every name on this list, there is a story behind them.  

Now, with respect to is there Rule 68 witness information from this witness, supposing there was, which is a big supposition, what -- would it be to Mr. Robinson's advantage or the Defence advantage now for us to produce it?  He has met the witness.  He has gone to the horse's mouth.  Anything that he wants to know that will assist him in his case, he has it from his relationship with the witness.  This, to me, is the worst-case scenario for making the Defence point, because he has the information that he's seeking.  How does it assist this Court?  Even if there was some sort of memorandum -- and my understanding is that there is none -- how would it be of assistance to this Court at this point?  He has direct contact with the source of the information that he's seeking to prepare his defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you saying that, as a matter of law, that if the Prosecutor believes the Accused has access to exculpatory information, that the Prosecutor is not obliged to obey Rule 68?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Not at all, Your Honour.  That was not my submission at all.  In fact, I was speaking hypothetically.  I was simply using this case to test an example.  We have done the necessary searches.  We have not found anything that has been documented.  Mr. Robinson may have more information about the OTP investigations than I do, assuming that the information he gets from this witness is correct, because I don't know of any interview where this witness alleged that there was no call for the extermination of the Tutsi.  

But let's assume, simply for purposes of argument, that there is some sort of memorandum to that effect.  I don't think there is and I don't know of any.  In this case, Mr. Robinson has direct access to the source of the information.  How does an incident like this arise to the level of asking for a stay of proceedings?  He has access to the information he needs to construct his defence.  I am not suggesting that the Prosecution has no obligation to disclose it, if we have it.  I'm not aware that we have anything along this line.  So that's my submission.  I was simply raising the issue for argument's sake.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, what has concerned us about the allegations with regard to these witnesses is that we do not think that we would be entitled to make orders against the Prosecutor unless there was some evidentiary threshold to show some prima facie showing that there has been some material which could be categorised as Rule 68 material.  

Now, you have given information concerning one witness.  What sort of information exists with regard to the other witnesses?  Now, you had mentioned -- both yourself and the Prosecutor have mentioned that certain types of information should not be disclosed publicly.  But if we are going to move forward on this matter, you would have to indicate the information that would -- that you have which would enable us to make a finding of fact that would justify the order you have requested, because, as we have said on previous occasions, we don't think we should make such an order unless there was a factual basis for doing so.  Now, is that something you can address now, in open court?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I think I can address that in open court, and I could -- first of all, there's two things.  Rule 68 is not triggered by the disclosure by the Defence of its violation by the Prosecution.  You're putting a burden on the Defence that makes it impossible to obtain Rule 68 material unless we catch them red-handed not disclosing it, which we've done now on several occasions.  So I think, first of all, you're reluctant to make an order to the Prosecutor that as to all of these witnesses, if they have statements within their possession, they should provide them in camera, I think is wrong.  You're making too much of a burden on the Defence.  If they have -- I've identified people who Mr. Mbonyunkiza said were at this meeting and who we believe have been interviewed and told the Prosecutor, maybe not specific as to this meeting, but told the Prosecutor that calls for extermination of Tutsis were not being made, or even other information that's exculpatory or even material to the preparation of the Defence.  It doesn't have to rise to exculpatory.  And so that's the kind of specific showing.  

We've given you the names of witnesses who the witness claims to have been present.  It seems to me that that's enough to trigger the obligation of the Prosecutor to provide at least to the Trial Chamber, in camera, all materials it has from those witnesses.  What prejudice is there to the Prosecutor in doing that?  

But, secondly, if you require more information, then I can provide that to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we agree with you that the Prosecutor has a primary obligation to disclose.  That's mandated by the rule.  So we accept that.  Now, what you have done now, you have alleged that there's a breach, and you're asking us to give a remedy for that breach.  We don't think that we should make an adjudication, unless there is an evidentiary basis that would justify your saying that there's a breach.  If you're saying the Prosecutor have not honoured a commitment and you're asking us to provide a remedy for doing so, we would need some evidence that would enable us to say that.  

It's not that we are saying the Prosecutor does not have a primary obligation; we acknowledge that they do.  But if we have to make an adjudication that they're in default, we need some basis for saying so.  And you see -- and we have to say in the face of the Prosecutor's statement because -- he has stood up here in open court and said, "I have given the Court my assurance that we are not in breach of this rule," and we can't just make an assumption and make an order in the face of it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I can give you, for example, for another witness on my list, the same story that I just gave you about Jean Habyarimana.  But I can only take it so far.  I mean, I can tell you that we've talked to a person.  He said he's been interviewed by OTP; he said he gave them this information.  I don't know what was written down.  I don't know whether they didn't even write anything down.  So I can only take this so far, and if you want me to tell you that, yes, I have in my hand a report of this witness by the Prosecution, if that's what's required, I have to have the document myself first in order to make them provide another copy, then it's an impossible burden that you're putting on us.  So all I can tell you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I'm not expecting you to produce the document that the Prosecutor has.  You have, for example, provided information.  We have just put the Prosecutor in a position that he had to respond with regard to Habyarimana.  You have alleged that you have spoken to other witnesses who have provided information that they spoke to the OTP.  Can you support those allegations?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, with respect to the last witness on our list, his name is Isaac Nkubito.  My investigator interviewed him in Kigali prison in November, and he told him -- told my investigator that at one time he had been a Prosecution witness in this case and that he had been interviewed on multiple occasions by the Prosecution, and that he had also told them -- and, first of all, that he was not -- that there were no such statements made at the meetings alleged by Mbonyunkiza, by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and that he had also told them that he had not heard that the officials, including Mr. Ngirumpatse of the MRND, called for the extermination of the Tutsi during that period.  So ...  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, in order to move forward more quickly, you have provided information of communications between two of the persons on this list.  Do you have information with regard to others?  
MR. ROBINSON:
With regard to the other people on this list, I do not have specific information that they have been interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor, although I expect that -- I believe that, given their positions with the Interahamwe, that some of them -- at least most of them -- would have been.  With respect to the one witness, Mudahinyuka, I have information that he has been interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor, and by Mr. Rapp in particular, and I've been told that there is nothing to disclose with respect to his information.  So I don't know whether that means he never discussed substantively Mr. Mudahinyuka's information, or he simply didn't write anything down, but I have information that he had been interviewed by OTP.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would any of the other Defence teams have any contribution to make before I ask the Prosecutor to respond?  No.  

In that case, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'll limit my response to the second witness that Mr. Robinson mentioned.  I can give the Court my assurance that there is nothing that needs to be disclosed in relation to that witness.  What documentation I do have, I'm more than willing to hand it up to the Court, in camera, to clarify the issue.  But with respect to that second witness, it is not an issue for -- that disturbs us or preoccupies us in relation to our disclosure obligations.  

With respect to the third witness that Mr. Robinson mentioned, we've already addressed that, and he accurately stated our response to his request, which is that we have no documentation in our office and we have nothing to disclose in relation to the last witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Webster.  Mr. Webster, we have noted your offer to hand up what documentation that you do have, but we do not think that we should review decisions that you have made with relation to the discharge of your Rule 68 obligations.  We think that that is -- we think that the way the rules have been constructed, that there's an ethical burden on the Prosecutor to make this determination properly, and we don't think that we should second-guess the Prosecutor privately and advise the Prosecutor how to behave.  We think that our role would be to adjudicate, if we are satisfied that this obligation has been broken, and then we would have to decide at that stage what is an appropriate way of dealing with such a breach.  But we don't think that we should have a private viewing of this material to advise you on it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honour.  I appreciate the Court's ruling and it actually is -- reflects my own thinking on the matter.  I wanted to clarify that my offer was limited to the information concerning the second witness.  I was not suggesting that we provide the Court with all of the information we had and that the Court would review it, but in order to clarify the issue with respect to Witness No. 2.  That was really the thrust of my offer.  But I understand the Court's ruling, and I respect it and it's actually what I think -- what I would -- I share the Court's concern.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What would, I think, assist everybody, if you could indicate which of these are witnesses you actually have statements from.  We understand you expressed the view that you have concluded that you have nothing which is exculpatory, but you could at least indicate which ones you have the statements from.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's something that I would prefer to -- that's the type of information I'd prefer to provide in closed session because now I can make a filing in that regard -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, at some stage we can move into closed session and perhaps what we could do, we could do all the closed session in one group, one session.  So we will defer this for a closed session later.  

Now we can move on to the second -- sorry, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would like to be maybe a little bit off topic but relate in a related way; I have information that I would like to show you which shows a clear breach of Rule 68.  I can cite document numbers, et cetera, and I appreciate the Trial Chamber's ruling that you don't want Mr. -- you don't want Mr. Webster to be second-guessed, unless there's a breach.  So what I would like to do is take a few minutes and show you the breach and give you the opportunity to give us a remedy for that breach.  It doesn't relate to Mr. Mbonyunkiza, it relates to the man who is to come in and testify today, Witness UB.  So would this be the opportunity, the appropriate time for me to do that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's for question No. 3.  We will come to it.  

Yes, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I just wanted Mr. Karemera to go out for a moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I just wanted to say something about this matter of the list of witnesses, the list of participants at meetings that was given to us by Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  I do not recall that this list was disclosed by the witness in a closed session.  He gave this information in a public session.  I have trouble imagining that the Prosecutor did not immediately go to seek the testimony of all the participants at this meeting whose names he now had.  So I have trouble imagining that he would persist in keeping secret all statements that he may have collected of any type from these witnesses whose names were available for -- to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  During the course of the later session, we probably will have an opportunity to evaluate the position, but at this point in time I think we have to rely on counsel, who has indicated that what he has to say may breach the security of the relevant witnesses.  I don't know if these are people who have protected -- I don't know enough to second-guess this comment, but we can evaluate it at a later stage.  

I would like to move on to my second question, which regards Witness HH.  Nzirorera states that the OTP has statements and reports of witnesses who provided information concerning the criminal activities of HH, including ordering and carrying out attacks against members of parliament and other citizens.  Now, what are the Prosecution's comments with regard to that aspect of the stay of proceedings, motion for stay?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I know of no specific statement where there's that particular allegation, but HH is a notorious criminal.  He's a confessed killer.  And even among the witness statements that were disclosed by witnesses who will be testifying in this trial, there's information of his notorious criminal activity during the events of 1994.  So that's not a secret, it's not something that we're trying to conceal.  

I have not compiled a case against HH on the basis of the files we have in the OTP, but the witness himself has admitted that he participated in the events of 1994.  Witnesses that we are calling as Prosecution witnesses say the same thing, and in regard to that particular allegation, I have no knowledge of a particular witness that makes that specific allegation.  But the Defence already has in its possession a substantial amount of material where other witnesses are claiming that they acted in concert with HH or that they saw HH do any number of things during 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  With respect to Witness HH, I can provide you with K-numbers of documents that we have of witnesses who have been interviewed by the Prosecution with respect to Witness HH, who has said that he's engaged in these criminal activities which has not been disclosed to us.  Unfortunately, I don't have them here with me because I wasn't prepared to be that specific on this point.  But I have the very same information for Witness UB, who I was prepared to be that specific about, and I can give you even copies today, but it's the same situation for Witness HH.  

We have copies of witness statements that have either been disclosed in other cases or we've been able to come up with, which show that Witness HH has committed numerous crimes within the areas in which he was operating during the April 1994 events.  And we believe that those -- that such statements reflect on his credibility, affect his credibility, and should have been disclosed to us.  I can provide you with the K-numbers and a list of those at some later stage today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  In those circumstances, I think I should move on to question No. 3:  Regarding Witness UB, Nzirorera states -- or counsel for Nzirorera states, that he knows that the Prosecution has at least one detailed statement from a Catholic priest, and some details of that statement were given in the motion.  Now, he also states that he believes that the Prosecution has interviewed witnesses who Witness UB claims were present with them at various meetings with the Accused at Kigali préfecture locations who have failed to corroborate his allegations, and a list of six witnesses have been provided under that heading.  

And, thirdly, with regard to Witness UB, Nzirorera alleges that he has requested translation of several Rwandan statements since at least 30th July 2005.  

Now -- so those are three matters raised, as far as we have been able to determine, with regard to Witness UB.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  Let me state as a preliminary matter that the Prosecutor established an electronic disclosure suite, an EDS, which is a repository of all of the public documents in our database, and we have even placed witness statements in that database which was made accessible to the Defence, and Mr. Robinson has access to the EDS.  

Now, if he's finding this information in the EDS, then he's finding it, or he's discovering it, in a manner that is intended by the rules because that database was established to afford the Defence an opportunity to look for information that would assist it in preparing its defence.  So I don't know if the Court could enquire where Mr. Robinson is pulling this information from, but if it's coming from the EDS, the EDS is functioning in exactly the fashion that it was designed to.  

With respect to the first matter, the statement from the Catholic priest -- the Catholic pastor, we did a search and I did -- my team did locate a statement, and it does support the allegation made by Mr. Robinson in his moving papers, but it's a statement that would not have been picked up by a ZY-search because the name of the witness does not appear in the statement.  The statement makes reference to a conseiller, and one can deduct from the context that the witness may have been talking about UB.  But Your Honour, we cannot exhaustively search the entire OTP database simply to prosecute witnesses that we're bringing to this Court as part of our Prosecution case.  

Now, we have no objection to providing that statement to Mr. Robinson, but it appears that he already has it, and he may have obtained it from the EDS -- or I don't know what source he has gone to, to acquire it.  He states in his moving papers that he has the statement, that he was willing to show it to the Court.  Well, in an instance like that, if he tells us specifically the item that he would like us to produce, we'll do it if it falls within Rule 68.  And with respect to that statement, I have no objection to disclosing it.  But Mr. Robinson already has it and it probably is accessible in the EDS.  

So, on that score, it is not an issue that should contribute to a motion to stay proceedings.  It simply eclipses our attention.  The witness's name does not appear on that statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, earlier this morning I'd asked you about your interpretation of Rule 68.  Again, you're suggesting that Mr. Robinson should tell you specifically whether the information falls within Rule 68, but I don't see how he could.  The Rule 68 puts the preliminary burden on the Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There's no misunderstanding on that point, Your Honour.  We bear the burden.  We have done the ZY-searches.  We have completed our Rule 68 searches, and I think I stated as much in previous submissions to this Court.  So the issue is not whether we have a burden to disclose Rule 68 material.  Clearly, we do.  

What I'm suggesting is that in this instance, Mr. Robinson has something very particular in mind, and if he has the ability to identify it.  So, as a practical matter, if we are all concerned with moving the proceedings forward, if he has something and he knows of it, he can tell us, and we'll look for it.  In this instance, with respect to this particular statement, as I read the statement now, it is arguably Rule 68 material, but the witness's name does not appear in the statement.

When we do a ZYFIND search, the ZYFIND database is not going to generate a statement because the witness's name does not appear.  Contextually, one can deduct that perhaps the declarant of this statement was referring to our Witness UB, and on that basis we can disclose it, but the statement -- we were not aware of the statement.  Mr. Robinson, by some means, became aware of the statement, which means that he has it.  If he wants confirmation that the statement comes from OTP, we will be glad to provide that information.  And rather than making this a game, he can tell us what he's looking for and we'll look for it.  But we have done our Rule 68 searches with respect to UB.  

With respect to the Court's second concern, which is Mr. Robinson's allegation that there are witnesses that do not corroborate UB, that is not a Rule 68 violation.  Failure to corroborate does not make a statement exculpatory.  So, on that basis, there is no obligation to disclose statements from witnesses who don't provide exactly the same information as UB.  So we do not consider that as falling within Rule 68.  

With respect to the third, the issue of translation, I have a list before me prepared by our legal officer, which indicates that at around three our four items have yet to be translated, but these are all Rwandan PVs that are in Kinyarwanda, that need to be translated into English.  And with respect to those documents, they're in the language of the Accused.  It is not a legal impediment to going forward.  

Clearly, we would all prefer to have French and English translations of everything that this Court is going to examine during the proceedings, but we simply don't have it, and this is the responsibility of the language section.  We've made several requests, and we've followed up on them to have everything translated.  But Mr. Robinson has the assistance of a Kinyarwanda speaker on his Defence team and he also has the assistance of the Accused, who speaks Kinyarwanda.  

So, we do the best we can under these circumstances, but the translation problem is not going to go away.  It's endemic to the work that we do.  We make best efforts to bring these matters to the attention of the registry, and they are the ones that have the responsibility for translating documents.  We prioritise and we make the requests, but we cannot control the work of the language section.  They do a great job, and they produce a huge volume of materials, and, unfortunately, there are three or four items that still remain to be translated from Kinyarwanda into English or French.  
Among those materials is the judgement against UB in Rwanda.  This is an item that we've made requests for in the past.  It's something that was an issue in the Karera case.  Well, we managed to obtain the Kinyarwanda original of the judgement, but we received it for the first time this Friday.  Now, we're looking through it, or we've having a member of our staff go through it, to locate the information in the judgement that is relevant to UB.  And we will request translations for those portions of it, and we'll make those available to the Court and to the parties as soon as they're available.  But all we can do is the best that we can do, and we have done that.  

So, I think that I've responded to all three questions, and if the Court has any further enquiries, and I'm sure Mr. Robinson may have further comments, I'll be happy to respond, but I don't see any of these three issues as something that should prevent us from going forward in this matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, as a practical matter, has the -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Webster still. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know why I'm doing this. 
MR. WEBSTER:
No problem.  I don't see it as an insult, Your Honour.  I'm just making fun with the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  The judgement, has it been disclosed?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The judgement, I have copies right here next to me, Your Honour.  I can hand them out to the parties and to the registry.  I believe it has been disclosed, but I'm sure it has not made its way to the Defence teams yet.  But we have courtesy copies right here in the courtroom which I can hand out at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because the practical question with regard to translation, it may be easier for the translation unit if the Defence had an opportunity to indicate what pages they would like to have translated so that one request could go to the translation unit, incorporating both the Prosecutor and the Defence pages.  So it would facilitate, I think, efficiency in their response to the request if there was a combined request.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I agree, and we will endeavour to do that and, in fact, as soon as we break, we can have a member of the registry distribute what we've already copied for the parties, which is right here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  Well, we can remember that Mr. Webster has stood up many times in this courtroom and said that the Rule 68 has been complied with and that they have carefully discharged their obligations under Rule 68 to us, to give us information which affects the credibility of any Prosecution witness.  And he said that in writing as well.  

With respect to Witness UB, Witness UB has specifically said that he was not engaged in any criminal activity during the genocide, and when interviewed on the 18th of November 1996, he was asked, "What do you know about the attack that was launched on St. André, because you are accused of having participated in it?"  And he answered, "As for me, I never set foot there since the war broke out."  

The Prosecution has that statement of Witness UB and they've disclosed it to us.  What they haven't disclosed is the statement of several witnesses who flatly contradict that.  The first is the statement of the German priest who was there at St. André and who says, and this is K-number K0119381, "At that point I ran to the college of St. André, where the army was staying, to ask for their help.  When I came back to the parish, I saw that our refugees had been loaded in a Mazda truck.  I saw******************* **********,"  and he doesn't say the name of Witness UB.  He says, "the conseiller of," and he gives the exact secteur, which I won't repeat here.  

So, there's only one person in the world who matches this description.  It's not as Mr. Webster says, "it could have possibly referred to," "may have an alluded to."  That's garbage.  There's only one person who that refers to, and that's Witness UB.  And it should have been disclosed, and its failure to be disclosed is a blatant violation of Rule 68.  

But it doesn't stop there.  The Prosecution interviewed a survivor of the attack on St. André college, whose wife and four children were killed that day.  And that witness interview is at K0216312.  And he talks about this attack on the 10th of June, and he lists the people who came to the parish compound to collect the remaining victims and who transported them in the truck to their death, and he lists Witness UB by name.  And so Mr. Webster's claim that he searches by name of the witness doesn't disclose the Rule 68 material is wrong.  

There is another witness, also in the same connection.  An interview by Witness UB says, "I did not commit any crimes during the genocide, and you can contact Joseph Munyaneza, who will tell you that I -- who will vouch for my story."  OTP has in its possession statements of Joseph Munyaneza, at K0330856, and Mr. Munyaneza tells them that Witness UB was a killer during these events and killed people.  Now, I have other statements of witnesses who observed Witness UB engaging in distribution of weapons, other conduct that he denies.  

Now, if the Prosecution's representation that it's complied with Rule 68 is taken at face value until the Defence, through whatever means, is able to show this kind of detail of the breach, and you will only act when we've caught them in lies, when we've caught them in misrepresentations, then you are not enforcing Rule 68 as it is supposed to be enforced; you're just simply giving us what we already have, and that's not the obligation of this Trial Chamber to enforce Rule 68.  If it's only when we already have the material, when we catch them in these deceptions that you are going to give us relief, don't bother, because we simply already have the material.  But what this shows --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I take exception to that last remark because you're either being offensive, or if you don't want us to bother, why make the application?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I want you to bother -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So don't tell us "don't bother."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well.  I would like you to make an order that the Prosecution provide all material under Rule 68 in its possession, that it comply with the Rule 68 -- and I'm demonstrating to you that it isn't doing so.  And I'm asking you to suspend these proceedings until they do it.  I don't know what more evidence I have to present to you to show that the Prosecution is not living up to its Rule 68 materials.  

In 2003, in November, in my opening statement at the first trial, I said that the Prosecution had evidence from its witness Omar Serushago, that on the 7th to the 13th of April, he claimed to commit no crimes, and staying home, taking care of his pregnant wife.  And I pointed out two specific statements from OTP witnesses, OAB and DO, which said that Mr. Serushago was committing specific crimes which they observed during that period, and I pointed out that this is a violation of Rule 68 and I asked for disclosure of that material.  We've never received it.  

In my motion to compel disclosure that was filed and decided by this Trial Chamber in July of 2005, I showed you, with respect to Witness GFB, that the Prosecution have provided us four of five witness statements given by this witness.  And in the fifth one, the one that was not provided, it said it was the view of the investigators who interviewed Witness GFB that, "The witness is both emotionally unstable and a congenital liar.  It is highly recommended that all information obtained by him to date be deemed inherently unreliable and disregarded in toto."  That was the material not disclosed to us for Witness GFB.  

So now here we are with the third instance where we've caught the Prosecutor failing to disclose its Rule 68 material, and I'm suggesting that we simply cannot accept their representations, given this record, and just blithely go on with the trial, saying that, "Yes, you're getting everything you need."  We're not.  
With respect to the other question, parts of your question on UB, it's the same situation.  We have information that some of these witnesses have been interviewed by OTP, if not all of them, and we have not received any disclosure as to their statements with respect to meetings that they are alleged to have attended by Witness UB.  Now, perhaps they didn't -- they weren't interviewed about these meetings, or perhaps they didn't write it down when they told them whether or not they were at this meeting.  

But Witness UB, the primary testimony he has against Mr. Nzirorera is that Mr. Nzirorera appeared at a meeting of 30 April, at which many people were present, and said that the enemy was Tutsi.  Now, when we know that OTP has interviewed other people who attended that meeting, it's not unrealistic to believe that they would have asked those people whether or not, in fact, Mr. Nzirorera was present.  And we believe that we're entitled to that information, that is, Rule 68 material, and we believe that the Prosecutor does not -- we cannot rely on the Prosecutor to disclose and meet his Rule 68 obligations because we know he doesn't meet it in these other areas.  

With respect to translation of the judgement, Mr. President, how are we supposed to cross-examine a witness who denies commission of any of the crimes of the events in April 1994, when we don't have his judgement, which contains not only his own explanations, but all of the information against him that was brought to court?  He says that that verdict of guilty, that sentence that he received was wrong, that he's innocent, all those people were lying.  Now, to take that judgement today in Kinyarwanda and start the process of translating and expect us to cross-examine on the fly, is impossible.  We're simply not equipped to do that.  It would be part and parcel of an unfair trial to require us to cross-examine witnesses when we're receiving material at the last minute.  This material should have been disclosed in July of 2005.  

And you see that in the Karera case, for the first time, Judge Møse said, "No, you don't have the Rwandan judgement of this witness, we won't have cross-examination."  And what happened, the OTP, they ran back to Rwanda and they got it.  And that's an example of the kind of approach that has to be taken in order to guarantee the Defence full disclosure and adequate time to prepare an effective cross-examination on that disclosure.  

Contrast that with the approach that you've taken with respect to Mr. Mbonyunkiza's judicial record.  You didn't stop any cross-examination, made us continue, and you told OTP to go ahead and request -- make their best efforts in Rwanda to obtain the statements of Mbonyunkiza, his interviews of June and July of 1998, that hadn't been produced.  And here we are, three months later, we don't have them.  And I think if you look at the -- contrast those two approaches, you'll see which one works, and which one assists in a fair trial, and which one is simply used for an expeditious but unfair trial.  
And so we would ask that there be no cross-examination of Witness UB this session, there be no testimony of Witness UB this session, because we have not had adequate time to discuss, to investigate, to prepare for this witness because of the disclosure violations.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do any other Defence teams have anything to say?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, we just wish to say that Karemera's team, Édouard Karemera's team, is in total support of the representations made by my colleague Mr. Robinson.  We would also like to add that the judgement pertaining to Mr. UB dates from 1996-1997.  Witness UB is on the list of -- has been on the list for the Karemera et al trial for a very long time.  So I have trouble understanding why a judgment of UB should only have been received this last Friday.  So, there is a lack of due diligence on the part of the Prosecutor.  He has realised, and we realise, that nothing is ever done to the Prosecutor when he fails in his obligations.  

The last time the solution that you have suggested, which was suggested also in respect of the cross-examination of Witness GFJ did not work, as Mr. Robinson has just indicated.  Because up until now, this is February 2006, we are still waiting for documents pertaining to Witness GFJ which were promised to us in 2005.  

Mr. President, I am going to request that the Court applies case law in the case of Karera to indicate that there is no possibility of cross-examining UB under the circumstances.  I'd like to point out, Mr. President, that this is not only a question of a judgment, because in the Karera trial, Witness UB said that there was an appeals judgement because the Court of Appeal was seized of the matter and the Court confirmed the judgement against him.  This matter is now pending before the Rwandan supreme court.  This entire file is what the Defence wants.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  On behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse, I support all what has been said, but I would also -- unless I understood wrongly, I would like to refer to something Mr. Webster said, and this is symptomatic of his approach.  He said that, "I received a copy of the judgement on Friday and our services are at the moment studying it to see in what form it will be disclosed."  It seems to me that this is proof of an approach which consists in the systematic selection from document -- of documents so that they can be kept aside or delayed if they're going to be detrimental to the Prosecution, or delay them if they're going to help the Defence. 
So what he's saying is, "We will tell you, we will disclose to you the judgement, depending on what we think it means," and this is a travesty of the rules under -- according to Rule 68.  If you need to catch him in the act, this is difficult, but we find that this is systematic on the part of the Prosecutor.  This is true for UB and it has been true for other witnesses.  

I recall, for your benefit, Mr. President, that we have a motion pending for the Trial Chamber to postpone the hearing of all witnesses because we need to have full access to Witness T.  We have witnesses like Witness UB, Witness ASG, and others, and, generally speaking, we are much prejudiced in the way that the Prosecutor deliberately keeps all the cards on his side to force the Defence to grope in the dark.  It is no longer tolerable, and the Trial Chamber should sanction this systematic approach on the part of the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any reply, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I'll start with my response to Mr. Weyl.  I think I was misunderstood, but let me correct any misunderstanding by, at this time, handing to him the entire text of the judgement that I received from Kigali.  So, to allay his concerns, if the registry would please just hand each of these documents to the Defence teams, and I hope that will satisfy him that the Prosecution is not trying to withhold any information.  I believe what I said was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, in that regard, you had indicated that you are going to disclose the statements made by the Catholic priest. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have them available at the same time?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't have copies, but I can make copies during the break.  But, clearly, what I said is that we brought courtesy copies of the judgement that we would hand to the Accused during the break, but we'll do it at this time so that there's no misunderstanding.  What we're trying to do is go through it and see what is the most relevant portions of the judgement to be translated because it would take a considerable amount of time to translate the entire thing.  

On the issue of disclosure for UB, we keep a record of what we disclose.  There are three pages, and the font on this, I think, is 10, and all three pages list all of the documents that we had disclosed for UB.  Of these disclosures, I would say a good third of them are PVs, procès-verbals, from Rwanda.  We made requests for this material long ago, and it has come in piecemeal, but it has come in.  And any time we get it, we disclose it on the Defence.  We were not aware that the judgement was an issue until it came to light in the Karera trial.  At that point our team made independent efforts.  We obtained the judgement because we put muscle behind it.  It became an issue.  We did not know it was an issue.  As far as we were concerned, all of the Rwandan material that we were supposed to receive, we had already received and already disclosed.  

So, independent of the President's efforts in the Karera trial -- or the presiding Judge in the Karera trial, we made independent efforts to obtain this material.  Our investigators went and looked for it because it came to our attention.  And we adopt that approach in every instance.  It does not take an order from the Court or a threat of not being -- having the witness testify, but when things -- when we are aware of a lapse or of something that is outstanding, we attack it, and that's -- what resulted is those efforts that resulted in our being able to disclose the judgement this morning.  

In terms of Mr. Robinson's repeated complaints about Rule 68, EDS was established to address the very concerns that he's expressing to the Court.  It's a huge database.  It has all -- by now, it should have all of the OTP witness statements in it.  The Defence can run their own searches, using their own criteria of what would fall within the parameters of material that is helpful to them, whether they deem it to be exculpatory or simply material to their defence.  They have a full range to look through that material, and Mr. Robinson has the capacity to do so because he's already been given an access password for the EDS.  

We do the best that we can.  We are not trying to hide anything.  We have done Rule 68 searches for UB.  What we have found, we have disclosed.  I can provide a listing of the materials under Rule 68 that we have disclosed for this witness.  When we do disclose exculpatory material, we do not identify it as exculpatory to UB and flag that to the Defence.  We disclose things as they become apparent to us as materials that the Defence should have.  We do that diligently and we do that repeatedly, and at some point this Court is simply going to have to make its decision on what is reasonable in the context.  

We cannot possibly go through our database and use it as a basis to prosecute every Prosecution witness.  It's simply not reasonable in the context.  And when you look at the volume of material that we have already disclosed for UB, it would be sheer lunacy to suggest that this is not enough to base a competent cross-examination on.  There are at least 10 different -- and I'm guessing here because I'm not counting them, but I see at least 15 different Rwandan PVs, which presumably are statements from UB.  

I'm not even sure that the judgement will contain a statement from UB.  I'm assuming that it must have some reference to something that he said.  But there is more than enough material for any competent Defence counsel to base a cross-examination on, which is what the Rule 68 was intended to provide, a basis to test the witness's credibility.  We are not hiding anything, but there are practical limitations and reasonable limitations to what we can do, and simply flagging a statement that we missed is not indicative of any violation -- or systematic violation of Rule 68 by the Prosecutor.  But at some point we have to apply the standards of reasonableness, and it's in the context of UB that this Court can express itself.  

Everything that we can do, we have done, but our job here is to prosecute the three men standing on the other -- sitting on the other side of the courtroom.  We do not prosecute our other witnesses.  When we find material that is relevant to this case and relevant to -- and within the parameters of Rule 68, we disclose it, but we can only do the best that we can do, and that's what we've done.  

I'm not sure if I addressed all of the concerns, but I'll rely on the Court to remind me if there's something that needs to be addressed that I have not addressed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for clarification, when we go into closed session, will you indicate which of those six names you have statements for?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I will have to look through my notes, Your Honour.  Is that going to be before a break or after a break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it's 10:30 now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  So, after a break, it shouldn't be a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have four other questions.  I won't detail the questions, but they relate to Witness ALG, Witness AWB, Witness GFA and Omar Serushago.  So the matters that I will raise relate to those, the allegations in relation to those matters.  

Mr. Robinson, I don't know if I have omitted any matters that are important to your application, but those are the matters that we thought required further information.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think that's complete, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-morning break now.  
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 1 to 20 by Karen Holm)




(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume, and we can move straight to my question number 4, regarding Witness ALG.  Counsel for Nzirorera claims that there's an undisclosed statement, indicating that Witness ALG was present at a meeting at Kigali préfecture office on the morning of 9th April at 9:00, where weapons were distributed, which contradicts the statements.  

Secondly, Nzirorera claims that there are undisclosed statements suggesting that ALG was present at the CELA institute while people were separated to be killed, and that he communicated directly with Interahamwe, in contradiction to his statement.  

And, thirdly, Nzirorera claims that there's an undisclosed statement indicating that Witness ALG is directly responsible for the killing of 35 to 45 young men at the St. Paul pastoral centre and that he would rape the girls he spared, in contradiction to his statement.  

Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  Over the weekend, my team did a search through the Zy on -- on the three issues that Mr. Robinson mentions, and there are statements to those effects in our database.  What we are trying to confirm now is whether those very same statements are available to the Defence through the EDS.  I don't believe that they were ever disclosed.  We can disclose them now.  

With respect to the latter of the two statements, by my assessment, they are not Rule 68 material.  The witness admits his involvement at the incidents in CELA and the incidents at St. Paul's.  CELA and St. Paul are actually one complex and one -- half of it is referred to as CELA, and the other half is St. Paul.  It's really one area.  In this witness's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson (sic) --  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you are still speaking too fast.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is a witness -- this is a witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I do apologise again.

MR. WEBSTER:
It's okay.  I've gotten used to it, Your Honour.  

This is a witness who has admitted his participation in some of the events of 1994.  His admissions cover allegations against him at CELA and St. Paul's.  By our assessment, a careful reading of the two statements that I believe Mr. Robinson is referring to, do not bring them within my reading of Rule 68.  Clearly in both statements our witness is mentioned.  The declarant in those statements characterise his participation a little differently than the witness himself characterises his participation, but it is arguably not exculpatory within the meaning of Rule 68 because it does not -- this is not an incident that is pleaded in the indictment.  They simply have different --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what I don't understand, you used the phrase, "It is arguably not exculpatory."  Now, nobody else can argue with you because nobody else has seen the document.  Now, what does the Prosecution have to lose by disclosing it?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We have nothing to lose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then why don't you do it?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not a problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That will solve all his issues. 
MR. WEBSTER:
It will not solve the issues, Your Honour.  If we had a finite list of documents and the issue was, do we disclose or do we not disclose, it wouldn't be a problem.  We disclose everything.  But we have a database where there are thousands of documents in it, and we have to look for the ones that fall within the purview of Rule 68.  And that's a monumental task when we have a witness list of 80 witnesses, and it appears that Mr. Robinson's contention is that we have to use the OTP database to prosecute every single Prosecution witness, and we don't have the resources for that.  

We created an EDS, where all of this information is placed at disposal of the Defence, so that they could look for it themselves if they cared to.  That does not mean -- that does not relieve us of our Rule 68 obligations, and I'm not suggesting that it does.  Now that we are aware of these statements and Mr. Robinson's contentions, we can disclose them.  That is not a problem.  All I'm suggesting to the Court is that I was not personally aware of these two statements before.  Disclosing these two statements is not a problem for us.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
The issue of principle, if I may just add one thing, is that if Mr. Robinson has information that he wants us to look for specifically, then we can do that, if it is a Rule 68 contention.  But apparently he already has the information that he is seeking.  So, to me, much of this discussion is an exercise in futility.  There's no problem with disclosing things once we become aware of them, but given the magnitude of our records and the number of witnesses that we have to deal with, we cannot prosecute everyone.  We can only prosecute the three persons that are the indictees on this case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, so Mr. Webster and the Prosecution have been caught again violating their Rule 68 obligations.  They have -- this material should have been disclosed long ago.  The material that they have now found this weekend in response to my direct request, this is material which, had they searched, as they're obligated to do, for information which contradicts their witnesses, they'd have found in their database, just as they found this weekend.  They're not doing their job.  That's the point.  

And, again, if we simply are reacting every time we catch them not doing their job and having them produce statements for us that we've particularly identified to them already, then, respectfully, the Rule 68 process is worthless if the Defence only receives those documents which it already obtains, to show that the Prosecution is violating Rule 68.  

Now, we've shown it with UB, we've shown it with ALG.  And Mr. Webster is dancing around and fudging about the statements of ALG, about whether they're exculpatory, and there's no fudging to be had about it.  They're clearly exculpatory.  Witness ALG has pled guilty to failing to disclose -- to discharge his duties as an official of the commune.  He says he should have done more to protect the people at CLA and at the St. Paul -- St. Paul parish.  

But here's what the witness that hasn't been disclosed to us said about this Witness ALG -- and that undisclosed witness is a priest, Father Célestin Hakezimana -- he said another person is Witness ALG.  "He used to collaborate with conseillers, but I charged him particularly of the killing of between 35 and 45 young men.  He's the one who signed a warrant of arrest that was brought by Lieutenant Irakakunda (phonetic).  And together with the Interahamwe, they took these people down to Kiyovu and killed them.  In the meetings chaired by Witness ALG, he ordered us not to leave the" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, sorry, sorry, sorry.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm sorry.  That's my -- I apologise.  

"He ordered not to have the refugees leave the place without his approval, and people also said that Witness ALG would rape the girls that he had spared."

Now, this is clearly not anything that this witness has admitted to.  He's only admitted to failing to discharge his duties.  This is the most -- does this evidence affect the credibility of Witness ALJ -- G?  That's the question under Rule 68.  Mr. Webster keeps referring to the fact that he's not prosecuting his own witnesses, and I think that just is so revealing as to his attitude about Rule 68.  The Appeals Chamber said that the duty to disclose under Rule 68 is as important as the duty to prosecute, but Mr. Webster sees this as a major hindrance to his work, but it's his obligation to do it.  

And the EDS system, as you've ruled yourself, is not a substitute for disclosure, because we don't have access to it outside of Arusha.  We're not allowed to come to Arusha early to access it in preparation of our witnesses, and it contains only redacted statements, which don't allow us to search for the name of a witness like the Prosecution is able to do.  So it's a complete breakdown and failure to disclose, under Rule 68, of Witness ALG, and it shows that what is needed here is not simply asking the Prosecutor to now disclose what we've shown they didn't disclose earlier, but to do a complete and thorough search of its records to provide all of the Rule 68 material, not only for these witnesses, but for all of the witnesses that are scheduled to testify.  Otherwise, I can guarantee you we'll have this same session every time we come back here to Arusha.  This is all material that was supposed to have been disclosed before the start of the trial, and I'm asking that you stay these proceedings until they get the job done right.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other Defence comments?  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I mean, I don't think I can say anything that goes beyond what I've already said, Your Honour, but what this indicates to me is that perhaps it was a mistake to establish the EDS, because I'm willing to wager that much of the information that Mr. Robinson is using to accuse us of violating Rule 68 comes to him from a database that we placed at his disposal in order to -- in order to avoid this problem.  In terms of the redactions to the statements that are in the EDS, the redactions are of identifying information of the declarant.  So all of the substantive elements of the statement are not redacted, and they are searchable.  So, presumably Mr. Robinson is looking for information against each of our witnesses and finding it, but that's what EDS was established to do.  

Now, as I've said to this Court before, we've tried to do our job responsibly.  We cannot find every single statement that mentions one of our witnesses and disclose it.  It's an impossible task, and that's why we provided this electronic resource.  We've done the best that we can.  I think with the volume of disclosures that have already been made, there's substantial materials for any advocate to use them against our witnesses and to use them for impeachment purposes.  I don't think we can do the job much better than we can.  That's simply the nature of this judicial process, with a fact base that is as detailed and as complex as this one and with the number of witnesses that pass before this Tribunal.  

So we do the best we can, and the Court simply has to call the shots as it sees it.  But we are not deliberately withholding information from the Defence.  In fact, we're doing everything that we can to make this process a fair one and to provide the Defence with all the material that they're entitled to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That brings me to question number 5 -- yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, thank you.  I had risen, but Mr. Webster had already started his submission.  I wanted to point out two things.  Still on ALG, a CD was disclosed to us on the 6th of February, including a document dated 24th of November 2005, a 37-page document in Kinyarwanda.  What I observe, it's dated 24th of November 2005.  To disclose it to us the 6th of February, less than a week before the start of trial is not proof of diligence.  And to provide it in Kinyarwanda -- nor is providing it in Kinyarwanda proof of good faith in providing the necessary means.  

And I should like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to a recurrent difficulty we face.  You make an order to authorise the presence of investigators in closed sessions, reminding us that that was self-evident because in open session they're allowed to be present.  Now, our investigator speaks Kinyarwanda and could help us, and our work was not allowed to come to Arusha because his work programme was refused on the pretense that the presence of investigators is not evident to court management services.  I say this to show to you how the Defence is hindered in its work.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we have indicated on many occasions that a preliminary step in addressing problems with regard to translation would be to communicate the problem through our trial coordinator to see whether administrative support can be given to address these matters.  Now, we've noted what your comment is, but it would be useful if you could do some liaison with our trial coordinator on this matter.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, with your permission, we would have done it much more -- even yet more efficiently if the document had been disclosed to us as soon as the Prosecutor had it in hand.  And since the 24th of November 2005, a lot of water has flown (sic) under a lot of bridges.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Has flowed under a lot of bridges."  Excuse me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That brings me to question number 5, regarding Witness AWB.  Counsel for Nzirorera complains -- claims that the Prosecution has in its possession AWB's statements to Rwandan authorities.  

Secondly, Nzirorera complains that the Prosecution has information in its possession, indicating that the witness was not one of the persons assigned to the roadblock he claims to have supervised and statements of other witnesses at the same roadblock who never saw Ngirumpatse.  

Those are the two matters, I think, the motion has raised concerning this witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We've looked at those issues, Your Honour, with respect to Witness AWB, and the information that we have found -- and I think we're looking at the information that Mr. Robinson has pointed us toward -- it does not fall within Rule 68, and it will not be disclosed.  We've looked at the issue, and there's nothing there that presents a problem for us under Rule 68.  So it's not an issue that I need to comment on further.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, that is not a very helpful answer because, as to your first question, the Rwandan statements of Witness AWB, Rule 68 doesn't apply.  They're obligated to give us all of their witness statements of their own witness.  And, in fact, I believe I received on Friday the Rwandan statement of AWB, which was finally disclosed six years after it came into the possession of OTP.  

Now, again, Rule 66(A)2 says that that should have been disclosed to us on the 19th of July and not on the eve of the session at which the witness is testifying.  What is the reason why, time and time again, we are not receiving disclosure in compliance with the rules?  I mean, Mr. Webster has given us absolutely no reason.  We know it was in the possession of the Prosecution because it was introduced as a Defence exhibit in the year 2000 in the Bagilishema case.  

Now, the Prosecution disclosed to us the testimony of the witness in the Bagilishema case.  Anyone reading that testimony would see that the witness's Rwandan statement had been referred to, had been introduced into evidence.  So why can't the Prosecution disclose that?  Why hasn't that been disclosed?  There's simply no justification for that.  And so now we're receiving it again, and in Kinyarwandan, on the eve of trial.  

Now, Mr. -- with respect to the Rule 68 aspects of your question, Mr. Webster says he doesn't see the Rule 68 implications of a list of people who were at a roadblock that doesn't include Witness AWB.  I beg to differ.  I think it's a matter the Trial Chamber can rule on.  Witness AWB says that he was manning a roadblock when -- you can look at his own statements -- when Mr. Ngirumpatse came by and talked about distributing weapons and ended up being involved in an incident where a person was killed.  

Now, if, in fact, there's a letter from the communal authorities, assigning people to that roadblock, which there is, because it was referenced to the testimony of AWB during Bagilishema's trial, and if AWB is not among those persons, that would affect his credibility.  That's relevant, and it's also material to the preparation of Defence under Rule 66(B).  

So you want to give Mr. Webster carte blanche to decide what is exculpatory and what should be disclosed, and time and time again, we show you that his judgement, on Rule 68 matters, is flawed.  He sees it as a hindrance, as a way of prosecuting his witnesses that he doesn't want to do.  And I think you have to take some action or else we're simply going to be in a situation where the trial of my client and the others is unfair.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, any other Defence comments?  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  First of all, with respect to the statement that was recently disclosed, as Mr. Robinson has pointed out, it was a Defence exhibit.  It's not an exhibit that the Prosecutor obtained independently.  It came to us through the trial process in Bagilishema.  Now, clearly the Prosecution, as an office, was aware of the existence of this statement since we prosecuted Bagilishema, but as a practical matter, it was not in a searchable form in our database.  And we would have had to have reviewed -- this team would have had to have reviewed the entire contents of the Bagilishema trial in order to locate this statement that came to us from Bagilishema's Defence.

Now, with the objection to disclosing it, we disclosed it.   We simply did not know about it until Mr. Robinson brought it to our attention.  He has it now, and we did not try to conceal it from him.  We simply were not aware of it then, and when we became aware of it, we disclosed it.  

With respect to the allegations at the roadblock, the information that Mr. Robinson is alluding to was disclosed in an exhibit that -- of the list of names of persons at the roadblock in Kibuye.  It may not be the exact document that Mr. Robinson has in his possession that he claims is a disclosure violation, I'm not sure.  I don't know.  But that information was already in the hands of the Defence because it's a Prosecution exhibit.  I don't recall the tab number, but it's on the list of exhibits that were disclosed to Defence, the same information that he's alluding to.  

The information itself, in my estimation, is not a Rule 68 violation.  Simply because a bourgmestre designates a list of ten people to go to a roadblock does not exclude our witness being present at the roadblock.  So to me that's not a Rule 68 violation.  It has nothing to do with impeaching the credibility of the witness.  The list -- or that fact does not suggest that only ten people, and only ten people on a list specially prepared by the bourgmestre, are allowed to be at a roadblock.  So these are all things for interpretation, but the information itself was already in the hands of the Defence.  

And as for witnesses that state that Ngirumpatse was not present, that is not an accurate description of the content of any of those witness statements.  There are witness statements that comment on that roadblock, and in their statements, they don't mention Ngirumpatse.  That does not mean that on the date that our witness claims that Ngirumpatse was there, that that information is impeachable.  We're talking about a roadblock that was in existence for three months, continuously, or intermittently, and simply because a witness comments on that location and doesn't mention everything that our witness mentions, does not make that information or that witness statement exculpatory.  

So we will live and die on our assessment of the information where Witness AWB is concerned.  I am confident that to the extent -- with regard to these allegations, these specific allegations, that we have done the necessary work, and we've disclosed everything that Mr. Robinson is entitled to.  So I have nothing to say with regard to AWB.  When Mr. Robinson, before this Court, has pointed out errors on our part or lapses on our part, I've admitted them.  With respect to AWB, I've looked at the information.  There's no violation, and there's nothing to disclose.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, just briefly if I could respond, first of all, as to Mr. Webster's statement that this list of people at the roadblock is already a Prosecution exhibit, I'm wondering if he could furnish us with the tab number of that because I don't find that.  Perhaps I'm mistaken.  

Secondly, this is now a new problem, different than the problems we've had before when the Prosecution simply hasn't had something in -- called to their attention and they find it and now they're willing to disclose it.  Now we have an issue as to the scope of Rule 68, and it's our contention that Mr. Webster is applying an improper standard of Rule 68, that something has to be absolutely conclusive as to the innocence of the Accused or conclusive as to the credibility of the witness before it can be disclosed; whereas the jurisprudence says that things that -- material that tends to be exculpatory, it tends to affect the credibility of a witness, tends to show that the Accused didn't commit the crime, has to be disclosed.  And so what we have is a situation where the Trial Chamber is needed to give the parties a proper interpretation of Rule 68, so that we're playing on -- we're speaking the same language.  

Now, if, in fact, there are people -- there was a list of people who are manning a roadblock and a witness who claims to have been at that roadblock is not on that list, yes, that is not conclusive to the fact that the witness could otherwise have been on the roadblock, but it tends to undermine his testimony that he was there, and it should be disclosed on that basis.  

Similarly, when other witnesses are at the same roadblock and they don't see the president of the -- they don't report seeing the president of the MRND coming and engaging in behaviour that's alleged to be incitement to genocide, it's true, it's possible that they could have seen it and not reported it in their statement, but on the other hand, it tends to show that such an incident did not occur -- or did not likely occur, and it should be disclosed.  In addition, it's material to the preparation of the Defence under Rule 66(B) because it would assist us to know the identity of persons who are manning that roadblock so we can go and check with them and find out whether Mr. Ngirumpatse was seen at that roadblock.  

So on this issue, we think that you have a call to make.  You can call it either way, but we believe that if you simply tell Mr. Webster to continue to do the best he can to pursue his Rule 68 obligations, then you're basically, in effect, ratifying his interpretation of Rule 68, which we claim is legally erroneous.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, this brings me to question number 6, regarding Witness GFA.  Counsel for Nzirorera claims that the Prosecution has interviewed witnesses to the events in Mukingo commune who have refuted allegations by GFA and CBU (sic) about officials who gathered on 7 April 1994, in Nzirorera's mother's house.  Statements by these individuals have not been disclosed.  Seven names have been listed.  I don't think I need to repeat them.  

Mr. Webster -- sorry.  He also alleged under this heading that GFA testified in the Ndindiliyimana case on the week of 30th January 2006, and he has not yet received the transcript.  Those are the issues raised.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin by responding to Mr. Robinson in regard to the last matter.  I direct him to tab number 24 in our exhibit bundle, which is a list of persons at the roadblock.  It's a letter from Bagilishema that had been previously disclosed and should be available to him under tab 24.  

Moving on to the issues concerning GFA, I've looked at all of those statements and those issues.  By my assessment there's nothing to be disclosed.  Of the list of names that he provided, only two have actually spoken to -- we have documentation of conversations between two of those witnesses and OTP investigators.  I've looked at those statements.  If they have not already been disclosed, there's nothing in them that would require them to be disclosed.  There was such massive disclosure concerning the events in Ruhengeri, during the initial phase of this case, Mr. Robinson may already have those materials, but if he doesn't, there's nothing in what I looked at that would bring it within Rule 68.  

There's one witness that made statements to Rwandan authorities.  I don't believe that that material is pertinent.  I have not looked at those specific items myself, but I am comfortable relying on the assurances that I've received that none of this material falls within Rule 68 for Witness GFA.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If I had said -- or referred to allegations by GFA, the other witness should have been GBU.  I might have said "CBU," but it should have been "GBU." 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I understood who you meant, Your Honour, GBU, and what I've said in relation to GFA also pertains to GBU.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I think this is a situation similar to what we've encountered before with Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  We have spoken with, for example, the first witness, the second witness, and the third, the fifth, and the sixth witnesses on this list, and they have told us that they were either present -- basically, they've given us information which refuted directly the testimony of GFA.  Witness number 1 was present at the scene and says that the authorities listed by Witness GFA and GBU were not there.  

Other witnesses, for example, Witness -- the second witness on my list, who is supposed to have been one of the people who were there, says he wasn't there, and the same with the sixth person on the list.  

And they've all said that they were interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor, some on multiple occasions, and that they have discussed with them the events of the morning of the 7th of April, and that in that discussion, they made no references to these supposed meetings, which they believe never occurred, in recounting those events.  
And so, again, we have a situation where people that -- we've talked to people personally.  They've told us -- they've given us exculpatory information.  They've told us they've given the same information to the Prosecution, and we don't have disclosure of it.  I don't know how much further I can take it than that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Any other Defence comment?  

In the absence, any reply, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'm simply going to repeat what I've already said.  So I don't think I need to reply any further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good enough.  Thank you.  

Well, this -- yes, the transcript. 
MR. WEBSTER:
My understanding, Your Honour, is that there's already been some communication between our associate legal officer and the Defence teams.  We'd indicated to him that the transcripts are not available in TRIM yet and that as soon as they're available, we'll disclose it to the Defence.  But on that note, I'd like the Court to take note that all these materials are -- I'm not suggesting, once again, that we do not have an obligation to serve this material on the Defence.  Clearly the rules are telling us that.  But since the enactment of these rules, the technology has gone beyond them, because the same database that we access to provide these materials are available to the Defence.  And Mr. Robinson in the past has even written personally to the registrar, thanking him for making this electronic database of TRIM available to the Defence, which he can access from California.  

So while we will wait for the document to arrive where it is supposed to be, we will access it, we will make copies and serve it on the Defence, we don't have it yet.  The Defence has the same capacity that we do to go into TRIM and print out the transcripts once they arrive there.  That's the procedure we use, and the same procedures that we use, the Defence themselves can use and do use.  But the short answer is, we don't have it.  As soon as we have it, we will disclose it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, this brings me to the final question, question number 7, regarding Omar Serushago.  Nzirorera claims that the Prosecution took a statement from the witness in February 2005, but it was not disclosed until November 2005.  He also lists 14 people who have been interviewed by the OTP who contradict the allegations of the witness.  

Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
With respect to Omar Serushago, I would actually request that the Court give us additional time to look into this matter.  We were here yesterday, and, unfortunately, the server went down, so I was not able to conduct all of the searches that I intended to.  Because, usually, in response to this motion, we look at each name individually and do a Zy search to confirm or to investigate what Mr. Robinson has alleged, and I cannot say to this Court that I've done that with respect to all of the witnesses listed in the portion of the motion that deals with Omar Serushago.  

We've gone through around half of the list, and half of what we've looked at does not appear in our database as persons having spoken to the OTP.  But before I comment on the entire list, perhaps the Court could give me another opportunity to consult the -- our search engines.  It was not working yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, perhaps Mr. Webster can address the question of the February 2005 statement not disclosed until November 2005.  
MR. WEBSTER:
What is the explanation that the Court is seeking in that regard?  Is it that the statement has not been disclosed, the Defence does not have the statement, or... 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we're not trying to direct you what to say.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If I can clarify what was in the motion, the point is that all statements of witnesses under Rule 66(A)2 were due to be disclosed on the 17th of July 2005.  We've shown that Mr. Serushago gave a statement to OTP in February of 2005 and that Rule 66(A)2 was violated and that the statement was not disclosed to us until November of 2005.  Perhaps your question is -- to Mr. Webster is to why that disclosure was not made in compliance with the rule.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, all I can do is state the obvious.  When we find the material, we disclose it promptly.  Apparently, that statement did not come to our attention until after -- until the point at which it was disclosed.  When we find the material, we disclose it.  I'm assuming that Mr. Robinson is accurate in his statement that the statement is dated February 2005.  I haven't looked at it myself, but if that's the case, we simply will live with the Court's assessment of that episode.  When we discovered the statement, we disclosed it.  We did not know of it prior to the date on which it was disclosed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, actually, Mr. President, not to belabour this particular point, but I point out that in September of 2005, I let the Prosecution know that I heard that Mr. Serushago had made a statement in February that had not been disclosed to us, and I asked them to look into it.  In another meeting we had with the legal officer in October when we were discussing missing disclosure, that was also brought to the attention.  

But, Mr. President, again, I just want to point out that it's the Defence that's suffering from these lapses, and they're repeated.  And there's a whole team of Prosecutors over there on the other side of this courtroom, and they're -- time and time again, they're shown to have not complied with the rules for disclosure.  And they have their own reasons and they vary.  It didn't come to our attention; we didn't -- the server was down, this, that, and the other thing.  But the accumulation of all of this is that the Defence has to -- is expected to come to Arusha and engage in a trial session when it doesn't have all of the disclosure that is required.  And unless some action is taken by the Trial Chamber to address this endemic problem, this cancer that has been allowed to grow in this case, whereby the Prosecution thinks that it's okay to come to court and hand out documents during or just before the witness testifies, as opposed to have disclosed everything in advance of the trial.  So you have to do something about this problem.  Otherwise, we're not getting a fair trial, and we're going to have rancor every time we come to Arusha.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Any other Defence comment?  

Yes, Mr. Webster, any reply?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm simply going to refer to portions of my earlier submission, that a standard of reasonableness has to govern the Court's assessment of this particular problem.  I'm simply going to reiterate that we take our disclosure responsibility seriously.  We try to pursue them diligently.  Where there are lapses and they're brought to our attention, we correct them, and we do the best we can under the circumstances.  And I'll simply leave it at that.  There's no intention on our part to hide material from the Defence.  We work at this quite energetically.  The disclosure in this case is voluminous.  We can't even keep track of everything that was disclosed.  In addition to the volumes of disclosure that we've already made, there's an EDS that has all of this information in it.  Mr. Robinson is complaining about things that he's already found from the EDS and from other Defence teams.  

When we look at the issue of moving this trial forward, and the question which looms ahead of us today in relation to this motion is whether this trial should stop because of these infractions that Mr. Robinson -- alleged infractions raised by Mr. Robinson is a serious matter.  And in terms of governing the way this case is going to move forward, reasonableness should govern how this Trial Chamber assesses this problem.  

There is mounds of material on which -- which the Defence can rely to cross-examine Prosecution witnesses.  There's so much material he cannot even get to it during the course of a cross-examination.  If we look at the example, just for illustration, of GFJ, when he testified during the last session, the issue of his -- the disclosure of his judgement and his prior statements, was so prominent in Mr. Robinson's complaint, and when we got to his cross-examination, he used none of it -- or very little of it.  So while I respect that the Defence has an entitlement -- and I'm not suggesting that the Defence is not entitled to disclosure -- we all have to be reasonable about these questions.  We cannot track down every single piece of paper that has the name of one of our witnesses on it and disclose it to the Defence.  We do the best that we can, and we're trying to have a fair process, one that is fair to all and one that is efficient.  And I do not think that it would be efficient for this Court to stop this trial on the basis of the infractions that Mr. Robinson is alleging.  

Where there are lapses we've corrected them, and we do the best we can to make all of this information available to the Defence.  It's a huge database at his disposal.  So on that note I'll conclude, but my submission is to the Court that this trial should proceed, that UB, who is waiting in the wings, should be called to testify as our first witness.  As a practical matter, he's the only witness that is available to testify today and for the rest of this week, and we need to move forward.  So on that note, I would submit to the Court that Mr. Robinson's motion and Mr. Ngirumpatse's motion should be denied.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, there were certain matters which you were going to disclose in closed session, which we should hear before we conclude this phase of our deliberations.  Are you ready to do that now?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I am, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am somewhat dissatisfied with Mr. Webster's answers.  He's saying that we've got to move on, but it is the Accused people who are suffering from the delays on the part of the Prosecution.  But I must repeat what I said before:  The aircraft that takes off without checking it's working, you move on, and then the Prosecutor tells you, "Well, I'm not ready; I don't have those details on such and such a witness.  I shall do my best, but we've got to move on."  It's like a cyclist who doesn't see the end of the road and comes up against obstacles that he has not planned for.  It's like you get information from the Prosecution 24 hours before the trial starts.  It must be understood, Mr. President, that the Defence cannot work like this.  This is not fair.  

If there is a piece of an element of evidence that is lacking for a witness to be assessed in terms of credibility, it affects the Defence's ability to conduct its examinations-in-chief and cross-examinations.  The Prosecutor is depriving us of an overall view of the case.  And we were supposed to have a clear idea of where we were going, since the 19th of April 2002.  Each time he tells you we do not have the right information, the Defence has to manage, and he says, "We have to move on."  We cannot move on like that without access to the Prosecution's documents, which he discloses to us only in dribs and drabs, because he wants to say that we should move on.  Because in the end, the Trial Chamber and the Accused are taken hostage by the Prosecution's inefficiency.  

So I would like to express my full support of the representations made by Mr. Robinson.  I think the Trial Chamber has clearly understood the position in which the Prosecutor insists on placing the Defence in.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the public, I should inform you that we're about to go into a closed session, at which the public will be excluded.  The reason for this is that a number of witnesses have been the beneficiary of protective orders, and the main import of these orders is for steps to be taken to prevent their identity from becoming public knowledge.  What is about to happen will reveal the identity of protected witnesses, and we have to ask the public to leave so that we can go into a closed session for this purpose. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 36 to 42] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
