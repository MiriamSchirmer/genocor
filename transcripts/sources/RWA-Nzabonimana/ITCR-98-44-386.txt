P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  We have delayed the coming in of the witness because of an issue which we feel should be resolved before we start these proceedings today.  

Prosecution, we believe you have an issue with the next witness.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, good morning.  It's true that we have an issue with -- with the next witness.  I discussed this last night with my learned friends and I informed them  that I'd received notice that CNAE -- was supposed to be our next witness after this witness -- was not well.  And I requested them that I will be making an application this morning to request for the substitution or the change -- the order of change of the order of appearance of CNAE and instead have CNBA called this morning because of that illness.  And, obviously, I was a bit shocked when they said that they would be opposing that application this morning.  

So that's where we stand right now.  I still have to -- I have sent one of my team members to find out what is the position right now, but we had organised to have CNBA here and I believe CNBA is outside the court.  As the Court pleases.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor yesterday told us that his witness had a headache.  That is all we know today.  There are some real headaches, and there are also diplomatic headaches.  We asked the Prosecutor to send us a medical report showing that this witness cannot at all appear.  This witness, CNAE, besides the fact that the change in the appearance poses a real problem for us, it is extremely important that his testimony -- his examination and his cross-examination be completed before Judge Rajohnson goes to Rwanda in order to be here for (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) examination -- in order to be there for the examination and cross-examination of (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal).  You heard the long examination.  I'm paying attention; I noted that we are in -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I guess counsel meant "open session".  He didn't say it.   
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
-- but if out of security -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we would like to go into a short closed session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 	
Very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we regret -- members of the public, we request you to leave now as the issues we are going to discuss may concern security of witnesses. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 3 to 28] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
