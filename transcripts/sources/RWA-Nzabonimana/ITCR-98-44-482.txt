P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday the 29th of June 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The appearances are the same.  

Ms. Hounkpatin. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President, good morning, Your Honours, good morning to all the courtroom.  I noticed this morning that Mr. Ngirumpatse is not present, and I would be telling you a lie if I said that I was surprised at that.  In fact, I saw him yesterday after the hearing and he was very tired, and he found the conditions at the UNF (sic) rather difficult for him because he has to clean up his cell himself and put his things in order all by himself.  It is for these reasons, I believe, that he is not able to be present in court today.  

Yesterday, when his blood pressure was taken it had increased significantly, and that is not a reassuring factor in terms of his health condition that we are all aware of, because his pressure has to be stable and within the normal range at all times.  

Mr. President, allow me at this time also to tell you that what Mr. Guindo said yesterday are at great variance with what Mr. Ngirumpatse told me relating to his having been brutally transferred to the UNDF without any due consideration.  This brutal manner of transferring him, Mr. President, is a demonstration of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, when you use very strong language like "brutality", that's an issue which is going to have to be addressed, and I'm going to have to get Mr. Guindo to make statements in rebuttal of it, if he wishes to.  So, continue, but bear that in mind.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Mr. President, I'm mindful of that.  Let me continue by saying that all puts to question your decision, because there is a demonstration of a will not to respect the conditions that were laid out by the registry and which are contained in your decision.  This will have a bearing on our entire defence to the extent that the -- our client is not granted the minimal conditions.  

That is what I wanted to say, Mr. President.  Because, to my mind, this amounts to refusal to implement your decision.  I therefore do not object to another investigation being conducted, or even if somebody from the registry were commissioned to verify the true conditions in which Mr. Ngirumpatse finds himself at the UNDF.  

I saw him yesterday.  He told me about his health, and said that if he didn't feel very well this morning he would not be present in court.  Yet he granted me permission to be present on his behalf during Mr. Bagosora's testimony.  

By the way, Mr. President, we have a new member on our team.  Jean-Chrysostome Ntirugiribambe, spelt N-T-I-R-U-G-I-R-E -- R-I, rather -- B-A-M-B-E.  He is our new legal assistant and he is sitting on the bench with Raphaël Constant and the other assistant -- legal assistant of Mr. Nzirorera's team.  

Mr. President, I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Hounkpatin.  We take note of what you said and we will make some enquiries.  I should remind you that I'm -- the President's office had Mr. Ngirumpatse in a safe house, thinking it was in his best interests, but Mr. Ngirumpatse requested to be transferred to UNDF, alleging that it was important for his defence that he be located there.  And so the language used in that application, I thought, was a bit discourteous.  But I -- but we reacted immediately to his request, which he said was essential for his preparation for his defence.  So he has received the accommodation that he requested.  

However, I will ask the registrar to make the appropriate enquiries, and I presume I will get an answer by tomorrow morning on those issues, and I will let you know the result of that.  We appreciate his granting permission for the proceedings to continue in his absence, and we will probably, if Mr. Webster needs an extra minute or two this afternoon, we may take advantage of the situation and allow him to complete his cross-examination this afternoon.  

And, just before you conclude, I just express a warm welcome to your intern, and I hope he has an enjoyable and successful tour of duty here.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:  
Mr. President, just one comment in respect of Mr. Ngirumpatse's application to be transferred back to his room at the UNDF.  That was a normal application from someone who is in prison and who, therefore, is expected to develop his defence case.  You know, he did not disagree with being in the safe house.  It was simply a timely arrangement at a specific time.  But when it comes to his Defence case, as such, it was absolutely necessary for him to be in possession of all his documents.  And it is on those -- for those reasons that he wanted to be at the UNDF.  

In any event, no prisoner would like to be locked up, because the best condition would have been to have been a free person.  But such is not the case.  Incredible as it may be that he applied to return to more difficult conditions for him, the point is that it was necessary for him to make that application and to return to circumstances which were conducive for his defence case.  

It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that he made that application.  

And, furthermore, Mr. President, maybe you think that I am exaggerating somewhat.  But let me say that it is good to be in a safe house, but after spending a year or so the safe house becomes a place of isolation for someone who may need to be in contact and discuss with other people, particularly in respect of a case that is so important to him.  So I hope the explanation that he has given you should be well taken, because they relate to the reality of his experience.  

So it cannot be said that he turned down your kind offer of a beautiful house to him.  No, that is not the case, Mr. President.  He would have preferred to have been staying under better conditions than the UNDF, but that is the case we have before us today, Mr. President.  And I thank you for your kind attention.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Hounkpatin.  And your words are well noted.  

Mr. Bagosora, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The time has come for you to face Mr. Webster in cross-examination.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  And Mr. Webster will now begin his cross-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me begin by wishing everyone a good morning to the Bench, the Defence, and to you, Colonel Bagosora.  

And especially to the Ngirumpatse Defence team, I would like to express our appreciation for Mr. Ngirumpatse's consent to allow us to go forward in his absence.  I'm sure he's well represented and he's present in the courtroom at least in terms of his legal representation.  So thank you to his Defence.  
THÉONESTE BAGOSORA (continued),
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning, to you, Colonel Bagosora.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me also indicate for the record that this morning I distributed two binders of documents.  It is quite voluminous.  I don't think we will get through everything, but these materials were compiled over the last week or two, and I was not able to extract things that may be extraneous.  So don't be alarmed.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, you know all three Accused in this case personally, right?  It's not just a professional relationship that you had with them in 1994; you're personally acquainted with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Joseph Nzirorera, and Édouard Karemera.  
A.	Yes, I know them. 
Q.	And this is going all the way back to the mid-'70s when you started your own professional career.  You've known them and interacted with them consistently since that time; would that be accurate?  
A.	Yes, I know them. 
Q.	And your relationship with them actually started through your association in the MRND party when it was a single party, and you had a right to be a member of the party and interacted with them as party members.  
A.	What relationship are you talking about?  
Q.	Well, I'm giving you an opportunity to explain.  I know that you're well acquainted with them, and what I'm suggesting to you is that your association also had to do with your activities as members of the MRND party when it was the single party in Rwanda, which is prior to 1991.  
A.	I have known them as individuals or persons who lived in Kigali town.  I knew them as civil servants, and that's it.  
Q.	Well, if we used -- if we took Joseph Nzirorera as an example, didn't your relationship with him go beyond that?  Didn't you have a personal friendship with him?  
A.	We were friends, we had a friendly relationship. 
Q.	And for Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Édouard Karemera would you say the same?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Would it be fair and accurate to say that you shared a common interest and held common views for the future and for the best interests of the nation back in 1994?  
A.	I did not ask them what their thoughts were.  However, we are and we were persons who defended the cause of the republic.  
Q.	And is it fair to say that your relationship with them never faltered over the course of April to July 1994?  
A.	From April to July 1994?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	I believe that in my examination-in-chief I already told the Court when and how I met them.  The MRND executive committee met on the 7th, in the morning, and I saw them again on the 8th, in the morning.  And throughout the day, practically.  
Q.	Can I interrupt you for one second.  

Colonel Bagosora, if you see my hand go up, I'm simply asking you in a non-obtrusive way to pause for a second, and I can restate or refine my question.  

I understand that you told us about the meetings on the 7th of April.  We're going to get to that, but that's not what my question addresses now.  I'm just talking about your relationship in very general terms.  So let me rephrase it.  What I'd suggest to you is that your relationship, professional, friendship, social, with Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and Édouard Karemera, didn't falter, didn't get any worse over the course of April to July 1994.  And, if anything, it probably improved, just given the dire situation that you all had to confront together.  Now, would you comment on that proposition, please?  
A.	Yes, that is exactly what I was driving at.  To tell you how many times I met them during that period, and then you would determine for yourself the nature of our relationship.  I told you that we had friendly relationships, and I had nothing to do with their political party, I was not a member of their political party, I was not involved in their activities because I was busy with my own activities.  I was director of cabinet of the ministry of defence.  They did not come to work there, and I did not work at the offices of their party.  So I saw them now and then during that period, on a few occasions, for very specific reasons.  

Now, when you talk about "relationships", I don't know what you are referring to and I would not agree with that.  
Q.	All right.  Well, thank you for your response.  

Would you say that they appeared to have continued respect for you and confidence in you over the course of April to July 1994?  
A.	I believe that they are in the best position to say whether they trusted me or not. 
Q.	My question was:  Did they appear to trust you and have confidence in you?  So it's calling upon your perception of them.  
A.	Are you asking me to speculate on what may have appeared to be?  
Q.	No, I'm asking you to think back to the period of April to July 1994 and reflect upon your interactions with these three persons, and tell us if, based on those interactions, if they appeared to have confidence in you and respect for you during the course of that period, April to July 1994.  
A.	I did not see anything pointing to the fact that they did not have confidence in me.  
Q.	And each of the three Accused in this trial testified as a Defence witness in your trial.  Right?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And here you are today in their trial testifying on behalf of Joseph Nzirorera, at least.  Right?  
A.	Correct. 
Q.	So we can assume that at least Joseph Nzirorera trusts you and shares your confidence to the extent that he testified in your trial and here you are today testifying on his behalf in his trial?  There must be some degree of trust and confidence; would you agree with that?  
A.	Well, if one were talking about the meeting I had with the members of the executive committee of the MRND, who else could have testified about that except those three persons whom I met?  So I called them in my defence because they were also eyewitnesses to that meeting, and they have called me as well, so that I can testify that, yes, indeed, I met them on that occasion.  So it is not a matter of friendship, it is an issue of eyewitness testimony, unchallengeable eyewitness testimony, which you are fully aware of.  
Q.	All right, thank you for your response.  I was really trying to get to the issue of trust and confidence, but I suppose you've answered my question.  

In any case, where trust and confidence with your associates is concerned, certainly you'll agree that the minister of defence, up until July 1993, who was your boss for over a year, James Gasana, he clearly mistrusted you; isn't that so?  
A.	I became aware of it through his writings and through his behaviour.  He did not trust me.  
Q.	And you rely on a memo from James Gasana to demonstrate that you were empowered to lead from the 6th to the 7th of April 1994; isn't that so?  
A.	I did not understand your question.  
Q.	My understanding of your testimony in direct examination is that the memorandum that James Gasana wrote on the 27th of January 1993, outlining the responsibilities and prerogatives of staff of his ministry, was put forward by you, through your testimony, as a basis for you to exercise authority on the night of the 6th to 7th of April, and for you to criticise Augustin Ndindiliyimana.  Wasn't that the substance of your testimony yesterday and on Friday?  
A.	Yes, I relied on that directive from Gasana.  
Q.	To empower you, or to justify the initiatives that you took.  That's the point that I'm trying to make.  Isn't that so?  
A.	First of all, in what circumstances was that directive issued by the minister of defence at the time?  He issued the directive because he was to participate at the negotiation taking place in Arusha, here.  And because he was a new minister at the ministry of defence, and I was also new to that position, I had just joined the ministry of defence in my capacity as director of cabinet shortly before, so he deemed it necessary to issue such a directive outlining, by way of instruction, the limits of the powers of the director of cabinet, whom I was, and who would be sitting as in -- as acting minister in his absence.  He therefore had to delineate my duties.  That was a definition that was at variance with the duties outlined in the presidential order appointing the director of cabinet.  

So, Gasana's directive was valid in his absence, except such directives were to be repealed by a subsequent minister.  He left, another minister took over, and those directives were -- were not modified.  So it is on those directives only that I could have relied, because there was no new directives, no amendment, or no cancellation of those directives.  

What I therefore want to point out is that these were ministerial orders that were in force at that time.  
Q.	What I would suggest to you, Colonel Bagosora, is that James Gasana, as minister of defence, issued those directives to limit you.  And you, in particular, as well as other members of his staff, who he assumed or had reason to believe were trying to circumvent his authority.  So the memo was not written to empower you, it was actually written to limit you.  Isn't that so?  
A.	Mr. Gasana was a Prosecution witness in my case.  He was supposed to appear, but he did not.  He did not come here to provide explanations to the very point that you are raising here.  I am not in a position to answer on his behalf.  All I can say is that I received those ministerial instructions, and I implemented them.  
Q.	The memo was issued after you had abandoned the delegation in Arusha.  You were a member of a delegation, a government delegation to negotiate the Arusha Accords, the delegation was headed by James Gasana at the time -- or, it wasn't headed, he was certainly a significant member of the delegation.  You abandoned those negotiations sometime after the protocol and power sharing was signed on the 9th of January 1993, and James Gasana, who remained behind in Arusha, then issued those directives.  Isn't that the context in which those directives were issued?  
A.	I did not abandon.  You are using an improper term.  And in my trial, that is not how the Trial Chamber understood matters, and I think I gave explanations at length there.  I returned home upon the orders of the president of the republic, who had signed my mission order to come and take part in negotiations.  So I returned home on the orders of the president of the republic.  
Q.	When you left Arusha, wasn't it said that you claimed you were going back to Rwanda to organise the apocalypse?  This is back in January of 1993.  
A.	You have to revisit my judgement, and I think you have it.  The witness who came and said that was not deemed to be credible.  He was not credible.  
Q.	Well, let's have a look at what James Gasana himself says.  And I would direct us to a document -- bundle B15, which is a statement that Gasana made to investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, back on the 29th of March 1997.  

And if you wait a moment, Mr. -- Colonel Bagosora, I will hand you up a copy so that you can read along with me.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could hand this to the witness, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, sorry.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, if you direct your attention to page 4 in the French, and in English it's on page 3 at the bottom.  It's not necessary for me to read verbatim.  If I summarise anything incorrectly, Colonel Bagosora, please bring that to my attention.  

But here James Gasana is saying that he accepted you, Colonel Bagosora, as director of cabinet basically because he was opposed to your being nominated army chief of staff.  And that given the treacherous politics within the ministry at the time, he had to concede and accept you as his director of cabinet, as the lesser evil of other choices that President Habyarimana was offering him at the time.  Is that true?  
A.	That is what -- the testimony of Minister Gasana, isn't it.  
Q.	Yes, but you're on the witness stand, and I'm asking you, that accepting you as director of cabinet was an accommodation that he had to make.  
A.	You understand that I was not present at the meeting in which I was chosen.  It is not said anywhere -- or, he does not say anywhere that I was a lesser evil.  I didn't take part in the meeting in which they agreed to choose me as a director of -- as directeur de cabinet as a lesser evil.  I did not take part in the meeting.  Therefore I am not in a position to answer your question. 
Q.	Well, Colonel Bagosora, you may not have been a part of the meeting where the nomination was made, but certainly you had conversations with President Habyarimana, you may have had or should have had conversations with Serubuga, with Rwagafilita, with other members of the staff and other FAR officers.  Didn't you understand from your conversations and your interactions with your colleagues back in June of 1992 that you were imposed on James Gasana, and that this was a concession for not appointing you chief of staff?  
A.	I have a problem with my headset.  I cannot hear you well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you assist, please.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let me rephrase and summarise my question to you, Colonel Bagosora.  

Couldn't you tell, from your interactions with other staff members and other officers, that your appointment as director of cabinet was an accommodation that had to be made because the original intention was to appoint you -- or, what you sought was to be appointed army chief of staff at the time?  
A.	Sincerely speaking, I have told you that I was never aware of what you are saying, and that I did not participate in any meeting that was considering my candidacy for the position of chief of staff, or director of cabinet.  I was aware that I had become directeur de cabinet by presidential decree.  

Now, there's a witness who did not even dare to come here to say that before me, before this Trial Chamber -- my team has even went to see him to ask him explanations in respect of his statements, but he refused to receive my team.  And now you are using a document from a person who refused to appear here, or that you as Prosecution refused to bring here and appear as a witness in my trial so that he can explain himself, so that he can be cross-examined on what he said.  So I'm saying that I -- I was never aware of how I was appointed directeur de cabinet.  
Q.	In any case, if we turn to document B12 in that same bundle.  This is an excerpt from James Gasana's book.  Now, you told us that you learned about his attitude towards you from his writings.  Is this what you are referring to, his book, Rwanda:  From a single party state to the garrison state?  It's a book we've discussed previously in this trial.  Unfortunately, I only have the excerpt in French.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could give this to the witness, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is an excerpt of three pages from the book, starting on page 123 and going to page 125.  

But before you look at the excerpt, Colonel Bagosora, could you answer my question?  Is this the source of your information about how Gasana viewed you?  
A.	I did not read the document -- I haven't read the document, but I know that he wrote some things about me in his book.  And I had thought that we were going to cross-examine him when the Prosecution had to bring him here, but the Prosecution did not bring him.  And now you are asking him (sic) to answer questions in his place.  
Q.	In any case, on page 124, in the first full paragraph, there are a few sentences which begin with -- and I will read it in French:  

"During the meeting, the discussion, I insist in refusing that Bagosora should be proposed as a member of government and as a chief of staff.  I -- in addition to my arguments, I said that he had to go on retirement."  
It goes on, but I don't think it's necessary for us to go into all of the details.  

So, based on that, my question to you is:  Do you hold Gasana responsible for forcing you into retirement?  
A.	Not at all, because I had reached the retirement age in June 1992.  The Nsengiyaremye government had granted me a one-year extension before the problem that you are talking about arose, and my one-year extension had to go right up to June ending 1993.  And if I were to go on retirement in September 1993, the problem that I am raising is as follows, that is, in the meantime, that is in August 1993, that's on the 4th of August, we had the Arusha Accords.  And the -- and following the Arusha Accords there was a protocol according to which the armed forces had to be demobilised. 
Q.	Pardon my interruption, I think you've answered the question, Colonel Bagosora.  And my interest is in getting through the material as quickly as possible.  So if you would please bear with us and just give us the most economical answer possible.  All right.  

So you didn't hold him responsible for you being in retirement.  

According to him, however, in your writings, what you referred to as the extension of your active service from government was actually a subterfuge that you were successful in perpetrating.  Because you prepared a memo -- or, he prepared a memo to the president about your retirement, and he alleges that you altered that document before it reached the president, and was signed in a manner that was inconsistent with his intentions.  He wanted you to be retired, and instead you forged the document, President Habyarimana signed it, and you were able to remain in active service for another year.  That's his allegation.  How do you respond to that?  
A.	If I had to go over my whole trial, then you should have allowed me to come with all my documents in my trial.  I produced a report -- or, minutes of the Nsengiyaremye government of June 1992 where I was granted a one-year extension of -- a one-year extension with effect from that date.  And now from June 1992, after one year, that would have led me to June 1993.  And if it had appeared in my trial, that minister would have been asked what he was talking about, and government minutes -- and I think you should have those minutes because it's the Prosecution that offered that exhibit which I tendered for admission into evidence.  
Q.	All right.  I think you've answer the question; you don't agree with Gasana, right?  
A.	On what?  
Q.	That the extension of your active service was a result of a forgery that you perpetrated.  You can just say "No, I don't agree" or "Yes, I agree", and I'll move on to the next question.  
A.	I do not agree with him on that subject, on that specific matter. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could hand up this document to the witness, this is B13 in my bundle.  This is another excerpt from Gasana's book.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And here he has reproduced a memo or a letter that you submitted to him, I believe, dated the 1st of October 1992, entitled:  "To the minister of defence, notice of service."  It starts on page 165 in this excerpt.  And here you're proposing some sort of joint command of the FAR, and proposing that you be maintained in active service, and be made one of three people that could command the Rwandan army.  

And this was another attempt on your half -- on your -- another one of your attempts to remain in active service, in spite of the fact that Gasana and Habyarimana, President Habyarimana, were agreed that you should retire.  Isn't that so?  
A.	I haven't read the passage or the memo, and I haven't quite understood your question.  
Q.	Well, let me give you the question again.  Didn't you write a memorandum to the minister of defence, back on the 1st of October 1992, proposing a new command structure for the FAR which would include you, so that you could be maintained in active service at a higher level of rank?  So you don't have to read the documents to answer the question.  Did you do that or not?  And then we can get to the document.  
A.	I wrote a memo and -- making proposals -- a proposal to the minister, Minister Gasana, after the cabinet meeting of June 1992, which had just designated the two chiefs of staff, and which had just appointed me director of cabinet.  And so at the time the officer that was appointed chief of staff of the army, well, was not the most senior member in the highest rank, and I was asking that he should be appointed to a rank whereby he could command others.  And since I myself was a director of cabinet who had just been maintained in my duties by the government, I said -- I gave a proposal to the minister that he should examine -- or, should consider the appointment of officials to positions whereby they would be of a higher rank than their subordinates.  And so the idea was not to be maintained, because even without a higher rank I was maintained in -- in duty.  
Q.	And your proposition, however you explain it, was rejected by Minister Gasana, right?  
A.	I did not know what was the outcome.  
Q.	It was never adopted; isn't that so?  
A.	Well, when you send a memo to your boss, he deals with it the way he deems fit.  It is a different service.  
Q.	My question to you is simple:  The proposal that you made was not adopted, right?  
A.	Now, you should ask Mr. Gasana -- Mr. Gasana that you did not want to bring here.  It is to him that I sent a memo, and he is the one who knows of what he did with it.  
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, I will ask you the questions as many times as it takes for you to answer it.  Your proposal was not accepted, right?  
A.	I have told you that I did not know what was the outcome thereof.  I sent the memo, and I did not know what was the outcome of the memo that I sent.  
Q.	Well, according to Gasana, who has reproduced your memo in his book, your proposal was not adopted and it was rejected.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And, Your Honours, I would like to move that particular excerpt into evidence as the next Prosecution exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 503, five-zero-three.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 503 admitted) 
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't think we need to read the contents any further, we can look at it -- or, the Chamber can look at it another time.  So the copy that was given to the witness can actually be taken by CMS and marked.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, you also sought to return to active service when Gatsinzi was the interim chief of staff in April 1994; isn't that so?  
A.	The question, please?  
Q.	I asked you if it was true that you also tried to return to active service when Marcel Gatsinzi was the interim -- or, the acting chief of staff in the first half of April 1994.  
A.	Yes, yes.  
Q.	And according to Gatsinzi, he, too, felt that he was the victim of some sort of subterfuge, because he was asked to sign something quickly and signed it, and only after -- afterwards realised that you had managed to submit an authorising memo for his signature, which he later -- which he rescinded as soon as he recognised its contents.  Did that also happen?  
A.	Well, that is his problem if he didn't read it.  But after the downing of the presidential plane that killed the president, and after the war was resumed by the RPF, I asked the general staff of the army to recall officers that had gone on retirement the previous year.  And amongst those officers, I was one of them.  First he recalled them, and then he reneged on his word.  And, in the meantime, the minister of defence came on and a little later the interim government recalled reservist officers because of the war.  That is, he recalled them back into service.  
Q.	Well, I thank you for that response, because it covers quite a bit of the terrain that I wanted to explore with you.  

The whole point of this line of questioning, Mr. -- Colonel Bagosora, is that you've made several attempts -- I think I can count at least four or five -- to be returned to active service, and you were repeatedly refused.  You were refused by Minister Gasana in 1992, you were refused by Gatsinzi, who claims that you tried to slip something by him sometime prior to the 16th of April when he was the acting chief of staff, and you were refused again on the 16th of April when you travelled to Murambi and tried to intervene directly with the interim government who was meeting in cabinet at the time.  Isn't that so?  
A.	Well, you are making some mix-up there that I really can't follow.  You said I made an attempt -- 
MR. CONSTANT: 
Mr. President, I am sorry that I will have to -- to interrupt my learned friend, because it would have been better for him to ask one question after the other.  Because in the statement he just made there are about four or five questions, and it will be difficult to answer all of those questions together.  And he's asking my client to answer the question -- to give an answer to the four or five questions that are embedded in one question.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me rephrase it.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Didn't you travel to Murambi on the 16th of April and attempt to interrupt an interim government cabinet meeting so that you could influence them to reappoint you to active service?  
A.	Never.  
Q.	Jean Kambanda, the interim government prime minister, was called as a witness in your case.  Isn't that so?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	In fact, you called him as your Defence witness.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Because you thought he would assist you in confronting the charges against you.  
A.	Of course, and he was a credible witness.  He was deemed to be credible by the Trial Chamber.  
Q.	And a portion of his testimony, given on the 11th of July 2006, at pages 31 in the English text, he clearly states that he observed you arrive by helicopter on the 16th of April 1994.  You recall that portion of his testimony, don't you, which presumably -- well, let me end there.  You recall that portion of his testimony?  
A.	Not quite, not clearly.  However, I can tell you that I went to Murambi from Kigali time and again by helicopter.  So what we need to do is to determine where and how I asked the prime minister to recall me into service with the army.  That is the issue, isn't it?  We did not discuss it. 
Q.	All right.  If you give me one moment I will find the transcript and we can look at it together.  

Let's look at document B3 in my bundle.  It's the transcripts from the 11th of July 2006, pages 31 to 36 in the English text, pages 35 to 40 in the French text. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could hand this to the witness, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	At the bottom of page 31 in the English text there's a question:  "And do you have any recollection of the next occasion on which you met Colonel Bagosora?"  And the answer from Jean Kambanda:  "The next occasion was around the 20th, but I think the exact date could have been the 16th of April.  At that time the government had to establish the general staff of the armed forces, the minister of defence had to present the dossier.  And when we were in that meeting I saw a helicopter land not far from the room in which the meeting was taking place, and then out came Colonel Bagosora and another colonel."  

And then he goes on.  And if you read later on in the transcript -- actually, on page 33 in the English text, he clarifies that this was a cabinet meeting that was specifically centred on appointing members of the army general staff, that was what was being discussed.  Minister Bizimana left the room, went to speak to you, and came back in and explained that you wanted to address the cabinet because you wanted to be appointed army chief of staff in place of Gatsinzi, who was being relieved.  

Does that refresh your recollection of what transpired?  
A.	I was not able to locate the excerpts that you have been referring to in the document, and I know that it is available in French.  However, regarding what you have just stated, the prime minister did not ask, and I did not talk to him to ask to be appointed chief of staff.  That is impossible.  It could not have been possible for the following reasons:  I was already an officer on retirement.  I had to be called back to service before becoming an officer in active service prior to asking for promotion.  I therefore did not agree with that excerpt, because it does not hold together, it is not logical.  

However, I made a written application to the minister of defence asking to be recalled to service after the presidential order for partial mobilisation.  At that time the minister of defence turned down my application.  That is what I can remember.  

You see, it was not possible for me to ask to be promoted to any rank within the military whatsoever while I was a civilian.  I needed to proceed first by applying to be recalled into service, and then subsequently ask for promotion.  And, you see, the -- the statement is that it is the minister of defence who told him that something was told to him.  So that is not what I said, and I didn't make any such representation.  
Q.	You do recall that testimony by Jean Kambanda in your trial, though, don't you?  
A.	I have told you that he was called to testify in my trial.  And I asked him to testify on very specific points, and he answered, he provided good answers.  He made some additional statements which were not of interest to me in my trial.  So what he has stated here is not true.  Yes, indeed, the discussion with the minister of defence or whatever discussions he may have had with the minister of defence were not something that I had control over.  Was he misguided by the minister of defence?  I do not know.  I am not responsible for their conversation.  I was not party to their discussion.  I can proceed by letter.  I didn't apply to become chief of staff.  All I applied for was to be recalled to active service.  And it happened, subsequently.  
Q.	Well, let me just clarify for the record, that the transcript of the 11th of July 2006 comes from your direct examination by Maître Constant.  So the questions that Jean Kambanda was answering at that time were actually asked on behalf of your Defence, Colonel Bagosora.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I would request that the Court admit that particular document in evidence, which is the document B4, I believe, both in French and English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 504, A for French, B for English.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 504A and P. 504B admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When Jean Kambanda was being cross-examined on the same issue, he brought even further clarity to the incident, Colonel Bagosora.  And this is contained in the excerpt B5, his testimony from the 20th of November 2006.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is a portion of Kambanda cross-examination when he's being questioned about the interviews, the transcripts of the interviews he had given to the OTP back in 1997, where he explains how the other members of cabinet thought you to be so powerful, that they were a bit surprised that Kambanda would have the audacity to refuse to see you back on the 16th of April 1994.  Do you recall that portion of Kambanda's testimony?  
A.	No, I do not.  Please guide me.  
Q.	I believe you will find it on the second page in -- actually, on page 33 of the French, you have Mr. White, who was the Prosecutor, referring Kambanda to a particular document.  And he guides him through it.  And it follows on the next page, page 34 in the French text.  In the middle of the page -- and I will read it in French so that it makes it easier for you, Mr. -- Colonel Bagosora.  The question:  "Well, I will help you with some of the details.  Just after the question, the following question with the initials MD on page 34, was it not possible the -- to interpret the manner in which they arrived as being a threat?"  
A.	I am not with you.  
Q.	Well, you know what, we'll move on.  If you don't recall that portion of his testimony, it's not -- it's not critical.  

But the point of my question -- or, my suggestion to you -- it was at page 36 in the French text, and it continues on to the next page.  And Kambanda's talking about that particular incident on the 16th of April, when you arrived by helicopter.  

Why don't we -- put -- put the document down, and let's just focus on my question, Colonel.  Do you recall arriving in Murambi by helicopter on the 16th of April when a cabinet meeting was going on?  
A.	No, I do not remember, but I often went there by helicopter.  So it may have been possible.  
Q.	And you have no reason to dispute Kambanda's recollection of that particular incident, do you?  
MR. CONSTANT: 
I'm sorry, there might be a translation problem.  The question is as follows:  "You have no reason for questioning", and I do not understand what that means.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	My question is:  You have no reason to dispute Kambanda's recollection of that particular incident.  
A.	In my trial?  Or now?  
Q.	As a general proposition.  Kambanda talked about this incident back in 1997 when he was interviewed, he talked about it again in 2006, twice, in direct examination and in cross-examination, and we're talking about the general proposition that this is an incident that Kambanda remembers quite clearly and has described in detail which you claim not to remember.  And I'm asking you now, do you have any reason to dispute his recollection?  
A.	Yes, I dispute it and I refer to Witness Rusatira.  I was not with Rusatira on the 16th.  You know where he is, and he is your witness, so what he will say will be true.  We were not together in the helicopter on the 16th.  
Q.	I didn't ask you any question about Rusatira.  I asked you if you had any basis to dispute Kambanda's recollection of you arriving by helicopter on the 16th of April in Murambi.  A simple yes or no will do, and we'll move on.  
A.	No, no, not at all.  I am the one answering the questions here.  The answer I have just given you arises from what I see on page 34, line 15, where it is stated that:  "Bagosora and Rusatira arrived together in a helicopter."  Together.  And what I'm saying is that that is your witness, and my position is that we were never together on the 16th of April in Murambi.  
(Pages 1 to 16 by Kirstin McLean)








1015H
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	I will simply move on, Colonel Bagosora.  You told us about Bizimana, who was minister of defence back in April 1994, also re-directing your proposal that you be returned to active service in early 
May 1994, right?
A.	That is correct, but it was an abuse.  There was a presidential order calling back to service all officers who freely chose to do so.  And I was one of those who freely chose to do so, and I wrote like the others and the others were called to service and my application was turned down.  I insisted, and at the end of it all, I was called back into active service. 
Q.	And when you tried to intercede with the minister of defence, Bizimana, it was actually in reaction to a telegram that had been sent to several of your colleagues inviting them back into active service.  And this is the document we already have in evidence is D. NZ671.  It's a telegram from the minister of defence to a number of former officers.  I'm sure you've seen it before.  It's in evidence both as P. 448 and as D. NZ671.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, if you could show it to the witness, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you saw others being called into active service, specifically Serubuga, Ntibitura, Rwagafilita -- at least seven or eight names there -- called back to service, councillors of the civil defence, and your name is conspicuous by its absence.  You approached Bizimana and asked him to be returned to active service, right?  
A.	No, that is not what happened.  Things did not happen that way.  There was a presidential order of partial mobilisation of reserved officers, those who freely chose to apply exclusively.  Now what you have before you is another file, an entirely different issue.  The file you are looking at relates to a situation, yes, which I believe -- okay, let me -- let me repeat myself.  There was a presidential order relating to partial mobilisation.  Officers who freely chose to apply, did so.  I also applied to be recalled, but the minister of defence did not include my name on the list.  It is from that time that I protested and I asked him what had happened.  Then he wrote a letter to me, which I believe I have among my documents.  It is a letter of the 21st of May 1994.  I do recall that date.  So the same minister you are referring to called me back to active service relying on the presidential order.  So his initial failure to call me back was simply an abuse of authority.  
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, what I suggest to you is that that is not the way you described this chapter back in your own trial, back on the 9th of November 2005, when you were testifying.  And I will start by suggesting to you, you were answering questions from your own attorney, not cross-examination.  I will direct to serve document B6 in my bundle, which is the transcript that starts from page 34 in the English on that day, and starting at page 34 in English and again page 34 in French.  Again, it's B6.  And in the middle of the page, at line 15 in English and at line 17 in the French.  Mr. Constant asking you:  "Colonel, tell us under what circumstances you were reabsorbed into the army in Rwanda?"  And your answer: "In early May, there was a presidential order which decided that there would be a partial mobilisation of officers, within that context that are requested to be reabsorbed into the Rwandan army.  However, the defence minister, Augustin Bizimana, turned down my request for reabsorption."  Follow-up question:  "Why?"  And your answer, Colonel is that:  "He said that it was not necessary for me to be reabsorbed."  
A.	That is correct.  But looking at the telegram that you've placed before me, I had read only part of it.  But if you look at it, you will see that it asks the officers mentioned whether they so desire and feel ready for the partial mobilisation that was ongoing.  This, indeed, is a telegram that was issued before the presidential order was broadcast, in view of the partial mobilisation and the telegram, therefore, was asking whether there were any volunteers who would respond to the call for partial mobilisation.  It is in that context that I provided the answer you have just referred to. 
Q.	Thank you, for that.  You would recall also from your trial that Prime Minister Kambanda, testifying as a witness in your trial, suggested that Bizimana was one of the more powerful ministers in government.  I think he even called him the most powerful minister.  Do you share that assessment of Bizimana in relation to the ministers of the interim government? 
A.	I did not have the terms of reference for the various ministries in order to grade the ministers.  I simply perceived him to be the minister of defence.  
Q.	But certainly, Kambanda, as prime minister, for at least three months, would be in a position to assess the relative strength and powers of the various ministers in his government, you would agree with that?  
A.	Well, maybe he should sit here and answer that question. 
Q.	Yes, but my question is directed to you, Colonel Bagosora.  Don't you agree that Kambanda would have had sufficient experience as prime minister for three months to make an assessment like that? 
A.	Except I engage in speculation, all I can say is that I was not familiar with his intellectual capacities.  
Q.	In any case, Colonel Bagosora, you tried to re-enter active service.  You tried to avoid retirement when it was initially raised with President Habyarimana and minister of defence, James Gasana.  You tried to be recalled into active service and promoted by proposing a new command structure within the FAR, to minister of defence, James Gasana, and that too was rejected.  You tried to enter active service when Gatsinzi was interim chief of staff, and that too was rejected.  You tried to enter active service on the 1st of -- sometime after the 1st of May, by appealing directly to minister of defence, Bizimana, and that too was rejected, right?  All that is true, that's what you've discussed over the last 40 minutes or so, right? 
A.	Your rundown of the facts is incorrect.  But if you were to give me a time, I will be able to make a rundown of these events in a proper order.  In June 1992, I was appointed by the Nsengiyaremye government to the position of director of cabinet for the ministry of defence.  I was given an extension for one year till June 1993.  And during that time, I did not have to apply for work because I had a one-year contract.  Now when it comes to retirement, I retired later on. 
Q.	I apologise for interrupting you.  You have another opportunity to repeat these same details again.  I think you are telling us the same thing we heard sometime ago.  Let me proceed with my questioning and we can come back to this.  

	My suggestion to you is that you refused many times, and after the refusal of Bizimana sometime after the 1st of May 1994, you went to Joseph Nzirorera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse and appealed to them personally and complained to them about not being able to re-enter active service, and then they went and directed Bizimana to return you to active service, leading to the memorandum from Bizimana on 21st of May 1994; isn't that so? 
A.	That is correct, 20 and 21 May, 20 and 21 May, with that correction. 
Q.	You were in Murambi on the 21st of May, you complained to Ngirumpatse and Nzirorera on that day; they went to see Bizimana on that day, and almost immediately, he was turned around and reinstated you, right? 
A.	Let me tell you, first of all, that I complained to the MRND party, because as I told you yesterday, that minister had sent me on retirement prior to the due date and thereby depriving me of my allowances.  So that was not proper.  Now, I was entitled to be mobilised along with the other comrades and yet he turned down my application.  That is why I decided to talk to the leadership of his party, the MRND, and ask them why their minister was being unjust towards me.  They listened to me; they talked to their minister and later on I was mobilised.  That is the correct version.  
Q.	But what was the basis of Nzirorera's authority and Ngirumpatse's authority to countermand the decision that the minister of defence had made? 
A.	You must know that the 1992 protocol called for the parties to appoint their ministers -- or, rather, to nominate ministers.  The president of the party, therefore, had a say in what the minister's position was, otherwise he could have been replaced.  So the truth of the matter is that the party had power over the ministers that had been nominated by the party.  It is in that context that I went to see the party leaders so that they could ask their minister why he had chosen not to implement the presidential order and to deprive me of my right.  So they did, indeed, intervene accordingly. 
Q.	And not only did the party have the authority to appoint ministers, they also appointed the director of cabinet in the ministries that they controlled, right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And, in fact, on these very issues, you were able to obtain an affidavit from Joseph Nzirorera dated the 20th of March 2002, which you used in your defence, and it was entered into evidence in your case as D. B271, and it's into evidence in this case as P. 74, and basically he recounts exactly what you've just told us.  And I will read it in French:  "I, the undersigned, Joseph Nzirorera, hereby certify that Colonel Bagosora, who is on retirement, came to tell me that on the 1st of May 1994, that the minister of defence, Mr. Augustin Bizimana, had refused to follow up on his request to be recalled into active service in accordance with the presidential decree -- or, order, Number 131/06 of 6th May 1994."  I will not read the entire text.  

And there is another affidavit that was signed by Ngirumpatse, which we don't have in evidence yet, 
but -- it's document B7 in our bundle, which Colonel Bagosora, you entered into evidence in your case as D0 B216, and which I will offer in evidence now, which is signed by Ngirumpatse, the 16th of March 2002, where he clarifies how the MRND party had the authority to appoint the minister of defence, the minister of planning, the minister of family, the minister of public works and the minister of higher education, and he was explaining the decision-making process that there were regional distributions for those ministries, both at the level of the ministry and in a testimony -- your testimony explains as well, it was the party that was making these decisions.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	Are you referring to the affidavit?  I do not have it here with me.  That's my fears.  Affidavit, or are you referring to a different document?  
Q.	I am actually referring to the affidavit of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, which was entered into evidence in your trial and which was a subject of testimony on the 25th of October 2005, in your trial.  I can hand it up to you.  It's not truly necessary.  I'm just simply trying to elicit from you that that was basically the gist of that evidence, that it was the MRND party that had the authority to appoint the ministers and also the director of cabinet? 
A.	In which framework, as part of the implementation of the Arusha Accords; within the framework of the implementation of the memorandum of understanding of April 1992?   
Q.	It doesn't matter, Mr. Bagosora, because it's the same regardless.  The party has the authority to appoint both the substantive minister and the cabinet director.  These were political appointments made --
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
If I may, Mr. President.  I think that, insofar as contradictory arguments are concerned, I think my learned friend should give that affidavit to Colonel Bagosora and not merely say that it is of no significance.  I think the affidavit is very specific. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  I will finish soon in a few minutes.  Your Honour, I am just trying to end this line of questioning.  

If Mr. Issa could hand this document to the witness; it's B7.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to put things into proper context, I will refer you to your testimony on the 25th of October 2005, Colonel Bagosora, you were answering questions from your attorney, Mr. Constant, and it's at the bottom of page 81 in the English text, which is also attached to the same document, my bundle, B7.  And in the French text, it starts from page 82 and continues to the next page.  Mr. Constant can have a look at it, if I am mischaracterising what you said back in October 2005, I'm sure they will bring it to our attention.  Basically, that is your evidence in your case.  Can we agree on that?  
MR. CONSTANT:  
If I may, there is an initial question relating to Mr. Ngirumpatse's document and, please allow Mr. Bagosora to answer.  My learned friend has referred to a second document and he made a very short excerpt thereof, whereas, there is this initial question in relation to the conditions under which he became directeur de cabinet.  I think it will be appropriate for him to ask him a question, to which he will give an answer before he moves on to the next question that has to do with a different document.  
THE WITNESS:
Regarding the affidavit, I don't have any objection to make.  It is my exhibit and the affidavit is binding on the person who signed it, that is, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So, I don't have any objection to raise regarding that document.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, you agree with me that -- would you agree with me that Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse must have had substantial power back in May of 1994, if their influence as party leaders could determine the decisions that were taken by the minister of defence in the interim government, right?  
A.	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's affidavit is clear.  It is his party who nominates ministers and the directeur de cabinet and he had such powers. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I see the time.  I apologise for going over.  I think we can break now and then I will pick up when we reconvene.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned you want to admit the affidavit into evidence. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can we just admit it then?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  If we could admit the entire -- there are two documents, the affidavit and the transcript of Mr. Bagosora's testimony back on the 25th of October 2005.  We can get separate -- I see a problem of getting it one single exhibit number, two exhibit numbers, one for the affidavit and the other for the trial transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think that is better.  

Do you have the numbers, Mr. Issa?  
MR. MJUI.
	The affidavit will be P. 505, five-zero-five, and the transcript will be P. 506; five-zero-six.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 505 admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 506A and P. 506B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  And we take on our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1040H to 1148H) 
MR. HOMETOWU:  
Mr. President, permit me to introduce to you two interns, who have joined the court management section since last week.  On my right is Adventina Kiyeyeu -- K-I-Y-E-Y-E-U -- and on my extreme left is Christina Mtui -- M-T-U-I.  They are nationals of Tanzania and law students at the Mysore University in India.  They will be here for two months.  Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

And on behalf of the Chamber, we would like to welcome them to CMS and to the Karemera trial.  We hope you have a very enjoyable and profitable tour of duty in the internship.
MS. KIYEYEU: 
Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  Before I go further, I would like to admit one other excerpt from Colonel Bagosora's previous testimony.  It concerns his testimony -- his testimony on the 9th of November 2005.  It's excerpt B6 in my bundle, which I gave away this morning.  So this could be admitted as P. 507. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. P. 507 admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, you participated in the delegation that negotiated the protocols on power sharing for October 1992 and then again the delegation that negotiated the protocol on power sharing of 9th of January 1993, isn't that so? 
A.	Are you referring to the Arusha Accords?  
Q.	Yes, but those two specific protocols, both of which are identified as protocol on power sharing, one from October 1992 and the other from the 9th of January 1993.  
A.	I participated in the negotiation of that protocol in part.  I was here in Arusha from the 1st of December up until the 26th of December.  So I did not participate in the signing of the protocol. 
Q.	Correct me, if I am wrong.  My understanding is that you were in Arusha until sometime shortly after the 9th of January 1993, is that correct or incorrect? 
A.	I was here in Arusha from the 1st of December to the 26th of December 1992.  And I came back here to Arusha on the 16th of March 1993, and stayed here until the 25th or the 26th, I think, of March 1993.  That is when I was here in Arusha. 
Q.	There is a document I would like to show you.  It's a letter that bears your signature.  It's dated 15th of January 1993.  It's document B16 in my collection of exhibits.  If you look at the last page -- and we do have it in both French and English -- the last page in the French text, and if you go to the front page -- the first page, the date is the 15th of January 1993, and this confirms the protocol on power sharing that has been negotiated and signed at the previous week on the 9th of January 1993.  Is it your suggestion that you were not part of that delegation? 
A.	I don't think your question makes it possible for me to answer you -- to answer it.  I think I should explain to you the purpose of this document and the circumstances in which it was drafted and then we can move forward thereafter. 
Q.	But answer the question first.  I'm not trying to stop you.  I'm sure you can explain what you need to explain, but tell us if you were part of the delegation that negotiated the protocol that was finalised on the 9th of January 1993. 
A.	I have already answered to the effect that I participated partially in the negotiation of that protocol, and I gave you the period during which I was here; that is, from the 1st of December to the 26th of December, because thereafter I returned home, but those negotiations continued and the protocol was signed in my absence. 
Q.	What is it that you wanted to tell us? 
A.	There is a question that had to do with this document that you've given to me.  Yes, I have signed it, and you can see that I am not the only one.  I signed it with the others, like Muberuka, Ndengeyinka, Rwabalinda and Gakara.  They were members of the delegation I was part of and they remained to continue with the negotiations, but they also left.  So, they negotiated only partially, because they joined me in Kigali later.  And this is a letter that was addressed to the president of the republic to tell us our observations with respect to what we had realised in the negotiations.  

So, my colleagues, who had virtually monitored or followed all that happened during the entire period, so when they arrived in Kigali, they made the proposal to me that we send our observations to the president of the republic.  So, they prepared a draft -- so we prepared a drafting together, rather, and we put together what we have here and that we submitted to the president of the republic for his attention. 
Q.	Thank you.  And what I suggest to you is that you were not satisfied with the way the negotiations were being conducted, and I suggest to you that you opposed both protocols on power sharing, the one that had been negotiated in October of 1992, and the one that -- this one you seem to be referring to, which is the protocol of the 9th of January 1993.  You were highly critical of both, isn't that so? 
A.	You shouldn't speak in terms of opposition.  You should talk in terms of relation of reports.  We were reporting to the president of the republic about the atmosphere surrounding the negotiations and how they were being conducted, as well as the problems that were being encountered.  This does not mean that we were against the protocol as such, but if you have read this keenly, you realised that we pointed out that there were two problems about which the president of the republic had to be aware.  So the idea was to brief him on the situation prevailing at the time. 
Q.	Thank you, Colonel Bagosora.  I don't want us to read the entire document but, certainly, you are familiar with the document and what do you intend to convey.  And what I am suggesting to you is that you thought that the minister of foreign affairs, Ngulinzira, who was the head of the delegation or significant member of the delegation, was out maneuvering you.  You front those who are closer to the MRND in Arusha, and you were dissatisfied because you thought he was too close or the opposition parties were making too many concessions with the RPF.  Is that a fair summary of what you told the president in this memorandum? 
A.	Partially, and that was true, because Minister Ngulinzira was of the MDR party, so he belonged to an opposition party, and he gave concessions to the RPF, concessions that were even unjustifiable and that is true.  And this was a fact that we were bringing to the attention of the president of the republic so that he should be informed of the situation.  That's it.  
Q.	One of the things that you mentioned in this letter is that the MDR, the PL and the PSD parties and the RPF, formed a strong alliance and refused that the CDR, a party deemed by many members of the delegation to have had a major political impact be included in the government.  Perhaps I read that too quickly, but this is subparagraph C on page 2 of the English text, and it's subparagraph C, which is on page 2 of the French text, as well.  The French is saying that you are summarising what happened, which is that the MDR party, the PL party and the PSD party, along with the RPF, refused that the CDR should be included in the power sharing protocols that were being negotiated.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	You need, first of all, to understand that in June 1992, the political parties, the opposition political parties, which you referred to, they all met the RPF in Brussels, and they entered into an agreement to fight against the president.  They issued a communiqué which is available and which was used in my trial.  

What I can say is the following:  Just when we were about to enter negotiations with the RPF, the head of the delegation of the MDR who had signed that accord in Brussels to fight against President Habyarimana, is the same person whom President Habyarimana appointed as head of delegation.  So, we were informing or notifying the president that he was mistaken to the extent that he had sent somebody whom he knew was of the RPF leaning rather than of his -- rather than on his side.  So the head of the delegation was of the opposition and had been working with the RPF, and this became evident subsequently. 
Q.	Well, some of the observations or the criticisms that you've just voiced, we've heard from some quarters in this trial, it was said in relation to this last protocol in January of 1993, that it was the Inyenzi negotiating with the Inyenzi, that the government and the MRND was being outfoxed in Arusha because you had Inyenzi negotiating those accords with Inyenzi.  Was that your feeling as well? 
A.	That was not my feeling.  All I am saying is that there was a mistake to the extent that the head of delegation who was expected to negotiate with the RPF was of the MDR, the MDR party, which had already signed an agreement with the RPF in Brussels in June with a view to fighting President Habyarimana and his regime.  And that was the crux of the problem.  The same people who had negotiated to fight against President Habyarimana and his party, the MRND, were the same persons who now had to head the delegation to -- to -- to negotiate what had to be given to the others, to the MRND, for example.  

So, government was divided.  It was a coalition government under Nsengiyaremye, because we had opposition parties and the MRND in the same government.  So the MRND acted in good faith allowing the minister of foreign affairs to negotiate on behalf of the government.  But I think that this was a mistake, because the minister of foreign affairs at the time was a member of the MDR party, which was already in an agreement with RPF, which they had signed in Brussels.  And this is what was going to happen later on.  Ngulinzira was closer to the RPF than to the government to which we belonged, and this is the point we were drawing the president's attention to, and it was true.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for that lengthy response.  But aren't you -- how was what you have just said different from the criticism coming from other quarters that it was the Inyenzi negotiating with the Inyenzi?  Tell me how that criticism Inyenzi were negotiating with Inyenzi in Arusha, how was that different from what you've just explained? 
A.	Our note is clear.  You have it before you.  Did you find that word in it?  
Q.	Well, the absence of the word is the only distinction, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Allow me to read the conclusion of that note so that we can agree on what we are talking about. 
Q.	I don't think it would be necessary, Colonel Bagosora.  I will move this exhibit into evidence and the Chamber -- 
MR. CONSTANT: 
Mr. President, I believe that the rule is for the Prosecutor to put questions and for the witness to answer.  If the witness is to express his feeling by way of reading the conclusions of the note, he should be allowed to do so, Mr. President.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, we all rose at the same time, my learned colleague and myself to make the same point, namely, that the witness should be allowed to read the conclusion.  I have read through them and I think the witness should be bold to read them.  I don't see why the Prosecutor is stopping him from doing that.  He is the one -- or, rather, it is the witness who is producing -- who is testifying and not the Prosecutor.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, allow me to add that my learned colleague, Webster, have this poor habit of placing documents before the witness and drawing his own conclusions and then stopping the witness from drawing his own conclusions too from this same document in relation to the questions that have been raised.  Either he is putting the questions and expecting the witness to answer and then enabling us to proceed, or it will make things much more difficult to proceed otherwise. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I have no objection to the witness reading the document and enter it into the record.  I am simply concern --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not a document; it's just the conclusion.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The conclusions.  I still move it into evidence.  I'd like it to be given a number now.  If the witness sees anything in the document that he wants to highlight, I have no objection to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let him read the conclusion that he requested.  

Now, Mr. Issa, what is the exhibit number?  
MR. MJUI:
P. 508; five-zero-eight.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted  
(Exhibit No. P. 508A and P. 508B admitted)
THE WITNESS:
"Conclusion:  The negotiations that are expected to culminate in the conclusion of the peace agreement must follow their course, although the previous protocol had serious deficiencies in certain areas.  Any related implementation difficulties could be corrected through diplomatic channels, if need be, by calling for the intervention of the observers before the peace agreement is finally signed.  

"Considerations that are aimed purely at the immediate interest of the political interests should bow to the superior interest of the nation.  The president of the republic and the prime minister, who are primarily responsible for the handling of the policies of the country should strive towards reconciliation and pave the way for mutual understanding on the essentials in order not to widen the problem between the president's office and the prime minister's office at the risk of driving the country into ruin."

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Thank you.  Are you satisfied with the trial record having now read the conclusion of the document, Mr. Bagosora -- Colonel Bagosora? 
A.	I am satisfied for the authorisation that was given me to read that excerpt onto the record.  
Q.	What I would suggest to you is that the thrust of criticism in the letter is exactly what the CDR had been saying back in January -- January 1993 with the -- and without what the CDR was saying.  Do you have any response to that? 
A.	I was not aware of their criticism, but this document is the product of our own sovereign and autonomous thinking.  
Q.	How could you not have been aware of CDR criticisms in Rwanda in January of 1993, given all of the demonstrations and the violence that accompanied their criticisms? 
A.	I am not a member of the CDR party.  
Q.	But you are still an intelligent observant citizen of Rwanda who was present in Kigali in 
	January of 1993, weren't you? 
A.	As a Rwandan citizen I was not under any duty to know everything that was going on.  And, furthermore, I did not have the capacity to know.  
Q.	Well, I would like to turn our attention to two other documents, B17 in my bundle and then B18.  I only have them in French.  You can look at the first one first.  They are both letters signed by Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye.  The first one, B17, is a letter that was signed on the 18th of January 1994.  The second one is a letter that was signed on the 29th of January 1993.  

The first one, if you look at the first paragraph in the French text, the prime minister is complaining to the minister of interior, the ministry of defence, which was your ministry, and the ministry of justice that he had information that the MRND and the CDR political parties were going to organise demonstrations, illegal demonstrations in Kigali and throughout the country over the period 
20 to 23 January 1993.  And it goes into detail.  

And then in the following letter he talks about initiating investigations and prosecutions for the violence that followed those demonstrations.  So in the first letter the prime minister is trying to prevent those demonstrations.  And in the second letter he is dealing with the consequences of those demonstrations.  Is it your testimony today that you knew nothing about these events? 
A.	There is the knowledge that the events took place, as is reflected in these letters which were copied to all ministers.  So it is possible that in my position as director of cabinet, I may have read that letter.  However, I did not follow up or follow the activities or the demonstrations and events that have been narrated in this letter.  

Let me draw your attention to the fact that I was not of the ministry of the interior and that I did not work for the gendarmerie, which was in charge of maintaining public order.  I worked in the ministers' cabinet and I dealt with those points and those topics that needed to be dealt with and, therefore, I may have read this letter, but I am not in a position to tell you how the demonstrations may or may not have taken place.  
Q.	Right.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to move the first letter B17 into evidence as P. 509, and the second, which is document B18, into evidence as P. 510.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 509 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. P. 510 admitted) 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, maybe you jumped the gun there in the admission of the document.  I am not objecting to the admission of the document as such.  But I simply just wanted to rely on Rule 89(C) and ask the Prosecutor to tell us why he is moving or applying for admission of those two documents.  He has used the documents in his examination following the use of a previous document that was signed by the colonel and other colleagues.  The document which was signed at the conclusions of which we have read; I do not see the nexus between that document and these two other documents.  What do those two documents establish in the record?  What -- how are they relevant?  And I am relying on Rule 89(C) to put this question to the Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
There is no objection to admitting the document, so I don't see how answering the question helps us.  I will offer an answer if -- just for completeness of the record.  The document goes to the credibility of this witness.  The witness claimed he did not know what demonstrations or violence had followed the CDR criticisms of the protocols on power sharing and those two letters demonstrate that there is -- clearly, there was concern about demonstrations being organised in a letter that was sent to his ministry, followed by a letter directed only to his ministry some ten days later, to deal with the aftermath of the demonstrations and the violence.  So it is inconceivable to me that an intelligent observant minister -- excuse me, that a director of cabinet in the ministry of defence would not know about demonstrations that were so widely reported and documented and in the context of this trial, so notorious to us now, given the number of witnesses that have appeared before this Chamber, both for the Defence and the Prosecutions that have gone on and on and on about the demonstrations in January of 1993 and the aftermath.  
MR. CONSTANT:
Mr. President, for the record, pending any verification, I would like to say that my learned colleague did not say that he was not aware of the demonstrations.  The question from my learned colleague was to determine whether the letter that he signed in his own hand was identical to the criticisms of the CDR.  And he said that he was not aware of the position of the CDR.  So he did not speak about being ignorant of the demonstrations.  So I am afraid that my learned colleague might be distorting the thoughts of my client.  That is all I wanted to put on the record, Mr. President.  
MR. NIMY:
Just one point of clarification, Mr. President, for the attention of the Trial Chamber.  The two documents that the Prosecutor is referring to, B17, that being the first document.  B17 refers to a planned demonstration because the letter states that the parties intend to or are thinking or considering a demonstration in Gisenyi.  That's the first document.  

And then the second document refers to demonstrations in Kigali -- rather, the first document -- demonstrations in Kigali for the first document.  The second document refers to demonstrations that have already taken place in Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Kibuye.  So we are dealing with two different issues here, Mr. President.  And the Prosecutor, therefore, is not dealing with the same issue when he presents these two documents that pertain to different issues.  He is using these documents for what purpose?  Is it in relation to the projected demonstrations referred to in Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye's first letter, or is it in relation to the demonstrations that had already taken place and for which investigations were being requested?  

And as my learned colleague has already stated, these two documents do not, in any way, relate to the statements of the CDR which appear in the document that the client -- or, rather, the witness read.  That is why I think that there is a mix-up here, a total mix-up between weight and relevance and probative value.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My understanding is, the documents have been admitted and my procedure is -- is further response required, Your Honour?
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Maybe we should state, for the record, that we are struggling to see that the documents are not admitted.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Colonel Bagosora -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think all that is necessary is that we do think that the documents are admissible and have been admitted and we have taken note of the submissions that have been made.  

You may continue, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, the RPF offensive, which I believe you have characterised as the violation of the ceasefire which occurred or started on the 8th of February 1993, was premised on the violence against Tutsi throughout the country, in particular, in Ruhengeri, that followed these demonstrations that we have just referred to in these two letters.  Is that your understanding or would you like to contest the way that I have put things -- put matters? 
A.	I contest.  The war launched by the RPF started on the 1st of October 1990.  

	Secondly, the attack of 8th February 1993 was, indeed, a violation of the accords of the protocols and of the ceasefire agreement.  Well, the accords were not yet signed because they were signed on the 4th of August 1993.  So on the 8th of April what actually happened was a violation of the ceasefires that had been signed previously.  So when I refer to the resumption of the war by the RPF on the night of the 6th to the 7th and in Kigali on the 7th in the afternoon, at that time I am referring to a violation of the Arusha Accords.  That's the distinction that needs to be made.  
Q.	But we can agree that the RPF defended their offensive of the 8th of February 1993 by referring to the killings against Tutsi in Ruhengeri, in Kibuye, in Gisenyi, that took place sometime in late January, right? 
A.	The RPF violated the ceasefire which was valid.  I cannot answer on their behalf.  You need to call one of their representatives to tell the Court why they attacked on that day.  So I am not in a position to answer that question.  
Q.	The directeur de cabinet in the ministry of defence in February 1993 has no understanding of what was being said by the other belligerent, by the RPF in relation to this violation of the ceasefire; is that your testimony? 
A.	The question is to find out whether I know why the RPF breached the ceasefire.  I have told you that I cannot answer on behalf of the RPF.  But when you talk about the matters of security or insecurity in December or January, which you referred to, I agree with you entirely.  You see, on the 1st of October 1990, that is when the war -- 
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, I think you have answered the question.  Let me give you a follow-up question.  And I will simply reiterate to you that I find it surprising that a man in your position in February of 1993 can't tell us how the RPF characterised its offensive.  I am not asking you to agree with them or to know the real meaning.  I am asking you: how did they characterise it to you or to your government?  
A.	When the RPF attacked Rwanda the idea was to take power.  And on the 8th of April they attempted again and they were stopped in Kigali and so that is what happened.  Then we went on to sign the Arusha Accords and they still violated the Arusha Accords, resuming the war on the 7th of April 1994 and ending up with capturing power in July 1994.  But you don't want to listen to that.  Who supported them in that effort? 
Q.	How were they stopped in Kigali in February of 1993?  It wasn't the FAR that was capable of stopping them, was it? 
A.	The FAR did what they could do but we received assistance from France.  
Q.	And would you agree that without French assistance in at least two valleys, because there were already French troops present in Rwanda, and additional troops that were brought in, had you not had that assistance, the RPF could have come all the way into Kigali and they were stopped only because they didn't want to engage the French, isn't that so? 
A.	That is speculation.  Even in Kigali the war may have lasted a very long time.  Twenty years of war in Beirut, the city of Beirut alone, it could have happened in Kigali too, we would not have lost.  
Q.	What was your assessment of the FAR's military capacity after this RPF offensive in February of 1993?  Having learned from that offensive, tell us what your assessment of the FAR's military capacity was in March of 1993.  
A.	What are you referring to, in arms, ammunition or what? 
Q.	What evaluation or assessment would you have made or could you make as director of cabinet in the ministry of defence in relation to the FAR's capacity to defend the country against external invasion in March of 1993 after the French stopped the RPF advance?
A.	The information available to us was that the war effort was supported by Uganda.  But, subsequently, we discovered that they were supported by Anglo-Saxon powers with Uganda serving only as an intermediary.  However -- 
Q.	Taken.  Focus your answer on your assessment of the FAR.  We understand how you feel about the US and other nations.  Tell us your assessment of your own country's military capability in March of 1993.  
A.	Military assessment can only be done properly in relation to another power.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it is 12:30.
MR. WEBSTER:
I can pause here and pick up after lunch, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How are we doing, generally?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Not very well because we got a late start in the late morning.  I will try to move very quickly, but I have a lot of material to cover.  And I will do my best, but I think we would be more prudent to report to the Court in the mid-afternoon.  I am expecting that we will continue until the end of the day.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think that we could think about -- we finish at 5 o'clock or 5:30 this afternoon.  

MR. WEBSTER:
I think 5:30 would be more reasonable and I am still not confident we will finish by 5:30, but I will move as quickly as I can.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  We take our luncheon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1236H to 1412H)
MR. WEBSTER:
Good afternoon, everyone.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good afternoon to you, Colonel Bagosora.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	I would like to return to this issue of the RPF military offensive in February of 1993, and what I would suggest to you is that you were a bit more forthcoming on this issue when you testified in your own defence in your trial back on the 28th of October 2005.  So I will refer us all to document C4 in -- in my collection of exhibits, which is your testimony from that date.  And it's the bottom of page 39 in the English text.  It was page -- also page 39 in the French text.  You were answering questions from your attorney, Raphael Constant.  And in response to a document that he submitted to you, you say that the French presence led to resumption of confidence almost immediately on the part of the Rwandan forces who regained some capability that enabled them to hold down the Patriotic Front Armed Forces under positions of the 23rd of February.  And then you continue with an exchange of questions and answers.  But, basically, over the next page and a half, you repeat that from the 23rd of February, with the arrival of French troops, the FAR gained confidence and was able to confront or stop the RPF advance, or the RPF simply didn't engage the troops beyond that point.  

Looking at the transcripts now, does that, in any way, refresh your recollection about those events, or is there anything you would like to add in relation to your evidence on that issue? 
A.	My testimony at that time as read out by you is correct.  
Q.	Can you -- we agree that after that restart of hostilities in February 1993 there was pressure from the international community to go back to the bargaining table and to work out a negotiation to end the war again? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And there was a ceasefire agreement that was signed sometime around the 7th of March 1993.  
A.	I don't remember exactly, but 7th or 9th of March.  Be that as it may, indeed, there was an agreement to that effect.  
Q.	And that the signature on that ceasefire agreement was followed by a joint press release or press conference, I am not sure whether it was simply in writing or there was actually a press conference in Dar es Salaam.  According to the document I have, it was held in Dar es Salaam from the 5th to the 7th of March 1993 and then there are a number of documents that bear the date 7th of March 1993, but it's all in relation to the ceasefire agreement and then the press releases that came afterwards to discuss it.  All of that is consistent with your recollection of events, Colonel? 
A.	I was not in Dar es Salaam.  However, what you are saying seems to be probable, if you could actually give me all the necessary information.  But I would agree that there was a ceasefire agreement in Dar es Salaam, but I am not very sure about the date.  It could have been the 7th, in any event, between the 5th and the 9th of March 1993.  
Q.	And do you have an independent recollection of the press conference or the press release? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you support that ceasefire agreement back in March 1993? 
A.	Of course, I did.  
Q.	According to the documentation I have that after the ceasefire agreement and particularly, after the communiqué or the press release came out, your president, Habyarimana, came under a great deal of criticism, specifically from the CDR who started calling him an accomplice.  Do you recall that? 
A.	CDR's position in respect of the negotiations was that the chief of the pro-RPF delegation was there, so he was negotiating on behalf of the RPF and that was their position and it remained so.  However, with regard to their reaction to the Dar es Salaam ceasefire agreement, I do not know exactly what their reaction was.  I wasn't aware of their reaction.  
Q.	But their reaction was actually put in evidence by the Nzirorera defence in an exhibit that we have in this trial, D. NZ66 and it's quite a biting criticism of President Habyarimana where they specifically use the word "accomplice", accusing him of being an accomplice.  
A.	I was not aware of that document.  
Q.	You are aware, however, that according to the press release that describes the ceasefire agreement that your government agreed not to recruit any more soldiers, to remove a number of bourgmestres who were accused of human rights abuses, not to procure any more arms, to direct French troops to leave the country, to recover arms that had been distributed to the civilian population and not to organise civilian defence.  

As I understand it, those were three or four of the main points that were included in the press release, at least and those were some of the things that CDR objected to.  Do you have anything to say about that?  I mean, are these provisions that you agreed with? 
A.	I did not have to agree because the government had negotiated the ceasefire accord.  The government had obtained it.  I was a government employee, so I had to subscribe to the government's position.  

Now, with regard to the list of what was agreed on, since I don't have the document in front of me, I would, however, say that that seems to be true because that is what I knew but I cannot say offhand that everything that you have just read out tallies exactly with the ceasefire agreement.
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, I call upon Mr. Issa to collect this document from me.  It was included in my bundle of Nzirorera cross-examination documents.  It is document C1 in that bundle.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I only have one copy with me here, but you can have a look at my copy, Colonel Bagosora, and the interesting parts are highlighted in yellow, so you can flip through it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And then I would also request that it be admitted into evidence.  For the other parties in the courtroom, it is not among the documents I distributed this morning.  It's something that was distributed two or three weeks ago.
THE WITNESS:
What I saw previously was the communiqué published following the meeting between the government of the republic of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front which took place between the 5th and 7th of March at the end of the conference.  

However, with regard to the other part following that first part, I am seeing this second part for the very first time and I can see that there is a signature on it and it is written CDR.  I have not seen this part concerning the CDR previously.  If you wish me to look at it, I will need some time to do so because with these spectacles I have on now, I am not able to read the small print on this document.  However, I agree that -- I agree with the first part in that it corresponds to what I knew.  

The second part concerns the CDR, and now I cannot read it because my reading glasses right now will not allow me to do so.  But I was not aware of this press release which was signed on the 9th of March, in other words, I did not know about it previously.
MR. WEBSTER:
I would like to ask Mr. Issa to assist by showing the document to the Court and to the Defence and I would request that it be admitted.  

As for the CDR document, Colonel Bagosora, that is actually already in evidence as a separate document.  And what I am requesting to be shown to everyone is a reprint of the press release that was published in Isibo.  It is not a copy of the original.  It is a copy of the document as it was reprinted in a journal.  And what concerns us is the agreement and the press release which Colonel Bagosora has some familiarity with.  And in the last page was the reprint of the CDR communiqué, which is already in evidence from the Nzirorera Defence team.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	While that is being circulated, can you tell us if you know, how did the MRND or President Habyarimana and the CDR work out their differences after this clash which seems to have been provoked by President Habyarimana's willingness to sign this ceasefire agreement and the CDR reaction to it? 
A.	After which clash? 
Q.	I am referring to the CDR communiqué of the 9th of March 1993 where they start calling 
	Habyarimana himself an accomplice and broke, according to the Nzirorera defence, broke off the alliance with the MRND because of the MRND's willingness or President Habyarimana's willingness to sign this peace -- the ceasefire agreement with the RPF.  
A.	I would like to point out that from the 16th of March 1993 up to 25th June 1993, I was here in Arusha, in Tanzania, so I did not follow what was happening elsewhere at that time.  I do not remember how things unfolded in respect of what you are telling me now.  
Q.	Well, what I would suggest to you is that the MRND and the CDR worked out their differences.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, just for the record's sake, should we admit the document now so it's more close to it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then you can proceed.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you just identify it, for the record.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, if Mr. Issa could hand it up to me again.  

It is an Isibo publication number 89 from the 13th to the 20th of March 1993.  It consists of pages 5, 6, 7, approximately 5 pages of Isibo and copies of the press release and portions of the ceasefire agreement that we have been discussing with this witness.  It is not the original agreement or the reprint of the press release and portions of the agreement that appeared in Isibo.  And I assume this would be P. 511. 
(Exhibit No. P. 511 admitted)  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I would like to have details on the document that the Prosecution is dealing with now.  The document that was admitted into evidence, that is, the D. NZ document, which one, exactly, is it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
The D. NZ document that this -- my proposed exhibit relates to is D. NZ66, which is a communiqué from the CDR dated the 9th of March 1993.  And I believe it was admitted by the Nzirorera Defence in its cross-examination of Witness UB back on the 2nd of March 2006.  And I can read portions of it, but it is already in evidence.  But it is -- it was used by the Nzirorera Defence to show that the CDR and the MRND broke the alliance and CDR was calling President Habyarimana an accomplice.  
MR. NIMY:
Now, the Isibo document the Prosecutor is talking about, this document was never recognised or acknowledged by the witness.  And the Prosecutor is preparing to offer it for admission into evidence.  Mr. President, I don't know how he is going to go about this because this document has already had to be rejected after it was presented the way he did it -- he is doing it now.  So he is trying to proceed in the same manner to have the document admitted but the document was never recognised by the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This is the first time that I have used this particular Isibo document and it is relevant for our trial because in the Nzirorera Defence document 66, at paragraph 35 -- and I am paraphrasing now in English since the document is in French.  

In the Defence exhibit it says the CDR party is profoundly shocked by the attitude of Mr. Habyarimana, Juvénal, president of the republic, who approved the content of the communiqué, which compromises the interests of the Rwandan people.  This shows clearly that Juvénal Habyarimana, the president of the republic, is more worried about his own interests than those of the nation.  And then it goes on and on and on, and it is basically a diatribe against Habyarimana.  So I think it's relevant for our purposes to understand what he was being criticised for, and that's the only copy of the agreement that I can find.  So I think the record is clear.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I wonder if the Prosecutor has finished giving his explanation, because I do not quite understand how this Isibo document can be brought here and tendered for admission into evidence since the witness never recognised it.  In which way does this witness give any words to this Isibo document?  This is something I don't quite understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, maybe I interrupted you too quickly and because maybe he should answer further questions on this matter.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, it was your testimony a few minutes ago that you supported any agreement that the government entered into, including this one, the ceasefire agreement of March 1993, all right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	But independent of your obligation to support it since it was an agreement of your government, did you think it was a wise move on the part of your government? 
A.	I didn't have occasion to think about that.  I wasn't part of the delegation.  Our government negotiated that agreement for the country, for Rwandan citizens and I was one of them, so I agreed with the agreement, that is, the ceasefire agreement.  We did not want war.  We wanted peace.  
Q.	Yes, but if that peace came at a cost which, in your case, was agreeing not to recruit anymore soldiers, not to buy any more arms, not to organise civil defence, to fire bourgmestres who had been terrorising their Tutsi constituency and withdrawing the weapons that had been distributed north of the country, it would be very unlikely that the FAR would be any militarily stronger after that agreement than it was before the agreement when they basically lost to the RPF, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	But a ceasefire is an agreement for peace.  And when you have peace, you no longer need to recruit.  You no longer need to procure weapons.  You no longer need to buy ammunition.  Our belief was that peace was going to begin.  
Q.	Well, in theory, yes, Colonel Bagosora, but what I would suggest to you is that it was against the backdrop of how the FAR was being limited by the agreement it signed with the RPF, that the MRND party started to arm and train the Interahamwe.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Who told you that?  Who told you that they started organising the Interahamwe and the army and to train them?  
Q.	That is my suggestion to you, which you can accept or reject.  So if you don't think it is true, you can tell us, then if you acknowledge that that was the case, you can explain.  
A.	I didn't know of a programme for the training of Interahamwe and I am talking about military training here.  
Q.	You, personally, didn't know.  Did you have any information provided to you by any other person?  
A.	No.  
Q.	You had never heard of investigation by human rights organisations, complaints by human rights organisations, complaints by opposition party figures alleging that the Interahamwe were being trained militarily by the FAR and being used against the political opposition? 
A.	No, I was not aware of that.  
Q.	So General Ndindiliyimana working on behalf of the gendarmerie has come on a number of times, most clearly in an expert report that he prepared in August of 1998 before he was arrested, where he describes this very phenomenon, not necessarily the consequences of the ceasefire agreement, but clear indications that the Interahamwe were being trained militarily by December of 1993.  You have no reason to dispute information that he was able to compile on this issue, do you? 
A.	General Ndindiliyimana himself is the person who can respond to that and provide evidence of what he is saying.  He was the chief of staff of the gendarmerie and he worked with the population.  As to evidence thereof, I do not know, but he did not inform me about that document.  He did not inform me and he sent no report to the minister of defence to the effect that he had seen where the Interahamwe were being trained.  
Q.	Well, if we could all turn to document E12 in my bundle, which is the report I am mentioning about Ndindiliyimana.  It is -- the only indication of a date on it is Brussels, August 1998.  And I am looking at page 7 in the French text, we only have it in French.  And at the bottom of page 7, paragraph 4, which is entitled "Paramilitary formation of MRND youths."  Here is three or four paragraphs where he described the training of Interahamwe and he concludes by saying that this problem was discussed at the level of the government and that the service de renseignements of the prime minister had declared that this training actually took place, whereas the MRND denied it.  And I will hand it up to you so that you can read it for yourself, Colonel.  
A.	Well, I will do -- I would like to read this document which he wrote after he probably had gone into exile or taken refuge somewhere in Belgium.  But was it when he was chief of staff of the gendarmerie?  When he was chief of staff of the gendarmerie, he never made any report on the subject for the minister of defence under whom he was working, in which case I would have been aware of it.  

Now that he was a refugee, he started making a statement, and more specifically, he did not come to testify in my trial, even though he was also a Prosecution witness.  So I find it hard to make any comments on his writings.  I have difficulty in making comments on Ndindiliyimana's document, for he was a Prosecution witness, but the Prosecutor never brought him to my trial so that we can discuss things like this.  
Q.	In any case, when you look at the document on the first page, in the first paragraph, he says that he was an eyewitness to events that he is submitting this statement to complete the statement that he gave initially to the Belgian senate, that is, his modest contribution to make known what he lived through.  That's the introductory paragraph.  And then he goes through to describe a number of things, but the part that interests us is what he had to say about the military training for the Interahamwe.  But if you go to page 6 at the bottom, he talks about the massacres in Gisenyi, Ruhengeri and Kibuye that we discussed earlier this morning, in January of 1993.  And this, in relation to Interahamwe military training, he makes reference to an incident that several other witnesses have described, which is, that in Kibungo there was a gendarme that took note of several bus loads of Interahamwe being brought back from Mutara in December of 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Constant, were you --
MR. CONSTANT:  
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. CONSTANT:
I am sorry, Mr. President, but probably, other -- maybe a translation problem because I heard my learned friend say that Mr. Ndindiliyimana stated that he saw training on page 2.  And I would like him to tell me exactly where he read this because I am not aware of this.  Let him show me where he read this in this document.  That is one thing that I wanted to ask.  

And, secondly, if my client is being asked to make any comments on this document, probably he should be given some time to read it, because you are making him have rather partial excerpts and, first of all, the document itself is not a complete document.  You have merely quoted from the end of the document and you are also making short excerpts from it and you are asking my client to make comments thereon.  And if he has to do that, he probably should be availed of some time to go through the document.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I had also stood up.  In fact, I stood up before my learned friend, Mr. Constant, got to his feet.  

Insofar as this document is concerned, I believe that the Prosecutor -- well, I thought he had read page 8 because I am on page 8 of the document and the fourth paragraph in French and I am on that paragraph, page 8 of the document.  Yes, I am going to read it because this answers the question.  

"Insofar as the paramilitary training is concerned about which much is being said, I didn't have any specific information as to the content and programme of that training, let alone the number of participants in the programme."  

End of quote, Mr. President.  And that statement was made by Ndindiliyimana. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I can respond to both concerns orally.  As far as -- directing my comment to Mr. Constant, if you look at the top paragraph on page 2, the first paragraph is the introduction that I was referring to where the second sentence -- and I will read it in French where Ndindiliyimana is saying:  "I witnessed the events as an actor and as a direct witness, an observer.  And it completes my testimony sent to the Belgian senate."  And we should all recall that -- I believe, it was either yesterday or on Friday the Nzirorera team admitted Augustin Ndindiliyimana's témoignage to the Belgian senate from the 21st April 1997 as the Defence Exhibit D. NZ833 was also admitted as a Defence exhibit in Colonel Bagosora's own trial.  It was D. B8 in that trial, and according to this document, which was recovered from Ndindiliyimana when he was arrested, this completes the testimony that we have already admitted into evidence through the Nzirorera defence.  So it's really not a major point that he is not telling us anything new, that evidence of these very same things from other persons.  This is only a part of the document, a part that interests us.  I have no objection to providing the entire document for everyone to look at.  The Defence already has it as a disclosure, the relevant portions for our purposes of those that I circulated.  Amongst the portions that I circulated, there is also commentary from Ndindiliyimana about RPF brigades and the types of things that the Defence likes to raise and that's in the same excerpt.  So I certainly wasn't trying to hide anything.  I was simply trying to limit the amount of reproduction that was -- would be required.  But it's really -- it's not a major point.  I am just suggesting to Colonel Bagosora that someone that he had a very close working relationship with was providing information that he should have had because if we are to rely on Ndindiliyimana, he claims that all of this was submitted to the government of which Colonel Bagosora was a part.  
MR. CONSTANT:
I am sorry that I have to rise, once again.  The question that he -- Mr. Webster put to my question was:  Did he accept?  Was he accepting that Mr. Ndindiliyimana had information regarding the training of Interahamwe?  After that he gave the document, and I am quoting from the document.  He said that "Ndindiliyimana had a vision."  In any case, that's the translation that I had, that he had an idea about the training.  And I should point out that this document doesn't say that because I know this document.  So my client is in a rather difficult situation whereby he may be asked to admit something that he doesn't know about.  This is all I am trying to say.  In this document, Ndindiliyimana clearly states that he had no information regarding the organisation of the Interahamwe or the training of the Interahamwe.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would suggest that there is enough on the record now for the witness himself to respond to the exhibit and that I invite him to do that, and I would also request that the exhibit be moved into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Has he been shown a copy of it? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I asked Mr. Issa to give him a copy.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have a copy, Mr. President.  I have no comments to make in respect of Ndindiliyimana's testimony, first of all, because I haven't read the entirety of it.  And then you said that we used that same testimony in my trial.  We took a portion of it concerning the sequence of events beginning from the 6th up until the 9th, that is the portion that I am well acquainted with.  And in that portion of the testimony, we don't speak of Interahamwe or their training at all.  Mention is made of other things concerning me.  So insofar as that first part is concerned, I am not well acquainted with it and I would be wasting time if I had to read everything now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the exhibit number, Mr. Issa?
MR. WEBSTER:
This would be Prosecution Exhibit P. 512. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 512 admitted) 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, for the record, I would like that it should be pointed out that insofar as the admission of this document is concerned, specifically, page 8 of the document, paragraph 4, and it is paragraph 4 of this document that is very important insofar as the question that the Prosecution put to the witness is concerned regarding Ndindiliyimana's knowledge of the military training given to the Interahamwe.  
So if this document is admitted into evidence, you will find the answer to his question on paragraph 4 of page 8 of the document.  That is what I wanted to say, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  

Mr. Nimy, we, in fact, had considered that issue.  I wasn't aware that you had objected to this before we admitted it.  But when you saw us in deliberation, that was one of the issues that we considered and we didn't think that it went to admissibility, but, rather, to the impact we attach to it when we were considering it.  So we admit and we take note of the submissions which both you and Mr. Constant have made on that point.

Yes, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Sow?  
(Pages 27 to 41 by Sithembiso Moyo)




















1500H 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to propose to the Trial Chamber -- in fact, wouldn't it be more relevant for the same portion to be read out to the witness so that he can react to it?  I think this is the purpose of admitting the document; otherwise, it would no longer be relevant.  I think Mr. Nimy could read the same portion to the witness and then he can react to it and this would be contained in the records.  That is my suggestion, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
As Mr. Webster is conducting the cross-examination, were you expressing a lack of confidence in his ability to read the French portion properly?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, this has nothing to do with his ability, but I think he has kind of clouded over the paragraph. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think Mr. Sow's point is well taken and Mr. Webster can put the paragraph to him.  
MR. WEBSTER:
	I am sorry.  Could you remind me of the paragraph?  It's on page 8, which --  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Page 8, paragraph 4. 
MR. NIMY:
Yes, that is correct. 
MR. WEBSTER:
	I don't have any objection as to the paragraph being read out even though -- even if Colonel Bagosora can quite read it in French.  But for the record of the hearing, the paragraph goes as follows:  

"Regarding the paramilitary training that much has been said about, I do not have any specific information regarding the content and the programme of that training, let alone the number of participants undertaking the training."
MR. WEBSTER:
I think we've dealt with this issue with more -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is:  Does the witness have a comment on it to make?  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I am sorry.  Colonel Bagosora, is there anything you would like to say in relation to that paragraph? 
A.	Yes, because, indeed, what General Ndindiliyimana is saying in that paragraph is logical because, if while he was chief of staff before he left the country, if he had been aware of the training, he should have made a report thereof and submit it to the minister of defence, and this is what I've just told you a short while ago.  He never submitted such a report.  So, logically, he knew nothing of the training.  And as far as I am concerned, what he says there is correct.
Q.	I think we've spent enough time on this.  I would, however, point out to you, Colonel Bagosora, that the second paragraph on the same page, there is a notation that the issue was addressed to the government and investigated at the level of the government, which would -- included the ministry of defence, but, though, what the nature and content and findings of those investigations were, is not clear.  To be fair to you, in the record all of that is given and the court can appreciate it all in context at a later time.  

I would like to return to our examination and what I am suggesting to you is that the CDR and the MRND worked out their differences by coming together to forge the implementation of the broad-based transitional government.  Would you agree with that statement?  Sometime in 1994, and leading up to March of 1994, the way that Habyarimana and CDR managed to come back together and stopped trading accusations was to work in concert against the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  
A.	I have already told you that for a certain period when I was not in a country -- I was not in the country, I had forgotten to say that from the 7th to the 14th of March, during the period when the ceasefire agreement was signed in Dar es Salaam, that is, immediately after my visit to Bujumbura, I came straight to Arusha.  I was here from the 16th to the 25th.  So everything that happened elsewhere during that period is something I am not aware of.  I returned to Rwanda on the 26th of June, and throughout July, I was negotiating with RPF.  I believe we were in negotiations on the 20th or 21st of July in Kinihira.  I was very occupied during that period so much so that I cannot give you any interesting information as such. 
Q.	Thank you for your response, but I was much more concerned with the period between the 5th of January 1994 and the 6th of April 1994, when there was an attempt to implement the broad based transitional government.  So my suggestion to you is that President Habyarimana used CDR and their request to be included in the broad based transitional government as a blocking mechanism to prevent the implementation of the broad based transitional government.  Do you have a response or reaction to that suggestion? 
A.	Could you repeat?  What period did you refer to?  
Q.	In 1994, going all the way up to the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	I knew that CDR was not wanted by the RPF initially, because they -- the CDR did not want to sign the code of political ethics.  Later, CDR signed the code of ethics and that was a precondition for the acceptance by the other parties when it came to power-sharing.  I think that in the Arusha Accords, it was decided that all small parties would be given posts -- or, at least one post.  

So what I know about the CDR at that time is that the RPF did not want CDR to be in the transitional national assembly, but not in the government.  What I remember is that, they did not want them in the national assembly because, according to the protocol agreement we reached, the power-sharing in government had already been agreed upon and CDR was not one of the parties in the government.  So the bone of contention here was the RPF's refusal to have the CDR join the national assembly.  That's what I knew. 
Q.	And that was the major sticking point to the implementation of the broad based transitional government in March 1994 -- at the end of March 1994, right? 
A.	No, CDR did not block the Arusha Accords.  You have to talk about the splits of political parties, such as the MDR, which split into two factions.  PL also split into two factions and those were the two parties which failed to designate their ministers within the context of the implementation of the Arusha Accords, and that's where the problem lies, because the issue of the CDR was finally resolved following pressure from ambassadors who were in Kigali, and that issue was resolved in March. 
Q.	Well, I think -- thank you for your response.  I would suggest to you that if you review the testimony of Booh-Booh in your case, where he was called as a Defence witness, and if you look at his testimony in this case, where he was also called as a Defence witness, if you look at some of the documentation from him that has been admitted in evidence both in your trial and in this one, it would appear from his mouth directly that the last ten days of March saw the development of CDR -- or, CDR seat in the national transitional assembly being raised as a blocking point by President Habyarimana, and it was, in fact, that very issue that led him, Booh-Booh, to go to Gisenyi on the 1st of March to spend the weekend there where he could meet with Habyarimana to try to get pass that particular negotiating point.  You don't recall that evidence from your witness in your trial? 
A.	That was a long time ago.  However, what I personally know is that, he gave his testimony and I am giving my testimony.  What I know is that there was a problem and that problem was at the level of the MDR and PL, who failed to agree on the designation of candidates to government posts, as well as to posts in the national assembly.  I heard about the problems facing the CDR, but I was not following the problems closely.  I heard people talked about it.  I think that apart from PL, which did not want CDR, all the ambassadors in Kigali -- I am talking about ambassadors representing the international community in Kigali -- all these ambassadors had put pressure on all the parties to see to it that CDR would join the national assembly.  That was done.  But with regard to MDR and PL, they failed to agree on the designation of candidates to represent their parties in government and the national assembly.  That's what I can say on that subject. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  

Colonel Bagosora, I raised the issue of the CDR and that particular weekend discussion because while Booh-Booh was discussing the CDR in Gisenyi, at least, on the 3rd of April 1994, this is the same weekend that you have alleged a coup attempt being planned and put into motion by Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, right? 
A.	I talked about April 1994, when I said that the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, had brought together officers from the southern part of Rwanda at her house, and the meeting, proceedings was talked about on RTLM and the meeting was described as an attempt of launching a coup d'état against President Habyarimana.  That is what I said.  
Q.	It is placed on evidence -- that broadcast was placed in evidence dated the 3rd of April 1994, and the substance of what Valerie Bemeriki is saying refers to a meeting that she claims occurred on the 1st of April 1994.  Now, was that radio broadcast the source of your information about this alleged meeting? 
A.	I think that you improperly used that document.  RTLM started broadcasting information about the meeting which must have taken place on the 1st or 2nd of April, and they started talking about the meeting from the 3rd up to the 5th of April.  That is my evidence. 
Q.	Thank you.  And my question to you now is that:  Did you learn about this meeting from the RTLM or did you have other sources of information? 
A.	No, not from other sources.  I heard it on the radio. 
Q.	This was not discussed at the level of your ministry? 
A.	What I heard is that, an officer who had attended the meeting at -- 
Q.	Could you please just start by telling us if you heard other sources of information? 
MR. CONSTANT:
I am sorry; he is answering and you are interrupting his answer.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, if I have interrupted you, continue.  But I would like you to get straight to the point, if you can, please. 
A.	I am telling you that after the meeting that was held at Agathe Uwilingiyimana's house, there was an officer who had attended the meeting, who went to inform the minister of defence about the meeting and about what had happened at the meeting, but this is something I learnt later.  In the meantime, the minister of defence went on official mission to Cameroon and that the events unfolded so fast, and on the 6th of April, President Habyarimana was assassinated. 
Q.	Is it your testimony that the minister of defence received this information before leaving to go on mission? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And before leaving to go on mission, he did not apprise you of this information?  You learnt it from RTLM afterwards? 
A.	No, he did not tell me anything about the meeting. 
Q.	The information that we have is that one of the participants in this meeting informed his superior officer before attending the meeting and then reported back to his superior officer after the meeting had concluded.  Is that your information as well? 
A.	I don't know.  I heard the name of the officer, but I have forgotten his name.  What I know is that, there was an officer -- a senior officer -- I don't remember his name right now -- and that officer informed the minister of defence of that meeting, but I don't know the exact words which he used in transmitting that information. 
Q.	Now, Colonel Bagosora, you are a man who has had experience in participating in a military coup, isn't that so? 
A.	I participated in only one coup d'état and that coup d'état was successful. 
Q.	And that was in 1973? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Based on your experience, which was successful -- 
A.	Did you say '73?  
Q.	Seventy-three.  
A.	5th of July 1973, that's what I wanted to say.  
Q.	And based on that successful experience, is it your view that the way to launch a coup d'état is to inform your superiors and to circulate information about it on the radio? 
A.	Since you want to talk about the coup d'état, can you allow me to provide the Chamber with essential elements of what can be described as a coup d'état?  If you have other elements which you wish to add, you can do so, because here you are talking about coup d'état, coup d'état, without making any specific references and I think that's not appropriate.  I can provide you with the essential elements of a coup d'état, because I was involved in a coup d'état, and I can give you the classical essential elements of a coup d'état.  
Q.	Please do so.  
A.	A coup d'état, a classical coup d'état in general has two sequences -- three sequences.  First, is to neutralise the existing authorities and its main supporters.  

The second part of the sequences is to ensure that there is security at all essential points, in critical points, in cities and countries.  With regard to Rwanda, those points were radio, television and important government installations.  

Thirdly, after being successful, you have to make an announcement on the radio and on television.  

Now, since you wish us to talk about coup d'état, there was no coup d'état on the 1st or on the 2nd.  There was a radio announcement to the effect that there was an attempt of having a coup d'état, which -- 
Q.	And in your experience, what are usually the results of having an attempted coup d'état for the persons that are trying to perpetrate the coup d'état? 
A.	In normal circumstances, you have intelligence agencies or agency which launches investigations in order to counter check whether there was actually an attempted coup d'état.  After that, they can -- you can -- the persons concerned can be prosecuted.  But as far as we were concerned, there were rumours about attempted coup in the night of the -- on the 1st and on the 2nd April.  That was broadcast on the radio.  The minister travelled and the intelligence services were under the prime minister and it was the prime minister who was attempting to launch a coup d'état.  In any case, what I am saying is that, RTLM radio station made such an announcement and that was never denied.  The minister of information and the director of Radio Rwanda were there, they belonged to a party, but they did not deny the news.  And then, on the 6th, people started thinking that there was an attempt of coup d'état.  So when the actual coup d'état against Habyarimana started - it started on the 6th, and this, as I said earlier, General Dallaire had asked me on the 4th of April, who was President Habyarimana's successor.  So, even at that time, I didn't wonder a lot, but I was wondering why did Dallaire ask me that question.  But on the following days, Habyarimana was assassinated, and Dallaire took -- or, wanted Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, to succeed President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Thank you for your lengthy response, Colonel.  But it's for the very reasons that you've articulated that I'd suggest to you that you didn't take this notion of Agathe Uwilingiyimana organising a coup d'état very seriously back on the 3rd of April, and that you are using it now simply as a comfortable pretext.  First of all, your minister of defence didn't even inform you, the director of cabinet, that he had information about a coup, right? 
A.	So what do you want me to say about that?  I listed you a sequence of events.  The coup d'état -- 
Q.	You've had your sequence.  Your minister of defence didn't inform you.  He left the country --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you could have let him to complete that answer.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I have no problem with the witness speaking at great length, but I am slowly trying to stay within the parameters.  His answers are quite long.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Please, proceed, Colonel Bagosora.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I will just speak to the witness as well.  

Mr. Bagosora -- Colonel Bagosora, you understand that we are under some time constraint.  So I would ask you to try and be as concise as possible.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I am sorry, I would like to remind the Prosecutor that here is this witness giving evidence, not the Prosecutor, not me.  It's the witness who is testifying before the Trial Chamber.  So we should listen to the evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) at issue.  So is it necessary to repeat it?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
(French spoken) says Counsel Nimy.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, you wanted to expound upon your answer, please do so.  
A.	I am talking to you about that coup d'état of the 6th and I am following the sequence that I gave you, the first sequence.  First of all, Habyarimana was the president and the head of state and he had been deposed.  And the second sequence was executed by Mr. Kagame, by assassinating President Habyarimana.  The authority has testified that Habyarimana was murdered.  

Secondly, we needed other persons who had to ensure the security of installations, for instance, of Radio Rwanda, of the television, et cetera.  And you know that General Dallaire sent Colonel Marchal to go and ensure the security of Radio Rwanda so that Agathe could go and deliver a speech there.  You are aware of this.  

Now, you also know it to be true that when General Dallaire arrived at the meeting in which I was, a meeting that I was co-chairing, by the way, and he wrote this and I read what he wrote and that he came to support a coup d'état that had to be staged by the moderate members of the gendarmerie, but, unfortunately, it failed -- all but it failed.  And why did it fail?  Because General Dallaire was ensuring the security of the radio, but the moderate elements of the gendarmerie that had to assist him did not cooperate with him.  They did not collaborate with him.  Why?  Let me continue. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) at this point because you are giving a response that is completely off track; that's not what I'm asking you about.  And I am not asking you about what transpired on the 6th and 7th (Microphones overlapping) -- 
A.	It was the coup d'état of the 6th.  
Q.	My question is directed to the 1st of April, which is the night that this purported meeting took place at the home of Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  Right?  Your testimony has been that you could not contact the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, on the night of the 6th, because you suspected her of being involved in a coup, referring to the 1st of April; right?  Wasn't that your testimony?  Just focus on that particular point and give us an answer.  
A.	The answer that I am giving you -- 
MR. SOW:
Please, Mr. President, I was compelled to sit down or to remain seated because you said two counsels cannot be standing at the same time.  

Mr. President, I am under the impression that we are not in the same courtroom as the Prosecutor.  He is the one who told the witness to give a sequence of events leading to the coup d'état.  Let him be cautious.  Let him display courtesy and elegance by allowing him to say what he's asked him.  
And it would appear that it is Mr. Webster that is giving evidence here and he doesn't have the right to be selective as to the answers the witness should be giving.  I think that after this was pointed out to him by the Trial Chamber, he should exercise a little bit more discipline.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I see the time.  My suggestion is that we pause.  Before we do so, however, I'd request that the witness be excused and that I be allowed to respond to Mr. Sow and the objection that has been raised, in the absence of the witness.  So just give me two minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Webster, we don't think this is necessary.  We think that, as I have said several times before, when we have senior counsel, we expect certain elements of self-discipline to arise.  And I think that by having the mid-afternoon recess is sufficient and we can resume in good shape in a few minutes time.  So we take our recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1534H to 1550H) 
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, if I may, I would like to advise the Trial Chamber that Mr. Nzirorera has to see his doctor this afternoon before 5 p.m., more specifically, he should be with his doctor at 5 p.m. prompt.  What this means is that he may be allowed to leave the courtroom at 4:55 p.m. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Nimy, we were already advised by the registrar of this and we thought that we would adjourn at 4:55, but I am interpreting your request to mean that he is authorising you to continue till 5:30 so long as he leaves at 4:55.  
MR. NIMY:
No, Mr. President.  I think we are fine with the registrar's hour for adjournment, and long live the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Fine.  We would adjourn at that time. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, let's try to address this issue, once again, and I would like to direct your attention to between the 1st of April and the 4th of April.  I am only concerned with those three days.  Now, it appears from the RTLM broadcast on the 3rd of April that there was a meeting on the 1st of April supposedly in the home of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, right? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, before we broke for the break you interrupted me and I didn't finish my answer and I am prepared to do that now.  I gave you the first sequence of the coup d'état and I was in the middle of the second sequence and there was the third sequence that I had to talk to the Trial Chamber about. 
Q.	We will get to that in the course of your answers to the following questions, so let's start again.  

It appears from the RTLM broadcast on the 3rd April that there was some sort of meeting at the prime minister's house on the 1st of April, right? 
A.	I have a problem.  There is a question that I answered partially and I would like to complete my answer before we proceed. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think the most appropriate thing for us to do is to proceed with the questioning as I've organised it, so I am asking the Court to direct the witness to answer my question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Colonel Bagosora, I think you should address the question put by the Prosecutor.  Sorry, what was the question that you said you did not answer completely, Colonel Bagosora?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, you asked me to say what were the key ingredients of the coup d'état.  I gave the three sequences and I've just - I've talked about the first sequence, I was in the middle of the second sequence and I still had the third sequence that would have made me complete my answer.  I do not know why I should break this into several pieces for the understanding of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I think the record is clear.  The witness outlined three essential ingredients of a successful coup d'état, as he understands it, and we'll get to each thing and he will have an opportunity to explore these in-depth.  These are through other questions and answers or when he is examined in redirect.  So I would like to proceed.  The last question I asked, Your Honour, really requires a yes or no answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think you can proceed. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, Colonel Bagosora, once again, we learnt from an RTLM broadcast on the 3rd of April that there was some sort of meeting at the prime minister's residence on the 1st of April, right?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Colonel Bagosora.  
THE WITNESS:
I have already answered that question a long time ago.  I said that I learnt that a meeting had been held on the night of the 1st or 2nd of April, and I learnt this from a broadcast by RTLM, and, probably, it was the broadcast of the 3rd or the 4th, I don't quite remember.  And I told you that one of the officers who had attended the meeting went and informed the minister of defence about it before he left to go to Cameroon. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And when the minister of defence left to go to Cameroon, he took his G2 with him, right?  

G2 is Colonel Ntiwiragabo, N-T-I-W-I-R-A-G-A-B-O.  
A.	Colonel Ntiwiragabo left earlier and the minister joined him there later. 
Q.	So you had two senior officers -- excuse me, two senior staff members out of the country voluntarily after learning that junior officers were gathering to prepare a coup, is that your evidence? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question. 
Q.	So I gather from your evidence that to the best of your knowledge, on the 3rd of April when you learnt about this meeting that had taken place two days earlier on the 1st, you also knew at that time that your minister of defence, accompanied by his G2 staff officer, left the country, even though they had been informed about a meeting to prepare a coup.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	I told you that the information I heard on RTLM talked about a coup attempt.  At that time, I didn't believe that, just like the minister and the colonel who accompanied him abroad.  They could just have seen that as rumours and idle talk.  I didn't exactly know -- I didn't know what the officer who attended the meeting told them prior to the minister's departure.  But when I heard that news on the radio, I concluded that they were just rumours about coup d'état, because there was tensions in the country, because I would say that was a very explosive period, politically and socio-politically in the country, so much so that when I heard that news on RTLM, I did not say that there was a coup d'état as such.  I just understood that there were rumours to the effect that there would be a coup d'état.  That's how I understood things at that time.  But, later, I learnt that there were preparation for a coup d'état.  If I am given time, I will talk about that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could have document F7 given to the witness -- or we can turn to document F7 in the bundle. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you ever come to learn the identities of the person who supposedly met with Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana on the night of the 1st of April? 
A.	Let me -- 
Q.	My question to you was:  Did you ever learn of the identities of any of the persons that supposedly met the prime minister on the 1st of April? 
A.	I was aware of the participants at the meeting from Filip Reyntjens's book.  That's how I came to know about it, but the news on RTLM did not provide the names of people who attended the meeting.  It simply said officers from the south. 
Q.	The issue wasn't sufficiently serious for you to even investigate it back in April of 1994, isn't that so? 
A.	There were so many problems at that time in the country and that was just one more problem and considered to be rumours, and you have to understand my role as director of cabinet.  I was not the director of intelligence.  If the minister left the country without telling me, whereas he was the one who got the information, then it could be probably because at that time he did not see that as a problem.  At that time, also, I didn't see it as a problem.  The problem started when Habyarimana was assassinated.  When I reviewed the film in my mind, then that's where I get a clear picture.  There was a meeting described as a meeting to prepare for a coup d'état.  There was General Dallaire who asked me about a successor, and then, subsequently, the president was assassinated, and then all the events unfolded after his assassination.  
Q.	I think we can both conclude, Colonel Bagosora, that the meeting on the 1st of April, if we can even describe it as a meeting, had nothing to do with the coup d'état, and Filip Reyntjens himself said as much and said so and testified in exactly those terms when he testified in your trial and was cross-examined extensively by your Defence attorney, isn't that so? 
A.	It was not a simple meeting because when you look at the participants and the personalities who were invited, and at that given time, and then when you look at the subsequent events, you cannot talk -- refer to that meeting as an ordinary meeting, because there were things that happened after that meeting. 
Q.	Colonel Bagosora, you used that meeting as a pretext not to contact the prime minister on the 6th and the 7th of April, and I am suggesting to you that it is only a pretext.  It's not a reason.  There was never any reasonable suspicion of her being involved in a coup against President Habyarimana.  Your testimony before this Trial Chamber in relation to that meeting comes only from what you've read years after in the books by Filip Reyntjens, isn't that so? 
A.	If you allow me to talk about the second sequence and the third sequence in a coup d'état, then you realise that there was a coup attempt and then I will answer all your questions on that particular subject.  I don't know why you don't want me to address the issue directly.  You seem to want to bypass that issue.  
Q.	If you look at the document I placed before you, it's F7.  It's the list of supposed participants in that meeting.  No disciplinary action was ever taken against any of these individuals, isn't that so?  
A.	The minister of defence returned on the 9th, three days after the attack on President Habyarimana.  In principle, he was the person who was to deal with the issue because you might have noticed that even in the document governing the functioning of the ministry of defence in the absence of the minister, you will notice that I did not have disciplinary authority over staff, just like I did not have operational authority over units, and people needed time to carry out investigations.  But the events just unfolded so fast.  You had the attacks, the resumption of hostilities and you had the massacres starting in Rwanda and for me to carry out investigations under those circumstances.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) the person that ever investigated this was Filip Reyntjens.  Do you know of any person or entity that has investigated this purported coup meeting on the 1st of April? 
A.	You are dwelling on that issue, but I have told you that there was a meeting whose purpose was described as planning a coup d'état.  But after that meeting, there were more serious events that occurred, and in respect of which we did not carry out any investigations, for instance.  

Up to now, the ICTR, the Office of the Prosecutor have not carried out any investigation on the attack against President Habyarimana.  There have been no investigation.  What prevented the investigations from being carried out.  
Q.	We turn to Reyntjens's testimony on this specific issue.  We can find it at document M9 in my bundle.  We have it in English and French.  It's page 107 of the transcripts of the 16th of September 2004, and if we look at beginning in line 22, in the English text, Reyntjens states: 

"I have interviewed orally and by all sorts of male four or five people who were present and involved, including the lieutenant, Iradukunda, who organised the meeting."  

"As far as the coup d'état is concerned, there is no source among the people present during that meeting or those meetings confirming that the people present there had decided or plotted for a coup d'état.  

"What had happened, according to my sources, was that Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana was upset about the stalemates in putting in place of the institutions and felt that politician from the south were threatened, referring to Gatabazi, who had been killed a few weeks earlier, and she felt that something needed to be done to lift the stalemate.  He goes on in his explanation.  But that's the extent of the investigation that were done on this purported coup."  Isn't that so, the writings of Filip Reyntjens? 
A.	What I can tell you about the meeting and what complicates the meeting and makes a significant meeting is the conduct of the elite -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could the witness repeat his answer because there was a microphone on in another booth. 
(Pages 42 to 53 by Sheriffo Jammeh) 
















1615H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me, Colonel; the interpreters did not get your answer.  Could you repeat it, please. 
THE WITNESS:  
I don't know where to start. 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	My suggestion to you was that, it would seem from your evidence, the only person who investigated this purported coup was Filip Reyntjens.  Then we have his testimony and we have his book in evidence, which was the source of your knowledge about what transpired at that meeting.  Was there ever any other investigation or do you want to respond further on this issue about purported coup on the 1st of April or coup meeting on the 1st of April? 
A.	Well, it's not that you are talking about Fillips Reyntjens, you have his book there.  I can show you a place in the book where he talks about a failed coup d'état -- coup d'état attempt.  You had the meeting on the 1st and 2nd of April, but it didn't work out.  Actually the coup d'état occurred on the 6th.  Fillip Reyntjens talks about a coup d'état attempt and he talks about a coup d'état starting from the 1st and the 2nd of April.  I am not the first person to say this.  Maybe I am the first person to mention it before the Trial Chamber, but I am not the first person to mention such a thing. 
Q.	The information that we have which is a compilation of information from Reyntjens and from André Guichaoua is the list that you have before you, of I think, 10 or 12 names of the purported 17 or 18 who were present.  And what I would suggest to you is that none of these junior officers were investigated by the FAR, disciplined by the FAR.  In fact, they fought alongside the FAR against the RPF, right? 
A.	You are not -- you did not respond to me because I told you, give me Fillip Reyntjens's book and I will show you where he says about a failed coup d'état and I will testify to that before this Trial Chamber.  
Q.	I will ask the question again.  Were any of the persons listed on the document you have in front of you, F7, which seems to be the best list that we have of persons who were present for that purported meeting.  Were any of them ever investigated or disciplined by the FAR? 
A.	I have already told you that during the time -- apart from the rumours around the meeting at Agathe's place and which took a more serious form after the attack against Habyarimana, there were other more important events in the country.  And since those officers whose names are on that list were not my employees, I cannot tell you what happened.  But the fact that the minister was informed about the meeting by one of these officers, I don't know which officer; it's the minister who can tell you how he assessed the situation in order to decide what measures he should adopt in view of that situation.  What I can tell you is that if the minister of defence, Augustin Bizimana, had taken into consideration at that time that the meeting was about a coup d'état, then he would not have travelled to Cameroon.  So if he deemed that it was not necessary to carry out investigations on that issue, I could not have done so because he did not inform me of what the officer who had gone to see him had told him about a meeting.  I knew what transpired at that meeting only when I read Fillip Reyntjens's book.  

	But I persist in telling you that Fillips Reyntjens who provided this list in the same chapter talks about that there was a coup d'état which turned sour and that this -- which turned sour and that's what I want to talk about before this Trial Chamber but you don't want me to do that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I would move the exhibit from the testimony -- sworn testimony of Fillip Reyntjens into evidence.  It's document 9 -- M9 from my bundle.  I would also request that the list of names, document F7 be submitted in evidence. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I would like in particular to talk about document F7.  I thought that the Prosecutor was going to be more proper towards this witness when asking him questions on this document.  But when the Prosecutor asked his questions after -- he asks his questions without giving him all the information contained in F7, because in F7, you have notice number 1, which is very important, but the Prosecutor did not mention it and he -- when asking him questions about the investigations.  Because if you look at F1, the investigations on which the Prosecutor is relying upon, you see that the investigations were organised in 1999 and 2003.  So when he overlooks that notice, he should not be asking the witness, why did the witness not carry out investigations on the 5th of April 1994.  To this effect -- in this regard I think there's something very improper on the part of the Prosecution.  Because in civil law, we will refer this literally as a fraud against -- this would be a fraud against my witness.  This is just what I wanted to point out regarding document F7, Mr. President.  

Now, with regard to the witness's answer, the witness's answer is very important.  But the Prosecutor doesn't want him to provide that answer to the Trial Chamber, but that doesn't matter because we will come back to that during re-examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My application stands that -- that the transcript from Reyntjens's testimony in the Bagosora trial be admitted as P. 513, and that the document F7 be admitted as P. 514.  Just to reply to him, let me give some more background for the document with the list of names.  This list is not compiled by Fillip Reyntjens.  It was actually compiled by André Guichaoua.  In the bundle of documents that I provided, are excerpts from Guichaoua's expert report where he has referred to this -- for this trial which is not received by the Chamber and rather than have a document that lists names and has his commentary, I thought it would be fairer -- a more fair procedure to use an annex that Guichaoua submitted to another book which just has the names and does not have his discursive comments which can also be found among my bundle -- in my bundle as F6 so that everyone can look at it.  It is basically the same information. 

MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, I am wondering about this unfair manner.  The Prosecutor is trying to enter into evidence a document which was used during examination-in-chief for the last 20 minutes.  F7 is a document emanating from Reyntjens and as such, can be associated with excerpts from Reyntjens's interview M9 -- M9.  I beg your pardon, and I made a mistake.  It should be associated with an expert witness called Guichaoua.  So would you agree with me, learned friend that this is unfair and, therefore, you cannot seek to enter into evidence a document, one, you changed the names of the authors at the eleventh hour.  I think my learned friend should tell Mr. Bagosora that he has two sources.  The first source is Mr. Guichaoua and the second source is Reyntjens.  And then both documents should have been discussed and then be admitted.  But, otherwise, I believe that we should not agree to this manner of proceeding when tendering exhibits. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have nothing to add, Your Honour.  I think the record is clear.  I think we tried to provide the Court with the best as we understand where these documents came from and why they would -- should be part of our record. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think that the transcript is admissible, we think it is admissible.  We don't think that we should admit the F7 document.  

Mr. Issa, could you give us the number for the F7 -- for the transcript. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The transcript will be P. 513, five-one-three.  A French, B for English.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit P. 513A and P. 513B admitted)
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would like the witness to take a look at document F5 in my bundle.  This is a letter from Edouard Gasarabwe addressed to Professor Fillip Reyntjens, date the 1st of September 1995, in French, three pages long, and basically it is information that Mr. Gasarabwe is providing to Reyntjens for his investigation.  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	And what I would suggest to you, Colonel Bagosora, is that a participant at that event at the prime minister's house on the 1st of April describes it as a social gathering, and a social gathering of the same type that often occurred with officers from the north.  And you can glance through it.  At the fourth paragraph he mentions that Ndindiliyimana had been invited but could not attend because he had competing authorities.  And in the fifth paragraph he says that this meeting didn't have a political character.  It was more a family gathering.  And then lower down on that first page he says, "We were coming together just like the folks do from Gisenyi and Ruhengeri."  And then on the following page, and I think it's the sixth paragraph, he indicates that he informed his commanding officer, Lieutenant Barufute, before going to the meeting and after returning from it.  And he describes it in the same terms that Reyntjens described it -- described the meeting in his trial testimony that we have admitted as P. 13 -- P. 513. 
Q.	Have you ever seen this letter before? 
A.	No, but I think there's somebody there at the office that read Fillip Reyntjens book -- Fillip Reyntjens you mentioned. 
Q.	This is the contents of this particular letter.  My suggestion to you, Colonel Bagosora, is that everything you have been telling us about a coup and a planned coup from the 1st of April is really just a pretext to justify your failure to contact the prime minister on the 6th of April. 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, when I tried to explain that there was, indeed, a coup d'état, he doesn't allow me to do so or to talk about a coup d'état, but he circumvents matters and wants to prove to me that the coup d'état did not take place whereas at the same time he refuses to give me the chance to talk about the coup d'état.  If I had described the three sequences of the coup d'état, he wouldn't have found it appropriate to take this round about way to prove that there wasn't a coup d'état.  It is that witness Gasarabwe who informed Fillip Reyntjens about the meeting, because I see passages here that Filip Reyntjens entered in his book.  The same Filip Reyntjens as I have told you, well, his book was important for me in my testimony.  Fillip Reyntjens, from all the testimonies that he got in this same manner, wrote in the same book in the chapter dealing with the coup d'état that went array or that failed.  Thus the coup d'état that was prepared by the Prime Minister Agathe.  And she continued to be beating about the bush without wanting to know exactly whether there was a coup d'état or not.  So let me talk about it because subsequently you will say that there wasn't a coup d'état because I wouldn't have given the key evidence of the coup d'état.  And if you continue to tell me or to propose to me that there was no coup d'état whereas there's evidence about a coup d'état having been staged, I do not agree with that manner of proceeding.  I don't agree with you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think that the coup d'état is a relevant and an important issue here.  And even though we are also interested in time, it would be better to know the witness addresses this issue on the witness stand.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay, I will pursue it.  First, I would like to offer in evidence the three-paged letter from 
	Edouard Gasarabwe as P. 514. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, as far as methodology goes, can I suggest to the Prosecutor to tender this document for -- to be admitted into evidence as will have been done with re-examination, otherwise here we would be admitting documents that are still at issue.  So he could wait and tender the document at the end of re-examination in which case we would be able to -- we will be in a position to determine whether it is appropriate to tender or admit this or that document as an exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, given the volume of documents that we will be going through, I don't want to wait until the end of the re-examination to deal with both submissions.  I would like to do it.   I think my own way.  If there's a liberal reason why they should not be admitted, Mr. Nimy can give it to us quite briefly, and if I think there's some substance with his argument, I would agree to have it marked for identification only. But at this stage the witness has already indicated that he recognises the passages from his letter incorporated in the analysis of Fillip Reyntjens, and the witness has already told us of his own knowledge about what happened at that meeting and after that meeting in relation to a purported coup is what he read from Filip Reyntjens.  From that thesis alone my projection is that there's reason to admit it so that the record is clear as to what this informant told Filip Reyntjens prior to arriving at his conclusions. 
MR. NIMY: 
Not at all. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
And that to satisfy the witness, let me also indicate that the book that he has been referring to by the (inaudible) has been admitted in evidence already as a Defence exhibit.  I believe it is D. NZ835.  And the portion of the book that is subtitled The aborted coup is included in that exhibit.  So we have it in the French original and in the English translation.  It's not necessary for us to read this into the record; it's already part of our records.  The Court has it.  And Mr. Issa can actually hand that to the witness if he wants to look at it himself.

MR. WEBSTER (continued):
But, my understanding is that Filip Reyntjens attempted to investigate every possible explanation for the events of April 1994 and he did that with respect to this incident which he entitled "aborted coup".  But he certainly was not suggesting that there was, in fact, a coup.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you've lost me with one remark.  Now, are you saying that this extract is already in evidence already?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, this -- this letter is not in evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Oh, okay.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The witness's --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The witness's testimony was that Mr. Reyntjens incorporated some of the sentences from this letter in his analysis.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

Mr. Nimy -- Mr. Nimy, we have approved the practice of admitting the exhibits in the section of the transcript where they are relevant.  It could facilitate our subsequent review.  Now, if there is a bona fide legal issue we don't mind deferring deciding it, if there is an issue.  Is there an issue with this (inaudible)?  Do you have an issue with the admission of this document?  You see, if you don't have an issue we will admit it, but if there is a bona fide legal issue, which required consideration, then we will deal with it later.  But as a general method, it would be preferable for us to admit the documents closer to the relevance of the testimony.  It makes it is easier when we are reviewing the -- when we are reviewing it.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I only wanted to ascertain that the document that the Prosecution is seeking to tender has been shown to the witness.  I'm not under the impression that this document has been discussed with the witness already.  That is my concern.  I'm not under the impression that the document was discussed with the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I did ask Mr. Issa to place the document in front of the witness, and I directed him to certain paragraphs in the document that I thought were relevant and I summarised them, in English, as I was going through my questions.  I think the witness has seen the document.  In fact, he, himself, commented that he recognised portions of the document from the way Filip Reyntjens describes it in his book.  And I see now that Mr. Issa has just removed the document from the witness.  So, clearly, he has had access to it and was reading it while we were discussing it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster, Mr. Nimy.  We admit the document now.  What is the exhibit number?  
MR. WEBSTER:
514.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. P. 514 admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Colonel Bagosora, I was asked to give you an opportunity to explain what you wanted to tell us about the third phase of successful coup planning.  You wanted to complete a previous answer.  Now is your opportunity to do so.  
A.	I said that the first phase or sequence was executed by General Kagame with his men by murdering President Habyarimana.  I said that the second sequence was executed, in part, by General Dallaire.  Indeed, General Dallaire sent a Colonel Marchal to provide security for Radio Rwanda so Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana could go and deliver a speech there.  General Dallaire was counting on the moderate members of the gendarmerie who (inaudible) and why?  Because General Ndindiliyimana, and he says so in his testimony, in his trial, he failed to make Rusatira to become the head of the army at the time that the ad interim chief of staff was being chosen.  And it is Rusatira who had been -- or, there were plans to have Rusatira play the role of chief of operations.  

Well, Mr. Ndindiliyimana is there and what he has written is there.  I'm not saying that you should read it, but he said that he failed to have Rusatira to be appointed as the ad interim -- the ad interim chief staff of staff, because he would have made it possible to -- or, would have helped in overcoming certain difficulties, but he does not say which difficulties.  

Now, he did everything.  He tried.  As for the third -- well, the second in sequence succeeded in part because the radio was securitised.  The third part was that -- well, the elements of the gendarmerie did not collaborate so they had to move on to the third sequence.  

General Dallaire, after having realised and he says so in his book somewhere, by the way.  So after realising that the moderate members of the gendarmerie had changed their opinions, he persisted and sent Colonel Marchal with the ten Belgian soldiers who had come to Kigali to take Agathe to the radio.  And he made all attempts to have Uwilingiyimana to arrive at the radio in order to deliver the speech.  And this was done outside of my knowledge.  And I said so yesterday.  

The armed forces did not know about this either, and even the members of her government were not aware of this either; whereas, her government -- and am I'm talking about Agathe, the prime minister here.  Whereas the members of her government had sent her a letter asking her not to make any further statements without having been given the mandate to do so.  

And I would like to say here, therefore, that the coup d'état that Filip Reyntjens talked about went awry, because they didn't have a chief of operations.  Because, in the meantime, we had appointed Gatsinzi in the place of the chief of staff because he was in Butare at the time.  And so the UNAMIR chief or commander failed to have an ally in the person of Rusatira.

So to sum up, the coup d'état was effectively -- was indeed staged but it was aborted because it failed and this had the -- its consequences, since the failure of that coup d'état led to the resumption of the war, a war that lasted three months.  And it's a war that entailed massacres.  So we had these three months of massacres that degenerated into a genocide, since the Prosecutor of this Tribunal has not yet so far established any proof that that genocide was planned.  But I believe that those massacres at some point degenerated into a genocide, into the genocide of the Tutsis.

To conclude, therefore, I would like to tell you, Mr. President, Your Honours, that if General Habyarimana had not been murdered and if the war hadn't resumed, there wouldn't have been those massacres and, therefore, we wouldn't have had the genocide of the Tutsis that we're talking about.  I'm done.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, in terms of time, we think it is probably the right time to consider our adjournment.  How are you doing?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think it will take me at least the entire morning session tomorrow, and given the notice that we received that we will be concluding early tomorrow, I'm not even very confident about that.  But I will make every effort to re-organise my outline and to move to the material expeditiously tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are not concluding early tomorrow.  We are having a break.  Oh, you mean just for the morning session?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  But we will resume after lunch tomorrow. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay, yeah.  So, I will try to finish before the end of the morning session but it may actually spill over into the afternoon.  But I'll complete tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  Colonel Bagosora, we have to adjourn now.  I don't think you would want to contribute to Mr. Nzirorera being late for his medical appointment.  

We take the recess now until tomorrow.  
(Court adjourned at 1655H)
