(Witness enters courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 21st of November 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  The appearances are the same on both sides.  

Mr. Witness, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We resume your testimony now.  I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you commenced giving your evidence last week.  The Prosecutor will continue her examination of you.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS 3/10,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Witness, I shall continue with your cross-examination.  Last Thursday when we parted, I had finished with the events pertaining to the centre of Kayanga.  I shall move to another point now which concerns the list of persons which was shown to you the last time.  You gave some information in regard to this list of persons and it seems to me that this information was based on your personal opinion of these people.  
A.	That's right. 
Q.	Do these people sit in the same Gacaca courts as you do? 
A.	Are you referring to the people whose names are on the list of witnesses?  I didn't quite understand your question.  Are you asking me whether these people are on the list that concerns the Gacaca courts?  
Q.	I shall make my question more precise.  The Defence counsel gave you a list with about 10 names, and when you looked at this list you said that you knew all these people.  Amongst these people there were two, of whom you said that they were among the people who took part in the killing of your family members.  
A.	I follow you. 
Q.	I think that you've just told us that your opinion of these people was a purely personal one; is that right? 
A.	Of course, that is my personal opinion, but this opinion is shared by the public. 
Q.	Witness, do these people sit in the same Gacaca court as you do? 
A.	I do not think that you have understood.  The Gacaca court is a separate court.  There are other courts.  I, for my part, take part in the proceedings of the Gacaca court, but I am not a judge.  Today there is another court which has been created by government which now replaces the canton court, which is the court that had jurisdiction over matters at the level of a commune.  ******************************* which is a district court now.  I am not a member of the Gacaca court, which is a separate, special court. 
Q.	Witness, you have not answered my question.  You said that you were a member of the Gacaca court? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the -- (microphones overlapping) 
THE WITNESS:
Madam Prosecutor, I have explained to you that you must make a difference between the district court and the Gacaca court.  This is not the first time I have explained this to you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was saying that the verb "to sit" may have a connotation to the witness of sitting as a judge, and I think that is what he was answering.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, but I think I put the question clearly because the witness said that he took part in Gacaca sessions.  I asked him whether he had indeed said that he was a member of the Gacaca courts, and he said that he was not a member of the Gacaca courts ********************************.  So my question is whether he is a member of the court, of the Gacaca court.  
THE WITNESS:
I take part in the sessions of the Gacaca as a member of the public in the cellule, but I am not a member of the committee of the Gacaca court.  ************************************* that makes up a certain court that collaborates with the district court which does the groundwork, in fact, for this district court. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, let's forget this body that works with the district court and let's please focus, if you will, on the Gacaca court.  
A.	All right. 
Q.	As you take part in these Gacaca sessions, did you or did you not observe the presence of people whose names you saw on the list? 
A.	Yes.  Some of the people whose names appear on the list take part with me in Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	In your view, were these people called to give testimony during these Gacaca sessions? 
A.	When we are in Gacaca sessions anyone may take the floor and say what he knows about what happened in his cellule.  It is an inalienable right of every citizen. 
Q.	Witness, you have not answered my question, which was fairly precise.  These people whose names you saw and about whom you said that you knew them well, have they been called to give testimony at Gacaca sessions? 
A.	No.  In Gacaca sessions these people are not mentioned.  Actually, only the victims are talked about and their executioners. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness corrects:  the executioners or criminals, those who committed the crimes I talked about.  And there is no real interest in the victims as such, and the people about whom you are talking are victims.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, the names on the list -- on the list you saw, you said that two of these people took part in the killing of your family, so there were more criminals than victims, weren't there?  
A.	It is true, as far as I am concerned, and you are right if you refer only to my case, but actually these people are the victims if you look at the general picture of what happened in our area.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that these two people were involved in the killing of your wife and your son? 
A.	It's true. 
Q.	So it is understandable that you might resent these people because of these events, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it's true. 
Q.	So does this feeling of resentment explain that you cannot think any good about them and you cannot testify in a manner favourable to them? 
A.	Perhaps you are right, but you mustn't forget that we live together. 
Q.	It is true that you do live together, but in spite of that observation, is it possible that you could come to this Court and testify in favour of these two people? 
A.	Madam Prosecutor, you're certainly right, but let me explain.  These people did in fact commit atrocities against members of my family, but I must wait for the courts to do their work.  That should not prevent me from getting on with my life and living in harmony with them, as I live in harmony with other members of the public. 
Q.	You said that these people were not called to Gacaca courts, court sessions, but other people, as you stated here before this Trial Chamber, other people, in particular those that give shelter to your family, were well aware of the events that they were charged with? 
A.	Listen, in Rwanda we have two different existing situations.  On the one hand, you have cases that are tried in Gacaca courts, and there are other matters, on the other hand, which are tried by ordinary courts in due course.  I do not know whether you do not understand that. 
Q.	Witness, you are not answering the precise questions that I put -- that I put to you.  You said that during Gacaca courts that you attend no one mentioned these two people as being criminals.  
A.	Yes, Madam Prosecutor, that is what I have said.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Witness, we shall move on to another point regarding André Rwamakuba.  You stated, Witness, that you knew André Rwamakuba and you had heard about him.  Can you tell us what the circumstances of all this were? 
A.	This is a question that was put to me by Defence counsel here.  Defence counsel asked me whether I knew Rwamakuba, and I said that I did because I had heard about him.  I also added that I knew the older brother of Rwamakuba, who owned a secondary school in our region which our children attended.  Rwamakuba's family is a family of intellectuals and it was well known, but I did not know Rwamakuba in person.  I knew his older brother, who had created a secondary school in our area and who had also been to university.  I answered that question when it was put to me by Defence counsel. 
Q.	Witness, have you ever had the opportunity of meeting and seeing André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I know his older brother and his mother because they lived near the school that I have just told you about.  
Q.	Please answer my question.  You have already said what you are telling us two, three, four times.  I have asked you a precise question.  Please answer the question:  Have you had the opportunity to meet or see André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I've never seen him. 
Q.	So if someone were to be introduced to you as André Rwamakuba, would you be able to say that it was André Rwamakuba, or not? 
A.	No, I couldn't identify him, but I could identify his older brother. 
Q.	So, Witness, apart from never hearing about him, never having seen him, not being able to recognise him, what do you know about André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I heard that he was a doctor and that he was the younger brother of his older brother, who was the principal of the school that I mentioned.  I also heard that his children were born -- or came of a wealthy family in this region.  That's what I can tell you about André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	So, apart from the fact that he was a doctor, older brother -- younger brother of his older brother, that he came from a good family, what do you know about André Rwamakuba?  What else do you know?  
A.	I have heard about him.  I heard about him during the practice of multiparty politics.  For example, it was said that he was a member of the MDR party.  
Q.	Can you tell us when you heard about André Rwamakuba as a member of the MDR? 
A.	I really couldn't tell you the year, but it was during the era of multiparty politics, when the MRND ceased to be the single party. 
Q.	Witness, your information is not very precise.  In the first instance, you had not heard about André Rwamakuba, apart from the fact that he was an intellectual.  You did not know him; you'd never seen him, so what could be your contribution to this Trial Chamber in respect of Mr. Rwamakuba?  
A.	Are you putting this question because I do not know him very well?  I didn't quite understand your question, especially the last part of it.  Madam Prosecutor, are you talking about a contribution?  In what sense?  
Q.	I shall repeat my question, Witness.  The information that you have provided is hearsay, for the most part.  You do not know him; you've never seen him; you'd never heard that he did anything.  So what could you possibly contribute to this Trial Chamber's business in respect of André Rwamakuba?  
A.	Let me talk for at least one minute about this.  Regarding the MDR and Rwamakuba, there were meetings that were held at the commune office in our commune.  Some of my neighbours who belonged to the secteur committee of the MDR party talked about in bars, in church, or perhaps in the market, or even when I visited my neighbours, they talked about it.  They said that Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR and the MDR commune committee.  I do not know what position he occupied in this MDR commune committee, but I did know that he was a member of it in our commune. 
Q.	Witness, you have still not answered my question, but I shall move on to something so that we shall not dwell too much on it.  

On Tuesday, during your examination, you said that you could only talk about what had occurred in your commune and the events that occurred in the place where you lived; that is in your cellule.  That's what you said, isn't it?  
A.	That's right.  I think that is what should be.  
Q.	It is therefore normal that you will not be aware of all the other events that occurred outside your cellule, isn't it? 
A.	That's true.  But I believe I said that I was going to talk about what happened in my secteur and in neighbouring secteurs.  I said I couldn't know what was happening in the entire commune. 
Q.	When you talk about neighbouring secteurs, could you be a little bit more specific, please? 
A.	I'm talking about Kayanga, Rutunga, ***********. 
Q.	So what you knew of the events that took place in neighbouring secteurs, is it because you were an eyewitness to those events or is it because what happened there was related -- was recounted to you? 
A.	I know what happened in my secteur, but since I know the inhabitants of the other secteurs and I used to discuss with them, that is how I came to know what happened in other secteurs. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm going to put a question to you concerning the meetings that took place in the communal office.  Can you give us the dates of those meetings, approximately? 
A.	The parties organised meetings on different dates.  You know, it has been a while since all this happened.  I believe that it was around 1993 and, by the way, I was not particularly interested in what political parties were doing.  What I'm aware of, though, is that there were many meetings that were held at the communal office, and I would like to reiterate this.  I think that was in 1993; it was in 1994. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, regarding André Rwamakuba, you testified before this Court that you never heard his name being called in respect of crimes committed in Gacaca proceedings? 
A.	That is what I stated, but I believe that you asked me a question concerning Kabarera and the Gacaca sessions, and I think I gave explanations thereon. 
Q.	Yes, Witness.  However, you later said that after information and data were collected and information processed, at least three persons did mention André Rwamakuba's name.  
A.	That is correct. 	
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the list that was handed over to you bearing the names of persons who gave personal opinions, there are at least seven persons who alleged -- who are alleged to have mentioned Rwamakuba's name at Gacaca hearings.  
A.	I know two persons from my cellule who mentioned Rwamakuba's name after the information had been collected.  This happened in September or October, during the information-confirmation stage; two persons did mention his name. 
Q.	So you are saying that this was in your cellule.  Is it therefore possible that in other cellules other persons might have mentioned Rwamakuba, André's name, without your being aware of it? 
A.	I definitely would have learnt of that because wherever we are, for instance, in the market, we talk about what happened.  If his name had been mentioned, I would have been aware of that.  The Gasabo and Kayanga secteurs are very close to my own secteur.  I know all that happens there.  And besides, ******************** and the inhabitants of that secteur know me and tell me everything that happens in their secteur. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, well, you do, indeed, talk about information that you gather from the market and not of information emanating from information that is collected and put together.  
A.	We often talk about what happens in our Gacaca hearings, when you meet somebody and you ask him what is happening in their Gacaca hearings.  Well, I'm not inventing anything.  These are things that we regularly talk about. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will put the question to you again.  You have indeed told us that you have never heard people talk of André Rwamakuba in Gacaca hearings.  
A.	I have told you that I heard people talk about him in my cellule during Gacaca hearings. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, why therefore didn't you, from the onset, say that you heard André Rwamakuba's name being mentioned, at least during the examination-in-chief?  So we had to move further in the cross-examination for you to talk about that.  
A.	I will crave your indulgence here, Madam Witness -- Madam Prosecutor.  I think I said that his name had been mentioned and I did give the names of those who mentioned his name, and I repeated this before the Trial Chamber.  I don't see how you can say that I did not right away say that his name was mentioned.  I did give evidence to that effect in this Court and I explained this last week. 
Q.	Well, let's move on, Mr. Witness.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
My notes support what the witness has said.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, can you please repeat your question?  The microphone was not connected when you spoke.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  I was saying that my notes supported the last answer that the witness gave.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us when André Rwamakuba was mentioned at Gacaca hearings, what were the charges that were brought against him, or what was he accused of? 
A.	It was said that he led attacks in that cellule. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you know that since 1996 Mr. André Rwamakuba's name was on a list of criminals that were being prosecuted, or sought, in Rwanda?  
A.	I knew nothing of it.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you had been aware of the crimes that André Rwamakuba might have committed, would you have been in a position to come to talk about them before this Chamber today? 
A.	Of course, I would have said so since I have given the names of those who committed crimes for the purpose of further reconciliation amongst Rwandans.  If he had committed crimes, I would have talked about them, and if he hadn't committed any, I would also have said so. 
Q.	Well, I made it clear before this Chamber that even as a Defence witness, you would have done so.  
A.	Yes, I would have stated it before this Trial Chamber, just as we do before Gacaca courts. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you as well, Madam Prosecutor. 
Q.	Now I'm going to submit a list in conclusion.  I would like to put questions to you pertaining to persons whose names are on that list.  
MS. FALL:
May the list be handed over to the other parties?  Well, apparently they have the list already.  I wonder if the witness has the list before him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was more than one list I have.  I'm not sure which one you're referring to.  I have more than one list that has been used.  Can I see which one it is?  
MS. FALL:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, I gave you a list on which there are some annotations.  That is the list I'm referring to. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, certainly, we actually have the document.  But we have more than one list, so I just wanted to see which one it is you are referring to.  So I do have -- we have been assisted.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, sir, that's the one I'm referring to.  If you need additional lists, we are ready to provide you with them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we are okay now.  Thank you.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I will request you to look at that list, and please don't call out names.  And can you please mainly refer to numbers that are -- that come before each name?  Concerning No. 1, what do you know of that person -- or do you know that person? 
A.	No. 

Madam Prosecutor, when I look at the first name, it does appear to me that I know the person.  I don't know the family name, but I do know somebody who bears that name.  
Q.	Can you tell me the circumstances under which you knew the person who bears that first name? 
A.	I know that she was married to someone who held an influential position.  I'm not in a position to tell you her husband's name, but I do know that he held an influential position.  I am going to tell you the truth, and I will tell you which persons I know and which ones I do not know. 
Q.	Now, concerning No. 1, can you tell us what relations you had with her? 
A.	I had no relations with that person. 
MR. HOOPER:
I think "relations" may have a particular meaning -- (microphones overlapping) 
THE WITNESS:
We did not live in the same secteur.  
MR. HOOPER:
-- normally, I believe "sexual congress", so perhaps the question needn't be quite so specific.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness.  
A.	I had no relations with that person. 
Q.	Did you know the person well? 
A.	You yourself must have noticed that I somewhat hesitated.  I knew that person in passing, and I didn't know the person very well, and besides, the person still lives in my -- in our commune and I see her from time to time. 
Q.	You knew, however, that she was married to a person who held an important position? 
A.	Yes.  Her husband held an important position in our commune. 
Q.	How about the No. 2? 
A.	I do not know the person. 
Q.	If I were to tell you that this is a person who lived in the same secteur as yourself and who at the time of the events was 16 years of age? 
A.	If that is somebody who is aged less than 20, it's somebody who is the same age as my children, I might not know him or her.
Q.	How about No. 3? 
A.	I know No. 3. 
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which you knew the person? 
A.	I know him because of his work; he was a doctor and that is the framework in which I knew the person.  And you know that usually medical doctors are known to everyone, and that person lives in a neighbouring secteur, in a secteur that is neighbouring to mine. 
Q.	Can you tell us if you have had to see that person at a specific or special occasion? 
A.	Do you mean during the war or prior to the war?  If you are talking about the period of the war, I saw him.  Besides, I think I talked to that person.  I have talked to you about that person -- talked about that person before this Chamber. 
Q.	That is correct, Mr. Witness.  Can you tell us where that person is today? 
A.	The No. 3 person is in custody. 
Q.	Do you know why he is in custody? 
A.	Everyone is saying that he is accused of genocide, but I don't know exactly the crimes he's accused of. 
Q.	How about the No. 4? 
A.	I know No. 4:  No. 4 is a lady and she is a responsable of a cellule. 
Q.	Have you had the opportunity of seeing that person recently? 
A.	I met her here.  We did not come together, but when I saw her -- I met her where I am lodged.  But after her testimony, I never saw her again. 
Q.	So you saw her prior to her giving testimony? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you -- were you opportuned to discuss with her? 
A.	She does not live very far from my home.  She lives in a neighbouring secteur, but I must tell you that here in Arusha -- 
Q.	Did both of you hold any discussions here in Arusha? 
A.	Of course; I've had to converse or to discuss with her since we were in the same house. 
Q.	Concerning -- how about No. 5? 
A.	I also met No. 5 here. 
Q.	Did you know him before? 
A.	I know him before because of his occupation. 
Q.	How about No. 6? 
A.	I know No. 6.  He's also known because of his occupation. 
Q.	Have you seen him recently? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And the No. 7? 
A.	Prior to the war I knew No. 7.  He used to work at the bank. 
Q.	Have you met him recently? 
A.	No.  The last time I saw him was before the war. 
Q.	And the No. 8? 
A.	I know No. 8.  He was a member of the population but he also carried out activities.  He was a teller.  He used to sell gemstones.  He did many things. 
Q.	Do you know where this person is today? 
A.	That person is also in custody. 
Q.	Would you know why he is in prison? 
A.	It must be because of the genocide. 
Q.	Do you know where he's accused of having committed acts of genocide? 
A.	I do not -- I'm not familiar with his case file, but at the time information was being collected, as I told you.  I was able to learn that his name was mentioned during the Gacaca hearings for the cellules.  At least, that's what I learned. 
Q.	Whereas you are aware of all that happened in your cellule and in the neighbouring secteurs, you do not know that this person was accused of genocide at Ndatemwa? 
A.	He's accused instead of having committed crimes at a location close to Ndatemwa and in other cellules.  Now, I do remember he's also accused of having destroyed houses at the Ndatemwa centre. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, for somebody who knows everything and who can explain the events, I needed to refresh your memory in respect of offences he's accused of.  
A.	Well, thank you for having refreshed my memory, Madam Prosecutor.  
Q.	How about No. 9? 
A.	I do not know the No. 9. 
Q.	And yet he lived in the same secteur as yourself.  
A.	Which secteur are you talking about?  
Q.	The Rutunga or Gikomero secteur.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor's microphone was not on when she asked the last question, Mr. President.  She may have to repeat it.  Thank you, sir.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Even if I were to tell you that she was married to No. 5? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The interpreters have wanted you to repeat the -- (microphones overlapping).  The interpreters have requested that you repeat the earlier question. 
MS. FALL:
I apologise to the interpreters.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So I was saying that even if I were to tell you that No. 10 was married to No. 5, whom you know?  
A.	I did not know the person's name.  I knew this person by sight.  I now see who it is.  
Q.	No. 11? 
A.	I don't know this person. 
Q.	Even if I were to tell you that this No. 11 is the son of No. 8? 
A.	I did not know this person's first name.  I knew the family name.  That is why I was unable to confirm that I knew this person.  I think you're right. 
Q.	So, contrary to what you said in the beginning, you do know this person well? 
A.	Yes, I know this person.  I know this person's family name. 
Q.	Do you know where this person is now? 
A.	I do not.  I knew that this person lived in Kigali, where he was a trader, but I don't know what has become of him now. 
Q.	Let us move on to No. 12.  
A.	There's several people, at least three, who have this family name.  I know, as I said, three people bearing this name:  one in Rutunga; another in Kayanga; and a third in Gasabo.  Since there is no first name, I really couldn't say who it is.  
Q.	Unfortunately, this is all the information we received, but this person was in Ndatemwa during the events.  
A.	If this person was in Ndatemwa, then I do see who it is now.  At that time this person was 27 years old.  It was a young person and this person was a trader in the centre of Ndatemwa. 
Q.	No. 13 now.  
A.	I look at this name.  I know the family name, but I don't know this person's first name.  If I were to know at least the area where this person lived, then I might be able to say something about it. 
Q.	If I told you that this person was a member of the MDR, what would you say? 
A.	It really doesn't help me. 
Q.	Let us move on to No. 14.  
A.	I know No. 14. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you know this person and what your relationship with the person is? 
A.	This person was the accounting officer of the commune.  I know that this person is currently in prison.  As to our relationship, there is none.  You know, in Rwanda, if you have not exchanged presents or cows or you have not been a godfather to someone's child or you've not married somebody's family member or that sort of thing, there is no relationship between you.  There cannot be any relationship between you and anyone. 
Q.	Can it be said, however, that this is your good friend? 
A.	No, we're not friends.  However, we have been in conflict. 
Q.	Shall we move on to No. 15? 
A.	When the war broke out, No. 15 was a young man and he's in prison today. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. FALL:
I have no further questions for this witness, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, under the rules of proceedings you still have to answer some more questions.  On this occasion the counsel for the Accused will have the opportunity to re-examine you on certain matters which it may be necessary for him to do so.  So you will now answer Mr. Hooper. 
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you were asked about Gacaca and you remember the list of names amongst whom you identified those responsible for the murder of your wife and son.  Can I ask you this:  In Gacaca proceedings, are the excesses of the RPF or the excesses of revengeful Tutsis a subject for Gacaca hearings?  Are they discussed at all?  
A.	No.  These questions are never raised during these Gacaca sessions. 
Q.	Now, a matter was put to you which I wasn't clear about and I'm going to invite the Prosecutor at this point, if she will, to clarify the question.  As I understood the question, you had named two people on a list as having provided, late in the day, information concerning André Rwamakuba in the course of Gacaca.  As I understood it, the Prosecutor was putting to you that seven people on that list had, in fact, named André Rwamakuba in Gacaca proceedings.  That was what was put to you and I merely want it clarified if that in fact was what was being put, that 7 on the list had named André Rwamakuba in Gacaca proceedings, or not, before I go on to my question.  I didn't interrupt at the time and I hope that the matter can be clarified now.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I put the question to the witness and I was satisfied with the witness's answer.  I asked the witness if he knew that -- that at least seven people had mentioned the name of Rwamakuba in Gacaca sessions, and I asked the witness whether he was aware of all that had been said in other cellules.  
MR. HOOPER:
And so I take it the Prosecution are putting on information or instructions the fact that seven of those people on the list have in fact named Rwamakuba in Gacaca proceedings.  Am I correct in that assumption?  
THE WITNESS:
Is the question for me?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, Mr. Witness, no; for the Prosecution.  
MS. FALL:
Witness, I have put the question.  I have just said what -- I repeated what I said before.  I am not going to answer that question, I think.  Perhaps you might be more attentive to what I say. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, Mr. President, it's an important matter and I'd ask for the Prosecution kindly to clarify their position.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, this is a legal discussion which ought not to concern you, so would you remove your headphones, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
The matter was put in a particular way, in a very specific way, to the witness.  And what I'm asking is was that a question of fancy or was it a question based on instructions, on information?  Is it being put as the Prosecutor's case that seven of the witnesses on the list have in fact named André Rwamakuba in Gacaca proceedings?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I think it's a question that you ought to answer because it may simply be a question of language, or it may not, and you have to clarify whether you are putting to the witness this base of information you have or not.  I think it's a question that you ought to answer. 
MS. FALL:
Once more, Mr. President, I shall repeat what I said and repeated.  I put the question to the witness as to whether he was aware that at least seven people appearing on that list said that they had given information in Gacaca sessions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see, there's been no evidence of that document at this trial, and so I think the Court is entitled to know whether you are putting that question from information that you have, or not.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, perhaps some parts of the transcript might be helpful.  I'm referring here to what happened in previous sessions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So am I to interpret from that that you are putting this as part of your case, that you have information to support the assertion?  That's the position, is it? 
 
MS. FALL:
Monsieur le Témoin - (microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
 -- to call me Mr. Witness. 
MS. FALL:
I'm really very sorry, Mr. President.  Mr. President, I think that we all know that on this list of witnesses shown by Mr. Hooper, and I am referring more precisely to the list of people shown by Mr. Hooper, we know that these people have made statements -- these people made statements.  I shan't go into further detail as we are in open session.  And I think a reading of certain statements during previous sessions would be quite edifying. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, we know they gave evidence at this trial and that they made statements to the ICTR investigators, but that's not what you put to the witness, and I think as a matter -- as we have to evaluate this evidence at a later stage, it's -- and I suppose it will affect how the Defence cross-examines this witness, they need to know whether you are going to try to prove that seven people on the list gave evidence at the Gacaca hearings or not.  I think that's a simple matter, that it's either something that you intend to prove because you have information or it was a question that was put like that or it's not a matter which you intend to prove.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would just like to say that we have information which we received from several sources and from statements.  This is a question we put to the witness, and the witness gave us an answer.  For the time being, we do not have an official position in respect of the information we received.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  That's your clear answer.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
As I understand it, and I take it the matter was put on the basis of the Prosecution's understanding of statements made in the course of testimony relating to Gacaca by Prosecution witnesses.  So that's clarified for me the situation.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you join us?  And Mr. Witness, if we can come back now to my question.  You've told us that, as I understand it, two people named by you on that list have -- you think it was September, in Gacaca, at a late opportunity, mentioned André Rwamakuba, and you told us a moment ago that it was in the context of Rwamakuba leading attacks in that cellule; that is, your cellule.  And just for a moment if we can remind ourselves from your details because I don't want to mention it out loud, the name of your cellule, which we can see.  And may I ask you this:  These attacks that Rwamakuba led were, you say, attacks led within that cellule; is that correct? 
A.	No, he never led attacks in my cellule. 
Q.	And I understand that.  I think we all understand that.  But these allegations being made against him by these two people, were they that he had in fact led attacks in that cellule? 
A.	That's right.  These are allegations made by these two people.  These people said that Rwamakuba led an attack in our cellule, and you understand that when reference is made to an attack or to leading an attack, it is leading an attack to kill.  If someone leads an attack, it is to kill people.  
Q.	Is Ndatemwa trading centre in that cellule? 
A.	I believe I have already explained to you that the Ndatemwa trading centre is astride three, or spans three different cellules that do not belong to the same secteur. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now I want to come to a matter that was put to you last week, and I'd ask that you be provided with the documents that you were provided last week, and that was a statement in Kinyarwanda that was said to refer to you.  If that can be provided, please, together with the French translation that was provided in respect of that document.  
MR. HOOPER:
As those matters go to you, can I ask you, Mr. President, whether the French translation document is a document of four pages, or three?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have a four-page document.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, you may recall that we asked for a translation of the statement and that was the document that was produced.  We hadn't had sight of it before it was produced, and it contains matters which I've only subsequently appreciated were there.  But it was provided to you in that way and I hope I can deal with it as best I can through this witness.  

Can the Prosecution please provide their documents to the witness?  And while that's being done, can I also provide an approximate translation in English of the statement, not of the translation, of the Kinyarwanda statement?  
MS. FALL:
At this point I would request that the witness remove his headset.  

Mr. President, I see what Mr. Hooper is driving at when he refers to the three-page statement and that this is possibly four pages in translation.  I do not know whether this is the problem, but I would like to explain what might have occurred.  We asked for a translation of this document.  Accompanying this translation, there was a page which contained personal particulars that we received.  It is a problem for us, but it would not be very serious, we feel.  This information has nothing to do with the translation of the document, although it was unfortunately included in the translation and handed over to the Defence and to the Trial Chamber.  I would like to say that the translation is in fact the first three pages and the last page has nothing to do with the statement in Kinyarwanda.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, do you now have both the Kinyarwanda document and the translation, together with the fourth page of that translation or the notes that were attached to it?  I'd like you to have -- 
A.	I have a document in French. 
Q.	You have a document in French.  I can provide you with -- well, someone can provide you with -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda booth indicates that they do not have the document in French. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I see the time, two minutes to go.  Can I -- well, I'll get this photocopied over the adjournment.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	First of all, Mr. Witness, let me ask you this.  Last week you made it plain that this statement has nothing to do with you and that it's your belief it refers to a younger man called just Matabaro; is that correct? 
A.	What did you say?  Wait.  Just wait a minute.  Let me look at the document.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to know whether he did give a first name.  I recall that he said that he knew the family but he couldn't recall the first name of this person. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think there might be a pronunciation problem.  I think, as I understood Mr. Hooper, you said "just", meaning "merely" or "only" and not -- am I correct?  So he was not suggesting there was a first name.  I think he said it was "just Matabaro". 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you're looking at the Kinyarwanda document at this point and reminding yourself of what you saw four or five days ago.  You'll be able to take that document with you during the adjournment and remind yourself of its contents.  But just coming to the point, as I understand it from what you said to the Prosecutor last week -- Mr. Witness, if I can have your attention for a moment.  Sorry to interrupt your reading.  

Mr. Witness, you'll get the opportunity very shortly to read that at your leisure again, but as one understands one's -- your evidence, last week, your position was that this statement refers indeed to an Matabaro but that person is not you, and is a younger man, and that consequently the allegations contained in that statement have absolutely nothing to do with you.  Would that be a fair summary of your position, or not? 
A.	You're right. 
MR. HOOPER:
So we're about to rise.  Before we rise, can the Prosecution indicate whether they still maintain that this statement refers to this witness?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I quite understand Mr. Hooper's strategy.  As we said, at this time we have received this information.  We asked for supplementary information that we have not yet received.  We are saying quite sincerely that it is not possible for us today to state -- to say in the affirmative that this is the same person.  
MR. HOOPER:
So is the Prosecution withdrawing its allegation at this point against this witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we should better take the break now.  Although, Ms. Fall, if you do have a clear answer at this stage, it will affect what happens after the break.  Do you have a clear position as yet?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we prefer to wait till after the break to give our answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break now.   
MR. HOOPER:
May I just, before we rise, invite the witness to take the statement he has with him and we'll send in also a copy of the French statement?  He's francophone and will have no difficulty reading that as well.  Thank you.  
(Court recessed at 1032H) 
(Pages 1 to 17 by Karen Holm)














(Court resumed at 1106H)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I appreciate this is the fifth day of your evidence, and I hope not to take up very much more time, but you have now been provided with both the Kinyarwanda statement, which you saw last week, and the four-page document from the Prosecutor that contains, on the first three pages, an approximate translation of the Kinyarwanda statement and for the remainder of the document various notes.  Dealing, first of all, with the statement -- and there's now been an approximate English translation of the document circulated, which you don't have, Mr. Witness, but others do -- there's a clear statement in the Kinyarwanda, which appears at the sixth line of the English translation, where the witness states, "I charge Matabaro, who lives in Kabere cellule" --  K-A-B-E-R-E.  And you were telling us last week that, as we know, you do not live in that cellule.

And you told us last week that Kabere, as it's spelt indeed in the statement relating to the other Matabaro, is indeed a cellule; is that correct or not, that Kabere is in fact a cellule?
A.	Yes, Kabere cellule does exist.  It forms part of Gikomero secteur. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  So, on the face of this document, immediately we have an identification of somebody else, it's your case, your position.  
MR HOOPER:
Just before we move from there, when this matter was being discussed by the Prosecutor and yourself, the Prosecutor made the comment that they would make inquiries as to whether Kabere cellule existed.  And I'd like to know whether they have a result of that inquiry, please.  So I'll ask the question again.  Have the Prosecution, as they stated they would, made inquiries as to whether Kabere exists as a cellule?
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I'm going to give a general answer to the question that was put to me prior to the brief recess to this one.  When we got information concerning the -- from the person in Kigali in respect of this statement, we actually said that we were going to seek further information, which is what we did soon after the hearing, by the way, by telephone I think -- my team is here to testify to this, so by telephone we got the person who said he or she was going to provide us with information 30 minutes later.

But I must say that so far we don't have the additional information concerning this matter.  We are still awaiting it, and as I've had occasion to say, we therefore cannot officially or formally today say that it was the same person or not.  

A while ago Counsel Hooper asked whether we were going to withdraw what we said concerning the allegations, and that is why I am saying that I'm giving a general answer in order not to go back to this.  We said we cannot withdraw or retract it, because it would appear to be premature, since we do not yet -- we have not yet received the information that we requested.  But it is certain that if we have such information and that it is correct to the effect that it is not the same person, we will, in all sincerity, retract our allegation.  I think I have addressed that issue comprehensively and definitively.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, these --
MS. FALL:
I would also like to make it clear, Mr. President, that indeed, when we personally carried out research here, we realised that a Kabere does indeed exist.
MR. HOOPER:
So the product of the research was that this cell does exist, where this witness in the PV that we have charges Matabaro who lives in Kabarera (sic) cellule.  

Now, I notice that when my friend was on her feet a moment ago, she referred to getting information -- and this will be relevant to my further questions this morning -- from a person in Kigali.  But, last week, as I understood it, it was a person in Gikomero, and I invite the Prosecution to clarify the source of their information.  Is it a person in Kigali or a person in Gikomero?  The latter was stated to be the procureur for Gikomero.  Is that the source of the information or not?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, there is also a point of clarification as to the name of the cellule.  I think the translation came over, or it came over as Kabarera cellule.  Is that what you intended? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Wasn't it Kabere?  
MR. HOOPER:
Kabere, sorry, yes, thank you very much, as in K-A-B-E-R-E.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  

So I invite my friend to clarify the source of information.  Was it the procureur for Gikomero, someone in Gikomero, or someone in Kigali?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think Mr. Hooper is splitting hairs.  I'm not going to keep coming back to what has been said already.  I have just made (sic) the difference between the information that we had in respect of the general charge that was preferred and the allegations concerning the witness and the allegations resulting from this statement that was provided to us by the representative of the prosecutor's office at Gikomero.  I think it is very clear that this is what I have always stated concerning information that we received and it is that same person -- it is from that same person that we requested additional information which, so far, we haven't received.  

And here I would like to insist to say that it is premature for the Prosecution to withdraw whatever allegation it made in this respect, because I think I was very clear when we requested information, we gave the name of the witness.  Without saying that it was a Defence witness, we gave his complete -- his full name, we gave the cellule, and it is from that that we got the information that we were given.

So it behoves us, therefore, to have further information.  And, once again, on the basis of that information, if we are certain that there was a mistake, we will be sincere enough to come and state it here before the Trial Chamber.
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  I merely comment that it is six days since the allegation was made -- a serious allegation.  One would have thought that, by now, the Prosecution would have furnished themselves with the necessary information to either stand by it, or withdraw it.
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the person charged in this PV is a Matabaro who lives in Kabere, and that is not you; is that correct?
A.	No, I am not the person.  And here I have my voter's card.  On my voter's card you can see my precise cellule, and you will see that my cellule is not Kabere.  I also have my identification card here with me that can confirm what I'm saying. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  I notice in the notes that accompany the translation at the bottom of page 3 that the Prosecution had in their possession when this statement was put to you, first it reads that "Kabere" -- K-A-B-E-R-E -- "is in Gatare, Gikomero."  That is G-A-T-A-R-E.  Can I invite your comment, Mr. Witness, on that?  Is Kabere in Gatare, Gikomero, or not?  Do you understand that note?
A.	I do not know Gatare that is being talked about here, but I do know Kabere cellule which is found in Gikomero secteur.  I don't know Gatare.  There is a cellule and a secteur.  I don't know what Gatare refers to. 
Q.	In any event, when these matters were being put to you by the Prosecution, it would appear they had information, right or wrong, that clearly indicated it was not your cellule, but that's a comment which I make.

Now, I'd like you to turn, Mr. Witness, to the final page of the notes, which you've had an opportunity of reading and which the Judges have been provided with last week.  And so I feel I should deal with it.

Have you had an opportunity, Mr. Witness, of reading and understanding the French of that?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I wish to draw the President's attention to the fact that, a while ago, I drew the attention of this Trial Chamber to the fact that the notes that we have taken and which are personal notes and on which we didn't have to question the witness was unfortunately disclosed to the Defence, and so those -- the document was photocopied with the notes that we had and disclosed to the Defence.  These are personal notes which we did not rely on to examine the witness, so these are annotations or notes that went to the Defence by mistake.  And I would like to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to this fact.
MR. HOOPER:
I quite accept that these notes do not form part of the Prosecution's disclosure responsibilities, but of course they have been disclosed.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, once again, I would like to ask a question as to whether, concerning a mistake from the Prosecution team, which unfortunately found their way into the hands of the Defence but which we did not use to examine the witness, I wonder if the Defence can use the said notes to examine the witness.
MR. HOOPER:
There's nothing under the rules.  These matters have been disclosed.  The Prosecution should be more careful, obviously, about things.  They had ample opportunity to review their position.  It is not just come to me; it is now before the Judges, and it's got perhaps a certain relevance and piquancy, because it is my belief and reasonable assumption that these notes are drawn from the same source as the person who, quite wrongfully, identified this witness as the Matabaro who appears in the statement.  As we go through these notes, I think it will shed a very interesting light on the perhaps attitude of that person who is assisting the Prosecution.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, once again, I wish to tell Mr. Hooper that it is not the same person who provided us with the information that you find in the notes.  So, Mr. President, it is very clear that, once again, this is only a disclosure that shouldn't have been made to the Defence, but which was, unfortunately, provided to the Defence.  

We did not make use of such information and, once again, I would like it to be very clear that the Defence cannot in any way rely, and I believe the Trial Chamber will put this on balance, but my point of view is that the Defence cannot rely on these Prosecutor's notes that ought not to have been disclosed to the Defence.  

Well, we disclosed what we had to disclose, which is the translation of the statement in Kinyarwanda, to the Defence, and this is what was provided to us and nothing more.
MR. HOOPER:
Well, in order for me to know my position the better, I would invite the Prosecution to let us know the source of this information.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that there are obligations for the Prosecution concerning the documents that the Prosecution uses to examine the witness, and you did recall this, and there is certain information we can obtain within the framework of our investigations.  And I think it is up to us to put the question to the witness and get his answer without requiring that this be admitted in evidence.  

I think that is what we did in respect of the information that we obtained and which is other than the one that we talked about when we translated the statement.  So, once again, those notes are personal notes which, unfortunately, were disclosed to the Defence while we were photocopying material.  This is a mistake, we do admit this, but I believe that the Defence cannot rely on that document that is the personal notes to examine the witness.  I think he himself has been heard to say that personal notes can't be disclosed and we can find this in the transcript.
MR. HOOPER:
It seems to us that part of the notes here were pointedly referred to and used in the course of cross-examination of this witness by Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL:
(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
She made the specific allegation against this witness that he was in fact a genocidaire.  She referred to information she had relating to that, and that was independent of a statement.  At least that was the apparent position of the Prosecution at the time those allegations were made on Wednesday.  

The fact is, mistake or not, the Prosecution have put this information into the hands of the Defence.  They have no duty to do so, but they have done it and they have trailed it, wittingly or not, before you, the Judges.  They raise matters of considerable concern.  First of all, there is a smear on this witness which, at present, seems --
MS. FALL:
Mr. President --
MR. HOOPER:
Can I finish?  
MS. FALL:
-- I would like to raise an objection.  Mr. President, once again, I believe, and I think we will defer to the decision of the Chamber after having pointed out that the minutes or records should show that we have insisted that the notes in question are personal notes of the Prosecutor, which unfortunately found their way into the hands of the Defence team.

We have indeed made allegations in respect of the witness, and on certain matters, especially within the framework of the identification particulars that were disclosed to us.  When we look at the notes of the Prosecutor we see that, as far as information that we had was concerned, we were not any further -- we could not be further from that -- from the cross-examination of the Defence.  I think these are notes that shouldn't have been disclosed to the Defence, but unfortunately, they got into the hands of the Defence by mistake and I did not rely on those notes to cross-examine the witness and, therefore, the Defence should not rely on the said notes to cross-examine or to examine the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  In our view this is a criminal trial and information has in fact been disclosed not only to the Defence but also to the Court.  So we have seen the document and we have looked through these notes ourselves.  In view of the fact that the Prosecutor cannot or has stated that they don't know for sure whether the very serious allegation made against this witness is true or false, I think the witness is entitled to have an opportunity to give his side of the story.  I really think that counsel should be allowed to use the document which has been put before the Court as part of his re-examination.

You see, the usual rule is that a document, once admitted, is in evidence.  And although it seems that part of the document may have been joined to the rest of it by mistake, it's before us, and we have it; we have looked at it; and in fact our assessment of the information that we have could be enhanced through examination on this matter.  So we allow the questions to be put.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would also like to clarify that.  If we made a mistake in including this document in the translation, it was because we were formally ordered to do so by the Trial Chamber.  We requested a different procedure -- that is, that has been done before -- the interpreters could have read the passages involving the name of Matabaro and make a much more official translation.

But the Trial Chamber ordered us to disclose the translation, the unofficial translation, that we had, and that is where the mistake came from.  I just wish to make that point of clarification.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, we didn't order you to make a mistake.  You see, this problem stems partly from our view that the Prosecutor should not make serious allegations against witnesses if they don't know what they are talking about.  And that is the position -- the unfortunate position -- in which we are in.  Here is this witness who has come before this Court and he has had his character attacked by the Prosecutor who says, "We don't know for sure if we're justified in doing that."  We think he should have every opportunity to clear his name.  We allow the questions.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you had the opportunity of reading this last page of this document in French?  Have you had the opportunity to read it and digest it?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	We have heard your evidence, but I merely ask you this: did you play any part at all in the genocide in Gikomero?
A.	If I had played a part in the Gikomero genocide, I would be accused of it.  I have told you that I was arrested after allegations were made by the sister of the person who killed my wife.  And when I was released, I lived freely and in harmony with anyone.  I have never been called to give evidence before a Gacaca court, and I wonder where all this information is coming from all of a sudden, now that I'm before this Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Yes, indeed.  Now, this document doesn't mention you as -- mentions you with a christian name beginning ******, I say no more than that, so it is to that extent specific.  And you've told us about your position in terms of politics; I don't go through that again.  Midway in the page it says, states, asserts -- asserts that you were an ami intimes, intimate friend of, and it then names three people.  And you were asked indeed this morning, presumably on the basis of this document, whether you were a good friend or not of Mathias Rubanguka.  It was asserted to you in cross-examination this morning that you were.  You told us in fact that you were not and that you had in fact been in conflict with him; is that right?
A.	We were not friends.  He was just my neighbour.  He scorned teachers; he looked low on teachers, because he worked in the commune.  I know that he's been mentioned in Gacaca sessions.  If I were really his friend, I would not have mentioned his name here before this Court, but I'm not making allegations against him here.  However, this proves that he is not my friend. 
Q.	The next man is a man Muhire.  You've also dealt with him this morning, if that's André Muhire, and I pass over him.  What about the next name, Gihanga, do you know who he is?  Is he an intimate friend of yours?
A.	This is a very young person.  I couldn't have a relationship with this person.  I do not think that these three people know each other.  Gihanga may not know Mathias, and Muhire might now know the others.  Perhaps Rubanguka and Muhire might know each other because they are practically the same age.  However, they don't live in the same secteur. 
Q.	Coming back to politics, were you ever a force or power within the MRND?
A.	Not at all.  At one time all Rwandan citizens were card-carrying members of the MRND.  I've never taken part in MRND.  I've never attended a political rally.  I don't know where such information would come from.  I have come here as a witness.  I'm not accused.  I'm not an accused in this Court. 
Q.	Indeed you are not.  Let me ask you about LIPRODOR.  First of all, do you know what LIPRODOR is?
A.	I've heard about that acronym.  I know it's a human rights association.  I know nothing further about it, and I think this association has been dissolved and no longer exists. 
Q.	Were you ever a member of it?
A.	Never; I've never been a member of LIPRODOR.  I've only heard about LIPRODOR.  I know that the association was dissolved because it ran afoul of the government.  It is the government that dissolved LIPRODOR, just like the MRND was dissolved.  I heard about it on the radio, and I read it in the papers, but I know nothing further about it. 
Q.	Well, I'm seeking to move as an exhibit a print-out from the internet taken at random essentially on LIPRODOR and it's an announcement dated July the 17th 2004 issued by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Integrated Regional Information Network, who are, of course, a United Nations body in which it states in the text:  "LIPRODOR is a human rights monitoring body which in the past has been critical of the government's record" -- that is Rwandan government's record -- "on promoting and protecting human rights.  Since the parliamentary commission in Rwanda made its recommendation, international human rights organisations have expressed concern over the move calling on the Rwandan government to reject the recommendation to ban LIPRODOR."  Quote:  "Dissolving LIPRODOR would call into question the Rwandan government's commitment to such basic rights as freedom of expression and association, Alison Des Forges, a senior adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement last week."  

There are other print-outs from Amnesty International and other human rights bodies criticising the dissolving not just of LIPRODOR but four other human rights organisations in Rwanda by the Rwanda government.

Mr. Witness, can I ask you this:  do you know, has your daughter ever been a member of LIPRODOR?
A.	I laughed when I read this document, because my daughter is so quiet.  You really can't know what she's thinking.  She minds her own business, and I do not think that she has any relationship with these people.  These people know her only as a manager in the bank.  For example, how could she be involved in politics when I myself have never been involved in politics?  I wonder -- I wonder when I read this document.  Only God can decide what this is, because it's completely beyond my comprehension. 
Q.	And the name that appears here of your daughter is the self-same daughter who survived the murder of your family, with her attendant mental injuries -- head injuries; is that correct?
A.	This is my daughter with whom I went to the camp.  This is not the one that you referred to. 
Q.	It's another one.  Thank you for clarifying that position.

And in the context of LIPRODOR, described "une force negative", there is someone called Seminega, Fulgence.  Do you know who that person is?
A.	I know Fulgence Seminega.  I know that he is a public finance employee.  I do not know whether he is also active in LIPRODOR. 
Q.	A name that doesn't appear on this document, do you know someone called Jean Paul Biramvu -- B-I-R-A-M-V-U?
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	I mention him.  You don't know, so you can't help.  I understand he was the chairman of LIPRODOR who now works as an adviser for the Prosecution here at the ICTR.  
A.	He works in Kigali?
Q.	I think here.  I don't know.  That was the relevance of my introducing that name.  Let me ask you if you know who Martin -- I won't mention his second name -- whether you know who that person is?
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Is it right that he's one of my investigators in this case?
A.	I have seen him, yes, and I think that he works for you.  I have met him. 
Q.	So it is not just you being smeared here, as you can see.  Tell me, do you know someone called "Makombe et beaucoup d'autres"  -- sorry -- Makombe.
A.	I know Makombe.  He is the head of our district.  He is the current mayor of our district. 
Q.	He's mentioned there in the context of LIPRODOR.  Is it right that he was appointed bourgmestre by Paul Kagame himself?
A.	Yes, that is what was said.  I was not present when he appointed him, but that is what he said. 
Q.	Have you any idea who made these allegations?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it possible to give some assistance with the spellings to the names to which you've referred?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  The names that I've referred to have been Rubanguka and Muhire who appear on the list of names. Gihanga, spelt G-I-H-A-N-G-A; Makombe spelt M-A-K-O-M-B-E, Seminega, Fulgence, spelt S-E-M-I-N-E-G-A, F-U-L-G-E-N-C-E, and LIPRODOR, spelt L-I-P-R-O-D-O-R.
BY MR. HOOPER:  
Q.	Now, this bag full of allegations in this document, have you any idea, Mr. Witness, who may have made those allegations?
A.	Counsel, you're asking me to speculate.  That's not good.  It's not good.  I do not wish to cast aspersions on anyone.  I do not want to implicate anyone without proof. 
Q.	Well, you see, we're told by the Prosecution that it wasn't the person who provided them the statement that was said to be you, referring to you, which it would seem not to be, but it was somebody else known to the Prosecution, but not someone, I'm afraid, they're willing to share any details about with the Chamber.  So I can't, I'm afraid, assist you in further addressing these false allegations.  Unless my friend is willing to do so, we will have to leave it there.

Finally, Mr. Witness, those are all the questions I have to ask.  The only other thing is, André Rwamakuba would be pleased to meet with you, and I understand that you, for your part, are willing to go and meet him.  You will be the first visitor from Gikomero in seven years and I would ask leave of this Court -- Mr. President, now that he's completed his evidence in the usual manner, I ask leave that he be granted leave to visit the accused.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the Chamber would like to find out whether there is any likelihood that this witness will be recalled at your request.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, if new information were to come to light, it might be possible to request that the witness be recalled, but we do not for the time being feel that that will be required.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not very helpful.  What is facing us is we feel inclined to grant permission to the witness to visit the Accused, but we do not think it would be proper to do so if there's a likelihood that he may be recalled to give testimony.  So we wanted your assistance in assessing what would be a proper way to proceed with this request.  

So I understand that any answer you give us may be subject to change, depending on what occurs, but you should have an idea of the degree of likelihood at this stage, and that's what we want to hear, basically.
MS. FALL:
That's right, Mr. President, I think this is a possibility that might arise when we will have obtained all the information that we have requested in regard to this witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, a moment ago my friend said that it was unlikely.  Their opportunity to confront this witness is now.  They have had five or six days to garnish this, as they wish to call it, evidence.  In any event, the witness has provided his answers in breadth in respect of these matters.

So in my submission, even in the unlikely event of his being recalled to answer questions along these issues, it won't in fact prejudice the Prosecution in any way should he, in the meantime, meet André Rwamakuba, particularly taking into account the nature of his evidence and his lack of knowledge of Rwamakuba.  Mr. O'Shea also reminds me, if an application is made, we would oppose it.

Mr. President, one matter -- I may have gone ahead really of myself there inasmuch as my inquiry so far from other teams is that this is an application that is not uncommonly made of the Tribunal -- commonly made, and I do not know of any incident where it's been refused, from what my inquiries were; in other words, it's really a matter permitting WVS to introduce a witness to the Accused.  WVS merely insists to me that it's made after the completion of evidence at this stage.  So it's not an application, as it were, of my doing; it's an application that's come as a result of discussions with WVS and other teams.  If you need further information in respect of that, I can get it, perhaps a little later.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have in fact been advised by the registrar, so we are aware of the process and the procedure.  We were just concerned about --
MR. HOOPER:
His status.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, it may assist.  My learned leader has given me permission to offer the following assessment of the situation with regard to this witness.  The likelihood of recalling this witness is vanishingly small.  The probable situation is that if there is new information which comes to light which will in due course be disclosed to my learned friend defending, the Prosecution would make an application at the conclusion of the Defence case to call rebuttal evidence, which of course involves calling a different witness, not recalling this witness.

This witness has been asked a variety of questions by my learned leader, the contents of which are plainly before the witness and his answers plainly before the Court.  There would be no need to recall him to ask the same questions again.

All that would happen is that, if leave were granted, a Prosecution witness would be called by way of rebuttal at a much later date in the case.  So on the narrow point of Your Honour's concern about the recalling of this witness, it is vanishingly small.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

We have come to a decision in this matter and we have agreed to grant permission for the visit to take place.

Now, Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your testimony.  It's lasted longer than we had anticipated.  We would like to thank you for your participation in the trial and for giving evidence here.  Your testimony is at an end now.  You are excused and you are free to go.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask you, Mr. Witness, not to allow yourself to be taken off straight away by WVS but to remain in the waiting room outside for half an hour so that I can speak to you before you go.  You didn't hear that?  WVS I think probably did.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe you should address your remarks to WVS.
MR. HOOPER:
Heard and understood.  Thank you, Sir.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you in a position to address the exhibit issues now? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, from the Defence, I can put in the D witness numbers for Witness 3/10.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the Prosecutor also ready for exhibits?  Are you ready for the exhibits?
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. HOOPER:
I'm just getting them numbered up.  Exhibit D. 163 is a piece of paper where the witness wrote down the names of the men who attacked his family.  Just pausing there, I'm taking it as said that the identification document has gone in already -- it hasn't?  Then can that go in, please, at D. 163?  I'm sorry, I've misread my script here totally.  Can you give me one moment?  I think that is going to be D. 161, thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  That's under seal? 
MR. HOOPER:
That will be under seal.  

D. 162 will be a piece of paper where the witness wrote down the names of the men who attacked his family.

D. 163 will be a list of names produced by the Defence for the witness.

D. 164 will be the letter -- sorry, the translation in French document produced by the Prosecution.

D. 165 will be the statement in Kinyarwanda produced by the Prosecution.

D. 166 will be the extract from the Web dealing with LIPRODOR with the passage quoted in court marked on that document.  And I think that is all the matters that we adduce.
 (Exhibit No. D. 161 admitted, under seal)
 (Exhibit No. D. 162 admitted, under seal)
 (Exhibit No. D. 163 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. 164 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. 165 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. 166 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
I should also add -- would it be D. 167 -- the English translation of the Kinyarwanda PV, which has been exhibited. 
MS. FALL:
It is an unofficial translation, the translation in English, I should like to point out.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are aware of it, but it might help certain members of the Panel to understand the French document.
(Exhibit No. D. 167 admitted) 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have three documents that I would like to have entered as exhibits.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I am tendering three Prosecution exhibits.  First is the witness statement of the 21st of June 2003.  It is from 1337 to 1334.  Those are the page numbers.  I think it should be P.79, if I'm not mistaken.
MR. HOOPER:
I think that is a note of interview, not a statement.
MS. FALL:
So it's P.78.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Ms. Fall, do you accept the clarification of the description of the document as a note of interview of the witness.
MS. FALL:
The document that was disclosed to us indicates witness statement, if I go by the translation of statement in French, so I would tend myself to think of it as a witness statement.
MR. HOOPER:
For reasons I've already provided at some length, and I hope accepted, that statement in English is not signed, and cannot in those circumstances be called a "statement".  It is a note of interview where I have attempted to fairly capture my understanding of what the witness said, but he's not had the opportunity to correct or to alter anything within it, or to sign it.  So, in fairness to the witness, it must fall into a different category of document than a statement.
MS. FALL:
I shall leave the Trial Chamber to decide.  I shouldn't quarrel, Mr. President --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you said it, then I had to make an order.
MS. FALL:
We agree, Mr. President, they are notes, so we tender as an exhibit the investigator's notes disclosed to us by Mr. Hooper.  The notes are dated 21st of June 2003.  We would like to tender them as Exhibit P. 78 and we request that they be placed under seal, in view of the confidential information contained therein.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 78 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
I believe the second document is also notes -- Defence notes pertaining to this witness, and they concern the statement of the 4th of November 2005, and go from 1609 to 1606.  I am tendering this document as a Prosecution exhibit, and I request that, in view of the information contained therein, the document should be placed under seal.  It should be Prosecution Exhibit P. 79.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 79 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
The last document is the list of persons that were shown to the witness today.  This is a list of 15 names.  We are tendering this document as Prosecution Exhibit P. 80, and it should also be placed under seal, if the Court wishes, because of the confidential information it contains.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.
(Exhibit No. P. 80 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I have no further exhibits.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
That concludes the business with the previous witness and we're now turning to the next witness.  There is a short matter of law, which I have my learned leader's permission to raise with Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues.  It is not a matter of law in which we are seeking a ruling, because in fact Your Honour hasn't made a ruling in relation to this particular area previously.

But as a matter of courtesy and information, the Prosecutor's office has conducted a small amount of research on what became the interesting feature last week of the propriety of disclosing impeachment material under cross-examination.  And Your Honour may recall that during the testimony of the previous witness there was a Rwandan PV which became the subject of some questions and ultimately was disclosed to the witness, and to my learned friends defending, and of course to Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues.  
Your Honour expressed the forceful and understandable position that the Prosecution must tread carefully on issues of disclosure.  And the Prosecution have taken very much to heart Your Honour's important observation.  We have gone about trying to find out whether there is any other authority which has arisen in previous cases which may assist Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, and we have found one very recently.  

It is a strong judgment by the President of the Tribunal, Judge Møse and his colleagues in the Bagosora case.  With Your Honour's leave, I would like briefly to distribute to Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues a copy each, and one for the helpful clerk, Mr. Issa's attention, a decision of the 27th of September this year.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French interpreters are also requesting a copy of the document.
MR. MORLEY:
Well, in those circumstances, Mr. Issa -- I can assist Your Honour in saying that I have, I hope helpfully, provided Mr. O'Shea with a copy of this decision.  I warned him that it may exist on Thursday last week and as a matter of courtesy my learned friend Mr. O'Shea and I have been in communication about the direction of this line of thinking.  So nobody is going to be complaining about not knowing what is going on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Morley, the French interpreters have requested a copy.
MR. MORLEY:
Yes.  That is why I have asked Mr. Issa to come back and I wonder if this might be given to the French interpreters, please.  I was trying to explain to him that Mr. O'Shea already had a copy; he didn't have to give him one.

Your Honour may recall we have Rule 66(B) in the Rules of Procedure.  And, in short, that tends to put an obligation on the Prosecution to disclose material which may assist the defence or -- it may assist in the preparation of the defence, or which the Prosecution may use during the course of the trial.

And if I can tell Your Honour that the decision which I have referred Your Honour to dated the 27th of September 2005 and entitled "Decision on disclosure of materials relating to immigration statements of defence witnesses", and it is a decision in the case of the Prosecutor against Bagosora marked ICTR-98-41-T, this is an interesting decision because it might be said to be directly on point.

The decision arises out of an argument which arose during the course of material being gathered in relation to Defence witnesses where the Defence witnesses had said things to immigration officials in other countries.  And the idea was that if the Prosecution had this material, it might be used for impeachment purposes during the course of cross-examination of those Defence witnesses.  The question arose whether that material should be disclosed in advance to the Defence.

And there seems to have been some argument, resulting in a decision.  Your Honour will see, if I can take Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, to paragraph 1 of the decision, the first sentence is relevant, which reads:  "In the course of the present trial, the Prosecution has confirmed that it has obtained statements by some Defence witnesses to immigration authorities of the States in which they have sought refuge."  That is the background to the existence of the material.

The relevant section of the judgment of some interest perhaps to the Chamber is on the next page, under the small (ii) entitled "Disclosure under Rule 66(B)".  Your Honour will see there that there is reference to the rule itself, which I remind Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues for the record reads, "At the request of the Defence, the Prosecutor shall ... permit the Defence to inspect any books, documents, photographs and tangible objects in his custody or control" -- and here are the key expressions -- "which are material to the preparation of the defence, or are intended for use by the Prosecutor as evidence at trial." 

I don't refer to the last section, as it is irrelevant.

If Your Honour then looks at paragraph 5, which is the beginning of an analysis of the meaning of Rule 66(B), and essentially the question under cross-examination can there be documents which take a Defence witness by surprise, Your Honour sees the development of the argument by His Honour Judge Møse, which, if I may, I read from the middle of the paragraph.  I'm simply focusing the Court's attention on the significant sentences.  I have no doubt that the entire judgment will want to be read quietly and privately, but in the middle of paragraph 5 it says, "Rule 66(A) is clearly limited" -- does Your Honour have that?  "Rule 66(A) is clearly limited to disclosure of documents relating to the Prosecution case."  It goes on, "Although some of the Rules in this section entail obligations throughout the trial, the Chamber considers that Rule 66(B) requires that the Prosecution must make available all materials which will assist the Defence in countering the evidence to be presented by the Prosecution.  The immigration documents requested by the present motion are not material to the Defence preparations to meet the Prosecution case, which is closed," and it goes on. 

Paragraph 6 refers to the categories of document that can be inspected by the Defence, and it deals with the relevant categories on the third line, and Your Honour may see the third line has the sentence beginning, "The second category" -- I hope Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues have that.  "The second category ('intended for use by the Prosecutor as evidence at trial') must be read as referring to evidence being presented during the Prosecution case.  A prior inconsistent immigration statement put to a witness, and possibly tendered as an exhibit, is not evidence in the sense of being presented to prove the truth of the content thereof." 

If Your Honour looks at the footnote, does Your Honour see the number "5", and one looks a little bit further down, Judge Møse has clearly identified a section in the Akayesu judgment where it identifies that the relevance of such a document being used under cross-examination is, and at footnote 5, three lines down, I read "relevant only insofar as they are necessary to a Trial Chamber in its assessment of the credibility of a witness." 

So, in terms of the first relevant category, the observation is that that category must be read as referring to evidence being presented during the Prosecution case.  Of course, we're not in the Prosecution case any more.  And the relevance of the document -- and it's a matter, of course, always for the Trial Chamber to weigh -- is does the document affect or assist on the assessment of witness credibility?  

Therefore, it is a document distinct from being relevant to factual issues.  It goes only to the reliability and truthfulness of the witness who is otherwise giving evidence on factual issues.

If we turn over the page, it reads, again in paragraph 6, I'm sorry, I'll go back to the first -- the earlier page.  At the bottom of page 3 there's reference to the second category, and this is the interesting category which Your Honour may remember referring to last week, material to the preparation of the defence, and Your Honour will see, and Your Honour's colleagues, that the paragraph 6 continues, "The final category prescribed by Rule 66(B) ('material to the preparation of the defence') must also be understood as referring to the Defence preparations to meet the Prosecution case.  The requested immigration documents are not part of the Prosecution case in the sense described above, but may be used during the Prosecution's cross-examination of Defence witnesses with a view to their impeachment.  In the Chamber's view, Rule 66(B) cannot be interpreted as laying down a blanket obligation for the Prosecution to disclose documents pertinent to its cross-examination of Defence witnesses."  And it goes on to observe that the Defence are always in a position to make their own inquiries about whether any documents might be in the pipeline through their own sources.  

But I pass over that, and I invite Your Honour to look at paragraph 8.  Paragraph 7 is irrelevant.  Paragraph 8, in the context of how matters have been left in paragraph 6, says, "This approach does not violate the rights of the Accused ... as suggested by the Defence.  There is no ICTR or ICTY case law supporting this view.  The Defence has referred to legislation and jurisprudence of national jurisdictions invoked to the effect that comprehensive and ongoing disclosure obligations are essential for the fair trial of an Accused."  
Here is the critical sentence for Your Honour's assistance, "No widespread practice of requiring disclosure of such statements in advance of cross-examination has been established.  On the contrary, disclosure at the time of cross-examination appears to be a common procedure and does not amount to trial by ambush." 

Finally, and I know Your Honour's eye is on the clock, if we turn to paragraph 12 dealing with modalities, there is reference four lines down, Your Honour will see, "...the Chamber has also acknowledged that there may be instances where such notification may only take place once cross-examination of a witness commences, in order to maintain" -- and here is a perceptive observation by His Honour Judge Møse -- "the element of surprise.  The Chamber will continue to follow these practices.  Consequently, the Defence will be entitled to see immigration statements at the time of cross-examination, which is in conformity with established practice in national jurisdictions."  

Conscious as I am of the time, I hope I've helpfully put before the Court a decision of some interest.  I'm not asking for a ruling, but it may assist Your Honour to know that insofar as documents may emerge during the course of cross-examinations, it may be that my learned friends defending will be discovering their existence as the cross-examination proceeds.  I hope that assists everybody to know where we all stand on this interesting feature of cross-examination practice.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, we can't hear you now; we must take the adjournment.  
MR O'SHEA:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, we have to take the adjournment now and we will resume tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1235H)
