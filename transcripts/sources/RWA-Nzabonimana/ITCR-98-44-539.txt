MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday the 2nd of February 2011, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse, good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President; good morning, Your Honours.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, sir.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. SOW:
Good morning, Mr. President; good morning, Your Honours; good morning to everyone.  

Mr. President, I would like to have leave from the Bench, before the Prosecutor continues with his cross-examination, to raise an issue of the resumption of this trial which has been scheduled for the 14th of February.  

We sent a mail through Counsel Dior Diagne to the Chamber, raising a number of issues.  And with your leave, Mr. President, I would like to mention those issues here, if it is appropriate to do so now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, I don't think it's appropriate to take up the trial time to discuss this issue now.  And so if you wish, we can do it after 1 o'clock.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Ngirumpatse, your cross-examination will continue.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to the Court, and to the parties, and to the registry. 
MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And good morning to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, before I forget, I would like to have a document admitted in evidence.  It's the letter of the 1st of February 1994 that I reviewed with Mr. Ngirumpatse yesterday, the letter signed by François-Xavier Nsanzuwera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can admit it.  Ms. Hounkpatin. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I will hand up my copy to the registry. 
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 562, five-six-two.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. P. 562 admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So, this morning I'd like to begin looking at a couple of other documents with you, mister -- Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

If you direct your attention to the demonstration of the 28th of March 1992, which we have in evidence in the form of a videotape and transcripts at P. 091, P. 91, which is the first document at tab O in my bundle.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could help me, please.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	During the course of that demonstration when you were in front of the PRIMATURE building, the office of the prime minister which was formerly the MRND palace in Kigali, you publicly announced that the Interahamwe would be the youth of the MRND party; isn't that so?  If we look at -- I think I've numbered it, I've numbered 3, which is on the second sheet in on the English text.  It's actually page 8 in that transcript, and it bears K number ending in 6781 in the English.  But it is -- I did put a little 3 in a circle so that you could find it easily in the French text.  

And you say:  "I would like to remind you that our party's first congress has decided that the MRND's youth wing should be called Interahamwe.  Henceforth, it will be called JMRND-Interahamwe.  Whoever wants to destroy the Interahamwe wants to destroy the MRND, and would be making a big mistake.  

"As I said in Murambi sous-préfecture, all parties have a youth wing.  Attacking ours means attacking our party, which is absolutely inadmissible."  

So when you say that publicly in May of 1992, aren't you suggesting that the party and the youth wing are one?  
A.	No.  First of all, Mr. President, I do not have a copy of the Kinyarwanda text.  If I said so, then it must have been in a mistaken interpretation of the congress's discussion -- decision.  

The congress did not decide to recognise the youth wing of the MRND.  What the congress did was to congratulate those who had created that youth wing, and express the desire that the youth wing be set up in all areas of the country, and that it ultimately be affiliated or integrated to the MRND.  

So I am not the one who talked about integration and affiliation; it was a decision of the national committee.  So, putting it this way would have been a poor interpretation of the decision of the congress.  I didn't have the power to affiliate the youth of the party to the party itself.  So this amounts to a poor interpretation of the congress's decision.  Which, by the way, is available.  That is my answer to your question.  
Q.	Well, if you review the congress's resolution -- I believe it was resolution 4 -- and I agree with you it is a bit legalistic, or a bit imprecise.  But what's very clear is what you yourself are saying.  So if there's any misinterpretation of the resolution of your congress, the misinterpretation is coming from you, not from how your words in Kinyarwanda are being translated.  

Because I'm not talking about one phrase here, I'm talking about the entire thrust of what you're saying when you declare to the party militants that the Interahamwe are the youth wing of the party, and the party and the -- and the youth wing are one.  You're grouping them together, and you do that quite often in other public speech.  And we'll go through it and I'll show you.  So if you'd like to comment further, now is your opportunity.  
A.	No, Mr. President, I don't have any further comments to make.  All I can say is that this was a poor interpretation of the decision of the congress, because that was not the position taken by the congress.  And the evidence of that is indeed the fact that it -- even up till 1994, the youth wing was not set up in all areas of the country yet.  

So maybe what I was saying was part of the steam that obtains during political rallies and part of the propaganda that goes with it.  It does not reflect the decision of the congress, which is very clear.  And I think it is for the Trial Chamber to assess what I have said.  

I have, by the way, acknowledged, and everyone knows that the Interahamwe were members of the MRND party.  Yes, from that perspective, I think it is correct.  We had the obligation, and we also -- I had the obligation to defend them from any attacks that they might have come under.  That is the answer I can provide.  
Q.	The next sentence in that passage reads as follows:  "The term 'interahamwe' does not have an aggressive connotation.  Rather, it denotes unity and harmony.  Strangely enough, I have never heard the government say that it was going to dissolve the Abakombozi."  

So I gather from what you're saying here that there was already some criticism of the Interahamwe, because you seem to be defending it on the 28th of May 1992.  Was that the case?  
A.	Did you say 18th -- 1998?  Is that what you said?  
Q.	No, I said the -- well, if I did, I'm mistaken, it was a slip of the tongue.  The 28th of May 1992.  Excuse me.  
A.	Yes, there were attacks, unjustified attacks, not only targeting the MRND youth, but the MRND itself.  And this situation is well known.  We were isolated, we were persecuted by everybody.  

We were even abandoned at the battle front by others -- by the others.  Because it is shortly after, a few days after, that the parties who claimed to be of the opposition while being part of government went along to sign a convention, an agreement with the RPF in Brussels, and denying us access to that meeting.  

Well, I am very, very comfortable to talk about that, and to assert that, yes, indeed, we were -- the entire party, not only the youth, the entire party was persecuted.  All members of the party.  I have already stated that the ubukohoza (sic) system, which we are all familiar with now, targeted the MRND, and we had several cases of our members who were driven out of their offices, their homes, and their property.  

I am sorry, but -- I am done.  I am done. 
Q.	Well, you make it sound as if the MRND was the underdog.  Wasn't it the majority party, it was the biggest party, the most influential party, the one that basically inherited -- or, grew out of the state apparatus?  You make it seem as if somehow you were the underdog in this situation.  
A.	I did not say that it was the underdog.  But the situation is clear, it is obvious.  Even if you look at the number of people at the detention centre who have come before the -- the Tribunal, most of them were -- are of the MRND.  Most of those who have been acquitted are of the MRND as well.  

But my point was that the persecution, whether it was internal or external, was obvious.  It was obvious at the time and is still obvious, even today.  And even though the Prosecutor may claim that we were the dominant party, the party in power and what have you, we were still the object or subject of all manner of negative labels.  So persecution was obvious.  Ubukohoza (sic) was targeting the MRND, unfortunately, but it is a fact.  And I don't think I need to belabour the point.  
Q.	But when you suggest that the Interahamwe should not be dissolved and compared to the Abakombozi, are you responding to the suggestion that had been made, as early as May 1992, that the Interahamwe should be disbanded?  
A.	I am not the one making that assertion.  I am actually criticising those who are attempting to do so.  Maybe there is a misunderstanding somewhere, Mr. President.  That is not my desire, that is not my wish.  I am simply criticising those who made such statements.  Even at the time that was being said.  

If you look at the so-called report, the so-called Nsanzuwera report, that was the whole idea behind it.  Because he and Nkubito were connected, or linked to the opposition.  See?  That's what I'm talking about.  I am not fabricating anything.  I am not creating something which does not exist.  
Q.	All right, thank you.  I think we understand your position.  

In -- in your speech on the 28th of May 1992, you make reference to another upcoming rally.  And here I'm referring to where I've numbered a little 2 in a circle.  You say, and I'm reading:  "On the 8th of next month we shall hold a big meeting."  And there is applause.  And then you go on to describe what is going to take place on the 8th of the next month, which is presumably June of 1992.  

Did that meeting actually take place, the meeting that you had predicted in your speech on the 28th of May 1992?  
A.	I do not remember.  No, I do -- do not remember.  Sometimes we planned things and they did not happen.  I have no recollection.  But maybe you can -- can prompt me.  June 1992?  Maybe you might prompt me with some information.  Otherwise I don't have any recollection of that.  
Q.	Regrettably, I don't have that information, either, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I was hoping that you could clarify a matter in our trial record.  

We all viewed a videotape of a meeting that took place at the Amahoro stadium when you were the national secretary of the MRND.  We viewed it when Witness PR was testifying in closed session, if that helps you to remember when we viewed this video.  

But there's another video clip that's already in evidence, it's P. 256.  It's a small clip with you speaking, and then Robert Kajuga speaking after you.  And I believe that I had demonstrated, through the testimony of Witness PR, that the two clips relate to a single event.  Because the images of you and Robert Kajuga were the same, even though they were on two separate videos.  So I was trying to elicit from you when that particular rally took place at the Amahoro stadium.  

Having said that, could you help us place the rally depicted in P. 256 in time?  Can we give a date, an approximate date to that particular exhibit?  
A.	In June, I think there was a rally at the Amahoro stadium.  I don't know whether it was in June, but there was indeed a rally, a public rally at the Amahoro stadium.  But I'm not able to give a specific date on which that rally held at the Amahoro stadium.  
Q.	All right.  Simply saying June 1992 satisfies me, and now we have greater clarity on when that particular rally took place.  

When we look at the excerpt that's already in evidence, and here I'm talking about two -- excuse me, P. 256, which is the next document in among the materials that I've distributed.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I'll indicate for the parties who are looking at it in the English text that I've included transcript from when this particular clip was played in another trial, which needs to be revised, but may still help -- help you to follow along.  Only the French is admitted in our trial.  

If Mr. Issa could assist us by giving this to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If you look at the first thing that you say, or that's captured on video.  You say:  "I'm here, and I hope that the Interahamwe will take the floor and explain to us the strategy that the youth of the MRND will adopt in defending Rwanda, now and in the future."  

Do you see where you say that in the French text, at the very top of the exhibit?  
A.	Yes, I'm there.  I am there, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	You're looking to the Interahamwe to defend Rwanda, now and in the future.  Weren't you putting the Interahamwe on a military footing, even back then, in 1992?  
A.	No, that would be a rather restrictive interpretation by the Prosecutor.  When you call on the youth to defend the country, at the time, particularly, there were several reasons for making that call.  In any event, soldiers are recruited from among the youths.  Secondly, the democratic system had come under attack by the RPF and was in danger because of the war.  

So, to say that the youth -- and, by the way, in another speech I had stated that the defence of the country was in the hands of the youth, and this does not in any way put them at the same level as soldiers.  Youth are the future of the country.  They are not only supposed to defend the country physically, but politically and on the democratic level as well.  So I was not in any way equating them to the soldiers.  The youth are the future of the country.  

And allow me to avail myself of this opportunity to tell the Court that any party without a youth wing, or without youth members, is a party that will die, will disappear.  So that was not our intention, to equate them with soldiers.  

You can defend your ideas, you can defend democracy, you can defend various positions.  But if you were to restrictively interpret it to mean physical defence and the physical brutality of war, then that would not reflect my intention.  Because my intention was much broader than that.  The youth is the future of the country.  Any party which does not have youth is bound to disappear.  And that is why the others were attacking us.  That, vehemently, for these very reasons, in order to cause our -- our party to -- to disappear.  Because, you know a party of all people is not a political party at all.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Well, the reason that I think it has a rather militaristic sound, or connotation, your remarks that I referred to, is when we look to the last line of the transcription, we have Robert Kajuga saying that:  "Our country -- it's not a secret anymore for anybody -- has just been attacked, or was just attacked by the enemy."  And what I think is going on here is that this rally is taking place after the 5th of June 1992, which is when there was another RPF incursion.  

Can you begin by telling us if there was an RPF attack on the 5th of June 1992?  And then you can comment further on whether you think you were putting the Interahamwe on a military footing.  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, please, I am not with you.  What part of the document are you reading?  You see, I was looking for the exact excerpt that you were referring to, and in that exercise I failed to grasp your question.  

That is why I'm asking the President if he would kindly ask the Prosecutor to repeat his question.  But I would like the Prosecutor, first of all, to point out the exact excerpt he is referring to in the document, so that I can be on the same page that he is.  
Q.	If you look at the third page, the last line, and I will read it in French:  "It is no longer a secret for anyone that our country has been attacked by the enemy."  
A.	That was by Robert, right?  
Q.	Yes, it was Robert Kajuga speaking right after you, and he addresses you.  We're going to go through what he says as well, but I wanted to skip to the -- the last thing that was captured on the video.  

But you speak, then he speaks; he addresses you and comments on the things that you've said.  And I think both of you were speaking sometime after the 5th of June, or shortly after the 5th of June, when there was an attack by the RPF.  
A.	In June '92, on Byumba?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	On the 4th -- night of the 4th to the 5th of June 1992.  Yes, but these were utterances by Robert, made by Robert.  He had his own ideas, I had my own ideas.  I didn't talk about that attack, I didn't talk about "the enemy".  And even if we were to avoid referring to the RPF as an enemy, I think that this would be -- this would be unrealistic.  Because if you have somebody attack a city, attack the inhabitants, attack the population, how can you refer to them as a friend?  

So I think that, on that day, I was at a rally; I was not at the battle front.  And when I talked about defending the country, I explained what my meaning was.  Robert focused on one part of the country, and I do not see how my statement would have assimilated the youth to the military.  I do not see that connection.  
Q.	Right.  We have your explanation; the Chamber can read the entire passage and make its own decision.  It's not a critical issue; this is only one excerpt of one of the many speeches that you've made.  But I'm just using it to suggest to you that you put the Interahamwe on a military footing.  You talk about them defending the nation, and you've -- that's my suggestion to you.  And now you've already responded, so we can move on to something else.  

Kajuga responds to you right after you finish walking away from the dais, he goes up and he starts to speak.  And he responds by asking that the préfectoral delegates and the presidents, presumably of the secteurs, should implement the party's decision to establish the Interahamwe nationwide.  

Isn't that what he's saying, that's the thrust of what he's saying in the three or four paragraphs that follow?  
A.	I am not aware of the existence of any delegates.  Now, what he explains himself, he was calling for people to try to implement the decisions of the national congress, from what I have just read.  So this programme that was supported by the national secretary refers to the implementation of the decision of the congress, namely, to set up the youth wing across the country.  

So I am not aware of the existence of any delegates.  Maybe he was aware of them -- of that, but I was not.  What I have said is that officially the person who was installed as the delegate of the national Interahamwe committee was in Gisenyi.  This is also confirmed or corroborated by one of the Prosecution witnesses.  I do not know any other location, apart from Gisenyi, where a regional delegate was installed.  

Maybe Kajuga knew something in his capacity as the national chairman, but I am not aware of that.  
Q.	I think if we go back to the original -- or, the longer video, which we looked at together, and I think we have it marked for identification as P. ID68, if I'm not mistaken.  And it goes on for over an hour, I think -- or, 45 minutes.  

You are sitting next to Kajuga, or near him for quite a bit of time.  So I don't know if he explained anything to you back then.  But in this text that we have in front of us, he says -- and I'll read in French:  "We called on the préfectoral delegates present to execute, as promptly as possible, this programme which is supported by the national secretary."  And I think he's referring to you, because you'd just left the podium.  

And then if we go to the last paragraph on that third page, he says -- and I'll read it in French:  "Regarding the recruitment of new Interahamwe, I call on the presidents -- or chairmen present to support us.  We also invite the national secretary to support us, so that our party may move forward in the area of membership, so that we may have new Interahamwe members across the country."  
A.	Yes, that indeed was the thrust of the programme, namely, to find or recruit Interahamwe across the country.  If you go to paragraph 10 he says:  "Dear members, dear colleagues of the Interahamwe, I would like to ask you, among other things, that the -- to tell you that the national secretary supports us in the recruitment of Interahamwe across the country.  But we have been experiencing some difficulties in this area, but he has already given us the support, even before we made the request."  

So the national congress supported the programme, endorsed the programme, and it is this programme that he is talking about.  So I don't see where the problem is.  
Q.	There's no problem.  We're in agreement.  

So, one would expect that -- given the intense rivalry among the various political parties, along with the fear of attack by the RPF, that the MRND would have devoted substantial efforts to implementing its membership drive for the Interahamwe.  Wouldn't you agree?  
A.	I do not agree with that interpretation by the Prosecutor, Mr. President.  My role was to build up the party, to strengthen the party.  I did not have the duty to take care of the defence of the country.  So when I referred to recruiting youth into the party, it was for strengthening the party and giving it a future.  That was my role.  

And if we were to proceed otherwise, it would be seeking ways of assimilating the Interahamwe to the military.  But that was not the case.  As national secretary, my duty was to help the party to have more members, more supporters, particularly from among the youth.  And that would only have been normal.  
Q.	So we're in agreement.  There was a need, articulated by you, and recognised by the party, to recruit more members into the Interahamwe nationwide.  

So my question to you is, two years later, by 1992, weren't there Interahamwe za MRND groups throughout the country, set up by regional MRND party leaders in their various localities?  Those are the same delegates that I presume Kajuga was addressing when he spoke sometime in June of 1992 at Amahoro stadium.  
A.	Mr. President, I have already answered that question.  Even if Robert had some people in mind, officially I'm not aware of that, except the case of Gisenyi.  I've already answered that question.  And, right up to 1994, that youth movement was not present throughout the national -- the national territory.  Of course, extending the movement throughout the national territory serves the Prosecution case, but it does not reflect the reality.  Gisenyi, yes; but, elsewhere, I'm not aware of that.  The recruitment of members, including older people, young people, yes, every political party that wants to survive has a duty to do that.  

And the programme that Robert Kajuga is talking about is the recruitment of Interahamwe, particularly everywhere in the country.  Therefore, at the time he is speaking, that did not exist.  I think this is putting words in his mind.  
Q.	Well, you may recall that we've gone over numerous other documents about the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri, Interahamwe in Kibuye, Interahamwe in Gitarama, with other witnesses during the course of this trial.  And we can go over those same documents again.  

My suggestion to you is simply that in June of 1992 the objective of increasing the membership of the Interahamwe nationwide throughout Rwanda was voiced, and my suggestion is -- but two years later something must have been accomplished, given the urgency of the political situation.  
A.	Certainly not.  Because a member of the préfectoral committee of Ruhengeri testified before the Court that the préfectoral committee of the MRND was opposed to that, because the war was taking place in their préfecture.  Therefore, to say that witnesses supported that, in fact, is not true, is not a reflection of the truth.  

And, as a party official, I am saying that -- well, first of all, let's understand one another right from the beginning.  To have young people throughout the country is not an offence.  I will have no reason to deny that, if that allegation was true.  Adult members of the party in all préfectures, of course at different levels.  But there were two préfectures where we were practically not present, that is Gitarama, Butare.  And I believe -- even Gikongoro, I believe.  

But it is not an offence to have members, be they old or young, in a préfecture.  If that was the truth, I will admit it.  But I am telling you that -- that if the RPF had accepted elections, the elections would have shown the real strength of the MRND in various préfectures.  I am telling you that Interahamwes were not present everywhere in the country.  Because it will be easy for me to acknowledge that they were Interahamwe, given that there will be no offence committed by the presence of Interahamwe throughout the country.  
Q.	Well, by the following year, November 1993, wasn't the Interahamwe able to expand throughout the country?  We can look at the text of some of the speeches that were delivered on the 7th of November 1993.  We've done it already through other witnesses.  

You should recall, when we reviewed what Kajuga had to say on that date in Kigali, he spoke to the Interahamwe of Kibuye, he announced that they were celebrating in Kigali, where the video was recorded, where you were present, that it was the second year anniversary of the Interahamwe.  There was a delegate from the Kibuye Interahamwe that took the floor right after Kajuga, who was speaking right after Édouard Karemera.  
A.	But, if my memory serves me right -- it is not necessary to bring that document.  I am aware of it.  So if my memory serves me right, Kajuga also said that the youth congress was being prepared, and it was during that conference, which had to take place on the 3rd of July 1993 -- it was during that congress which had to take place in Kigali that the delegates, the local delegates, the préfectoral delegates had to be elected.  Therefore these people of Kibuye perhaps had already shown an interest, but there were no préfectoral -- they were not préfectoral delegates, and they were not many.  

I would like to add that it was during that congress that the national youth committee of the MRND had to be elected.  But the congress did not take place because the party had given priority to the national congress to elect the steering committee of the MRND.  That was the 4th of July when we were elected.  So that youth congress never took place.  Of course there were young people that were interested.  But to say they were a serious movement, I would say no.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.
MR. WEBSTER:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  I left my microphone on.  Sorry about that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

We lost your sound, Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was simply trying to direct those who are interested in following the text to where it can be located in my bundle.  It's in the same section, tab O.  It should be the second or third document in.  It's labelled P. 12.  I think there's a little 6 in the upper right-hand corner.  We have it in both languages.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Here we are in November 1993.  And you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, if you look at the second paragraph, by saying that:  "I would like to congratulate the Interahamwe.  Since the foundation of our party they have shown that it is they who support the party.  All of them, both boys and girls, are courageous.  They have been the subject of defamation for so long that I think even in Asia, America, and Europe, all whites know the word 'Interahamwe'.  But this defamation has no effect.  Because if whites have learned to fear the Interahamwe, they are right.  If whites have learned to respect the Interahamwe and the MRND, they are right."  

So my suggestion to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, is that either because of its criminality or its reputation for criminality, you seem to be again defending the Interahamwe.  

What do you mean when you say the Interahamwe have been the subject of defamation?  
A.	It is certain that is what we have discussed, since I was being cross-examined.  I -- I said that our party and its youth wing were being persecuted.  But they stuck to their ground, they held on, and people learned to respect them.  That is the purport of what I said.  Because they would have dis -- been discouraged immediately.  However, they persisted, they fought, they supported their party and their ideals, and people learned to respect them.  

This is a speech of encouragement which has no militaristic connotation or any malicious connotation.  It cannot be an offence to encourage and support one's party.  That was our duty.  Naturally, when you lose war as we did, that could take on another meaning.  But the idea that we had at the time of the events is not the idea that public opinion has today.  Because today people use the unfortunate events of 1994 to develop theories that would not perhaps all fortunately withstand the test of history.  

That is the meaning of what I was saying.  Persecution was certain, be it in the media, in the country, abroad, in newspapers.  It was clear that we were being persecuted, we were being slandered.  

I will give you an example, if you would allow me.  
Q.	I think you've answered my question completely.  Let's move on.  

If the Interahamwe was attracting so much criticism and bringing so much -- presenting the -- the MRND party with so much of a challenge, even in terms of its international reputation, what would have been the problem with disbanding it?  
You said it had no independent existence.  It wasn't doing anything for the party, if I understand you correctly, since it had no independent existence.  Wouldn't it have been wise, at that point, simply to say there is no such thing as the youth wing, there's no such thing as the Interahamwe, it's just the MRND party?  
A.	I have already explained that in a political party, if officials do not encourage young people to become members, then after a generation the party will die.  I have already given explanations regarding that point.  There was the determination to involve young people in the party.  I've already answered that question, Mr. President.

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And when we look to the last line on the first page in the English text -- and it should be -- there should be an asterisk next to it in the French text.  It's on the second page in the middle of the page.  The second portion where you see something in -- paragraph -- I'm reading from the bottom of the English.  

"They had an objective when they saw the divisions between you and the other youths.  They had failed up to now because Rwandan youth is still standing firm, however, it is united because at its head it has the Interahamwe."  

When I read that, what it suggests to me is that after the Hutu powers split and the other opposition parties, the Interahamwe was being put forward as the leadership group for all of these other party youth who are now starting to align themselves with the MRND.  We bear in mind that this is November of 1993.  

Do you have any response to that suggestion?  
A.	I do not agree with that suggestion because what I am referring to here is that several months earlier, young people had stopped fighting.  And this was what I was encouraging.  This is what I have always sought.  And if I am expressing satisfaction at this point -- if I'm expressing satisfaction at the fact that those who were so in discord among the youth movement of various parties had failed, it's because young people of various political parties had fought.  But then that fighting came to an end.  And that is what I'm saying here.  

And I'm expressing satisfaction at that because that has always been the purpose of discussions with my colleagues of other political parties.  We sought to bring to an end -- to the fighting, fighting amongst the youth movements of various political parties.  And I'm here expressing satisfaction at the fact that that fighting had come to an end and that the atmosphere had clearly improved even among political leaders and well before what you referred to as the power wings.  

The power wings in my opinion - well, this speech which is kind of humoristic criticises those who rely on ethnicity to win votes among the people.  So the idea you have is not the one I had.  
Q.	You know, fundamentally, I think we're in agreement, Mr. Ngriumpatse.  There was a split in the MDR, and I believe it was July of 1993.  And it took a very visceral form in October of 1993 after 
	Frodouald Karamira gave his speech on the 3rd of October.  And what I'm suggesting and what you seem to agree with is that the various youths weren't fighting with each other as much because they all were coming together under the leadership of the Interahamwe because the Hutu power wings of the opposition were now aligning themselves with your party, the MRND.  
So you weren't fighting the youths of all the parties anymore; they were being pulled together with your youth wing, the Interahamwe.  Isn't that what you just said?  Maybe expressed slightly differently.  
A.	That is a divergence.  The first thing I said is that young people had stopped fighting among themselves, and that was well before the death of President Ndadaye.  They had stopped fighting well before that.  

So we do not have the same interpretation.  The Prosecutor wants to link his interpretation to the Prosecution case, but which does not reflect the reality.  

Well before the death of Ndadaye, that fighting had come to an end.  I had visited my colleagues of the other political parties to bring to an end fighting among the young people.  Therefore, when 
President Ndadaye was assassinated, street fighting had stopped.  I am not aware of any such fighting, and that was well before the death of Ndadaye.    

From the moment I was elected, I paid a great deal of attention to that, and that was from the month of July, and the street fighting had completely come to an end.  

Therefore, do not try to tell me that it was because all the young people had come together under the same umbrella or ideology or that because they had aligned themselves with the Interahamwe ideology.  That is not true.  They remained political adversaries, (inaudible) political rivalries who did not make any concession as far as we were concerned.  
Q.	If we go to page 3 in the English text, the top paragraph where I put an asterisk.  And in the French text it would be on page 4 with K number ending 646.  And I think I've also put an asterisk.  

Don't you acknowledge that there were Interahamwe in Gitarama at your speech in on the 
7th of November 1993?  

You talk about denouncing the bourgmestre, Musambira, right, who was killed during the genocide?  He wrote in that -- in English it's Kamana (sic), Silas.  I think you're referring to Kubwimana, Silas.  

He wrote that Kubwimana, Silas and I hold nightly meetings in Rugobwagoba (phonetic) in order to stir up trouble in Gitarama.  He did not mention Mpamo.  

"Why should I hold those meetings at night?  There are Interahamwe members here in Gitarama.  So why should I not go with the Interahamwe in the day to meet members of the party?"  

Aren't you indicating that there were Interahamwe -- or an Interahamwe organisation in Gitarama at least on the 7th of November 1993?  
A.	Mr. President, I just said a few minutes ago that the events of 1994 influenced all opinions, even in a negative manner.  A serious politician, would he allow his adversary -- can you -- do you think that a politician would agree that he's absent in Gitarama?  You think that a politician, a serious politician, would admit that to his adversaries?  Not only would that be impudent, but it is politically fatal.  

I couldn't say that our party was not present in Gitarama.  But the witnesses who came here said that we were practically absent.  But from a political standpoint, if I have a political rally, I am not engaged in war.  And in that case I cannot tell my political rivals that I was absent in that area.  That is politically fatal.  If I said so, yes.  In politics any other politician would have said that no party would accept that they are absent in the provinces of the other people, the rival parties.  If that be the case, political competition would have no meaning.  

But I believe you should not -- you should not link everything to 1994.  You made mention of the bourgmestre -- of Musambira.  I do not know how he died, but I regret his death has no relationship -- his assassination, if at all he was assassinated, is not linked to what I am saying.  He had written this, but I read it, and I responded publicly.  But it has -- this has nothing -- or we should not say that there was an Interahamwe movement in Gitarama.  That was a way of speaking.  I could not have said -- in a political context I could not have said that we were absent.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We understand you.  

We go to the next document, which is still from the rally of the 7th of November 1993.  This is the text of what Robert Kajuga said to the crowd.  And I'll remind you that we had looked at the image of Kajuga together a few weeks ago when he was dressed in the Interahamwe uniform and approached the (inaudible).  We look at the first page in the English text.  This is document -- there's a little 5 in a circle at the top right-hand corner.  We have it in French also, in the middle of the page -- the bottom of the page in the French text.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, could you hand this to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	"I would like to call upon those who claim that the Interahamwe are soldiers to come and attend the march-past.  Come and see how they are trained to be men of valour" --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the French booth wasn't able to follow.  Please could counsel give the reference.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's document number 5 in that same section.  It ends in K number 5302.  And I'm reading from the last line on page 17, as it's indicated in the printed text.  It's still P. 12, an excerpt from an exhibit that's already been admitted.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter has not been able to locate the passage.  If counsel could, please just read slowly.  
THE WITNESS: 
Are you referring to the page that ends with 02, that is, a K number ending in 02 at the bottom?  
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	Yes.  The last line in French, and then it continues on to the next page.  And I'll read in English:  

"I would like to call upon those who claim that the Interahamwe are soldiers to come and attend the march-past; come and see how they were trained to be men of valour and how they have assisted the party to prosper.  They will make you proud.  We are the ones in charge in Kigali.  No other demonstration can be held there unless the Interahamwe approve of it."  
A.	Yes.  But in my opinion, this was ironic.  Maybe it is a matter of culture.  But he says -- or it says that those who say Interahamwe are soldiers -- this is a negation.  He's saying that they are not soldiers but that he requests people to come and see them march, just like the other members of the parties were marching.  There were groups that were marching; cultural groups, groups of young people who were marching during rallies, during public events.  

And this is rather ironic.  I do not take this as an assertion that they are soldiers.  No.  He is mocking those who claim that the Interahamwe are soldiers.  This is, in fact, quite the opposite of what you are saying or thinking.
Q.	All right.  Well, I thank you.  We have your interpretation.  The Chamber can read it for themselves and appreciate it by looking at the video and make its own assessment.  But it seems to me that he's making reference to those Interahamwe who were being sent off to Gabiro and coming back, having been trained for several weeks, with a new Interahamwe card, which is what your Witness V06 relates in the witness statement we reviewed yesterday.  

But we can still agree, however you want to interpret Robert Kajuga's words, that the Interahamwe came to be seen as a menacing, militaristic force in Rwanda by late 1993.  
A.	But that does not in any way take away from the unfair nature of this characterisation, and that is what Robert is denying.  
Q.	You complained yesterday that all of the Interahamwe witnesses that we heard in this trial were Prosecution witnesses and for that reason gave testimony that was inaccurate and biased against the accused and in favour of the Prosecution.  

But can we agree that Georges Rutaganda does not fit in that category; right?  He wasn't a 
Prosecution witness.  And as someone that you've known as a co-detainee, I don't think you could put him in the Prosecution camp.  We agree, don't we?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I'd like us to look at what Rutaganda has to say in his own trial, in his own Defence, back on the 8th of April 1999.  This is an excerpt of his testimony that's already in evidence.  We have it in another tab.  It's tab IH (sic) of my bundle.  I'll read it slowly.  I don't think we necessarily have to find the other document, but if you give me one second, I'll read it to you.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa can actually take this to the witness.  It's the transcripts of the 8th of April 1999.  It's in evidence as P. 454.  And here he's discussing the structure of the Interahamwe organisation and its relationship to the MRND party.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	"As far as I am concerned, if there was a problem, we met" -- and here he's talking about the Interahamwe provisional committee, of which he was a member.  

"As far as I'm concerned, if there was a problem, we met, we discussed the issue, and we reached a conclusion but it was always under the leadership and with the coordination of the party." 

And then there's a question -- 
A.	I'm sorry.  Can you please tell me where you are reading from, the page, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If Mr. Issa could collect the document from the witness, I'll mark it for him.  

Can you direct his attention to right there.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you see where I put a little, red arrow, Mr. Ngirumpatse?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Dear colleague, it would appear to me that the French interpreters are suffering.  Do you have a copy of the document for them?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's tab IH (sic).  It's in the middle of that collection.  It takes the form of a trial transcript.  It's dated the 8th of April 1999.  There's a handwritten inscription, P. 454 and the name Rutaganda at the bottom.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster, isn't your tab HI? Or is it IH?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I'm sorry.  HI, not IH.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Have you found it Mr. Ngriumpatse?  
A.	Yes.  Is that the excerpt highlighted in red at the bottom, page 179 in the French version?  
Q.	Yes.  In the French text it's page 179 starting on line 21.  In the English text it's page 154 at line 1.  

And Rutaganda is saying in response to a question -- is:  "As far as I'm concerned, if there was a problem, we met, we discussed the issue, and we reached a conclusion.  But it was always under the leadership and with the coordination of the party."  

Then he's asked the question:  "Yes.  But if you didn't have any legal instruments, as it were, this group of five people was free to do anything it chose." 

Rutaganda's answer:  "No.  We could not do anything outside the party.  And I think that the question is very important here, because obviously confusion would come when you want to separate the Interahamwe of any party.  The Interahamwe MRND is the party itself; it is the members of the party.  The party is responsible for managing them, and it's the party which is organising everything." 

There's another question in response and Rutaganda goes on to say, "It is an integral part of the party." 

And it goes on.  But his discussion basically reinforces what I've been suggesting to you all along and what other Prosecution witnesses has told us, which is that the Interahamwe provisional committee is being managed by the party leadership.  Isn't that what he says in that passage?  
A.	That is what he says, but it is a misinterpretation, once more, of the decision of the congress.  This was the position of the congress:  It commended those who had created, and those who created were not the party.  He urged them to continue to restructure in order to be affiliated or integrated into the party at some point. 

So when Rutaganda talks about integration as such, he is mistaken, because there was no integration.  What he, therefore, states is not only contrary to the resolution but also a misinterpretation of the constitution of the MRND.  I do not agree with his interpretation.  
Q.	Well, it's not in your interest to agree with his interpretation.  
A.	That doesn't make it untrue even if it were in my interest.  
Q.	Yes.  But the point is that Rutaganda is saying the same thing that every other Interahamwe witness has said when they come before this Chamber, whether they be Defence witnesses or 
	Prosecution witnesses.  He was testifying in this court as a Defence witness.  He was testifying on his own behalf in his own case.  And he's describing the nature of the organisation in the very same terms that Witness T and Witness G described it.  
A.	Even for those witnesses, it was in their interests to make those arguments.  Georges Rutaganda, it was in his case that he testified.  T had a case file.  G wanted to benefit from full immunity.  So it was in their interest.  It was much more in their interest.  

But at least I have recognised that they were members of the party.  Now, they created this organisation themselves without the intervention of any member of the party.  We encouraged them to continue, and the speeches on that point are very clear.  However, I could not -- or it does not mean that I was the one in charge of -- although I could assist them, as the national secretary or the chairman, in the activities.  But it doesn't mean that I was organising their activities.  

Some have claimed, for example, that I am the one who drafted their mails, their correspondences, but that is not true.  What I have acknowledged and recognised is that if they wanted to organise any demonstrations that would be prejudicial to the interest of the party, then we would advise them along the lines that would be in the interest of the party.  That does not mean, in any event, that we were the ones who gave them authorisations to organise their demonstrations.  They had to ask for those authorisations from elsewhere.
Q.	All right.  We have your explanation.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Mr. Issa, could you bring this up to Mr. Ngirumpatse.  It's on page 78 of the French text.  It starts there.  And I'm reading on the English text, starting at line 7; on page 53 in the English text. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Rutaganda is being asked about Turatsinze, Jean Pierre.  The question put to him is:  "Now, this individual who you claim had another name and was working in the party, what was his job in the party, Mr. Rutaganda?" 

Rutaganda's answer:  "He had a small office on which it said 'youth service', and he was often there.  But he was someone who was known because sometimes he was a driver.  He would transport messages, distribute mail.  So that was actually his role." 

So here we have another Interahamwe witness, not a Prosecution witness, a Defence witness, providing information that Turatsinze had a small office in the MRND headquarters, bearing the inscription "youth service" and he was sometimes a driver.  

I'm sure he was a man who did many things for many people.  But you've denied consistently that he had an office and that he was a youth coordinator, and here we have Rutaganda suggesting otherwise.  
A.	Maybe he went to sit in that office, but he was not in charge of that office.  There was no owner of that office.  We could not hire anybody to fill up that position for financial reasons.  

Now, an office of a party official to take care of youths should have been occupied by somebody who was much more qualified than this person.  And this would have been common sense.  We could not have taken or hired somebody who simply knows how to read and write and drive a car and make him a leader of the youth.  We would have at least looked for someone who had attended up to 
secondary school at the very least.  

So maybe he got people to believe that he was in charge of that office.  But Rutaganda goes on to say that he was a driver, he transported messages, distributed mail, and so on and so forth.  That, in fact, was actually his role.  And that appears from line 1 to 9 in the French version.  On 21 April 1999, that was Rutaganda's testimony, namely, that his role was to drive, transport messages, and distribute mail.  

Now, if we were to look for an officer for the youth service, we definitely would have hired a more qualified individual.  I do not see how we could have hired someone who had simply been a driver and who had never held any other office to that position.  At the time there were people who were more qualified who may have studied in that area, who may have studied abroad.  But there was no reason for us at that time to hire somebody in that particular service, more so as the youth had already organised themselves on the ground.  So we did not need a civil servant at the national headquarters for that particular position at that time.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I would like to offer this one- one-or-two-page text as the next Prosecution exhibit, 
	one page in English and two pages in the French from the 21st of April 1999. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. P. 563A and P. 563B admitted) 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be P. 563; A for French, B for English.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngriumpatse, you've reserved quite a bit of criticism for UB, Prosecution Witness UB.  And you've chracterised him as an international witness.  

Can you explain what you mean by that.  
A.	There are witnesses who have said so even before this Trial Chamber.  I am not the one who fabricated that, the fact that he's not credible.  Even the Gacaca newspaper has made a number of comments about that witness.  And that has even led to determination of various sentences for false testimonies with an additional six months' imprisonment because of the lies that were part and parcel of those testimonies.  
Q.	Well, that's news to me.  I don't recall that from the testimony of any witnesses or any exhibit in our trial.  But I'll review our records and see if there's any substance to what you're saying.  
But you were the one who chracterised him as an international witness.  Wasn't that the term that you used in your direct examination?  
A.	Yes, I said so.  But another witness had referred to him in those terms before me.  I am not the author of that concept of international witness.  
Q.	So you were just parroting what another witness said in the court?  
A.	I think so, yes.  Another witness had used that expression.  And speaking off the cuff, I don't have any documents or transcripts to work with.  But I am not the author of that expression.
Q.	And then when you suggest that he was sanctioned for false testimony, you're just repeating something else that you heard.  You've never seen any documentation of that?  
A.	I did not say that he was sanctioned.  I said that the newspaper, Gacaca, carried a story on that topic and that a decision was taken to add six months to the sentences of witnesses who lie but that he had been identified by the Gacaca newspaper in a document which I believe is in evidence already.  And my Defence team should be in a position -- or even looking through the archives, we should be able to identify that document.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  There's a technical problem with the French channel at the moment.  My colleague is not receiving it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Is it okay now?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it?  

Mr. Issa, could you make an enquiry for us, please.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I can confirm that we did not hear Mr. Ngriumpatse's answer, except from a live sound in the courtroom.  We didn't hear him on our headsets.  So there must have been a technical problem on the French channel, at least as far as the last answer goes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the response was that there was a Gacaca document that substantiated what Mr. Ngriumpatse said about Witness UB and that his Defence team could find the number of the exhibit.  So we can look for it as well.  

But I don't recall that, Mr. Ngriumpatse.  We'll move on to another subject. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  The registry has confirmed that the sound has returned.  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngriumpatse, moving on to another subject.  Soldiers and reservists were recruited into the Interahamwe; isn't that so?  
A.	Included?  No.  I don't think we should say they were included.  That is not the understanding.  Not active soldiers -- not active soldiers.  Categorically, the answer is no.  There were no active soldiers who were members of the Interahamwe or of any other political party youth wings.  

However, soldiers who were no longer in active service were free to join youth wings, not only the MRND, but also PSD, MDR, the PL and all over.  Nothing stopped any reservists -- any 
young reservists who were not bound by any contract with the military to sign up with the youth wings of any political party.  But as for soldiers in active service, it was actually prohibited for them to engage in such activities.  
Q.	What about gendarme?  
A.	Gendarmes in active service?  No.  That was not possible.  Maybe the Prosecutor has information that I am not privy to.  He may have people who provide him with other types of information.  According to the laws governing political parties, gendarmes and soldiers were -- they came under the same rules.  
Q.	The information I have at my disposal as -- actually coming from you, Mr. Ngriumpatse, when you were interviewed on the 15th of June 1998, in cassette number three, the transcript which can be found at tab N in my bundle.  It should be the third document in, at page -- ending in K number 6166 in the English text.  I'm not quite sure what page it is in the French.  But I'll read it very slowly.  

This is what you had to say when you were asked questions about the Interahamwe shortly following your arrest.  This is at the very bottom of the page ending in 6165 in the English text.  Again, it's cassette number two.  

"But I also have to say that in those youth movements there was a phenomenon, because you know they were young people; they were also reservists; they were soldiers or gendarmes who belonged to all those youth movements, indistinctly in the Interahamwe.  They were in the MDR and the PSD." 

And then you go on.  But I believe it is you yourself that is suggesting that they were soldiers, gendarmes and reservists in the youth wings, including the Interahamwe.  
A.	Mr. President, during the last sittings, I wanted to say something about the Bamako declaration.  What I want to say might require some time.  And I would like to ask for authorisation from the Trial Chamber to proceed with providing an explanation on this declaration.  

It is a statement that I cannot endorse -- on this statement, rather, that I cannot endorse.  I would like to ask for permission or leave from the Trial Chamber to explain a few matters pertaining to this statement before dealing with the specific question that has been put to me.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, my suggestion is that we reserve any such discussion to the end of the testimony if there's a motion on the part of the Prosecution to admit any of the transcripts in evidence.  But at this stage I think we would be all better off simply proceeding.  I'm not going to abandon using those transcripts, but I'm not offering them in evidence now, and Mr. Ngriumpatse will have ample time to tell us about the circumstances of his interview if we make an attempt to admit it in evidence at a later stage.  

I think the witness can respond to the question without having to go into too much discussion about the circumstances of the interview.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I do not know whether we should speak on this request from Mr. Ngriumpatse and the Prosecutor's reply.  It would seem that Mr. -- the Prosecutor is referring to this document as a statement, and I believe that it is in order for Mr. Ngriumpatse to raise a prior concern as to the nature of this document and the context in which it was drafted.  

I, therefore, do not see how it is that the Prosecutor will continue to work on a document and continue his line of questioning based on this document; whereas, Mr. Ngriumpatse is denied the possibility of making a statement asking the nature and context in which the document may have been drafted, and that would clearly have an impact on the answers that he provides as to the questions being put by the Prosecutor.  

That is why I apply to the Trial Chamber to please grant Mr. Ngriumpatse leave to provide preliminary explanations to this matter before the Prosecutor can proceed with raising questions whatsoever with him relating to the said document.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we have to agree with the -- with the Prosecutor at this stage.  We have already issued a written decision saying that the Prosecutor is entitled to use this document during his cross-examination.  It's not in evidence at this stage.  Only Mr. Ngriumpatse's answers will be in evidence.  And the issue that Mr. Ngriumpatse wishes to discuss only becomes relevant if there is an application to put the document or any part of it in evidence.  But as of now, it's not in evidence, and all that would-be evidence would be what Mr. Ngriumpatse says about it.  So we permit the question.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I think I already have a response from you, Mr. Ngriumpatse.  Is that so, or is there something else that you need to say on that limited issue that you, yourself, had chracterised gendarmes and soldiers and reservists as being recruited into the youth wings of various parties, including the Interahamwe?  
A.	I talked about reservists, not about soldiers or gendarmes, in active service.  That would not have been possible for that category of persons.  Otherwise, they would have been sanctioned.  But I'll stop there.  

I have already indicated that for some reasons there are several inconsistencies within this statement.  So no one should be surprised if the answers I provide are different from what you may find in the report -- or in the statement.  

I have answered the question, Mr. President.  I've answered the Prosecutor's question.  And that is it.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour.  I see the time.  I think this is perhaps a good point to close.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  It's 10:30.  We'll take our mid-morning recess now.

(Pages 14 to 25 by Lisa D. Smith)






















(Court resumed at 1054H) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, going on to something else.  You wrote two letters to President Habyarimana that have already been admitted in evidence.  I believe one is P. 285.  It's the handwritten letter of the 
	23rd of November 1992.  And the other is P. 27, which is the handwritten letter of 
	14th of February 1993, both of which can be found in tab M, the binder that I circulated.  What we have in the binder are the typewritten text, the French transcription and the English translation. 

In both of those letters, your concern seems to be that the MRND was losing control of the army because of the Arusha Accords.  Would you agree?  It's at least one of the concerns that you raised with President Habyarimana.  
A.	Mr. President, can I have the document being referred to.  I would like to acquaint myself with it. 
Q.	Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could hand this up to the witness, both the typewritten French transcriptions. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If you look at paragraph 4 -- and it is enumerated in the November 1992 document, which is P. 285 -- we can start with that one.  In English it reads -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The French interpreter is unable to locate the document, Counsel.  Apparently, it's not in the bundle at all. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I will read it slowly.  It's already in evidence.  We don't have to read the entire text.  Mr. Ngirumpatse can refer to it. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	It says, "Considering the situation, your influence within the army is imperative."  Have you found the section, Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Is it paragraph 4 of the letter of 3 November 1992?  Is that what you are reading, paragraph 4 of the letter, I think, 23 November 1992?
Q.	Yes.
A.	Yes.  But I did not understand the question.  
Q.	You suggest placing the elite contingents of the army in the police.  And my suggestion -- that's what you are suggesting to President Habyarimana.  And my suggestion to you is that the reason you are making that suggestion is because the MRND -- or you on behalf of the MRND are making the observation that the Arusha Accords is going to weaken your ability to control the army or dominate the army.  So you want to take your elite forces and put them in the police force where you could still rely on them to compete with the RPF when the two armies are fused, which is what would happen under the Arusha Accords.  Wasn't that the concern? 
A.	Not at all.  If you read carefully, I am saying the following:  During the merger, we have to depend on loyal forces.  In Angola the president had put all the elite forces in the police.  And after the elections, that force pushed back UNITA.  Of course, here we cannot do the same operation.  But it will be necessary to reflect on an approach that would strengthen your influence over the army.  

That has nothing to do with counsel's question, Mr. President.  I did not say that.  It is clear. 
Q.	And you go on to say that, "At any rate, in spite of the blackmail, we must not let go of MINADEF and MININTER," referring to the ministry of defence and the ministry of interior.  But I am curious about the first part of the paragraph where he says -- where you say, "During the merger, one must rely on 
	loyal forces."  So doesn't that get to the heart of what I was suggesting to you?  

The armies were going to be fused pursuant to the Arusha Accords.  You and the MRND wanted to be able to rely on loyal forces.  Since the command of the army was going to be shared with the RPF, you wanted to put your elite forces into the police where you could control them still through the 
ministry of interior, which was going to still remain with the MRND party.  
A.	Mr. President, I am saying that what I am saying in connection with Angola is that we cannot do the same operation as in Angola.  I am simply telling the president that, of course, here we cannot proceed in the same manner but that we should reflect on an approach that would make it possible for the president's influence to be maintained over the army. 

In any case, in spite of blackmail, we should not give up the ministry of defence and the 
ministry of the interior.  This was at the heart of -- or in full negotiations.  These are the negotiations. 

If we had been a minority, of course, we could have given up many things.  But putting the elite force in the police, I am not saying that.  I am saying that this is impossible in Rwanda. 

This sentence is clear, crystal clear.  I am not saying that that should be done.  I am suggesting to the president to find how he can strengthen his influence over the army.  I do not have any concrete proposal to give -- to make to the president. 

So what you are ascribing to me -- what the Prosecution is attributing to me, Mr. President, I did not say that.  I did not suggest to the president to put part of the army in the police force. 

I wrote in French, and I am reading the document in French.  And it is very clear.  The Prosecutor reads French, so it should also be clear, very clear to him. 
Q.	All right.  We have your response.  But I'd bring your attention to another document.  I am not sure if it's included in the bundle, but this is a UNAMIR inter-office memorandum dated the 
	22nd of February 1994, which doesn't appear to have been copied, but I will describe it, and then I will ask Mr. Issa to take it over to Mr. Weyl so he can look at it. 

But this is the type of document that we have seen before in this trial.  It's an intelligence report about distribution and arms caches and training camps.  It was actually distributed previously to be used with another witness.  And I am looking at paragraph 4 of this memo that was addressed to the 
force commander on the 22nd of February 1994.  And what is indicated by this intelligence officer is the following, and I will read it in French:  

"A huge increase in the number of criminal police was noticed.  MINADEF and MININTER wanted to arm them against the opposition for the entire year."  

Let me repeat.  In fact, MINADEF and MININTER wanted to arm the Interahamwe against the opposition for an entire -- to destroy, but the trick was discovered.  They changed tactic.  The préfet swelled the numbers of communal policemen by an influx or significant increase of Interahamwe who received police uniforms and arms. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Mr. Issa, if you could just show this to the Defence in case they didn't follow in the translation. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	What I am suggesting to you is that this is an intelligence report from UNAMIR, and what they discovered is something along the same things that you were suggesting to President Habyarimana in November 1992, which is that the communal police could be used to benefit the MRND which controlled the ministry of the interior by filling it with Interahamwe in the same way that you suggested that it could be filled with elite forces of the army.  Would that be a reasonable conclusion under the circumstance? 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
I am sorry, Mr. President.  It may be useful for us to have a copy of that document as counsel proceeds with the questions.  That particular document is not in the binder.  I am not able to find it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  I apologise.  It's not in the binder, but it was previously distributed with another witness.  It was not copied by error.  But I have handed my copy over to the Defence so you can see what I have read from.  So I am simply making a suggestion to the witness.  He should be able respond. 

I am not offering it in evidence.  It's simply a suggestion that I am making to Mr. Ngirumpatse, and this is a good-faith basis for me to make the suggestion.  That's really the limit of what we're doing with the document. 
I could have made the same suggestion without even referring to the document. 
THE WITNESS:
No.  No.  It has no bearing whatsoever.  You see, when you suggest, along with this UNAMIR officer, that we are swelling the ranks of the communal police with Interahamwe and at the same time you are talking about the elite troops, you see, you don't need the Interahamwe to do that. 

I believe that, once again, these are fabrications by the opposition.  It was not these young civilians who were supposed to go war and who never went to any serious military school.  We could not somehow hide behind them to influence the army.  The communal police had no weight in Rwanda, no influence, neither over the army nor the gendarmerie.  So this is a whimsical accusation. 

And I have already testified that in my letter, it is clearly stated that we cannot proceed in the same manner.  I did not offer any suggestion.  But if I had to suggest anything, it would not have been to suggest that the Interahamwe be used as a force that would be able to stop or check the RPF. 

By the way, Mr. President, let me add that in November we discovered an RPF document which talked about using -- or letting -- or having a strike force in Uganda in order to torpedo the elections.  But that is what I was referring to. 

This is -- this was in 1992, and it is not the Interahamwe who could have been elite troops that would have been in a position to stop the RPF.  So I think that drawing such a conclusion from this document is totally unacceptable.  In fact, it doesn't even hold as a matter of logic. 

So what I did was -- is contained in my letter, but I did not make any proposal or suggestion. 

Furthermore, Mr. President, when I wrote to the president of the republic, my letter was handwritten.  I could have written anything that I wanted to write to him without any fear whatsoever.  But if we are to read other meaning into what I wrote, let me just say that there was no such thing in it. 

And history has already proven that indeed we were in danger.  The president was murdered, the country and the administrations were destroyed, and so I was not mistaken in my assessment. 

I thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	If we turn to your other letter, the letter of the 14th of February 1993, in the last paragraph you make the suggestion that the young must be trained urgently, and in parenthesis you indicated "secretly", of course.  Aren't both of these letters, in the portions where I have indicated to you, somehow urging the president, who at the time was still the president of the MRND party in February of 1993, to militarise the Interahamwe? 
A.	Mr. President, I already provided an explanation on this letter during examination-in-chief, and I did so at length, particularly regarding the use of the word "secretly".  I explained that in 1991 we tried to 
	set up a civil defence system and weapons had been distributed to communes bordering Uganda at the war front so that the inhabitants of those areas could protect themselves against the RPF. 

I stated that the RPF, its friends and its godfathers, various embassies and the media, had created a scandal.  And I said that by proposing for such training to be conducted in secret, I wanted to avoid being trapped in the same way as we had been in 1991. 

Secondly, I am not making reference here to the Interahamwe.  You see, the defence of the country, as I have already explained, is a matter for all citizens.  In the letter itself I stated that only the entire nation would be able to stand up to them.  The entire nation is not only the Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe are such a small faction of the country that they would not even have resisted the RPF for an hour. 

So if I had wanted to proceed in that manner, I would have been as clear as that in my letter.  So what I believe, Mr. President, is that the Prosecutor is looking for all types of excuses to support its case.  

We were attacked on the 8th of February 1993, Kigali was almost captured, and I believe that there were 14 political parties out of the 17, as well as our embassy in Kampala, which made the same suggestion to the president.  So I was not the only one to have made that recommendation, and my focus was not on the Interahamwe at the time I made the suggestion. 

The letter to the president of the republic was handwritten.  And if I had wanted to say "Interahamwe", I would have stated clearly in that letter that I was alluding to the Interahamwe. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Well, throughout its various phases, didn't the ministry of interior and the ministry of defence, both of which were in the hands of the MRND, make it possible for the MRND to control the civil defence programme? 
A.	No.  The minister of defence was forced to withdraw the weapons that had been distributed in 1991 because it did not work. 
Q.	That's understood.  That's what he was directed to do, but I think you will agree with me that there is documentation that the weapons were never withdrawn, from Ruhengeri at least.  I think we both -- we have all looked at documentation from the presentation of Joseph Nzirorera's case where the guns that were initially distributed were never withdrawn.  And what I am suggesting to you, it was the 
	MRND's control of MINADEF and MININTER that allowed it to dominate and control the civil defence programme, however it was organised.  
A.	First of all, I was not a member of government, and I am not in a position to provide details as to the discussions and the decisions relating to the distribution or withdrawal of weapons.  I became aware that those weapons were not withdrawn only when -- only here in Arusha.  But in general, the public in Rwanda knew -- or thought that the weapons had been withdrawn. 

So I am not in a position to assert whether the weapons were withdrawn or not and the circumstances surrounding any such transaction.  I cannot provide any reasons for it. 

Let me restate what I have already stated.  The national secretary of the party is not the government. 
Q.	Well, on that last point, the fact that the public may not have known that the weapons were never withdrawn despite the government's decision that they should be withdrawn, isn't that some indication of how persons in the ministry of defence and the ministry of interior and the territorial administration in Ruhengeri were able to subvert the decisions of the government, which at that time was headed by somebody in the MDR; whereas, the ministries that we are referring to, ministry of interior and ministry of defence, were in the hands of the MRND?  And at least in Ruhengeri, Mukingo commune was in the hands of an MRND bourgmestre.  That's the very point I am making, Mr. Ngirumpatse, that the MRND party's control over the ministry of the interior and the ministry of defence allowed them to dominate and control the civil defence.  
A.	Mr. President, I cannot engage in such a discussion.  I have already testified that I was not a 
	member of government.  I have explained that I did not have authority over ministers who were answerable to the prime minister who himself was answerable to the president of the republic.  There is no room for a political party in that set up, unfortunately. 

So I cannot engage in this type of discussion, because I don't have the necessary weapons for this type of discussion.  The bourgmestres were not under my orders.  The préfets were not under my orders.  The minister's advisers, the ministers themselves were not under my orders.  So how do you expect me to engage in this type of debate?  I cannot. 
Q.	Weren't Interahamwe incorporated in the civil defence? 
A.	What civil defence?  After 1994?  Because we tend to confuse things.  We have the Interahamwe of before 1994 and then the Interahamwe of after 1994.  Let us not confuse issues. 

Apparently, everybody may have chosen to be called Interahamwe, but the two situations are not the same.  Before 1994, I am not aware of any civil defence programme, except the one I have referred to in 1991, under the control of bourgmestres independently of their political leanings.  We explained that the weapons were distributed at night and then stored at the communes during the day, and the Interahamwe were not part of it. 
Q.	Well, I was asking the question generally, but we can certainly limit ourselves to Kigali.  But in 
	partial response to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, we have heard evidence in this case where Interahamwe in Mukingo commune in Ruhengeri explained that they were incorporated in the civil defence in 
	Mukingo commune, or at least in Busogo secteur.  So that's certainly an example.  But I think, as a general proposition, wherever there were Interahamwe and civil defence, the Interahamwe were incorporated in the civil defence.  

But looking at Kigali, weren't the leaders of the civil defence forces in Kigali during the genocide, which is to say after the 6th of April?  Weren't those leaders of the civil defence -- Robert Kajuga, 
Bernard Maniragaba, Rutaganda, Nkezabera -- the leaders or the officers of the provisional national committee?  Weren't those the leaders of the civil defence in Kigali? 
A.	As far as I know, the guideline by Prime Minister Kambanda on civil defence was issued on the 
	25th of May.  I am not aware of any civil defence before that date. 

If anything was done in Kigali and elsewhere, it must have been by members of the population.  I am not aware of any organisation, any structure known as the civil defence at that time.  People had become uncontrollable.  It was not possible. 

And by the way, even after the 25th of May, nothing worked because Kambanda did not have the weapons; he did not have the men; he did not have trained persons.  So it was simply a last-ditch attempt. 

And my answer, therefore, to your question is no. 
Q.	I think that we would be able to look at documentation from UNAMIR, UNAMIR sitreps that refer specifically to Robert Kajuga, UNAMIR internal notes that refer to Kajuga and Nkezabera and Maniragaba, identifying them as the persons that were representing the self-defence forces in Kigali any time UNAMIR needed to contact those self-defence forces.  
A.	Is that your question?  
Q.	Yes.  I am suggesting to you that there is documentation in UNAMIR that identifies at least three of those persons as leaders of the self-defence forces.  Do you have information to the contrary? 
A.	No.  The question is not whether I have information to the contrary.  The question is to determine whether UNAMIR was correct. 

You see, in any event, had UNAMIR preferred to work and contact with people at the war front -- in any event, nobody from UNAMIR ever came to meet a party member on this issue.  And this indicates that there was no connection between those people UNAMIR refers to as agents of civil defence and the 
party.  So I do not know where UNAMIR got its information from when it talks about civil defence. 

It is not because one is defending one's house or one's wife or one's children that it amounts to civil defence.  Civil defence must be a structure, an organisation.  Before the 25th, there was no civil defence in place and people did whatever they could to survive, and that is what I mean. 

If you claim that UNAMIR came to talk to me on this issue, fair and good, but I did not meet anybody.  I did not talk to anybody.  Maybe UNAMIR talked with people who were in Kigali, and that would be a matter that concerns only UNAMIR and the persons with whom they had the discussions.  I was not part of that arrangement.  The party was not part of those discussions.  Everyone knows where the leaders of the party were at the time. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, if it could be demonstrated that the leaders of the civil defence in Kigali were Kajuga, Maniragaba, Rutaganda and Nkezabera, could one reasonably conclude that the Interahamwe were controlling and managing the civil deference, at least in Kigali? 
A.	Well, if those people, as the inhabitants of Kigali, worked with other persons to defend the city, this does not amount to what could be referred to as a civil defence and which would have come under the authority of political parties or the government.  So the fact is that government was absent from Kigali and from several -- or most points of the country.  That is the difference that needs to be established.  That is where we differ.  That is where our views differ. 

The Prosecutor thinks that because UNAMIR thought that there was a civil defence in place and they found people to talk to about it, then all government and political parties must have been involved.  And I say no to that. 
Q.	Well, let me ask the question again.  If it could be demonstrated that the leaders of the civil defence in Kigali were Robert Kajuga, Bernard Maniragaba, George Rutaganda and Ephrem Nkezabera, wouldn't it be reasonable to conclude that the Interahamwe were leading the civil defence, at least in Kigali? 
A.	Not necessarily.  I do not agree with that conclusion.  UNAMIR maybe targeted a number of personalities but did not address the question in depth.  So I cannot accept such a conclusion. 
Q.	If we turn to the documents in tab D of my bundle, we will find a rather thick collection of documents that was provided by the Belgian authorities when they interviewed Roméo Dallaire back in 
	September of 2006.  And as attachments to the statement that was taken from General Dallaire, there are a number of UNAMIR documents, including handwritten notations by his assistant who at the time I believe was a Senegalese officer by the name of -- it's written on the document, actually.  

If you look in tab D -- and I will hand it up to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse -- towards the middle of the documentation, you will see a list of annexes.  And following that, the first annex is described as extracts of the chronology of -- of a meeting between General Dallaire with different civilian authorities prepared by Major Diagne, D-I-A-G-N-E, in Rwanda in 1994. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could assist me. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I am just going to refer one page to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  If you look over at the left-hand column, you will see an inscription of the names Robert Kajuga, Bernard Maniragaba and Ephrem Nkezabera; right? 
A.	Yes.  I am with you.  I can see it.  I am with you. 
Q.	That's one of several memoranda that mentions those three names over and over again in five different meetings between UNAMIR officials and these self-defence forces in Kigali in order to manage several humanitarian missions that UNAMIR was trying to organise with the army chief of staff, the ministry of defence and the civil defence forces in Kigali.  

I don't think it's necessary for us to go through all the documentation, but if we were to look at 
Dallaire's statement and go through these documents systematically -- and this is the whole collection of documents that we have in this tab D -- I think what we would conclude is that there were at least 
five different meetings between the self-defence forces in Kigali and UNAMIR and various 
FAR personalities starting on the 24th of April, 13th of May, 14th of May, 15th of May, 17th of May.  Do you have any information about that or any reason to question what I have suggested to you or dispute what I have suggested to you? 
A.	No.  First of all, I was not made aware of these meetings.  Everyone now knows what my role was from the 12th of April -- to be more precise, on the 18th of May.  But it is also known what I did from the 20th of April.  Therefore, I was not aware, neither was I informed of these meetings. 

Secondly, if UNAMIR was dealing with people in Kigali that were defending their town, I do not see how this has a link with the Interahamwe, because UNAMIR also met the préfet, met other people who are not mentioned here.  UNAMIR met people who were defending their town.  And if Interahamwes were among those defending their town, that would not be surprising because they lived in Kigali. 

But I should also add that these people, if the Chamber and the Prosecutor remember the film entitled "Small Kigali", it was UNAMIR who sort of made -- or socialised with these people.  They were practically comrades or friends.  So to talk of politics and to involve them in meetings, that was perfectly normal.  They were always together in this restaurant called Petit Kigali because there were officers of UNAMIR there. 

Mr. President, I think the Prosecutor should allow me to complete my answers. 
So far I don't think my answers have been too long as to disturb the Chamber.  Please, can the Prosecution allow me to complete my answers.  Moreover, I was going to -- I was about -- completing my answer, but the Prosecutor seems to be impatient. 

I am saying that these UNAMIR officers socialised constantly with these people at the restaurant called "Petit Kigali".  It is, therefore, not surprising that they spoke about these matters.  But that does not mean that these were people who were in charge of the whole town, were in charge of the 
civil defence operation.  No.  It was a link, a social link that had been created.  

Of course, Dallaire already knew Robert.  Everyone knew Robert Kajuga.  Dallaire had known him for a long time.  He was the chairman of the provisional committee of the Interahamwe.  So this is not surprising.  But that does not involve the entire organisation in the Interahamwe simply because there were a few members of the committee there.  They are not even in the majority. 

How many of them were there, moreover?  Three.  Just three. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	So I will ask my question again.  If it could be demonstrated that the leaders of the civil defence in Kigali were Kajuga, Maniragaba, Rutaganda and Nkezabera, wouldn't it be reasonable to conclude that the Interahamwe were controlling -- were managing the civil defence in Kigali?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I would like to object to that question.  Yes, it's right for the Prosecutor to test the credibility of the witness, but this is the fifth time that he is speculating.  The Prosecution has been speculating.  The witness has not refused to go along with the Prosecution. 

The role that he attributes to these individuals -- well, he talks about the role -- or, rather, he should talk about the role and ask the questions immediately, or he should accept the answers given to him in view of the speculation. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, I don't think it's a question of speculation.  It's a question of having the witness answer the question that was asked of him.  I have asked him the same question three times.  I haven't gotten an answer to the question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the witness can answer the question. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I will repeat it one more time for you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  If it could be demonstrated that the leaders of the civil defence in Kigali were Kajuga, Maniragaba, Rutaganda and Nkezabera, would it be reasonable to conclude that the Interahamwe were managing the civil defence in Kigali? 
A.	Mr. President, I have already answered that question.  To my knowledge, as of the 25th of May, there was no civil defence.  Perhaps there were people who were defending their houses, their town, their families, but there was no civil defence programme.  Therefore, I cannot be told that people who are defending their families had a programme, had a structure, an entity.  And I am saying why the 
	officers of UNAMIR were meeting the three persons mentioned here.  It is because they socialised in the restaurant called Mon Petit Kigali.  That's all.  It was not a matter of a civil defence programme.  Not at all. 

That is the answer that I am giving the Prosecutor but which he doesn't want to accept.  But I do not have any other answer to that question. 
Q.	Okay.  We will come back to that.  I will move on to something else now. 

There are a series of photos that I would like you to have a look at, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  These were disclosed on a CD-ROM to the Defence at the beginning of the week, and I just want to go through them very quickly and get some feedback from you, Mr. Ngirumpatse. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I think I will need the assistance of the video technicians.  We do have it set up on the monitor here. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Do you recognise the image there?  I'll suggest to you that it's the CND building in Kigali and that's the main boulevard that passes in front of the CND.  
A.	The main boulevard in front of the CND?  
Q.	That's the parliament building in the distance, and this is the -- 
A.	I can see.  Yes, it is the main building, the big building. 
Q.	And that's it again as the vehicle approaches the building; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The third photograph is another view of the same building from the main thoroughfare in front of it, the CND building; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that's the main entrance booth to the CND complex.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Here you have a view from the top of CND looking out over to the supreme court.  Would you agree? 
A.	The supreme court?  Which supreme court?  
Q.	Perhaps it was another building in 1994, but you can see the plateau which forms part of the 
	parliament building.  Can you recognise that? 
A.	I see a big building taller than the others.  I do not know whether that is what you referred to as the supreme court building. 
Q.	What I am referring to now is the lower right-hand corner where you see a sort of plateau and 
	street lamps.  Isn't that the landing in front -- or the area in front of the parliament building? 
A.	Yes.

1145H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And this is a panorama that I'm showing you with three or four pictures in succession of what you see standing on top of the hill.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Here we are looking towards the second entrance to the CND; right?  Isn't that the entrance that goes down the hill on the other side of the CND building? 
A.	So far, yes.  I'm following you.  
Q.	And as this is a view of the same side entrance of the CND building -- this is not the main entrance, this is the side entrance; would you agree? 
A.	Yes.  Yes.  
Q.	And that's what you see -- that's the part of the CND complex that you see if you're going up the hill from that side entrance.  Would you agree to that? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	All right.  The building that you see in the middle of that photograph, isn't that the hotel or the residential complex where the RPF delegation was cantoned after the RPF contingent arrived in Kigali on the 28th of December 1993? 
A.	Yes.  There was a hotel inside the complex.  
Q.	And that's the photograph of the hotel; is it not? 
A.	Yes.  Well, I do not know what it looks like now because this photograph must be recent.  This photograph doesn't date back to 1994.  This is a recent photograph.  But I have no reason to doubt it so far.  
Q.	Even if the photograph is recent, that was the location -- or that is actually the building that was there in 1994 when the RPF was resident in Kigali at the CND complex.  Isn't that the building where they were housed? 
A.	I have already said that I have no reason to doubt this.  
Q.	That's another view of the same building where the RPF was head -- was -- was cantoned when the contingent was moved to Kigali in late December 1993.  Would you agree with me that that building was separated from the rest of the CND by a barricade?  That you could not go from that building into the parliament hall while the RPF was cantoned there?  No one from the parliament building could get over to where that hotel is and no one from that hotel could get over to where the parliament building was; right? 
A.	No.  Do not ask me how the buildings were arranged inside the complex because, as soon as the RPF arrived, we only had access to the main entrance of the CND.  That is all.  
Q.	That's actually the point I was trying -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	That's the information I was trying to elicit from you.  When the RPF arrived, you only had access to the main hall and the main entrance.  You could not use the side entrance and you could not have access to this hotel building; right? 
A.	It depended.  It depended.  For those who wanted to see people at the CND, they could go up to that point.  
Q.	Anyone who wanted to visit with the RPF would have to enter on the side entrance, and they would have to get through the UNAMIR soldiers that were at the perimeter.  And they were monitored to gain access.  And the RPF was monitored if they wanted to leave that building which was shut off from the rest of the complex.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	No, no.  That was what was said, monitoring, but we know that RPF troops also went out whenever they wanted.  So I think we should be more moderate in our language.  Normally, yes, but checking or monitoring, I doubt that.  
Q.	My concern is not with monitoring the persons going in and out.  My concern is with who had access to what parts of the CND complex.  And I ask you these questions because there's been a suggestion from Defence witnesses that the RPF and the opposition boycotted the swearing-in ceremony on the 5th of January 1994.  And my suggestion to you is that the RPF contingent had to exit the CND compound through the side exit and go around to the front entrance, which we looked at previously, in order to gain entrance to the parliament hall.  Wouldn't you agree? 
A.	No.  We cannot agree because I am not aware of how they went out or came into the CND building.  I do not know.  I do not know how they came in.  I do not know.  
Q.	Well, presumably, they would have to go through the same entrance that you did, the front entrance, because there was a barricade between this hotel and the rest of the complex.  They could leave through the side entrance that gave access to that hotel.  But in order to get into the CND, they would have to go through the front entrance that we looked at earlier in the first series of pictures, which is the same entrance that you would have to go through.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	No.  I do not know.  I have said that I do not know whether that is the way it happened.  
Q.	What other way could it have happened if there was a barricade separating this hotel from the rest of the complex? 
A.	I do not know if there was a barricade.  What I'm trying to explain, Mr. President, is that the Prosecutor perhaps has visited this site.  What I can say is that before the arrival of the RPF contingent, it was possible to gain access to the hotel from the -- from the plenary room of the parliament.  In fact, receptions could even be offered there at the hotel.  But going through -- or going from the reception room of the parliament, you could go directly to the hotel without having to go out.  That is what I know.  

Now, the description you are giving me, I'm not aware of it.  
Q.	On the 5th of January 1994, was the RPF contingent present at the CND plenary room in order to be sworn in as part of the putting in place of the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	I think I saw a few soldiers around the room, that is, RPF soldiers.  But since I did not know the delegates -- or RPF members of parliament or delegates, I cannot tell you that they were present.  But there were RPF soldiers who were around the parliament.  I saw them on the morning of the 5th of January.  
Q.	I understood it to be part of your defence that the PL delegates and the MDR delegates and the RPF delegates that were to be sworn in boycotted the swearing-in, and that's the reason why the BB -- the broad-based transitional government could not be implemented.  Is that not the position that you take on that issue? 
A.	But the fact that there were RPF soldiers around does not -- or did not mean that the RPF delegates were there.  But the situation is the following:  There were members of parliament from the PSD party, the MDR party, the PL party and the MRND party, of course.  There were also members of parliament from the other political parties.  But since there were still problems within the MDR, and also within the Parti libéral, I believe also in the PSD -- the PSD also had some problems, so not everyone was there.  

However, I think that RPF delegates, it is probable that they did not come.  I think they did not come.  But the fact that I was able to see some RPF soldiers -- well, there were still problems within those political parties.  Therefore, some political parties, in particular the MDR and the Parti libéral, the 
PL party, had members of parliament whom others did not agree or accept.  So this was not complete; it was something that was not moving on well.  

In any case, after the president was sworn in, he invited everyone to come together at 3 p.m.  And at 3 p.m., neither the designated prime minister, nor the sitting prime minister, nor the RPF, nor the PSD and many others were present.  And that is why it was not possible for us to continue.  
Q.	And what I'm suggesting to you is that the reason those delegates were not present is because they were not allowed access to the CND complex, which we see from the main entrance point, which is now what you see on the monitor.  That's the main entrance there, isn't it?  That's one of the 
first photographs we looked at.  That's where all the delegates would have to pass through in order 
to get into the plenary room, as you've described it.  

And from what I understand, you claim that the PL and the MDR and the RPF boycotted the swearing-in.  And the Prosecution has always maintained that they were prevented from getting in because of the soldiers and the Interahamwe that were at that main entrance prevented them from having access.  

So you'd agree with me that anybody that wanted to get into the plenary room would have to go through that main entrance that's pictured on the video screen now.  
A.	I am simply surprised that you place the Interahamwe at this point.  That was impossible.  There was the Presidential Guard, there was the gendarmerie, but no civilian could have access up to this point. No one -- unless they had an invitation card, and whoever had an invitation card was able to enter.  

I regret very much that the Prosecution continues maintaining this theory, but it was not possible for a civilian who did not have an invitation card to cross the main road in order to have access to this point.  It was impossible.  Therefore, I do not believe in that story, according to which the Interahamwe prevented members of parliament from getting in.  This is not a serious theory.  There was the Presidential Guard, the gendarmerie and even UNAMIR.  So it was only uniformed people.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, even if it was only uniformed people, even if it was only the Presidential Guard, those uniformed people did not allow the PL delegates to have access to the plenary room.  That's essentially the point I'm making.  We can -- we can remove the Interahamwe from the equation.  

What I'm suggesting to you is that the only persons that could get inside to take the oath of office are those that were allowed past the Presidential Guard at that entrance point.  It's a small point.  We can go on to something else.  But it's simply what I wanted to elicit from your testimony.  And I think you've indicated as much, that that was the main entrance and that was the only way to get access to the plenary room.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	No, no.  The problem is not at that level.  There was always a member of state protocol -- invitation cards were issued by this department of state protocol.  Whoever had an invitation card could pass.  But I believe -- and I think it is easy to understand that for people who were assigned to ensure the security of the building and of the people who were there, if you did not have an invitation card, you could not enter.  That is probably what happened.  

I heard of that later on when I returned -- well -- or, rather, when I entered this courtroom with Judge Laïty Kama at the beginning of our trial when I received documents.  

But this problem, according to which people were prevented from entering, did not catch 
anyone's attention in Kigali for the good reason that if one did not have an invitation card, that person could not enter.  I believe the role of the protocol service and the guards, whoever they may be, 
is that -- to prevent intruders from entering a building where people of a high level -- where 
important people were meeting.  That is my understanding.  

But as I said, there were invitation cards.  I myself was given an invitation card which I had to show at the entrance, and I was allowed to pass.  
Q.	We'll move on to some -- we'll move on.  

When President Habyarimana took the oath of office, which started the transition to the broad-based transitional government, the failure to swear in the rest of the cabinet and the 
transitional national assembly created an impasse in governmental affairs in Rwanda.  Isn't that so? 
A.	Yes.  I have already stated that there were a number of problems in some political parties.  And, yes, of course.  
Q.	Fundamentally, the dispute that caused this paralysis in government was the split in the MDR and the PL, because each side of the party that had been split into competing factions claimed that its delegates were the ones that should be seated in the transitional national assembly; right?  Isn't that what you're talking about, the problems in the party?  
A.	Yes.  At the level of the government and at the level of the national assembly, there was disagreement among members of parliament.  There was disagreement with the ministers, either in terms of the names or the various positions.  In fact, the Arusha Accords had already specified which positions or which portfolios were going to which party.  But the problem was about the persons to be designated to take up those portfolios, and some conflicts arose within parties in that connection.  
Q.	Yes.  And concerning that split -- or these competing claims on who would occupy those seats in the national assembly, President Habyarimana supported one side of the PL, and the RPF supported the other side.  And it was a continuing dispute over who would be seated in the national assembly that prevented the broad-based transitional government from being set up.  

Isn't that an accurate summary of the main problem with implementing the broad-based transitional government after the 5th of January 1994? 
A.	No.  No.  The problem did not arise at the level of the president.  The problem was within the parties.  There were factions within the parties pitted against each other.  So the problem was not at the level of the president or the chairman -- or, the president, rather.  If the parties had agreed, there would not have been any difficulty with the president.  

It is problems that arose with political parties and not with the president.  If they had done like the MRND and tabled their lists of members of parliament and ministers, that would have been easy.  It is because they were selfish and undemocratic that these problems arose.  It was internal personal squabbles within the party that -- within the parties that were the problem.  

It was not an issue of the president as such.  And, of course, I am not defending him.  But let me say that here and now I must tell the truth as to how things unfolded at that time.  
Q.	Well, my understanding -- and this comes not just from my conjecture but from the testimony of witnesses and the evidence -- the documentary evidence that we've amassed in this trial, particularly the commentary from Filip Reyntjens and the various memoranda from the prime minister, 
Agathe Uwilingiyimana, and the president -- well, the president's office under the name of -- under the signature of Enoch Ruhigira -- was that President Habyarimana was willing to accept the delegates that were appointed by the Mugenzi faction of the PL and would not accept the delegates that had been appointed or named by the Lando faction.  

And it was a continuing dispute over which list of delegates could be seated that led to this delay in implementing the broad-based transitional government.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	No, not at all.  I think that is a distortion.  All things are distorted when it comes to these proceedings.  

Now, this was the thinking of the president.  The political parties are legal entities represented by individuals.  He was ready and willing to accept representatives -- members of parliament and ministers represented or designated by the legal representatives of the political parties.  And in this particular instance, it was Mugenzi for the PL and Twagiramungu for the MDR -- Twagiramungu who, at the Kabusunzu congress, was dismissed from the party as well as Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  

But Twagiramungu took the case to court.  And when the president was assassinated, I believe that the courts had not yet come to a determination.  

In any event, the president's position was to rely on legality in order to accept any persons that were designated.  To my mind, that was the best approach.  But no one wanted to accept that approach because the RPF said that its interests -- or that it had a moral duty to defend the interests of the Liberal Party represented by Landouald Ndasingwa.  

But in any event, between Mugenzi and Ndasingwa, the PL had already found a solution to their problems, and the difficulty arose rather from the RPF, which threatened Ndasingwa.  That is the explanation that I can offer.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you for your response.  We'll move on.  In any case, the Chamber will have an opportunity to go through all the documentation, and it can make its own assessment if it thinks it's important for the issues in this trial.  The volume of documents on this issue is quite extensive, so we don't have to resolve this issue through you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  

But what I'd suggest to you is that one of the great worries of President Habyarimana, in terms of how this newly constituted broad-based transitional government would be composed, was his fear that the opposition parties could build a coalition within the transitional assembly, and bring him up on charges of human rights abuses against the former Kayibanda regime for the crimes that were allegedly committed when he came to power in the mid-'70s. 

Wasn't that a concern, that without a blocking minority, the MRND would expose the president?  Where the president could be exposed to being brought before the supreme court? 
A.	Categorically, my answer is no.  When he signed the Arusha Accords and I signed the code of ethics myself, which was appended to the Arusha Accords, the MRND had already accepted the accords as they were.  Had there not arisen problems, we were ready to go through the transition up to the elections.  

That is what Witness PTR stated here when he testified on what I said at the Hôtel Méridien to our party members and anyone else who wanted to listen to us.  We had already agreed to work in that context of marginalisation for 22 months.  It was not too serious.  We had tabled our list of members of parliament and list of ministers without any complexity.  

So I do not agree with that hypothesis.  I do not agree to your theory of fear of anything whatsoever.  
Q.	Well, let's have a look at the letter that you wrote to Habyarimana in 1992.  I think you still have that in front of you.  It's what we looked at earlier, P. 285, or did -- maybe Mr. Issa brought it back to me.  
Hold on for one second.  

Do you still have the letter that you wrote to Habyarimana before you, Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, I do.  Yes.  Yes, I do.  
Q.	Look at the first paragraph.  This is the letter of the 23rd of November 1992.  
A.	I'm there.  
Q.	What you say at that first paragraph:  

"Nobody seems to be interested in the restoration of the Supreme Court.  Yet, that operation must be linked to the proposal to elect a new interim president at the expiration of your mandate.  Ngurinzira is making such a proposal because, in a spirit of revenge, the MDR has always planned to bring you before the Supreme Court to be tried, thereby shutting you out of the electoral campaign."  

And then you continue.  

This is the advice you're giving to President Habyarimana back in November of 1992 as the Arusha Accords were being negotiated.  Wasn't this one of the concerns that you had, at least, when you were advising the president in relation to the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Yes.  I was drawing his attention to that provision, and that is it.  One year after, things had changed, not only with the opposition, particularly the MDR, but also on our part.  When we signed, we were 
fully aware of the existence of this provision.  If the parties had not split into factions, nothing would have stood in the way of the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  

So this is a letter of November 1992.  The Arusha Accords were signed on the 4th of August 1993, here in Arusha.  So these things were already behind us.  We had accepted -- in other words, we had already accepted, given that we had negotiated, we were able to obtain the little that we could obtain as the MRND party.  But we were ready to move forward with the transition towards the elections.  

Now, on any other point, a question could have been raised even if they were not in the majority because there was a need for a two-thirds majority for the instrument to pass.  But at that time, we were not concerned by this.  So it would be a mistake to attempt to link my letter to the situation that happened -- the situation that happened within political powers.  And that, to my mind, is only a matter of personal ambition -- personal ambition within the political parties.  

So, Mr. President, I've already explained that our party was saved because the four members of the steering committee did not accept a position of minister.  So if they were going to share five positions out of which four were already taken up, then our party also would have run into problems.  

We, in our case, allowed the grass roots to determine who would be minister and who would be a member of parliament.  It was not the steering committee which did so.  The mistake that the other political parties made was to grab the positions for themselves.  That is the answer I can provide.  
Q.	My suggestion -- my suggestion to you is that this isn't an issue that was resolved back in 1992 when you wrote that letter advising the president.  I think it was a live issue going into 1994.  Because it was in your interest -- or in the interests of the president and the MRND to split the opposition so that there would be no coalition that could possibly bring him before the supreme court.  

It's the same issue that was motivating President Habyarimana to block the implementation of the broad-based transitional government, unless he was assured of a block in the minority.  Isn't that the case? 
A.	No.  That is not the case.  That is what enemies of the MRND or of President Habyarimana would like to have -- that is what they would wish for.  But I have given you the real reasons for which it was not possible for the transitional institutions to be set up, and the reason is personal ambitions.  But when things deteriorate because of such circumstances, no one will agree that they had decided to hang on to a number of ministries.  So what they did is they looked for a scapegoat.  They looked for a scapegoat far away -- far, far away in order to avoid their own responsibilities.  

Now, what I am saying is that, as chairman of our party, we transcended these things.  We were above the fray and there was no reason to be afraid.  I have already told you that I organised a 
press conference at the Méridien hotel to explain these things to our party members.  
Q.	Is it your position that the MRND supported the Arusha Accords and supported the implementation of the broad-based transitional government? 
A.	Yes, of course.  
Q.	Didn't the MRND lose power by virtue of those same Arusha Accords?  Your role in government was significantly diminished because of the Arusha Accords, wasn't it? 
A.	Mr. President, this is what I have been saying for a long time now.  That is the explanation I've been providing.  That is a reality.  It is true that we lost many ministerial positions, but we accepted that position.  We were ready to live with it.  We were always agreed with the Arusha Accords, starting from the speech of 15th November 1992, in Ruhengeri, when we agreed with the negotiations and the outcome being the Arusha Accords.  So that is -- that is a given.  

From the time the MRND as a single party disappeared, then it became obvious that there was to be competition with other political parties, except for those who were not open-minded; otherwise, people would understand that -- people who were open-minded would understand that the political game had changed where one could win, just like one could lose.  

As for the steering committee of the MRND, we were perfectly comfortable with that new dispensation. And that is why when we took leadership of the party neither myself, as chairman, nor Karemera, as first vice-president, nor Kabagema, as second vice-president, nor Joseph Nzirorera took a salary for those positions.  We provided voluntary services -- and I had to open a law firm in order to be able to survive.  You see, I did not even personally want or insist to be part of the government.  

Therefore, this suspicion -- this suspicion or allegation is baseless.  
Q.	What I'd suggest to you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, is even if you look at MINADEF, the ministry of defence, which the MRND was able to retain under the Arusha Accords -- your party still lost out even with the military because the military was going to be fused in a manner that you deemed disadvantageous to the FAR and to your party.  

Wasn't there very strident criticism of the Arusha Accords because of the way the army was going to be demobilised and fused with the RPF? 
A.	First of all, I have explained already that this ministry was actually a burden, a ministry that would have to prosecute the war, manage deserters, and also deal with people disabled by the war.  

Secondly, I am rather scandalised that we expressed our opinions and our points of view during the negotiations.  What are negotiations meant for?  Negotiations are meant to bring parties to the table -- to the discussion table and expression -- and ideas are expressed and consensus is sought.  

That is what happened.  So nobody should be scandalised that we put forth our ideas during the negotiation.  What else could we have done?  What does the Prosecutor expect that we should have done at those negotiations?  Just go in, sit down and accept everything without any discussion?  If that were the case, it would no longer be negotiations.  It would simply be a dictatorship.  

What actually happened was that we went in, negotiated, discussed a few things and 
sought agreement.  That is the purpose for which negotiations take place.  We criticised things.  We even snubbed from time to time.  From time to time we even cried.  And yet all of that is part of the negotiation process, which we took to the very end.  And I am proud of that.  I'm proud that we did that.  We understand what negotiations are.  We understand what consensus is all about.  And the role is -- the -- the rule is for one to respect conventions and agreements once they have been entered into.  
So my answer is as follows -- it's what I have stated.  
Q.	All right.  We'll move forward.  From the 5th of January going all the way to April, when the war 
started up again, there was a constant back and forth between the president, the opposition parties, the prime minister, UNAMIR became involved, the Tanzanians became involved as facilitators.  But the issue was how to get the broad-based transitional government implemented.  We can agree on that much; can't we?  Nothing I've said is controversial.  That was the situation back in the beginning of 1994.  
A.	Granted.  However, you must include the president as one of those who made efforts because I believe that he, too, made some efforts at that time.  
Q.	At some point in February 1994, Lando -- Landouald Ndasingwa wrote a letter to President Habyarimana to complain about the failure to implement the broad-based transitional government.  And it was copied to all of the presidents of the various political parties, including the MRND.  So it would have been copied to you.  Do you recall having received that letter?  

We've discussed it before in this trial; it's identified as P. 502 in our record.  We used it in the cross-examination of Colonel Bagosora.  Do you know the letter I'm talking about, Mr. Ngirumpatse?  It's a letter where Lando complains about why the broad-based transitional government is not being implemented and the danger that that presented to the country.  

Did you receive that letter back in 1994? 
A.	I think so, but I'm not sure.  You know, with time, one can forget about a number of letters, especially when such serious events took place.  I have no reason to deny that he may have sent the letter to me.  But in any event, I read the letter while here.  
Q.	In any case, at page 4 of that letter, paragraph 18 -- because he's enumerated the paragraphs in his letter -- what he told the president and indirectly you, Mr. Ngirumpatse, is that it was noticed that every time a section of the Arusha Accords was signed, there were attacks against the innocent population, as he described it.  

And in the letter -- or, at least, in that paragraph, he says that now with the spectre of civil war casting a pall over the whole nation, especially in the capital, some folks wonder if the same thing is going to happen with the final implementation of the Arusha Accords.  

Thinking about Lando's concerns in February 1994, doesn't -- don't they seem rather prescient now in light of the massive killings that took place in April of 1994, when the war started up again? 
A.	No.  Mr. President, the Prosecutor has talked about the involvement of Tanzania.  But let me draw the attention of the Trial Chamber to the press release by Minister Rwegasira, whom I have already talked about.  

When he attempted to put order into the PL, that is, Landouald Ndasingwa's party, he blamed the RPF for torpedoing the agreement between Mugenzi and Landouald.  So this is the delegate of the mediator who places blame squarely on the RPF.  And now we are using it against the MRND.  I do not understand this.  

Secondly, we had agreed between the political parties and the RPF to set up the transitional institutions on the 22nd or 23rd of February 1994.  

On the 21st, the RPF murdered Gatabazi, one of the more high-profile ministers.  The result of that action was that we had to defer the swearing-in ceremony to a later date.  

On the 22nd, Martin Bucyana -- B-U-C-Y-A-N-A for Bucyana was murdered.  

The president and I had already said that on the 6th of April -- we had agreed with the 
director of cabinet that the institutions will be set up on the 8th of April.  

On the 6th, the president was assassinated.  And we know who did it.  Although some parties try to hide it -- or to hide that fact, we know who murdered the president.  So I think that we should not try to mask or cover the main perpetrator of this tragedy.  

These are the main reasons for which the institutional -- the transitional institutions were not set up.  The RPF wanted the Lando wing or faction to be part of the government, while the Mugenzi wing was left out.  That is what the Tanzanian minister of foreign affairs asserts in a document, which is already in evidence before this Trial Chamber.  Thank you, Mr. President.

1230H 
BY MR. WEBSTER: 
Q.	In any case, Mr. Ngirumpatse, some time around the 14th of February 1994, the RPF political leadership that had been housed in CND complex, left Kigali and went back to Mulindi, apparently in frustration when the broad-based transitional government could not be implemented.  Were you aware of that, back in February of 1994, talking about the fact that the political leadership that was to be sworn in and then left Kigali and went back to Mulindi? 
A.	That is not what I think.  I also have some information; namely, that they were going to a meeting there.  And we know what followed there.  It was the assassination of Gatabazi, Bucyana, and the assassination of the president.  The person who had an interest in seeing to it that the transition did not take place, that the elections did not take place, it was not the MRND, it was the RPF.  

	And the RPF has continued to fear elections even today, because what is taking place today in Rwanda is not elections.  I am not the only one to say that.  Everyone knows today that 93 percent of the votes is not genuine.  So we have divergent views on that point.  I regret for not being pleasant to you. 
Q.	You are aware of when the RPF political delegation left Kigali in February 1994.  
A.	I heard about, it but it was subsequently.  It was not on the same day.  It could be well after that. 
Q.	Was it before the 6th of April? 
A.	Of course, but when you hatch a plot, it is always before the commission of the crime.  So there's nothing surprising in that. 
Q.	My question was when you became aware of it.  I am not asking you anything about a conspiracy or a crime.  But I think you have answered my question.  

Were you aware -- or, did you become aware of a meeting on the 17th of February when General Ndindiliyimana requested to meet President Habyarimana along with the ministry -- excuse me, the ministry of defence or the chief of staff of the FAR, a meeting that we have discussed with other witnesses at least once or twice in this trial, when Ndindiliyimana attempts to pressure or raise concerns with President Habyarimana about the danger of war starting up again?  Did you know about that meeting back in 1994, in February? 
A.	No. 
Q.	The first time you learnt about it was here in this courtroom? 
A.	Certainly.  Yes, I think so.  I do not remember being aware of that meeting before my arrival here at the Tribunal. 
Q.	In any case, the concerns raised by Ndindiliyimana was that the FAR was in no position to go into war with the RPF, and that President Habyarimana should stop these delaying - stop the -- do what he could to implement the broad-based government -- transitional government as quickly as possible.  Had you had any similar information about the military strength or superiority of the RPF in relation to the reduced or limited capacities of the FAR as we approach April of 1994? 
A.	It would be very presumptuous on my part to say that I have knowledge of military matters, and no one informed me about the disproportion between the RPF forces and FAR forces.  I was not aware of such a situation. 
Q.	There has been evidence from other witnesses, witnesses with less political status or influence than you, that there was discussion within MRND circles of information provided by the 
	US State Department that the FAR was in no position to go back to war with the RPF because the RPF was likely to be militarily superior.  Did you ever have -- come in contact with information of that nature coming from the US State Department?  
A.	I think you should give me all the information.  Which witness are you referring to?  I would like to know the name of that witness, Mr. President, and the content of the witness's testimony. 
Q.	My recollection is that Witness GOB testified about being in meetings of the MRND, not necessarily in February of 1994.  I believe his testimony was that was ordinarily in that period, but the analysis was the same, that the FAR was not likely to prepare against the RPF if the war started again.  

	And let me say, Mr. Ngirumpatse, that that is not a very difficult assessment or a challenging assessment in view of the fact that the RPF basically overran the territory in February of 1993 and came within -- I think it's a stone's throw to Kigali in the February 1993 offences.  So just by virtue of the military advance in February 1993, it wouldn't be too difficult to assume that the FAR was not prepared to face war again, especially in light of the conditions that were laid down by the ceasefire agreement in March of 1993. 
A.	It would be presumptuous on my -- for me to -- that the FAR were not capable between 
	February 1993 and February 1994 to fight against the RPF.  You see the lapse -- the time that lapsed was one year, so perhaps the witnesses may have been corrected.  I have already said that,
	in fact, I was not an expert on military matters.  I did not follow them up properly because there were problems that concerned other people.  GOB did not specify where the meeting took place, whether I was present, who chaired the meeting.  Were MRND members in a position to make such an assessment?  I do not think so.  I do not think that members of the party at the time referred to were in a position to judge the relative strength of the FAR forces and the FAR.  

As regards the information or intelligence provided by United States State Department, I was not aware of such intelligence whilst in Rwanda. 
Q.	Let's review the terms of the March 1993 ceasefire.  And let me state that I am not a military expert either.  But you would agree with me that the March 1993 ceasefire agreement, under the terms of that agreement, the FAR could not recruit any more soldiers.  They couldn't buy any more weapons.  The government of Rwanda had to dismantle the civil-defence programme.  The government of Rwanda had to expel the French.  The French soldiers that had come in February 1993 are the only things that stopped the RPF from marching straight into Kigali.  

	So if the FAR could not re-arm and could not recruit, and had to -- and if the French had to leave, why would you think that one year later the FAR would be in a stronger position to fight the RPF, when the RPF was militarily dominant during that February 1993 advance? 
A.	But that is not an argument.  It is not because the French were leaving or that a ceasefire was signed on the foreign pressure; that what you are saying is true.  I am saying that I was not aware of that meeting between Ndindiliyimana and the president, and I would not know what the president's answer was.  

	From what I heard or learnt in this courtroom, the chief of staff of the FAR was at the meeting.  The minister of defence was at the meeting.  We are not told what they said.  Therefore, I cannot draw any conclusion on that basis.  Already they had signed that ceasefire agreement because they were moving towards a peace agreement.  And it was in the same year, a few months after that the peace agreement was signed.  But that does not mean much to me.  

	I could not conclude that the FAR were weak.  Problem -- or, rather, military problems, military matters were dealt with by other people.  It is in my habit to focus on my own work. 
Q.	Well, in any case, my suggestion to you is that Ndindiliyimana, at least, and not only him, but I think the officers of the FAR -- a significant sector of the FAR officer corps realised that if war broke out again, that the RPF would likely prevail.  I think that was the back trap that was going on in February, March and going into April, the beginning of April 1994.  

In any case, I would like to return to this last chapter in the following part of the Arusha Accords.  "Once the issue of the competing delegates within the PL and the MDR was resolved, all of a sudden inclusion of the CDR became an issue in order to implement the broad-based transitional government."  That was an issue that was raised by Habyarimana only on the 29th of March 1994; isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. President, I am not going to dwell on that question.  The diplomatic corps accredited to Kigali unanimously supported the entry of the CDR member of parliament in the national assembly.  The letter signed by ambassadors accredited to Kigali was brought to the attention of the president of the republic by Mr. Booh-Booh himself.  

	How could the chairman of the MRND be responsible for that problem or matter?  It was the diplomatic corps, to avoid anyone being left out, which asked that the CDR take up its seat in the national assembly.  There were obstructions by the RPF which could not be understood.  So it was the diplomatic corps and UNAMIR, the representative of the United Nations Secretary General, who supported the entry of the CDR in the transitional national assembly.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, you were here in this courtroom when Booh-Booh testified, and in his trial testimony and in his witness statement of 1995, he himself states that he viewed the new insistence by the CDR as a last-minute provocation from President Habyarimana, that only came up on the 29th of March 1994 as another impediment to the putting in place of the broad-based transitional government.  You don't recall that testimony from Booh-Booh? 
A.	But that is not the issue.  It could also be necessary for him to deny what I am saying; namely, that the diplomatic corps supported the CDR and that it was he, himself, who took the letter to the president.  If you compare my testimony and his testimony, the conclusion would be easy to arrive at.  That is easy.  
Q.	Did you challenge Booh-Booh when he testified to that effect, that the CDR issue came up as a last-minute blocking manoeuvre on the 29th of March, unexpected from President Habyarimana?  You were in this courtroom when he was testifying to that effect. 
A.	Was it necessary, since the documents speak for themselves?  He cannot deny his signature.  He cannot deny the fact that he personally took the letter to the president of the republic.  Moreover - first of all, Booh-Booh was not my witness.  And, secondly, I do not consider that as being a serious charge against me.  I have an indictment.  There are charges brought against me.  Now, if I have to -- if everything that didn't work must be attributed to me, that is something else.  But Booh-Booh did not deny his involvement in that CDR problem.  No one -- no diplomat who signed that document can deny that they supported the CDR's entry into the national transition assembly. 
Q.	I would like you to look at a document -- a letter from the RPF.  It's in tab R of my binder
MR. WEBSTER: 
Only available in French; it's only going to be in the French binders.

Mr. Issa, if you could hand this to the witness, please. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This is a letter dated the 5th of April 1994.  It's signed by Alexis Kanyarengwe, the president of the RPF -- of the RPF.  It's referenced as a complaint against Dr. Booh-Booh.  And if you look at the second -- fourth paragraph at the bottom of the page, page one, Kanyarengwe is complaining that Dr. Booh-Booh, just like President Habyarimana, is raising for the first time, on the 29th of March 1994, as a condition for the putting in place of the transitional institutions, the entry of the CDR into the transitional national assembly.  And then he has a reference, and then he goes on, and the final cause all of the impediments that he thinks are relevant to the discussion of why the Habyarimana regime is blocking the implementation of the broad-based transitional government.  

	Have you seen -- discussed this one before, or this is the first time that you are looking at something like this? 
A.	Whilst we were in Rwanda, I do not remember having received this document. 
Q.	Have you seen it since then, or this is the first time that you are seeing it? 
A.	Here, perhaps, here in Arusha, perhaps. 
Q.	Yes, but I am asking you, is it -- looking at it right now, is this the first time you are seeing it or have you seen this before? 
A.	In any case, I do not remember having read it in its entirety, and that is why I am surprised by some passages which I am not familiar with.  Therefore, I would request time to read it in full, so as to be able to answer your questions.  This letter is quite long or lengthy and I cannot address matters arising from it immediately.  I must acquaint myself with it.  

	Of course, with the leave of the Bench, I could return with this letter, so as to read it.  Then when I return, I would be in a position to answer your question tomorrow.  Because given the time left, I may not have -- I may not be able to read it and to make comments on it.  So I am seeking leave of the Court -- leave of the Bench to return with this document, which is quite lengthy, so as to be able to read it and, thereafter, answer the questions tomorrow. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I see the time -- I see that we are five minutes before one o'clock.  I don't think it would be a problem to stop now and pick up tomorrow, that's if with the Court's approval.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we expect some comment on the request of the witness.  What was -- what's on our mind - and may I ask you.  Maybe that's why I am asking you.  In light of the order that we had made already, he will be able to discuss this letter with his lawyers  because -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Oh, I have no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ah. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Microphone, please.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no objection to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
In that case, the request is granted.  

	And we take our adjournment now until tomorrow.  
(Court adjourned at 1255H)
