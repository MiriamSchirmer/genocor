MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Welcome to Courtroom III.  

Mr. Registrar, can you commence the opening of the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, the 25th of October 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecution versus Karemera et al,                      Case Number ICTR 98-44T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 

Well, I can state that the appearances are the same as before; yes, the appearances are the same.

Yes, Mr. Robinson, we have just a little bit under one hour this morning as we have to break for the other witness.  

Mr. Witness, we are going to have to stop your testimony, no matter what happens, just before            10 o'clock this morning, as we have something else to do from 10 o'clock.  You will have to stand by; you may have to stand by to come back in the afternoon, but we will explain that to you just before we end your testimony this morning.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning and good morning members of the trial chamber.  I want to welcome back my colleague, Ms. Hounkpatin.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  I wish to correct your introduction saying that the teams remain the same.  I have joined our team this morning to represent Mathieu Ngirumpatse as had been expected as of Friday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  You must forgive me; I didn't recognise you or notice your attendance this morning.  So welcome back this morning, we are glad to have you back in our chamber. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Thank you.

WITNESS AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza (Kinyarwanda spoken).  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson.  You yourself know that the news isn't good.  Sometimes you have to speak the truth, but I am here, otherwise, the news is not good. 
Q.	What are you referring to? 
A.	The President prevented me from delving into these matters; we will come back to them later.  I believe we can proceed with why we are here and avoid delving into those issues right now. 
Q.	Okay.  I'm going to continue and ask you about the events after your resignation of -- your letter of resignation.  So you took that letter of resignation that you submitted to the MRND to the other political parties; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, I believe I am having a problem -- unless other people are having problems with their headset, I didn't hear anything.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, can you repeat your answer; I didn't have any power in my headset? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, Counsel; that is what I said. 
Q.	And your letter of resignation was published in the newspapers of the opposition parties; is that correct? 
A.	There were comments -- or commentary on that letter, journalists made comments on that letter.  The letter was written in French.  And at the time the newspapers that were appearing then were written in Kinyarwanda, but as I have already explained, the newspaper Isibo Rwanda Rushya and Ibuka reported on this letter.  Furthermore, Radio Muhabura of the RPF also made mention of it.  I'm speaking about that time, that period of time. 
Q.	And do you have copies of any of the newspaper articles about your letter? 
A.	I'm going to tell you that that was a long time ago; I believe I have mentioned to you that I have even lost some documents.  In 1994, I decided to throw away some of those documents; I'm referring to the documents concerning Rose Karushara.  A few moments ago I said Rose Karabuya (phonetic), but that was a confusion on my part, and I do apologise to that person.  I am, indeed, referring to                   Rose Karushara and not Rose Karabuya (phonetic).  So that is a situation regarding that situation.  

There are many documents which I threw away, and I got rid of them for security reasons. 
Q.	So, the answer to my question is that you don't have any of the -- the newspaper articles about your resignation? 
A.	Yes.  But you can try to find documents yourself; there are documents here and there.  You know, I didn't know that this Tribunal was going to be established for me to be able to keep such documents.  The fact remains that I am here and the letter which I wrote at the time is also there.  

With regard to what I was saying yesterday, there is something else which I wanted to explain, because yesterday we didn't finish with this matter; we said that we were going to come back to the letter.  So, now, let me explain that point to you, if you allow me, because I have noticed that you are looking for the truth, obviously.  At certain occasions the presiding Judge will ask me to limit myself to just a few explanations.  But since you have asked me the question, if you allow me, I can continue and provide you with further information. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I am going to allow you to give all of the information that you think is relevant, but I just -- let's stick to the point.  I was just asking if you had the document.  There is no problem if you don't have it.  I'm not expecting you to have saved everything, don't -- please don't feel defensive about that.  It is just a question, yes or no; you have the document or you don't.  Now, what would you like to say about your letter of resignation? 
A.	I said a moment ago that you are in search of the truth.  I would wish, furthermore, that all lawyers behave in like manner, because you are looking for the truth and that is obvious, it is evident.  

With regard to the letter, I mentioned further down in that document the following: "National Secretary, can the Interahamwe remain a body of the party and not become a youth wing thereof?"  Why did I express myself in like manner?  I wanted to say that the MRND had just established -- established something new within itself and that it was not a youth wing per se.  That was the meaning -- or the intent of what I said in trying to explain what had happened.  If we were to take, for instance, the minister for youth, the person known as Nzabonimana, Callixte, who came from Gitarama.  He was the representative of the MRND Gitarama.  So, I'm saying that this body attached to the MRND organisations such as Urama (phonetic) would probably also want to ask for affiliation to the party.  

As for the Interahamwe, this was an internal body of the MRND, and it was decided that it be called MRND Interahamwe youth.  And it was inculcated with the genocide ideology up to the point that they exterminated everyone.  And that is what happened.

Yesterday, you asked me -- or you said to me that there was no extremist element in the letter.  And I responded by saying to you that I had written that letter in order to show Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the national secretary and the others, that they had just established a body which was destined to exterminate the Rwanda population.  And with time, they strengthened that body -- I'm sorry, I was going to mention another proverb in a foreign language, but you know, when youths are sensitised in this manner, they become alienated mentally.  They sensitised the Interahamwe in order for them to exterminate people.  So, this was a point that we mentioned yesterday, but which you failed to understand.
Let's take a man like Pheneas Ruhumuliza and others; you cannot consider him or them as being members of the youth.  I remember one -- a friend named, Nkezabera.  These are people who are quite old; they are not youths.  There are other cases still.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse himself was a member of the Interahamwe.  Yes, because he was the one who established that body, and introduced it to the national congress.  It was, indeed, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I even remember the speech he made before the congress of the MRND.  

There was Item 4 on the agenda of the congress members.  There was a proposal for the establishment of that body.  And he presented, or introduced the Interahamwe body -- or organisation in order to have it established.  Later on they trained the youth in the handling of weapons and the youth was armed and many other things happened.  

As for publications which you referred to, please refer to the rally organised in Mburabuturo.  There was for instance, Mark Ruganira, who is presently manager of SORAS; there was also                      François Nduwumwe, I believe he is a senator in the present government, in Kagame's government, I mean.  It is a government which is trying to teach people to love one another, but it is a difficult task.  It is a painful job.  

You know, in Kigali people do not hate themselves, they try to live peacefully.  Listen, I'm not the spokesman of that government.  I'm asking you to seek the truth.  If that government were to act as the previous government, I would denounce it.  I would say that this government of Kagame is beginning to behave in a manner which is not acceptable.  Today we are not trying to find out who these people are, where they come from, and what have you; but what I am telling you is that these people have sown bad seeds.  Mr. Robinson, I'm trying to show you the truth.

Sometimes one feels the need to explain at length in order not to be merely content with a yes or no answer.  This is why people need to be provided with the opportunity to explain themselves.  Because you want to know what had happened, Mr. Robinson, for you to know the role of these people who were sitting by you, I couldn't tell you sincerely that I couldn't say nothing about Nzirorera.  I know he was appointed to such and such a post at the ministry, but I can't say more than that.  As for Mathieu, what I know is that I cannot say that I saw Nzirorera beside me anywhere at any particular event.  I do not think that I strayed from the content of the letter.

When that body was established, I was there.  I was a witness.  Maybe in order to illustrate         Mathieu Ngirumpatse's extremism, I'm going to tell you something.  Someone came to the third meeting; this is still in relation to the letter; that man was beaten up, severely beaten up.  And Mathieu ordered that that man, that young man, because he was a Tutsi, be removed from the meeting room.  He is a soldier presently.  These are examples that I am giving.  Ngirumpatse gave the order that he be removed from that location, and he was severely beaten.

In fact, the questions that you are putting to me remind me of other incidents too, which surround the establishment of this body.  So, this is what I had to tell you with regard to the publications you mentioned in relation to the body that was established.  Since you are seeking the truth,             Counsel Robinson, I needed to provide you this information.  

There is also another point concerning the choir we referred to, but I think maybe I will have the opportunity to come back to that later.  Further explanation -- explanations were not required of me.  There is the same thing that applies to the meeting of Cyasemakamba.  I have been prevented from explaining myself further on these matters.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I'm surprised to hear for the first time about the third meeting that someone was beaten and removed, since you have discussed these meetings at length in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005.  And this is the first mention you have ever made that Mathieu ordered some man who had been beaten to be removed from the third meeting in February 1992.  So I would wonder if you could give me the name of that man who was beaten. 
A.	I'm going to tell you why I mentioned him.  Yesterday you raised a matter in reference to the letter; I think that I didn't stray from the contents of the letter.  Sometimes because of the questions that you are putting to me, there is information which I recall, and I must provide that information because I have realised that you are looking for the truth.  I think that was the motivation behind your question.  You asked whether there was any information which shows of -- shows Mathieu's extremism in the letter.  And I haven't mentioned anything of that nature in the letter.  Are you with me, Mr. Robinson?  

	As when you asked questions, of me I remember quite a lot of other information because I presume that one question leads to another.  And for me, each time you ask me a question, this assists me in remembering other information, information which may illustrate the extremism of this man         Mathieu Ngirumpatse and his collaborator.  That is the only reason.  Because when you asked me questions, you also have to expect me to answer you.  Are you with me, Mr. Robinson, because I realise that you, you want to know exactly what happened?  You want to know the truth.  I can see that are you surprised. It is obvious.  It is evident, because I'm providing you information following questions that you are putting to me.

You shouldn't think -- I don't know how to put this.  I'm not inventing -- what I am saying is I'm not inventing anything.  And I am remembering things, events which occurred.  But now as for this individual, I wouldn't be able to locate him today because he is working within the army.  I wouldn't be able to locate him.  But the fact remains that the incident took place.  Inyange za Général, this is a group that they brought out.  And the person, I remember him very well, and he belonged to the group of the Interahamwe known as Inyange za Général.  The person was nicknamed, Spark.  
Q.	And do you know his name? 
A.	No, I don't remember the name.  In fact, the name was never mentioned.  I remember what he looked like.  If I were to go back to Kigali and I were to meet him, I would really encourage him to come and meet you because you are wanting to see him.  As for his name, I do not -- I do not know his name.  His name was not mentioned.  
Q.	Well, let's return to the use of your resignation letter that you made.  And I understand that in addition to having it published in the opposition newspapers, you also read it out at a meeting of the PSD; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	And you yourself joined the PSD party after you resigned from MRND, correct? 
A.	That is correct, Mr. Robinson, but I didn't hold any position.  Furthermore, when I joined PSD, I was looking for protection because I wanted to ensure that if some misfortune would befall me, somebody would know, but I didn't hold any political office within that party.  Let me remind you, Mr. Robinson, that some of those events that took place at the time happened, and we need to know how we came to the establishment of the power wing.  Do you know one François Ndungutse, who was the member of the PSD?  I think there is someone else whose name, I believe, was Hyacinthe, do you know these people by any chance?  Do you know them?  Do the names ring a bell, because I want to make sure about that, because otherwise I would like to speak about them?  
Q.	Yes, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I am familiar with those names, but what I would like to do right now is to have you shown a document by the registrar and to try to admit this as an exhibit.  
MR. ROBINSON:
So, let me ask the registrar is permission and of the Trial Chamber could if I have the witness shown a copy of what he earlier provided as the card from the PSD party.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, you gave us, during your last visit here in September, the original PSD membership card that you obtained in 1992, it was photocopied by the registry, front and the back, and even the button that you had was photocopied.  And what I placed in front of you is what I received as the photocopy.  So is that, in fact, your PSD card?   
A.	Yes, that is correct, Mr. Robinson.  This is the card.  Nothing has changed on the card.  Sometimes people manipulate things, they change documents but I can see this one is, indeed, the same card that I had. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, I would offer this card as D. NZ46. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ46 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Before you give the card, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I just would like to have you look at it and I notice that it says "Agent of the state" in French, agent d'État or something like that.  In other words, it looks to me that on the face of the card your occupation was listed as an agent of the state; do you see that? 
A.	Yes, it was a ministerial decree appointing me to that position, it was still in forced.  Even today, that decree is still in force even if I work for a company today.  

I would like to talk to you about this.  And it is very logical.  And pardon me and to the interpreters, I don't know how to say that in Kinyarwanda, they say it is logical.  Here is the situation, when there is a presidential decree or a ministerial decree, take for example, Mathieu, at one point he was appointed an ambassador.  For thereafter for his entire life, he will be known as ambassador.  Now, let's talk about the agent of the state or civil servant; it is still in force.  I was appointed according to a ministerial decree.  Alexander Muterahejuru was minister of public -- of the civil service, rather, and he made the ministerial decree upon the request by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So if you look at that mention on the card, I can sometimes understand you.  You are looking for the truth.  But let me explain, I'm not inventing anything.  If I return to Kigali, I will send you a copy of that ministerial decree.  I had no idea we were going to talk about that document, but I will send it to you.  I will send it to the Tribunal and then they can disclose it to you.  That is the situation, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, do I understand you correctly that in June of 1992 when you went to the PSD and joined, that you represented yourself as a civil servant, referring to the post that you held at the ministry of justice for 18 days under Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	At the time I went to the PSD, I had just resigned from the MRND; the party of the killers, the party which organised the killings.  I was seeking protection.  I had no desire to be involved in that party's activities, but I am telling you there was a ministerial decree in force.  I don't understand why you don't understand this, why you don't understand that ministerial decree.  When I resigned from the MRND and I joined the PSD party, I worked for Petrorwanda.  I had a contract, a trial contract within Petrorwanda.  And, you know when you have that kind of contract you are on probation, as it were; you are not a full employee.  So I can't say that I was an employee of Petrorwanda.  I didn't have any documents to that effect.  That is why I did what I did.  And before I made any move, I had to think about it.  It is in my nature.  I told Mr. Kavaruganda very clearly.  Have you made sure that this is the signature of Kavaruganda, because you may suggest that it is a document that I made up?  But I asked you last time to try to compare the signatures on other cards.  If you haven't done that, you must agree with me.  I think you might think this is a doctored document, that is why I am telling you this.

I'm simply trying to tell the truth.  But those I speak with also must have an opportunity to check what I am saying.  That is the situation, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I don't doubt that that is an authentic document so you don't have to worry about that. But I would like to talk to you now about some of the events after your resignation from the MRND, when you claim that Mr. Ngirumpatse sent people to look for you and tried to kill you.

Now, you received this information from a person whose name is Turatsinze, correct?  
A.	Turatsinze, yes, T-U-R-A-T-S-I-N-Z-E.  I wanted to spell the name for you.  It is a Kinyarwanda name.  And pardon me, Interpreters, I know that when you spell a name sometimes the spelling is different, T-A -- but nevertheless, Rwanda is a better place today.  I am no longer involved in politics.  I'm simply giving you some personal feelings, Mr. Robinson.  I'm not a politician.  I'm simply talking about the events and what I experienced.  Furthermore, with regard to the PSD, if I wanted a position in that party, I would have done so after the war.  But I didn't want to, politics is another game all together.  I simply wanted to go about my life as an ordinary citizen.

I tried to be insightful in my decisions, but I am a free man, someone can ask me to join a party, but I will not, in any case, take any position of responsibility in it; because members of the party or your colleagues may commit reprehensible acts, and it is always possible, Mr. Robinson.  It is possible.  I will stop there for fear of being too lengthy in my responses.  
Q.	What name did you know Mr. Turatsinze by? 
A.	Other names, Jean-Pierre Kassim Turatsinze.  In fact, you only told me one name and I spelled it for you, and I stopped there.  
Q.	So, when you knew him you knew him by Kassim and you also knew him by Jean-Pierre; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, but later on I remembered the name Jean-Pierre, but we really used to call him Kassim.  Later on I found out that his first name was Jean-Pierre.  I found out about that later on. 
Q.	And what was his ethnic -- what was his ethnicity, if you know? 
A.	If I am not mistaken -- in fact, today we don't speak about ethnic groups anymore.  We simply say that we are Rwandans.  But since we have to go back over these events, I have to talk to you about them.  He was a Tutsi. 
Q.	And did you tell us that he was normally of bad character? 
A.	Did I ever tell you that he had a bad character?  Show me when I said that.  But I can tell you about his duties, about what he did or what he was told to do.  If he was of bad character, I wouldn't have been told about it.  I wouldn't have known what the people were planning to do, how he worked with Mathieu and the Interahamwe.  Just like Kajuga was given responsibilities, there were people who worked for these straw men, but to characterise them as someone with a bad character, I don't know.  He was given this and -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness has made an allusion to money, with his hands. 
THE WITNESS:
Even the sons of God were betrayed because of this.  No, the son of God was not betrayed, they simply gave denarius to someone.  This is in the Christian belief system.  They gave someone money.  And I can compare that situation to that of Kajuga and Turatsinze.  I don't know where those people are today.  If we could read their minds, you would understand that they were not of bad character; they were after money, simply.  That is but one example.

That shows that when you are after money, you can even do horrible things to your neighbours; and that is the situation.  That is the truth.  These are the explanations that I have for you about Kassim, but I did not say that he had a bad character.  Maybe you have written it down that way, but you should change it; and think about this, it was because of money.  That is the truth, Mr. Robinson.  

If you want me to go on talking about Kassim, I have more to say but if you want, we can move on.  This is the first time you have raised this issue, and it seems you want more information.  And a lot of times you say this is the first time you have ever talked about this, but now you have asked me this question, so now I have to give you this type of information.  Yes, I am answering the question that you are asking me.

Mr. President, I believe that the interpreter has not correctly said what I said.  I was talking about steering behind the wheel.  This is the way I am giving Mr. Robinson the explanations.  It is as if        Mr. Robinson is behind the wheel, I am following him; because, Mr. Robinson, you are after the truth.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were you aware that Mr. Turatsinze had stolen weapons in 1993 and sold them to a group of Burundians called FRODEBU? 
A.	You should instead say he pointed out where the Interahamwe weapons cache was to the UNAMIR contingent.  But you are speaking about FRODEBU, and I don't know about that, Mr. Robinson.  I am ready to tell you the truth, the whole truth.  I am prepared to tell you that Kassim pointed out the weapons cache of the Interahamwe.  He showed it to the UNAMIR troops.  I can't invent any of this.  I know a great deal.  That is why some people are looking for me.  Some people want to eliminate me, but I will continue to tell the truth.  That is the situation, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	What was Mr. Turatsinze's position at MRND, as you understood it?  
A.	When the Interahamwe were set up, when Ngirumpatse set up task to the different Interahamwe members, he tasked Interahamwe -- Turatsinze to Kigali -- to Kigali, he would have to distribute supplies.  He was given a Suzuki Samurai, so, in fact, he was an MRND driver.  
I remember the vehicle very well.  The Interahamwe could go onto the vehicle during rallies, and they would wear their Kitenges.  Mr. Robinson, I'm compelled to give you all of the details and talk about everything that I remember.  Those who want to kill me can do so.  But my head will go on talking.  Those people were not able to kill me because I was in God's hands.  I will tell you what I know.  Yes, lots of questions are put to me so that I may be disconcerted, but I won't be.  I'm talking to you about what happened to me, and I can do that.  Jesus was even persecuted; our prophet Muhammad was too.  

In 1994 people were hunted down and killed, but some survived.  So take what I say as it is.  That is the situation, Mr. Robinson.  These are the facts that you are looking for. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like me to continue or would you like to stop at this moment? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think it is better to stop because -- if it is convenient point?  

Mr. Sow, are you going to finish by 1:30?  
MR. SOW: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I will do my best to finish by 1:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Mr. Robinson, about how much time do you anticipate?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I still have a few hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, we are going to take a break now and your testimony will resume - sorry.

Mr. Fry, when are we going to start?  

Mr. Robinson, we are trying to schedule the resumption time, if we -- is there a chance that you will finish this afternoon?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I doubt it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Witness, we will take a break with your testimony now, but you should be available for resumption at 3 o'clock.  We may, in fact, start it later than that, but we would like you to be here to resume your testimony for 3 o'clock this afternoon. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wanted to remind you of one small matter, Mr. President.  Mr. Robinson never gave the number of the exhibit he showed earlier.  I wanted to remind you of that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, that PSD card was D. NZ46; perhaps if that is what he is referring to, I think it does have a number now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  That is my recollection as well.  We can take a very short recess now.  

Mr. Sow, we will be ready for your resumption. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If I could address one minor matter; yesterday, I agreed to provide a clean copy of this witness's will-say statement.  I did provide a copy to the Accused and to the registry officer and the Court.  And Mr. Fry can enter that under the number that it was given yesterday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I will indicate for the record that it does have a K-number now.  It starts at KO358835 and goes to K0358837. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

We will rise just for a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 0956H to 1032H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you make connections with The Hague, please. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, I believe The Hague is on line and ready now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to resume your testimony this morning.  You remain on the same oath to tell the truth that you took at the commencement of your testimony.  We have reached the stage of proceedings where your examination will be conducted by Mr. Sow, who represents the Accused Édouard Karemera.  

Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS G,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  My name is counsel Felix Sow.  I am from the bar of Senegal, and I have been a member of that bar since 1981.  And I am currently president of the bar association, the order of counsel in Senegal.  

Witness, I hope you have had an opportunity to rest so that I can put a few questions to you.  There are also seven documents relating to those questions that I would like to discuss with you.  I have disclosed the documents and I hope that you have had an opportunity to look at them.

Witness, are you ready?  
A.	I don't have document Number 7. 
Q.	In fact, I have just been informed that measures are being taken to have document 7 sent to you.  But do you have document Number 5, Witness?
A.	Yes, I have just received it.  
MR. SOW: 
With the leave of the Trial Chamber, I should like to begin my cross-examination. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, in response to a question put to you by the Prosecution, that is, when they asked you, did you know which political party the Accused were affiliated with during the period 1991 to 1994; you answered, "Yes".  Is that correct, Witness?  
A.	I believe so, yes. 
Q.	So, I should like to ask you about your knowledge of the party.  First, the national revolutionary movement for development, which later became the republican movement for democracy and development.  Do you know about the national revolutionary movement for development, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I should request now that we look at document Number 1, which are the statutes of the national revolutionary movement for development.  

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you have that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Tell me, have you ever read the party statute? 
A.	I wouldn't say that I have read the entire statute; I have glanced through it, however. 
Q.	According to you, when looking at Article 6 of the statute and let me quote, "Pursuant to Article 7 of the constitution of the republic of Rwanda, the national revolutionary movement for development is the sole political framework outside of which no political activities may be exercised." Can you tell me, Witness, if that provision was effectively implemented, practiced by the party?  
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Does not that article specify that the MRND is a single party? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let's look at Article Number 8.  Third paragraph of Article 8 says that the national revolutionary movement for development supports and controls, or monitors the various activities and powers of the state.  Is that correct, Witness? 
A.	Was this drafted at a time when the MRND was a single party?  If that is the case then the answer to your question is yes. 
Q.	Let me be specific, and I'm speaking about the revolutionary movement, the MRND in its first form. 
A.	Okay, thank you. 
Q.	Let's look at Article 9:  "Each Rwandan is a full member of the revolution -- or rather the national revolutionary movement for development.  Members shall be called militants and must respect the statutes and rules of the movement." Is that correct, Witness?
A.	That was the case. 
Q.	Let's look at Article 11:  "Foreigners may be supporting members."  Here is my question; since every Rwandan was a member of the MRND, foreigners could only be supporters, members or supporters; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Let me finish by speaking about Article 12:  "The central organs of the movement are:  One, the presidency of the movement; the national congress; and, three, the central committee."  Witness, is it correct that those were, indeed, the central organs of that movement? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me proceed.  Tell me what were the objectives of the national revolutionary movement for development? 
A.	You have the statute; can you tell me where I should be reading?  
Q.	Is it not correct that the motto of the revolutionary movement was peace, unity and development? 
A.	Yes, I believe so. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell me whether or not the party accepted all Rwandans, without discrimination?
A.	Yes, it was a single party.  As spelled out in the statute, all Rwandans, Hutus, Twas or Tutsis were automatically members of the party.

1045H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	As a member of the MRND, can you tell me which organisation you were affiliated with? 
A.	I am not sure I understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Since you were a member of the MRND, did you ever work for any of the party's organs or bodies and if so, which one?  Which body of the party did you work for? 
A.	I was always a member of the MRND; that is all. 
Q.	So you didn't work for the MRND in the cellules, for example? 
A.	No, I did not. 
Q.	Even if you didn't work in the cellules for the MRND, did you have any other activities within the party? 
A.	Yes, I was involved in Umuganda.  That was a national project which took place on every Saturday.  The MRND created that.  Everyone had to participate. 
Q.	What is Umuganda, Witness? 
A.	Umuganda is, in fact, community work.  Civil servants and the entire population had to participate on Saturdays. 
Q.	Did those activities benefit the population in any way?  Was there a positive outcome? 
A.	Personally, yes, I believe there was a positive outcome as a result of the work. 
Q.	On 10th October 2005, during your examination-in-chief, you said that prior to the multiparty system Rwanda had a single party, it was a party state; that party was called the MRND.  I would like you to point out for us, Witness, and explain what you mean by party state.  
A.	For me, that party, as you pointed out in the Statute, it was a party that controlled the government, it was about -- or else everyone was a member of.  Automatically, it was a state party.  It controlled everything.  It controlled all bodies of the government. 
Q.	From that, am I to understand that there was opposition between the party and the territorial administration of the country? 
A.	I am not sure I have understood your question. 
Q.	Let me be more specific.  Since the party was omnipresent and controlled the state, I want to know if political leaders in the regions or the préfectures were representatives of both the party and the state at their level. 
A.	Yes, even in companies and state structures there were MRND representatives.  There were MRND representatives in the ministries and in companies, and among the population in the communes and préfectures there were MRND representatives. 
Q.	If I understand you correctly, it was therefore a very powerful party? 
A.	Very powerful and wealthy. 
Q.	Why was it a wealthy party? 
A.	For a salaried worker, who worked 30 days of every month, two of those days pay would go to finance MRND activities; that budget.  
Q.	That budget was for the MRND, given to it by the state; is that correct?  
A.	I don't know.  Yes, there was an MRND budget and its budget was based on contributions by members and everyone was a member. 
Q.	There you said that there was no discrimination amongst Rwandans.  Now I want to know if during that period when the national revolutionary movement for development existed, did the ethnic groups live together in harmony? 
A.	I believe so, yes. 
Q.	So at that time the MRND was very powerful.  Why did it not, as some people say, claim to eliminate the Tutsis? 
A.	I am not sure I have an answer for that question. 
Q.	Didn't the MRND have all the resources to do that? 
A.	I don't know. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President at this stage of my cross-examination, I would request that document number 1 be tendered into evidence and be marked D. K1. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, I was just wondering whether this has not been already admitted into evidence. 
MR. SOW:
In fact, no, Mr. President.  The document tendered previously was the national republican movement and that was tendered as D. NG2A, that document was the statute.  Here we have the statute for the first political party, the revolutionary movement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for the clarification.  It is admitted into evidence. 
(Exhibit No. D .K1 admitted)
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We have, of course, no opposition to putting this into evidence D. K1 -- and this document, it seems like it comes from a compendium of documents because it starts on page 305, and you can see from the page that is ahead, on the first sheet that we've gotten, that there were other MRND documents and the same thing for the last sheet.  Now, I am wondering if Mr. Sow has a copy of the original book that may have other relevant documents and if we could have a look at the original book, if he has it. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, documents were disclosed to us by the Prosecution.  In those documents we had the statutes of the revolutionary movement for development, and I have no opposition to those documents being tendered. 

MR. WEBSTER:
It should be the documents I have -- I am just expressing curiosity about other relevant documents in their context of reciprocal disclosure; if we could look at the other documents that may be included in the same volume, that's where we are only concerned about.  I am not doubting the authenticity of what Mr. Sow is proposing as an exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't know if I understood Mr. Sow properly.  What I thought he said is that that document came from you.  Is that the point?  

Is that what you said, Mr. Sow? 
MR. SOW:
This document was given to me by my client, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  I had misunderstood what you had said earlier.  I am sorry. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, the Prosecutor's references are on the face of the document.  These documents were seized by the Prosecution and then disclosed to us thereafter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought you just said that was not what happened. 
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. Karemera has just clarified this, showing me that there are Prosecution numbers on the document, which means it came from the Prosecution. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I apologise for raising the issue.  Maybe I can speak to Mr. Sow about this afterwards, but I don't see anything that indicates that this is a Prosecution document.  If it had been a seizure from the Accused, it would bear a KA-number and I don't see that, and there is no K-number on it.  What I see are handwritten indications.  It may have -- I don't know where it comes from, but that should be the registry because the registry does handle indications on documents.  But looking at this, I don't see it as a Prosecution document, and I am not disputing the contents of the document; I am just enquiring about other possible relevant documents that you may have.  That really is the need for my enquiry.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Sow, I don't think that needs to take up our trial time, but would you discuss this with Mr. Webster at the break.  Thank you. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I agree that the entirety of the document should be tendered. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now? 
MR. SOW:
Yes, now, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and isn't this what you said just now?  Basically, what are you tendering?
MR. SOW:
The document that I disclosed which bears Number 1. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, so you are tendering that?  
MR. SOW:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's good.  That is admitted into evidence. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there something else that you wanted to tender at this time?  
MR. SOW:
No, Mr. President.  With your leave, Mr. President, I should like to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I wanted to ask you -- according to you, when did you first notice that regions and ethnic groups started to surface as a concern in Rwanda?  You said that Rwandans lived in harmony. 
A.	You know, even if they did live in harmony, there was still ethnic injustice in the workplace and in schools.  And I would say that the least problems arose well before 1991.  I can refer you to lists that were drawn up, I believe, in 1972 or '73.  There were lists of persons in ministries and in companies of Tutsis who were on the list.  It was said that they should not come to school or return to work.  Those existed well before. 
Q.	During your examination-in-chief, Witness, you talked about the war of aggression which occurred on the 1st of October 1990 in Rwanda.  With regard to that war of 1st October 1990, can you tell us what the consequences were on the relationship between the ethnic groups in Rwanda? 
A.	With the war of 1st October 1990, ethnic problems in Rwanda began to arise because the enemy was considered as not only the RPF, but also Tutsis who worked with so-called work worthy RPF were also considered as enemies. 
Q.	Can you please tell me what was considered to be the ethnic base of the RPF? 
A.	The ethnic base -- I would say the majority of the members of the RPF were Tutsis. 
Q.	Is it correct to say that the RPF referred to itself as Inyenzi-Inkotanyi? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	According to some researchers in history, the term Inyenzi is a cold word that the initiators of the rebellion at the time, people who were therefore very traditionalist gave to their army movement.  It is the Kinyarwanda abbreviation.  I am sorry for my pronunciation.  Maybe I will spell it afterwards if necessary.  Ingangurarugo, yiyemeje kubaingenzi.  Let me spell, I-N-G-A-N-G-U-R-A-R-U-G-O, Ingangurarugo; Yiyemeje, Y-I-Y-E-M-E-J-E. K-U-B-A-I-N-G-E-N-Z-I, Ingenzi and this is translated into combatant of the militia Ingangurarugo, whose motto was the best.  Historically, the Ingangurarugo were the most feared militia of the monarchy Rwabugiri.  Let me spell the name R-W-A-B-U-G-I-R-I, Rwabugiri. 

So I wanted to ask you what your opinion is of this interpretation given to the term Inyenzi? 
A.	I don't know how you come by this because I didn't know that the word had such a meaning.  All I knew was that the term was used to signify a cockroach; that is all. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, in fact, the name that I have given you was cut up in order to come up with the term "Inyenzi".  They took from Ingangurarugo the "I" and the "N", the first two letters.  And Yiyemeje, from there they took the "Y" and the "E", and "I,N" from in the Ingenzi.  We have from there the term "Inyenzi" which is built up in that manner.  So it is not the perjurity term "cockroach" which brought about the term "Inyenzi".  
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Tell me, Mr. Witness, in initiating that aggression in October 1990, do you not believe that the RPF was inciting hatred between the Hutus and the Tutsis? 
A.	I believe that when they carried out that war in -- or, waged the war in 1990, it is because they had problems in the country which was hosting them, Uganda; that country no longer wanted them.  So they were organising themselves in order to return home, and home was Rwanda. 
Q.	Quite so.  But basing themselves on ethnicity, do you not believe that they were going to resuscitate the hatred that existed between the Hutu and the Tutsis? 
A.	Counsel, you know that most of these people who were in Uganda were children who were born from 1959, 1960.  Their parents left in 1959, so those people were not Hutu; they were Tutsi.  These people wanted to come back home because they were facing problems where they were.  So in coming 
	back -- in returning home, there were negotiations which didn't lead to anything tangible, so they preferred to come back home using force.  Earlier on they had tried to do the same in 1961, '62, '63; they tried to come back and it didn't work.  But this time around, they tried to come back and they managed to do so.  I do not -- it wasn't their objective to engage the Tutsis in being killed, but they did this in order to come back using the force of arms which brought about hatred. 
Q.	That's right, hatred between Hutu and Tutsis.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You stated on the 
	10th of October during your examination-in-chief, that around the 5th or 6th of October during the war led by the RPF, there were people who were taken and imprisoned and these people were Tutsis.  They were considered as accomplices of the RPF.  Do you confirm that statement? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that three quarters of those people were Tutsis and I believe one quarter were Hutu. 
Q.	Can I ask you on what basis you found the estimates you are advancing?  What's the basis for your estimate? 
A.	I am not the only one.  There is the international community which spoke about these estimates.  Everybody realised that this is what happened in Kigali and in the préfectures.  People who were incarcerated were Hutus -- or some Hutu. 
Q.	Did you have access to reports which were written at the time concerning those arrests? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Can you tell me whether these arrests were carried out on the basis of ethnicity?
A.	What I saw is that it was on the basis of ethnicity that these arrests were effected. 
Q.	Can you tell me how far the events of October 1990 had any impact on the process for the return to multipartyism in Rwanda? 
A.	Could you please repeat that question, Counsel?  
Q.	Could you tell me how far the events of October 1990 had any impact on the process for the return to multipartyism in Rwanda? 
A.	What I can say is that during the beginning of multiparty era in Rwanda, we saw the establishment of the ethnic based parties.  We also saw that there were parties which were regional in their trend, and many or most Tutsis who were in the MRND, the revolutionary movement -- MRND, I mean, when multipartyism came about, they had not registered in the republican movement version of the MRND.  They preferred to opt for other parties such as PL, whose members were Tutsi in the majority. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would wish to utilise document number 2 which I have tendered -- I have produced and it has been recorded as an exhibit under code D. NGN2A. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, to your knowledge, can you describe to the Chamber the process involving the return to multipartyism, and I wish you, in particular, if possible, to speak to ourselves about the conclusion of the commission for the restructuring of the MRND which was brought together by Faustin Munyaneza? 
A.	Counsel, I don't see how I can make that description because I wasn't a member of that commission.  I saw things come about.  I saw parties, the MRND, which accepted that the -- the congress of MRND accepted multipartyism and that was how things started. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, could you tell me about the statutes of the national republican movement for democracy and development, MRND, as it was adopted by the constituent congress of 1991?  I go further to say that you have those statutes before you. 
A.	Unless I read them, but I know that the MRND -- the new MRND had peace, unity and development as its objectives.  That is all I can tell you. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am going to help you.  If we were to look at Article 3 of the Statute -- can you please turn the page to the second page.  I wanted to ask you regarding the colours adopted by the MRND, the new MRND.  In your view, are these the colours that were adopted, red, black and green?  Were they the same colours as those of the revolutionary movement? 
A.	I no longer recall. 
Q.	Because in the initial statute of the revolutionary movement, you will realise that the colours changed.  In the revolutionary movement, you have yellow, which was replaced by black.  

Let me go ahead, Mr. Witness.  Article 5 of the Statute provides for the republican form of the state that the MRND would maintain and support the republican form of the state; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is it also true that the new MRND would maintain union and would exclude all forms of discrimination? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	As is stipulated under Article 7 of the statute, can you tell me whether within the framework of the party, you received any training or education on the doctrine of the new MRND party? 
A.	Before I continue, I would like to inform you that I never was a member of the new MRND.  I was there. But I never formally became a member by becoming a card bearing member of that party, the new MRND. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  So there's no point in me going forward along that line, is there?  

Let's come back to the multiparty era, Mr. Witness.  And I would like you to look at document number 3, which deals with the work of the national synthesis commission.  Do you have that document, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I do, Counsel. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you:  Did you get to know about this report which was written at the time by Mr. Edouard Karemera and which led to the revised constitution of 10th June 1991? 
A.	Yes, I was aware of this report and I also associated it with the report -- with the commission led by Karemera.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, Mr. President, I missed counsel's question.  He was a bit too fast for me.  I was still thinking.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, did you get that?  The interpreter would like you to repeat your last question. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you have the opportunity to get to know of this report? 
A.	I said yes.
Q.	Now, I am going to invite you to look at the document, and we are going to go to page 36.  Here, we are looking at the principles of the national political charter.  Principle 1 states the following:  "Political activity in the Republic of Rwanda shall be organised under the principle of political pluralism.  Any Rwandan citizen shall be able to establish a political party; to belong to a political party of his choice; to withdraw of his own free will or to refrain from belonging to any party at all." 

Mr. Witness, can you tell me whether this principle would have constituted a complete break with the state party? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	I am now going to ask you to turn to page 38, Principle 3.  "All parties must seek and consolidate the cohesion of the Rwandan people.  Consequently, it cannot -- no party can institute by its principles its manifesto or its activities for any exclusion based in particular on ethnicity, regional or denominational membership, or based on any other form of discrimination." 

Mr. Witness, isn't it true that this principle talks about the negation of any type of discrimination, be it regional or religious or ethnic, and that it was for the union or unity of all Rwandans? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, but this was not implemented as stipulated under Principle 3. 
Q.	We will come to that.  Let's move on to Principle 4:  "Peaceful coexistence between different components of the Rwanda society is essential.  In this framework, political parties can only exercise their activities through peaceful means.  They are, in particular, prohibited from establishing militia or other organisations with similar methods."  

	Isn't it true, Mr. Witness, that this principle also dealt with peaceful coexistence in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Let me conclude with Principle 6 at page 40, four-zero.  "Members of the armed forces, the police and the judiciary are prohibited from engaging in political activities unless they are relieved of their duties prior to any such activity.  Any political party must respect its respective statute which consecrates its incompatibility."

Mr. Witness, in your view, does Principle 6 clearly stipulate the incompatibility that exists in the judiciary, the police and the armed forces being involved in political activities unless the members of these structures resign from their positions prior to any such involvement? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Therefore, the report which was thus written, did it not really lay down the main cornerstones of multipartyism and democracy? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you now tell me, in your view, Mr. Witness, the role that Mr. Edouard Karemera played in the advent of multipartyism? 
A.	He chaired the national synthesis committee which drafted the report the parties were to follow.  That report was instituted.  All the democratic principles were contained in it, but what happened afterwards was different; what the commission did could work. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, before I move onto another line of questioning, I would request that this document number 3 be tendered into evidence as D. K2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D.K2, admitted) 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I may be wrong, but my recollection is that this was already admitted previously.  Wasn't it admitted by Mr. Robinson?  It was not.  Okay, I am sorry. 
MR. SOW:
That is not the case, Mr. President.  I am sure Mr. Robinson could confirm that for us.  Let me move on, Mr. President. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what role -- no, pardon me.  Let me start again.  Have you heard of Rukusanya, R-U-K-U-S-A-N-Y-A?  
A.	That was a nickname given to Mr. Karemera due to the work he did for that national commission. 
Q.	Do you know what Rukusanya means? 
A.	Rukusanya is to unite. 
Q.	The uniter; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What can you say of the man as a civil servant in service of the state?  With regard to his work, what can you say? 
A.	You know, I didn't work with him, but I knew him as -- that he was the minister of the civil service.  He worked with one of my family members.  He was highly regarded. 
Q.	According to you, this man struggled for multiparty politics.  Could he become sectarian to the point he would be considered a member of the criminal enterprise, which -- the objective of which was to eliminate the Tutsis? 
A.	I can't answer you.  I never had an opportunity to speak with him.  What happened -- I don't know who organised it.  I knew him as a minister, as the vice-chairman of the party; that is all. 
Q.	Can you tell me -- and now we are getting back to the party -- if the changes within the revolutionary movement which became the republican movement were simply formalities, or were there profound changes that occurred within the party? 
A.	There were profound changes. 
Q.	Can you tell me if those changes weakened or strengthened the party with regard to its composition or its popularity among citizens? 
A.	Before that decision was made, there were constraints from the donors.  I remember that the president was at La Baule at the meeting.  Donor countries were asked to accept the multiparty political system, so they could benefit from the funds from donors.  So the advent of the multiparty system simply 
	wasn't -- didn't come about because the leaders had willingness.  There was also external pressures.  There was a change, indeed, in the MRND in its old format.  It lost a great deal.  It lost many members, for example, and those members, I would say, were constrained.  The MRND in the old system received a great deal of money from the population and required a lot of the population.  People needed change; that is what I can tell you. 
Q.	With regard to the new MRND's legacy, can you tell us whether or not the old MRND handed it over to -- handed it -- rather, back to the state? 
A.	Yes, more than 99 percent of what belonged to the revolutionary movement went back to the state.  I believe it went back to the ministry of finance. 
Q.	So, financially speaking, the MRND became -- or was severely weakened.  
A.	Yes, it was a new party which was born.  It was no longer the MRND state party.  They had to play on the field like everyone else -- like all of the other parties.  They started from scratch as well. 
Q.	What were the consequences of that multiparty system with regard to the territorial administrative restructuring of the country? 
A.	Administratively speaking, there were many changes.  The préfets of the préfectures were chairmen of the parties in the préfectures.  They were MRND organs under the old system which existed.  They monitored everyone, I would say.  The population was able to see that there was no longer direct control over them, and now they could join new parties of their own free will.  They were free to join another party without being compelled to do so. 
Q.	And within the government, what type of changes occurred?  And, by the way, the example of that may remind that the government which was set up distributed various functions of government between the MRND and its new format and new opposition parties.  So, is it correct to say that the prime minister's office was headed by someone from the MDR party; the ministry of foreign affairs was also held by an MDR member; the ministry of the armed forces also led by an MDR member; the ministry of justice was led by a PL member; the ministry of commerce and industry also led by a PL member; the ministry of finance by a PSD member; the ministry of public works also a PSD member; and the ministry of agriculture also was led by a PSD member?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I have a small correction.  The ministry of the armed forces was headed by someone from the MRND.  So for the other ministries, can you confirm for me, indeed, that members of those parties headed those ministries?
A.	Yes, there was a multiparty system.  There was sharing of the different responsibilities.  The MRND had to share responsibilities with the other parties.  
Q.	Do you know that the intelligence services which fell under the presidency, under the new system fell under the prime minister's office? 
A.	I don't know how that worked, but the intelligence services were under the prime minister's office, and the intelligence services under the presidency continued to work as before. 
Q.	As you know, the multiparty system led to the creation of opposition political parties, as well as a new MRND.  In addition, youth movements were set up, particularly, youth movements for the opposition political parties. 

Witness, can you tell me with regard to the creation of the Interahamwe -- was the Interahamwe created as a result of the multiparty system or was it created because youth wings started to be created amongst the opposition parties? 
A.	I am not sure I understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Let me repeat it. 
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	You were questioned by the Prosecutor.  During that questioning, you said that opposition parties began to create youth organisations, and during that time the MRND, in its new format, did not have a youth wing or a youth organisation.  So, here is my question:  The Interahamwe were created, is that because there was a new multiparty system, or was it created because other youth organisations existed amongst the opposition parties?  Do you understand the question, Witness? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	I believe it was conducted on a political level in the party.  There was a youth wing under the new MRND.  The youth commission had to work with the youth of the party, and I believe in the MRND statute that commission existed and it was supposed to work with young people.  As it turned out, other parties had already created their own youth wings.  So I think that the youth wing was created as a result of multiparty system, because the old MRND did not have a youth wing; the new one did.  So I think it was -- this occurred on a political level. 
Q.	Can you tell us who chaired that youth commission within the MRND, Witness? 
A.	I believe the person was called Désiré Murenzi.  The Interahamwe were created.  
Q.	How did the Interahamwe go about recruiting members?  
A.	There was a first meeting.  The people who came to it were invited by Désiré Murenzi.  The members who participated in the first meeting themselves invited their own friends.  It went on in that way.  If you knew somebody, you could tell that person that they could come to participate in a meeting, and during that meeting, they could accept or refuse to join the organisation. 
Q.	Can you tell me if the national committee for the Interahamwe had recruitment policies, and, if so, can you describe the policies? 
A.	There was no recruitment policy.  I explained to you how people were recruited. 
Q.	Can you tell me how the national committee kept in touch with members?  Did they issue communiqués or was there some kind of liaison linking the two? 
A.	From the time they were created up until May 1992, the Interahamwe held weekly meetings on every Wednesday.  There was no need for a communiqué.  Everyone knew that after 5 o'clock on Wednesday, there would be a meeting. 
Q.	Witness, I am not talking about the committee meetings; I am talking about the link between the committee and other Interahamwe members, how were they linked? 
A.	That's what I am telling you.  The Wednesday meeting was not simply a meeting of the committee.  The weekly Wednesday meeting was for all members of the organisation. 
Q.	Very well, I understand now.  The provisional national committee, did it have authority over its members?
A.	I am not sure what you mean by authority. 
Q.	Did the national committee control its members?  Was it able to control them to the extent that when orders were given members of the Interahamwe organisation would carry out the committee's orders? 
A.	The national committee did not control members.  They gave them instructions and the committee told them what they needed to do the following week.  Those who wanted to obey those instructions could do so; those who wanted to participate in the demonstration could do so, but there was no strict enforcement.  It was a very flexible system. 
Q.	Would you confirm that when the committee gave instructions to Interahamwe members, those Interahamwe members would carry out those instructions? 
A.	From November to May 1992, during the weekly Wednesday meetings, everyone was invited.  They were invited to report on what they had observed during the week.  That is how we worked.  They would gather all the necessary information, and in the meeting, they would look for solutions to the problems they would encounter.  After those discussions, members would leave and work on the basis of the conclusions that were made.  The committee did not give instructions; everyone had to participate in providing information leading to instructions. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us how many people participated in the meetings? 
A.	Initially, there were 30 members.  That number grew to 100 or so in Kigali préfecture.  Then between November 1991 and May 1992, the MRND had allocated a small room for us and so we -- the organisation attempted to set up Interahamwe in each secteur of Kigali, and those members would choose their own president and vice president and they would meet in their secteurs.  That was because there was not sufficient space to welcome all of the participants.  Sometimes members of the national committee would visit those various secteurs and they would do so to inform them of a communiqué from the MRND headquarters, informing them of the future projects and also to inform them of the week's work.  That was how we worked. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Can you tell us if the Interahamwe existed throughout Rwanda? 
A.	During which period? 
Q.	Prior to April 1994.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What about Kibuye, specifically? 
A.	You know, the decision was made in 1992. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it seems the signal has been lost.  It's back.

Mr. President, after the signal was lost, we lost thetrain of thought of the witness, if he could be asked to repeat.
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry to interrupt, but I missed the response because the connection broke.  Could we have the witness repeat his last answer?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel is asking you to do that. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I want to ask you the same question again so that you are able to repeat your answer.  Can you tell us if the Interahamwe existed throughout Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what is the exact situation for Kibuye préfecture? 
A.	There was a congress in April or May 1992 authorising the creation of the Interahamwe in the préfectures.  All of the préfectures I knew had Interahamwe.  I wonder if Kibuye was an exception to the rule. 
Q.	So, as far as you are concerned, Kibuye also had Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who was in charge of Interahamwe in Kibuye then? 
A.	It was the chairman of the MRND for Kibuye préfecture who was in charge of Interahamwe. 
Q.	Who was the chairman of the MRND in Kibuye, then? 
A.	It was a member of parliament, Sehundo Nyimahundo -- I am not sure I recall the name. 
Q.	In your opinion, how many members of the Interahamwe were there in Kibuye? 
A.	I can't answer that question. 
Q.	So, apparently, you are not aware of what was going on in Kibuye with regard to the Interahamwe? 
A.	You know, I didn't go to Kibuye.  I never went to any meetings or rallies in Kibuye, and so I am not in a position to answer your question. 
Q.	Did the provisional national committee receive any reports about Interahamwe activities in Kibuye préfecture? 
A.	When the Interahamwe was set up in the various préfectures, the MRND chairmen in the préfectures were in charge of them -- of the Interahamwe, and I believe that they reported back to the executive committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, it seems that you said that when the Interahamwe was set up in the préfectures, the provisional national committee was part of that process.  
A.	Yes.
Q.	So if the Interahamwe were set up in Kibuye, the national committee should have been there for the ceremony to set them up or to inaugurate them? 
A.	As I said before, I did not go to Kibuye for that.  What I do know is that the members of the provisional committee of the Interahamwe divided up the work.  In other words, they divided the préfectures and responsibilities for them.  They said, "You are in charge of this préfecture, and you are in charge of that one."  I don't know who went to Kibuye in that capacity, and so I don't know who went there, which report they made.  At any rate, in each and every préfecture the members of the provisional national committee were invited for the ceremonies. 
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is 12 o'clock.  We take a break somewhere around this time.  So when you come to a convenient time. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, this may be an appropriate time for the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We'll take a short recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1205H) 
(Pages 15 to 28 by Sithembiso Moyo)












(Court resumed at 1240H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow, you may continue.  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, I can.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, if you agree, we'll agree -- we'll continue with our line of questioning concerning the Interahamwe.  Witness, do you have an Interahamwe card?  
A.	Are we in a closed session, or is this an open session?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Sow, I think it's a reasonable concern.  That particular question, I think, could be answered because it's very general, but where are you going with this line?  You must -- what I would like you to do, if you have closed-circuit -- closed-session questions, to organise them in one group so we don't have to go in and out of closed session.  Are you moving on to a line of questioning that requires closed session or not?  
MR. SOW:
No, Mr. President.  These are merely general questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we think that that question is sufficiently general to be asked and answered in open -- in open session.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I did have that card.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Can you be more specific for me?  For one to be an Interahamwe, was it absolutely necessary to be a member of the MRND?  
A.	Yes, that was the case.  
Q.	And yet a moment ago you said that you were an Interahamwe, but that as far as membership of the Interahamwe was concerned, you didn't renew your membership and become a member of the new MRND.  
A.	Yes, that was so.  
Q.	So, can you confirm for me that you did not bear an MRND -- or new MRND membership card?  
A.	Yes, I can confirm that.  
Q.	Can you tell me, please, what are the references that feature on an Interahamwe card in relation to membership within the MRND?  
A.	I don't really remember what the card looked like, but what I can confirm is that there was the number of the card itself.  But now as for reference to the MRND, I didn't have an MRND card.  I don't know whether there's a space on the Interahamwe card for such reference.  I don't think there was any such space.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, with regard to this card, I would wish that we refer to tab 51 of the documents produced by the Prosecutor, please.  And this is under volume 2.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's in evidence already as P. 1, if I'm not mistaken, so it actually should be with the registry in The Hague.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I do recall this exhibit.  I think that's the exhibit I remember.  You want it shown to the witness?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, that's right, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission is granted.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have the document?  
A.	Not yet.  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, can we be given the title of the document?  
MR. SOW:
This is the Interahamwe card, and it comes under tab 51, which became an exhibit under the code "P. 1." 
MS. TALON:
We don't have that document.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, have you found the document?  
MS. TALON:
Yes, we believe we found the document, and the witness has it in hand.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you have the exhibit?  
A.	Yes, I do, but I'm not sure because I'm not sure whether I have the correct side because I have Interahamwe's MRND and then the number of the card, but I don't have the reverse side of the document.  
Q.	I want you to refer to the document which bears the name "Rutaganda."  That's the document I want you to look at.  
A.	Yes.  Yes, I have the exhibit.  
Q.	All right.  So we can proceed.  Mr. Witness, when you look at that card, the last item does say that this is the MRND card, and it gives a number, B for bravo, stroke, one-thousand and four.  So there is, indeed, a reference for the MRND card, isn't there?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Therefore, once you have an Interahamwe card -- what was the writing in that place reserved for references for the MRND card?  
A.	I can tell you that the card that I had, there was nothing about the MRND card because there were no checks.  These documents were delivered by us, and no one would be able to check on my card.  But what I can suggest to you is that you should ask the member of the executive committee of the MRND to check in their records to see whether I'm registered as a member of the MRND in Kigali.  That's where I was.  
Q.	Can you confirm for me, or deny if need be, whether all the Interahamwe members, before the events of April 1994, were members of the MRND?  
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Counsel.  I do apologise, Counsel.  
Q.	I will repeat the question for you, Witness.  Before the events of April 1994, can you confirm or deny whether all the members of the Interahamwe organisation were also members of the MRND; in other words, can you confirm or deny whether they had the membership cards of the new MRND?  
A.	I cannot make that confirmation.  
Q.	Should I understand that there were possibly members of the Interahamwe organisation who were not members of the MRND party?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	A moment ago I asked you a question about the chairman of the Interahamwe organisation in Kibuye.  What I want to ask you now, since you told me that the chairman of the Interahamwe was the chairman of the Interahamwe in Kibuye préfecture, I want to ask you whether the chairman of the MRND was an Interahamwe.  
A.	No, no, no, no.  I said -- let me explain.  The chairman of the MRND in any préfecture was the MRND official of that préfecture.  He was the one who monitored events of the MRND in his own préfecture.  He was the official of the party.  Now, there was also a committee of the Interahamwe at each préfecture level, and the said committee would report directly to the chairman of the MRND in that préfecture.  
Q.	Can you tell me who was the chairman of the Interahamwe in Kigali préfecture?  
A.	I know that the MRND coordinator in Kigali-ville préfecture was -- was Jean Habyarimana.  The chairman of the Interahamwe, I think it was Nzabanherura (phonetic) or someone else.  I'm not quite sure I remember right.  
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I'm going to ask you other questions regarding the MRND.  Through its national leadership, in other words, its executive committee, was it able to conceptualise, plan, carry out, and implement the execution of the Tutsi?  
A.	No, I'm not aware of that.  
Q.	Do you think that the MRND organised the Interahamwe in order to eliminate the Tutsis?  
A.	I do not think so.  
Q.	What do you mean by that?  
A.	It's because when the Interahamwe were established, I never heard that mentioned.  I never heard anyone from the executive or national committee say that, meaning that the Interahamwe were going to be established in order to execute or proceed to the killings of the Tutsis.  
Q.	You already stated that from the 6th of April 1994, Rwanda had become a jungle; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  There was no control as such.  People could kill, and they wouldn't be persecuted.  The ministries were there, but nothing was being done in order to bring about law and order or to ensure security in the country.  
Q.	Given that context, do you think that the MRND could proceed, other than by disseminating communiqués over the radio, in order to communicate with the population?  Would there have been any other means of communication?  
A.	I think there were other means that the authorities could use, be they from the MRND or from the government, in order to stop the chaos that was reigning, especially in Kigali.  
Q.	According to you, what would those means have been?  
A.	I can give you one example only.  Everything that was being said on the radio, all the speeches were beautiful speeches, but -- let's take an example.  There was a radio station which was there, and it was disseminating the contrary to what the authorities were preaching.  Why did that authority, which had the power and which had all the means -- it had all the soldiers; it had the gendarmerie under its control -- why did it not stop that radio station?  In that radio station, there were not more than 50 people.  They could be arrested and stop them from broadcasting.  They could have just gone on the ground, especially in Kigali.  If they had done that in Kigali, in the initial days, the killings would have stopped immediately.  The new government was installed.  
Q.	If the radio station was stopped from continuing with its broadcast as such, would the war have stopped?  
A.	There was a killing of the innocent people, and there was the war.  The war is something else.  One can have a war, but that wouldn't necessarily involve the killings of innocent members of the population.  
Q.	During that period of time, was there no other radio station which was also doing the same thing as the radio you've just referred to?  
A.	Well, if you want me to mention Radio Muhabura, yes, there was Radio Muhabura.  Radio Muhabura was not controlled by the government of Kigali, the government of Rwanda.  If the government could stop that radio station from broadcasting, it was easy.  It's not because Radio Muhabura was doing that that you also need to repeat the same thing.  I don't think so.
Q.	Very well.  Now, did it ever come about that you heard Radio Muhabura disseminating or broadcasting information that would go along with fanning the flames or pouring oil on the fires?  
A.	No, no, nothing about oil on fires.  
Q.	But what exactly did that radio station say?  
A.	It was asking the population not to follow the government in place, not to obey the government in place.  It was saying that it was necessary to remain calm, and sometimes it would -- it would mention which areas in Rwanda were experiencing killings.  
Q.	Did that radio station inform the population about the acts of violence perpetrated by the RPF?  
A.	It could not.  It could not.  That radio station could not do that.  
Q.	And why?  Why would that be?  
A.	You know, the RTLM radio station did not say what the population was doing.  
Q.	Given the war situation which was obtaining (sic), or the law of the jungle, the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, was it able to ensure that its own members obeyed the communiqués issued?  
A.	Could you please repeat that question, Counsel?  
Q.	Yes.  I'm saying that given the war situation that was prevailing -- and according to you, you said it was the reign of the law of the jungle -- the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe, was it able to ensure that its members obeyed the communiqués that were broadcast?  
A.	I do not think so, because the committee, per se, was scattered right from the 6th of April 1994.  
Q.	When you learnt of the crash of the aircraft of the president of the republic, you stated on 18th October 2005, in your examination-in-chief, that you thought right away that it was the RPF; and you also stated that a Tutsi friend, before the president of the republic took the oath of office, informed you of the possibility of the president having been killed by the RPF.  She allegedly told you that Kagame forcibly threatened the MRND into accepting the Arusha Accords.  Is that not so? 
A.	No, I didn't say that.  Kagame, himself, said that on the radio.  I'm not the one who said that my friend told me about that, no.  
Q.	Very well.  When Mr. Robinson said to you -- put it to you, "Would you agree with me that the person responsible for the assassination of President Habyarimana bears a heavy responsibility for the events that followed," you answered "yes."  Is that not so?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Tell me, Witness, before President Habyarimana was assassinated, weren't other political leaders killed?  
A.	Yes.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, with your leave, I should like to look at document number 4 that I've disclosed to the parties and to the witness.  This document is, in fact, an excerpt from André Guichaoua's book about the political crisis in Rwanda and Burundi in 1993 and 1994.  That document was disclosed by the Prosecution, and it is numbered K0287918.  

I have a correction, Mr. President.  This is not an excerpt from Mr. Guichaoua's book but, rather, his expert report.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you have the document with you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Look at the first page.  There's a reference to inset number 4, assassinations of Félicien Gatabazi and Martin Bucyana.  Do you see that, Witness?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Please look at the second page of the document which describes the assassinations and infiltrations from the RPF into the Interahamwe.  Let me read the passages of interest here.  This is on page 2, in the middle of the second paragraph.  There's mention of Sergeant Mugisha, nicknamed Interahamwe, one of the members of the Kigali commandos, among the most demanded of this -- for this type, rather, of operation, who was also known as an activist of the Interahamwe militia, which he was able to infiltrate.  

Are you following, Witness?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	Let me then go to the last but one paragraph.  "Devastating suspicion immediately arose amongst those close to President Habyarimana.  The presidential camp accused the leaders of the opposition, participating in the meeting at the Meridien" -- then there's a parentheses -- "allegations Gasana (sic) speaks about in his work, Rwanda, From a Party State to a Garrison State."  Paris L'Harmattan edition 2002, page 245.  Then parentheses, closed.  

"In that context, the elimination of Bucyana, chairman of the CDR, appeared natural since he was lynched by the population in the commune of Mbazi, on the initiative of militants of the PSD party.  Those assassinations led to violent confrontations, amongst the militias of the parties in Kigali, resulting in 37 deaths.  Those confrontations were regional in nature and between Hutus. It would come to a halt when the leaders of the parties involved took measures of political dividends that the RPF would withdraw.  As in January 1993, after the massacres of Tutsis, an opponent -- political opponents in the préfectures of Gisenyi, Ruhengeri, Kibuye, and Byumba, preceded the violation of the ceasefire, and massive attacks on Ruhengeri and Byumba on the 8th of February, as early as the 24th of February 1994.  

"The RPF threatened, over Radio Muhabura, to resume the war in the face of the political standstill which was blamed on the presidential camp.  And so it used the Ugandan media from the end of February to early March 1994, to prepare its supporters for a sure victory.  In Uganda Confidential, from 28 February to 7 March 1994, you read that Kagame's chances of taking Kigali have multiplied by 100 -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I find myself on my feet.  I apologise to Mr. Sow.  My learned friend is reading from an expert's report, and I assume he's going to ask a question of the witness about whether he agrees with what's being read to him, but we've had so much read at this stage that a simple question is not likely to elicit a clear answer.  I would invite that if my learned friend is going to refer to the Guichaoua report or any other reports, as distinct from speeches which recall what was said by various characters in Rwanda at the time, instead we're dealing with expert reports here and express opinions as to historical events, if such material is going to be put in front of the witness, I would invite that my learned friend identify short sections and then ask whatever relevant questions he has.  My learned friend has been reading now for about five minutes, and I don't quite comprehend how a witness is going to answer whatever question he then asks.  
MR. SOW:
I apologise, but I don't believe that I was too long.  I was about to finish when the objection came.  I would simply request patience, and you will hear the questions put to the witness very briefly.  Of course these questions will deal with the events that took place.  I've already asked him if political leaders were assassinated prior to the 6th of April 1994, and he answered yes to that question.  So now I'm continuing with that line of questions, Mr. President.  With your leave, I should like to proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may continue.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Let me finish the passage.  "In the People edition of 4 to 8 March 1994, one can read quotes from Paul Kagame, where he says that he has the resources, the equipment, and the troops to take Kigali one day and that he is prepared to do so."  

So I've finished reading the passage.  Witness, the document I've just alluded to describes the assassinations of Félicien Gatabazi and Martin Bucyana.  Were you aware that those assassinations took place?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you tell me if expert witness Guichaoua's version is an accurate reflection of what actually happened?  
A.	I know that some political party authorities were assassinated, but I cannot interpret Mr. Guichaoua's work.  I think that question is best put to Mr. Guichaoua, if he is convinced about what he's written.  I'm not the one who should answer that question.  
Q.	Isn't it correct that if early on the assassinations were blamed on what they called the presidential camp, later on evidence was adduced that those political figures were, in fact, assassinated by the RPF?  What do you think?  
A.	I can't affirm anything.  Were there any investigations into that?  What is certain is that for Bucyana, there was an investigation into the assassination of him, and there were suspects from Butare.  That's all I can say.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  With regard to the assassination of the president on the 6th of April 1994, did it not create psychosis amongst the population and fear in a survival instinct, as well as provoke anger amongst those people?  Perhaps you haven't understood the question.  
A.	Yes, I've understood.  I don't know how to answer you.  That's the problem.  Who asked the population to rise up like that?  It was almost automatic.  The plane went down and immediately people began to massacre.  Did the population start to massacre one another?  I'm not sure.  What is certain is that in Kigali, after the plane went down, what I know for sure, immediately there was a roadblock at the roundabout that -- which was manned, that roadblock, by the Presidential Guard.  Many people were arrested at that roadblock.  I know some people who were arrested there as early as the 6th of April.  So the population was angry.  I don't know.  They may be angry, but they also may have been able to contain their anger.  
Q.	Well, with regard to that anger, number 1 talked about it in an attempt to explain the killings that were going on.  
A.	He explained when?  I'm talking about the 6th of April.  Number 1 on Exhibit P. 9, himself, was stopped at that roadblock; so was number 3, I believe, stopped at that Presidential Guard roadblock.  Up until the 10th of April, number 1 didn't show his face.  He was in a place that was occupied by the RPF.  That's all I can tell you, Counsel.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, before we proceed, I would request that the description of the assassinations of Félicien Gatabazi and Martin Bucyana, and as described in the excerpts distributed to the parties, be tendered as Exhibit D. K4.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, in respect of that application, I would offer the thought that, it being an expert report which the witness was unable to comment on, was unable to adopt its contents, either by way of agreement or possibly identify things he disagrees with, one wonders what status this has as an exhibit.  It's not evidence of the assassination and the background to it, because it is not something that the witness has been able to endorse.  It's right to say that this material will all become live before the Tribunal when Mr. Guichaoua gives evidence, but in terms of the propriety of offering that short report through this witness into evidence, presumably, as evidence of the truth of its contents, I respectfully submit there's no foundation, and it is evidentially improper.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Is Mr. Guichaoua being called by the Prosecutor?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry, Your Honour.  My headphones aren't working very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is he actually going to be called by the Prosecutor?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, just give me a moment.  

It's intended that he will be an expert witness at some point.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's our position that an excerpt from an expert report such as this should be admitted for identification only and that when the adequate foundation is laid through the expert, it can be admitted.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, (inaudible).  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. Nzirorera and myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  If I've used this document, it's simply to talk about the assassinations of certain political figures, indeed, this witness has acknowledged.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that to get the document admitted through this witness, it's an uphill task.  Do you adopt the proposal that Mr. Robinson has made as having it marked for identification only at this stage?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we could mark it for identification.  

What would be it's identification number, Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I believe it's ID. K1.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted -- marked for identification.  
MR. SOW:
With your leave, Mr. President, I wish to now deal with document number 5, which has been disclosed to the witness and to the parties.  This document deals with the circumstances of the assassination of President Habyarimana.  This is an article written in Le Monde of 7 May 2004.  In that article, Mr. Guichaoua was interviewed.  The document I've distributed is four pages long, and there are some passages which are of interest.  I simply wish to quickly raise those and point them out and then ask questions to the witness about the assassination of the president on the 6th of April 1994.  I wish to do this because that assassination marked the beginning of the killings.  And as such, it is a very critical period.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, very briefly -- if the witness might take off his headphones, please, and for that to be confirmed.  Thank you.  

I invite Your Honour to consider where this particular aspect is going.  The witness has already said to my learned friend at an earlier time, and I think also to my learned friend, Mr. Robinson, that he, the witness, doesn't know what the circumstances of the assassination were.  He jumped to the conclusion it may have been the RPF, but to offer him an expert report or an article involving a -- an interview with an expert and invite his comment on what the witness, therefore, makes of the shooting-down of the plane may be an evidential vacuity.  It's a matter for Your Honour.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I have the impression that the Prosecution has not followed what the witness has been saying.  I have simply asked him to confirm if, when he heard of the news, he thought of the RPF and that the RPF was responsible.  He said yes.  We've heard the witnesses comment on the assassination.  He was asked about this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, it's 1:30.  We'll just give an indication of what we are thinking.  We have ruled already that the issue of who was responsible for the killing, we don't think it's relevant in the trial.  Now, we don't think that that is what you are investigating at the moment, but -- so we would have a line somewhere around there.  As far as I understand your questioning, you're addressing the issue of spontaneity as what -- as a trigger for the -- for the killings, and we permit you to investigate that.  So we will allow the question that you have put 'cause we don't think that you have crossed the line as yet.  

In terms of time economies, we are going to take the break now, so I don't know if it would suit your purposes if the witness could look at the document during the lunch break, which may make it unnecessary for you to actually spend time reading it on the record, unless you had some additional purpose for doing so.  But with those few remarks, we could take the lunch break now.  

About how much more time do you think you will need to complete your examination?  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I had estimated, in total, three hours.  I've used about two-and-a-half.  So if there were no disruptions from my learned friend on the other side, I would have finished.  But it would be a good idea for the witness to look at the document beforehand.  I thought, in fact, he already had.  I had disclosed the documents prior to my examination of the witness.  At any rate, I will do my best to not waste the Court's time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you think you may finish in approximately half an hour or so after the lunch break?  The information is needed for scheduling.  See, we have another -- something else for this afternoon, and I'd just like to make scheduling arrangements.  So is approximately half an hour your best estimate?  
MR. SOW:
I believe, maximum, I will take 45 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Registrar, you could use that information in managing Witness GFJ.  
MR. FRY:
Understood, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Well, we take the lunch break.  We'll resume at 3:30 Arusha time, 2:30, The Hague. 
(Court recessed from 1335H to 1542H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can resume now.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  Can you hear me?  
A.	Yes, I can.  
Q.	Did you manage to use the lunch break to look at Guichaoua's interview?  
A.	Yes.  I've looked it over.  
Q.	Thank you.  In the document you have, Guichaoua was interviewed on the assassination of the president of the republic, Mr. Habyarimana.  At the same time, he also mentioned the terror campaign concerning attacks made by APCs and tanks.  He also made reference to the elections which took place in Kirambo sous-préfecture.  What I want to ask you now is whether the version of the elections in Kirambo that Guichaoua gave, where he believes that the MRND won the elections, after which the members leaders of the MRND, who were elected, were arrested and then murdered in the so-called demilitarised zone.  Does that version of the facts given by Mr. Guichaoua correspond to the reality?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, I believe we've lost The Hague in the wires.  
MR. SOW:
The connection to The Hague has been disconnected.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar?  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you want me to ask you the question again, or do you already understand it?  
A.	I believe I already heard it, and I believe Mr. Guichaoua's version of the events is a reflection of the reality at the time.  
Q.	Thank you.  What about the infiltrators?  The provisional national Interahamwe committee brought out a communiqué in February 1994, and in that communiqué, the committee condemns very strongly anyone demonstrating illegally or passing for Interahamwe through the use of the Interahamwe uniform.  This communiqué was the exhibit tendered and recorded as D. NZ17.  This is my question.  If the committee brought out this communiqué, what kind of infiltration was it referring to -- the committee -- what the committee was referring to, in your view?  
A.	When the national -- when the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe issued this communiqué -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm concerned about the last question that was asked and actually answered by the witness concerning Guichaoua's article.  First of all, I believe my colleague made an observation before we came to the break earlier this morning, which I would like to renew, which is, what is the evidenciary basis for trying to move the contents of this article before the Trial Chamber?  Now, Mr. Sow's question took me a bit by surprise because I've looked through the entire four-page article, and I don't see any reference to the elections and the sous-préfecture of Kirambo and a good portion of the information that he put to the witness.  So right now, as far as I can see, unless Mr. Sow can redirect me to a specific portion in this article, I'm a bit confused because it seems to me that he has mixed his own formulation with some of the formulations in this article.  I may be incorrect, but I've just looked at it for the last minute, and I can't find the references that he mentioned.  

Now, there's a paragraph where there's a discussion of the (French spoken) and a portion of what he says, but the reason that we raised this objection in the first place is because, how do we list content of this article of an expert, of an interview with an expert, into evidence by compounding the question we put to this witness?  So, I mean, that's my concern.  I think the only way the Court can address it is to read the article itself and to compare it with Mr. Sow's question, but maybe Mr. Sow can help us out because I'm at a loss here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we're not stopping the question, but we are concerned that the content of the document is not slipped into evidence by -- you know, inferentially.  So we don't want you to -- to sort of read the document into the record, but you may enquire and get the witness to comment on it.  It's not admitted in evidence yet.  It's just an exhibit.  So you can comment on it.  Sorry, it's just there for identification.  We don't know if it will be admitted or not.  So you can comment on it, but its content is not part of the record as yet.  I suppose it's a question as to how you phrase your questions.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This particular document has not even been identified for the record.  This is the -- what Mr. Sow is reading from or paraphrasing was the article that appeared in Le Monde which was an interview with André Guichaoua that was conducted by Steven Smith.  So it's not even André Guichaoua's writing.  It's an interview that he had with the author of the article.  Mr. Sow formulated a question based on a part of the content of this interview and then other information that he brought into his question.  So my objection or my observation is, I don't know what was actually put to the witness.  Is it what Guichaoua said, what Mr. Sow added?  So the whole procedure to me seems awkward, and that's what's -- the concern I'm expressing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  I didn't understand it exactly in that way.  You see, we think that what is relevant to the record is not the question, but the witness's commentary.  So what becomes evidence is what the witness says, not the way in which the question is put.  So that was -- that is the concern that we were addressing basically.  
MR. WEBSTER:
But my concern Your Honour is that the witness just said, "Yes, I agree," which means that he agrees to everything that Mr. Sow has said.  So the whole procedure to me seems awkward and clumsy because I don't know what is coming from where.  Is it Mr. Sow's formulation?  Is it Guichaoua's formulation?  Is it the Witness's formulation?  The whole way of leading this line of questioning to me seems inappropriate, and I'm expressing my concern because I don't want this to become a pattern in -- in Mr. Sow's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My concern about that is not the same as yours, because the witness should be able to know what he agrees to or what he doesn't agree to.  At the end of the day what interests us is what the witness's view is, not what Mr. Sow is putting to him.  And so we (unintelligible) that the witness would be discriminating in his answer.  

Now, if the objection is that the question was unclear and confusing, then we could ask Mr. Sow to clarify the question and make it clear exactly what you're putting, because I understand Mr. Webster to be saying that the question confused him.  He didn't understand exactly what you were putting, and maybe you could clarify it.  

Am I putting it correctly, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That's part of my concern, but I think the Court has already expressed itself, and we can move on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to specify that I did not read out André Guichaoua's interview because you had suggested that I give the witness the time to read the interview and then I proceed with my questioning.  And, indeed, it would seem that the witness did not read the interview because there are parts which are concerning the Kirambo elections.  If now I'm authorised to do so by the President, I will.  I'll read out what he said in the document.  
THE WITNESS:
No, the name "Kirambo" is not in the text.  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Kirambo is not mentioned, per se, in the text, but the events concerning Kirambo were related by Guichaoua.  They were recounted by Guichaoua.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Mr. Sow -- Mr. Sow, it's not necessary to address me any further.  We are permitting you to continue.  We've given you some guidelines of what we think will comply with our understanding of the rules, and you may continue with your questions.   
MR. SOW:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Now, Witness, coming specifically now to the infiltrations, you, together with the Prosecutor, raised on the 13th of October 2005, here, before this Chamber -- and the transcripts are of the 13th October, page 6, line 5 -- the various acts of violence perpetrated by the youth wings of the various parties.  Is it true that the MDR, through Kubohoza, tried to destabilise the Interahamwe?  
A.	I would say that it didn't want to destabilise the Interahamwe.  It wanted to destabilise the MRND. 
Q.	Did you ever hear mention made of an organisation known as ODI?  
A.	ODI, you say?  
Q.	Yes, the Organisation for the Destabilisation of the Interahamwe, ODI.  
A.	No.  
Q.	Thank you.  Can you tell me how the youth of the opposition worked together with the RPF?  
A.	Could you please repeat your question, Counsel. 
(Pages 29 to 43 by Wendy Molnar)




































      1500H
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Can you tell me how the use of the opposition worked together with the RPF? 
A.	Apart from the fact that the PSD party organised marches and meetings, together with RPF at Mulindi, and the PSD youths would go and participate in football or volleyball matches with the youths of the RPF.  Apart from that party, I do not see any other party.  Maybe the PL, which went to visit the RPF in Mulindi, but other than that, I don't see any other kind of meeting or -- I do not see.  I don't quite see.  Because the only party which would send its youths for visits was the PSD, I believe.  That's all I know about that, Counsel. 
Q.	Were you aware of the joint communiqué issued by the MDR, PSD, and PL, and the RPF in Brussels at a meeting which took place at the end of May or beginning of June?  The communiqué is dated 
	3rd of June 1992 and the communiqué, amongst the various parties I mentioned, dealt with their desire to unite against the MRND in Rwanda.  
A.	I have the communiqué here with me, and it's number 7 of the documents you issued?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	They said that the MRND was not invited to that meeting.  But what you have just said, I cannot trace in this communiqué. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would wish that this communiqué, which is number 7 of my documents, can be referred to so that I can show to the witness that the passage which is of interest to us and which shows that, between these different parties, there was a joint decision to unite in order to contract the dictatorial regime in Rwanda. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, please look at document number 7 and please go down about three quarters of the way down that page, and you will see the paragraph beginning with (French spoken).  Have you seen it? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	So the permanent system of consultation was also set up; the modalities of that consultation were to be specified later.  From this point on, and in the meantime, coordinated actions in the areas of information, diplomacy, and population sensitisations could take place in order to explain the misdeeds of the dictatorial regime of Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Now, for you, this paragraph I've just read, what does it represent? 
A.	For me, it is denouncing the dictatorial regime in Rwanda, but this doesn't mean that they want to remove the MRND from Rwanda. 
Q.	Isn't it true that the RPF leaders, the PSD, and the PL would send members of their youth wings to the RPF camps in Mulindi for visits? 
A.	I'm not aware of that, but this is what people were saying, and maybe it's true.  Families would send their children for training in Mulindi.
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, document number 9, I would wish -- number 7, I beg your pardon -- I would wish that this be tendered as an exhibit and provided with a relevant number. 

Mr. Registrar, can you come to our aid please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, it's Exhibit D. K3. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. K3 admitted)
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, now I only have to deal with part of my cross-examination dealing with the presence of Mr. Karemera, and then I will have finished. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, on the 10th of October 2005, in examination in-chief, in response to a Prosecution question which said, "How many times have you met Edouard Karemera?" You responded, "Four times."  Can you specify where and when you met him? 
A.	I met him on the 10th of April at the hotel, The Diplomat.  I met him in Butare during the ceremony to install Préfet Nteziryayo.  I met him again in a meeting of the Interahamwe.  He showed up for a few minutes.  And then the fourth time I met him was at my office. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to ask you some questions about those various meetings.  You met him on the 10th of April 1994, at the Hotel des diplomates.  You said that on the 11th of October 2005, that Édouard Karemera and Mugenzi, Justin, were overjoyed at the fact that there were many, many corpses, and you said that you could see it on their faces, and the way they were carrying themselves.  From that, Witness, must I understand that Edouard Karemera didn't know there were killings, whereas you were commissioned to undertake a pacification campaign, to put a stop to those very killings? 
A.	What I can say is, for me, Karemera didn't think there would be so many corpses.  He thought there would be fewer.  And when he was told that there were many, that was when he displayed those emotions. 
Q.	Yes, but he knew full well.  And furthermore, the international media had spoken to this at length, that there were many killings, and it wasn't for nothing that you had that mission to go out and tell the population to stop the killings and bury the dead.  He could not have ignored these events at that time? 
A.	I'm simply telling you what I saw.  If he was unaware, I simply could see that he was satisfied when he heard how many victims there were.  
Q.	When you said that you undertook the mission successfully that was given to you -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we apologise from the interpretation booth.  There has been some interference and we could not hear counsel's question. 
THE WITNESS:
(Not interpreted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I wanted to interrupt you.  

Mr. Sow, the translators did not get your question and they have asked if you could repeat the question.  There was interference with the sound. 
MR. SOW:
I apologise, Mr. President.  This was the question:   
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, don't you think, and according to what you said, if Mr. Karemera, as you said, displayed joy, that it could be attributed to the fact that you successfully undertook the mission you were tasked with? 
A.	First, thank you for accepting -- acknowledging that Mr. Karemera was there, because Robinson, your learned colleague, said that I was mistaken.  He said that Karemera wasn't there.  I'm telling you that you could see how he expressed himself and he showed satisfaction when he heard the number of dead people.  And I told you, furthermore, you're telling me the same thing that counsel for Mr. Mugenzi told me last year. 
Q.	Witness, I apologise.  I did not say or acknowledge that he was there or not.  I didn't acknowledge anything.  I'm simply putting questions to you, and that's my role.  And the next question is this one:   Did you know that at that time, at the hotel, The Diplomat, Mr. Karemera was busy drafting a communiqué criticising the meeting of five political parties participating in the government at the very moment you were participating in that meeting? 
A.	Let me confirm once again that he was at that meeting. 
Q.	Very well.  Tell me about the meeting with the Interahamwe in which Mr. Karemera participated? 
A.	I wouldn't really say he participated.  He was passing through.  He came through the room where we were having the meeting.  There were also MRND officers there, and he had to go through there because the meeting was taking place in the entry hall, and so he simply came through and greeted us.  He did not speak as such during the meeting. 
Q.	Very well.  Thank you.  What about the meeting at your office; tell us about that one? 
A.	Mr. Karemera ************************************************************************************************* **************************************************************************************************************** **************************************************************************************************************
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me ask you questions about Édouard Karemera in Butare.  

MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like us to look at document number 6.  That document is a statement by a Witness X, which was disclosed to us by the Office of the Prosecutor. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, do you have that document? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	I would like to ask you a series of questions about this document.  After the 12th of April 1994, you went to Butare; where did you stay? 
A.	In Butare. 
Q.	Exactly where? 
A.	I can't say in public session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we are concerned whether that would be a closed-session question.  To identify his place of residence in Butare might not be a proper question in open session. 
MR. SOW:
I can set that question aside for the time being, and perhaps there will be a series of questions that will have to be asked in closed session.  I hoped to do everything in open session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us on which date number 1 arrived in Butare? 
A.	What I do know is that it was during the month of May. 
Q.	Where did he stay in Butare? 
A.	He stayed in a hotel in Butare. 
Q.	How long did he stay there?  Until which month? 
A.	Well, until Butare was taken at the end of June.  Maybe the -- early July -- no, late June. 
Q.	At that point in time was number 1 ill? 
A.	Yes, he was seriously ill. 
Q.	Did you visit him on a regular basis? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	At that time did he ever organise any Interahamwe meetings in Butare? 
A.	He didn't have the strength even to speak.  He couldn't have done so. 
Q.	Did you ever meet Lieutenant Colonel Alphonse Nteziryayo -- and I will spell that, N-T-E-Z-I-R-A-Y-A-Y-O (sic)? 
A.	Yes, I've met him on several occasions. 
Q.	Where?  Where was your meeting place? 
A.	We met at the hotel.  I met him also at the préfecture office when he was préfect. 
Q.	Why did you meet him at the hotel? 
A.	He stayed there.  In fact, he stayed in the same hotel as number 1. 
Q.	Be it before or after the 6th of April, and up until your departure in exile, were you aware of any orders whatsoever given by Nteziryayo to the Interahamwe to kill people in Butare or in the surrounding areas of Butare? 
A.	What I do know is before Nteziryayo became préfet of Butare, he was in charge of the civilian defence for Butare.  He would tour all of the communes in Butare préfecture.  He would meet the young people in Butare on those tours. 
Q.	Still, with regard to Alphonse Nteziryayo and number 1, did they ever organise the massacre of people by using Interahamwe in Butare or the surrounding areas? 
A.	I told you that number 1 arrived to Butare when the killings had already come to a halt.  In all of Rwanda, there were practically no more killings. 
Q.	Is it true that you were in Butare when Colonel Alphonse Nteziryayo was appointed préfet of Butare on the 17th of June 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I was in Butare. 
Q.	Can you confirm that you met Minister Edouard Karemera in Butare when he came to inaugurate Colonel Alphonse Nteziryayo as the new préfet? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that. 
Q.	Can you tell us when and where the ceremony took place? 
A.	I can't be specific with the date, but I know it was in the MRND offices -- the former MRND offices. 
Q.	Isn't it true that at that time some communes in the préfecture had already fallen into the hands of the RPF, and the city itself was under serious threat? 
A.	Not the city of Butare. 
Q.	Weren't there some communes that were occupied by the RPF? 
A.	I wouldn't say so.  There was fear in the communes around Kigali and the communes bordering Burundi.  
Q.	For example, communes such as Nyabisindu, Ruhashya, Muhira, Ntyazo, Rutasira; weren't those communes occupied by the RPF? 
A.	In Mayaga, people began to flee the region.  It was difficult to go to Buhongo.  The roads were occupied by soldiers; one side Rwandan soldiers and RPF on the other. 
Q.	Do you confirm that you had information about Sylvain Nsabimana, the préfet, after the incident which took place at a roadblock manned by soldiers where the préfet had a list of orphans with him? 
A.	Yes.  I know why he was removed from office.  He had lists of people to evacuate, and on the list were some Tutsis and friends of his family. 
Q.	Is that why he was removed from office? 
A.	That's what I heard.  That is why I heard he was replaced. 
Q.	Préfet Sylvain Nsabimana was inaugurated on 19 April 1994 in Butare.  Prime Minister Kambanda mentioned all of the authorities who were present.  I've noticed that the name of Edouard Karemera is not mentioned.  Can you explain this for us, Witness? 
A.	Yes, because when Sylvain Nsabimana took office, Karemera wasn't minister of interior and he was not in Butare.  He only came to Butare for the inauguration of Colonel Alphonse Nteziryayo. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification, Witness.  Can you confirm that when they say 
	"Lieutenant Colonel Alphonse Nteziryayo was the man for the task," Karemera was talking about this Butare native, administrator, and soldier who could easily cooperate with the secteur commanders of Gikongoro and Butare to face the critical situation of the RPF's rapid advance toward the area? 
A.	You know, at that time there were no killings; there was war.  Butare was not subject to RPF attacks at that time, but people were afraid in Butare.  To be the man of the hour or for the task, perhaps it was because he was a soldier. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would seek to tender the last document into evidence.  It's my document number 6, which I have disclosed to all the parties.  I should like to tender it as Exhibit D. K3 -- 4. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  If it's the document which is headed "inter-office memorandum" and is the disclosure of English and French versions of a statement, then whilst my learned friend is welcome to put this in evidence, first of all, it is simply a previous consistent statement on the part of the witness.  And secondly, it refers to all sorts of others matters which have not been dealt with.  And thirdly, the document hasn't been used at any stage to cross-examine the witness.  So in terms of what the rules of evidence are here, I'm not entirely sure.  But the putting in of the statement, if he wants to do it, he can.  But I'm not quite clear about what the procedural rule is by which it's going in evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Sow, I would be interested in hearing you on this matter.  Normally the statement made by a witness is used to show that there was an inconsistency between the statement and the witness's testimony, and it might be put in where that exists.  But I'm not (inaudible).  
MR. SOW:
In fact, Mr. President, the witness confirmed that, indeed, Edouard Karemera was not present during the inauguration ceremony on the 19th of April.  It is for that reason I sought to admit the document since there is a change, a development, in fact, with regard to the statements which were later on confirmed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand.  You said the witness has admitted that what he said here contradicts the testimony he gave in this court.  
MR. SOW:
I'm talking about the prior statements.  In the statement that you have, clarifications were made.  We've always thought and said that Mr. Karemera was present during the ceremony of the 19th of April, which was not the case.  And that has been confirmed by the document that I seek to tender into evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're not quite at the same point yet.  As far as I understand the rules, a statement taken from a witness would be admitted in evidence where it is demonstrated that the statement contradicts testimony which the witness gave in trial.  In order to do that, it would be necessary to draw the attention of the witness to what he had said, and he should have an opportunity to comment on it if it contradicts his testimony in this trial.  I'm not aware that you have done that as yet, as I am not aware that this statement has been introduced to contradict testimony which the witness has given in this trial.  So basically I thought that the objection raised by Mr. Morley was well founded. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, under the circumstances I withdraw my request, and I thank you.  And I also wish to thank the witness for having answered my questions.  I am done.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 

Mr. Witness at The Hague, that concludes our linkages today.  We will now take the adjournment on that aspect of our proceedings and we resume tomorrow morning at the usual time. 

We will take here a short break now, and then we will resume with our -- with Witness GFJ after our break.

So, we can resume our sitting.  We are just going to confirm that we are back in Arusha.  We are no longer connected with The Hague, are we? 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, yes, we have cut the connection with The Hague.  
THE PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you very much. 
Good afternoon, everybody.  We have received the Registrar's submission in response to the order that we made concerning the retention of the witness's passport and we have decided to order that it is  a submission that is disclosed to the parties.  So we make that order now.  
We also expect a supplemental filing with the Registrar disclosing a communication from the Rwanda authorities which we also order to be disclosed to the parties.  We have not seen that supplemental filing as yet, but we expect it and we make the order for its disclosure.   

So, Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, as a result of the steps that we have taken, the Registrar has indicated that your passport is being returned to you.  Have you received it as yet? 
THE WITNESS: 
I think that I have obtained the same information which goes in line with what you have said from the Witness and Victims Services section.  I have been shown a document which I am supposed to sign.  I think maybe you can look at the document in question.  The person who gave me that document left me their telephone number.  However, before we proceed, I would like to thank the government of Rwanda.  As I stated yesterday, Mr. Robinson had asked me a question, saying, in that that I was being looked for by the Rwandan government and that was the reason why my passport was confiscated.  From the person whom I received this document, I have been informed that the Rwandan government is not pursuing me for any motive whatsoever, that I have not done anything wrong, however, Mr. President. The origin of all these rumors has not been shown to the Chamber.  We should get to know why my passport was  confiscated.  I informed you, Mr. President, that I had matters to submit to you at the end of my testimony and that the staff of this tribunal had a role in the matter.  It is a long story, 
Mr. President, but I shall come to you with it at the end of my testimony.  These are issues which may make me run the risk of being killed and have all this blamed on the Rwandan government.  Therefore, I wish that the person who confiscated my passport to explain to you the reasons why.  Now, I have been given a document, a piece of paper on which I need to sign in order to certify that I have received my passport back.  But I know that you have carried out an investigation, at the end of which my passport was returned to me.  But, that person -- I am not talking about an investigation, I think the interpreter mentioned the term investigation, no, that's not true. 
UNKNOWN SPEAKER:  
Listen, the fact of the passport. 
THE WITNESS:  
I am talking about an investigation, which needed -- needs to be carried out so that we know why my passport was confiscated.  Even in June I wrote to the tribunal presenting my complaints.  At a given point in time I was even given a passport, or travel document from the Tribunal, and I was authorised to travel with my own passport.  As for the allegations according to which the government of Rwanda is after me, those are false allegations which are intended to tarnish the name of the Rwandan government.  This is why the Rwandan government communicated to the Tribunal information according to which I was not being sought, and this needs to be made clear.  To conclude, I would like to ask the Chamber to summon the person who confiscated my passport so that they can provide the necessary explanations.  
THE PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson.
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President. 
THE PRESIDENT: 
It is clear that you have a number of other matters to deal with in your cross-examination.  So we are going to ask you to continue.  We are going to ask the Registrar to take steps to expedite the disclosure of the matters to the parties, so as soon as he is able to get copies, they will be distributed to you.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you. 
THE PRESIDENT: 
	But we hope -- we don't think that we should interrupt the rest of your cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That is fine, Mr. President, and Mr. President, I do want to thank the Trial Chamber, I think you got to the bottom of the situation and I think you were correct in direct -- in ensuring that this witness's passport was returned to him.  Myself, I spoke with the representative of the government of Rwanda, who is here in the gallery right now, Mr. Butabingwa, and he confirmed there were no charges pending against this witness in Rwanda, and there is no reason for the Registry to retain the passport.  From my point of view, this witness,even though he is a Prosecution witness, he is to be treated fairly in this by the Tribunal and I want to make sure that other witnesses when -- especially when there is the testimony in their own name, that they are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.  I think I would join with this witness in asking this matter be investigated in why this witness -- the victims section of this Tribunal (inaudible) I think that is wrong and anyway, I think the Tribunal Chamber did the right thing and I thank you for that.  With that said, I will go on with my questioning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, Mr. Witness, you are trying to attract my attention.  What do you wish to say?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, there is something which Mr. Robinson has said, and we should not give importance to what he said; he said that a representative of the Rwandan government, maybe he should also be given the opportunity to speak and maybe I will have the opportunity to know him because I do not know him.  That is number one.  

Number two, Mr. Robinson has spoken to you the way in which he has, and yesterday, I had told you, that this subject should not be completed but -- this is necessary and we are going to proceed with the proceedings and we haven't solved this matter completely.  

Mr. President, I don't want to give you the impression that I am bothering the Chamber, but I think I am at the end of my tether. 

My passport has been returned to me. Now, the person who has retained my passport should come before the chamber and he will have the opportunity of explaining to you that I have had other problems that I have not mentioned here.  This would be a good precedent because no other witness, be they from the Prosecution or the Defence, would not have to suffer what I have suffered here.  You made mention of the representative of the government who is in the gallery.  And I do not know that person.  It would be a good opportunity for me to get to know that gentleman as Mr. Robinson has referred to him a moment ago.  

Those are my two requests which I wish to submit to Your Honours.  And first of all, kindly facilitate my meeting with the representative, and that the person who confiscated my passport be summoned before the chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, there are proper channels to achieve the forum for remedies for different types of complaints.

What we are doing here is managing a particular trial.  And we were interested in addressing an issue of your rights as a witness in our case.  The issue that you have raised may involve issues which need a different forum for it to be resolved.  We are not at present persuaded that this is an appropriate forum to address your complaints that you have just referred to.  We will still think about it, but that is the view that we have at the moment.  Your request to be introduced to the representative of the government of Rwanda is also a matter that we can do nothing about.  We cannot invite him into the Chamber and we cannot facilitate your request.  So there will have to be other channels through which that can occur.  That is not something that we can do.  Do you understand?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood you, Mr. President.  I have no problem -- we may proceed. 
THE PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, thank you very much.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:   
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I am going to go back and ask you some questions about information that you received from Mr. Nsengi(sic)  In June 1992.  You tell us that he informed you of a plot to kill by Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  So can you tell us whether he informed you of this on the telephone or in person?  
A.	I am sorry.  You know, since it is the month of Ramadan, at this time of day, I get tired but I will make an effort.  And I will tell you the truth, and here we are in a struggle for the truth. What I can say to you, Mr. Robinson, as I have already explained, as I already explained when I was referring to Mr.Turatsinze, when I left the Amarandi (sic), Turatsinze warned me by telephone, he even gave me other information, but he warned me of the plot which was being hatched against me.  He even gave me other information subsequently.  That is the situation as it was, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Just limiting ourselves right now to the telephone conversation you had with Turatsinze when he first informed you of this plot, can you tell us, as best you can recall, what he told you?  
A.	Turatsinze, he warned me, by telling me that Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who is there behind you -- he warned me, telling me that people had plotted to -- to kill me.  Subsequently one evening a grenade was thrown at me, but luckily the grenade did not hit me and I decided to move house and I went to live at my sister's house in Gasata.  

At one point you said that I was someone who was being sought and that I was working with Desire Murenzi and you were wondering how that was possible.  You had at one point asked me why these people who were looking for me didn't finally end up finding the opportunity to kill me.  I was telling you that I was in Gatsata at the entrance to my sister's house.  Later on these people obtained information, according to which I was at my sister's at Gatsata.  And this made me move once again to go to live at another sister's house who was living in Kiyovu.  At that time I was living the life of a prisoner or detainee.  Eventually they knew that I was at that sister in Kiyovu's house and again I had to leave and I went to my sister's house, who was in Nyamirambo.  Eventually, Kassim telephoned me to tell me that once again he was aware of my new abode.  May God help him, wherever he is.  So finally I stayed in Nyakabanda until the time when my sister married a white man and she went to live in Holland, in Vernigen.  Later on, I earned some little money and I bought the house.  We signed a sale agreement on the 11th of July, 1993.  I married and I lived in that house and that is where I am until the present moment, Mr. Robinson.  So, it is there in Nyakabanda where we are.  That is the explanation which I tried to summarise because otherwise there are other incidents which did occur.  
Q.	When the grenade was thrown at you, did you report that matter to the police? 
A.	I am sorry, for having laughed.  I don't think that is acceptable to the Tribunal but let me say the following; as I have explained, it was the  Interahamwe who were using those grenades. I think I even explained what happened at the Baobab where the Interahamwe would obtain the grenades from.  If it was necessary to inform the gendarme,  when it was the gendarmerie itself that was distributing the weapons?  What use would that be?  I do not think you understand the complex nature of the situation at that time.  Maybe your clients can help you in understanding this if they are able to speak the truth.  At that point in time there were many grenade attacks which occurred and people were killed following those grenade attacks.  Have you understood me, Mr. Robinson? In fact, even before 1994, acts of genocide had already begun.  These were things which were planned, until we got to the time when many people were exterminated in 1994.  What I want to do is to show you that the gendarmerie was involved in distributing those weapons.  There was no point in going to inform the gendarmerie because what would have happened would be that I would be placed in gaol and then I would be shot dead.  

For instance, take the date of the 28th May, 1992.  Yesterday we were looking at a letter, and I think you realised that this involved people from Gitarama and Butare who were placed under detention.  At that time Mathieu Ngirumpatse had planned reprehensible acts, and later, the prosecutor had 44 people arrested under the pretext that people were bandits.  People who were native of Gitarama or Butare, instead of asking them to produce their identity cards they were placed in detention.  And you are suggesting to me that I should have gone to the gendarmerie?  If I had not a place  to hide myself, I would not have -- I would have been killed -- I would not have been able to go here.  I have underwent a great number of difficulties, Mr. Robinson, so this is my answer regarding the gendarmerie to explain why I did not find it useful to contact the gendarmerie. 
Q.	Could you give me the names of these people who were involved in the plot to kill you, as far as you know?  
A.	The name that I was able to know at this point in time in relation to this event was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That is what Kassim told me.  That is how it was.  
Q.	And so you are unaware of the names of any other people who were supposed to be involved in trying to kill you? 
A.	My dear friend, it was the Interahamwe, his Interahamwe.  You even have the names of his Interahamwe.  Those people gave you the names of them.  The name that was given to me was the Interahamwe, Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That is the truth, Counsel.  I don't want to accuse anyone unjustly. I know you are a counsel for Nzirorera, and at any rate, you are a member of the Defence team.  But I am not talking about Nzirorera.  I only know about Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  I have no idea if there is a relationship between those two men but I am only talking about Ngirumpatse.  That was the prevailing situation at the time.  
Q.	So, is it your understanding that Mr. Ngirumpatse discussed your matter with the leader of the opposition of the Interahamwe and instructed them to arrange for someone to kill you? 
A.	I am not sure if I was correctly interpreted in French.  There is only one person we are talking about.  When you speak about someone who is going to kill, it is only one individual.  I do not know if you referred to one individual.  Perhaps you can repeat the question for me so I am sure. 
Q.	I was asking you whether it was your understanding that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had discussed your matter with the leaders of the Interahamwe and had given them information that you should be killed? 
A.	Now it is clear.  I was listening to the English channel and it is completely different from what the interpreter said.  I immediately switched over to the English channel and I heard "leaders", plural, of the Interahamwe.  So now, on several occasions that interpreter has made mistakes which could cloud my testimony with confusion.  

Mr. President, please ask that interpreter to explain what was said and to do his job well and to correctly interpret the questions.  These issues have been raised on several occasions here, Mr. President .  You asked me to do this and now I am doing it.  But, I will stop there so we can find a solution for that problem.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am not clear as to exactly what was the exact interpretation problem that you complained about.
THE WITNESS:
I was saying the following; the interpreter talked about one single person but Mr. Robinson asked if Mathieu sent one person to eliminate Ahmed Mbonyunkiza, Witness GFJ.  But I didn't clearly understand because, normally, Mr. Robinson is very specific with his questions and so I switched over to the English channel and I heard "leaders", plural -- Interahamwe leaders.  He was asking if Mathieu  spoke with those leaders.  So, you see, given how the question was formulated, I have to answer based on that formulation.  God helped me because fortunately I understand all three languages.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is a fortunate thing.  I suggest that we start with a clean slate now, and let Mr. Robinson put his question again.
MR. ROBINSON:  
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, was it your understanding that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had spoken with the leaders of the Interahamwe and given them orders to kill you?  
A.	Kassim informed me, and he said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had a meeting with the Interahamwe, the purpose of which was to kill me; that's the truth.  That's the answer. 
Q.	Okay.  So Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I want to put something to you as part of my case.  Okay.  And what I am going to put to you is that we have been in contact with every living member of the national committee of the Interahamwe, including some who are witnesses for the prosecution, and none of them have ever heard of you.  What do you say to that.? 
A.	That is what I was saying, Mr. Robinson.  Please understand.  I am telling the truth.  I explained.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry -- (Inaudible) I am a bit bothered by that question, frankly (inaudible).
MR. WEBSTER:
I know that Mr. Robinson has requested to see two persons who were national committee members of the Interahamwe and both of them refused to meet with him, so for him to make the statement to this witness that he has spoken to every member of the national committee of the Interahamwe and all of them denying knowing him, I can't --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A little bit more slowly, Mr. Webster.  You have to start again.  There is a problem with the interpretation; you are going too fast, apparently.  Can you recall what you said, Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I also am switching backwards and forth between French and English.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It was really a request from the French booth to repeat what you have said and to do it more slowly.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I started out by raising an enquiry in relation to Mr. Robinson's question or proposition to the witness, because Mr. Robinson has commented on several occasions that he has tried to contact several members of the national committee of Interhamwe, some of which are reportedly Prosecution witnesses, and they denied him an opportunity to meet with him. So on what ground, on what basis is he now putting it to this witness that he has spoken to every living member and none of them know him.? I would wish an offer of proof, because it seems to be inconsistent with other representations that Mr. Robinson has made.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Mr. Robinson, the way you formulated your question, puts you in the position of a witness, almost.  
You know -- we are not on the record.  

Thank you Mr. Registrar, I understand that the systems are working again.  We had intended to take our adjournment at 6 o'clock today, so we have just over 10 minutes more.

Now, Mr. Robinson, I was commenting on the objection raised by Mr. Webster. It seemed to us that you put yourself in the position of a witness and now that Mr. Webster has challenged the factual basis of your statement, we think that we should ask you to withdraw it and put another question to him because there is no way -- you know, I do not know how one tests the factual question.  You can't have a debate between you on what is factually accurate or not in this type of circumstances and it might be more appropriate if we disallowed that question and answer, and I would invite you to put the matter to him in another way.  
MR. ROBINSON:  
Very well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyukiza, during the time that you were hiding from the Interahamwe, you continued to work at Petrorwanda; correct? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Now, I want to turn to another event and that is the meeting in Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992, and you told us that you did not attend that meeting; correct? 
A.	Absolutely.  I did not participate in that meeting since I had left the MRND. 
Q.	And since your testimony on direct examination on this point, we have seen the videotape of exactly what president Habyarimana said on that occasion and so can we simply agree that the videotape, of what was said would be more reliable than your recollection of what was said some 13 years later.  
A.	Counsel, could you repeat your question? I am not sure I understood it.  
	(Pages 51 to 58 by Eleanor Bastian)




















1754H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Since you gave your testimony about the meeting in Ruhengeri, which you did not attend, the           Trial Chamber has viewed a videotape of the speech of President Habyarimana on the                            15th of November 1992 at Ruhengeri.  And so I'm asking can we simply agree that the videotape would be more reliable than your recollection of this speech that happened 13 years ago? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me.  You know I can raise the same type of objection to this question as I did to the last question, because while the Trial Chamber did see a videotape, the videotape certainly did not contain the entirety of all of the speeches, and certainly not the entirety of President Habyarimana's speech.  So in this instance, Mr. Robinson again is not only putting himself in the place of a witness, but the  Trial Chamber.  So, I'm uncomfortably with the formulation of that question. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I was actually trying to do us all a favour with that question, because as you know when Mr. Webster tried to begin the Ruhengeri meeting testimony, which the witness never attended, you strongly urged him not to go into that subject because of the length of time it would take for opening that area on cross-examination.  And Mr. Webster, nevertheless, disregarded your advice and went forward with that testimony.  And I was feeling obliged to put to the witness my case, and also to fully do my job for cross-examination.  And I think if I were to do that, we could spend probably one hour on the Ruhengeri meeting, given the pace at which my questions of this witness go.  

So, I thought that by putting to the witness the fact that the videotape which we have, would be a more accurate recollection than his, and having him accept that, would be a good way to proceed to undo the mess that we all find ourselves in with this witness, part of which I think is due to Mr. Webster's insistence of covering those matters.  Now, if the Trial Chamber wants me to go into it, I can. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I think Mr. Webster's, as far as I understood it, was a more limited objection.  While we are not in a position to assess whether he is accurate or not, as far as I understood his objection, what was exhibited was not the entire speech.  So that the way in which you put the question was not accurate.  That is the way I understand the objection to be.  Now we can't evaluate that, but you know what your position is.  And if he is right, then you would have to reformulate your question.  So I thought it was limited to the question of accuracy.  

Mr. Webster, am I correct?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  Yes, Your Honour.  That is basically what I was stating, because he has placed the Trial Chamber in the capacity as a witness.  The entire tape was not -- the entire speech was not recorded in the first instance, and the entire videotape was not played.  So, on two levels it is an incomplete recording of what was said and the --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The playing of the videotape is not relevant to the question because in any event we are going to have to view the evidence at some stage, and we can play it ourselves, if we can get it translated. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
What, Mr. Robinson --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the playing of it is not the issue.  The question is, is the video -- is the speech in evidence?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The speech is in evidence, and the "messiness" that Mr. Robinson is trying to identify is not with this line of questioning about the event or the -- or the videotape.  It is his positioning himself and the      Trial Chamber as a witness to what transpired in the absence of this witness here in the courtroom.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
And an easier way to address it is simply to say; I have a transcript.  Would you look at this transcript, does this transcript -- is this transcript that he presents to the witness more accurate than your recollection.  That is where he wants to get, but he has done it in an awkward way. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I thought he was trying to save time because -- I thought he was trying to avoid going into the details of the speech, you see.  Now, if he does it that way it now is going to involve a different type of cross-examination which is going to take some time.  Now, if the witness agreed that the recorded speech is more accurate than his memory, than he doesn't have to ask any more questions.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The witness would have to look at the recorded speech, because the recorded speech --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But why?  You are going -- the only issue would be whether the recorded speech was really a recorded speech or not. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, because what we have as a recording is a part of the speech and what the witness heard and remembers may be more than what we had on the videotape.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is what I asked, do we have -- I had understood you at first to be saying that.  So what you are challenging is the accuracy of what was put to the witness?  

MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But subsequently I thought you said that we had the entire speech.  Now, if we have the entire speech we are going to rehear it.  So, it would be sufficient if the witness answered that simple question; but if we don't have the entire speech, then Mr. Robinson will have to do it the long way. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We don't have the entire speech.  We have several video recordings, all of which have been transcribed and all of which have accumulated in a transcript, but that is not the entire speech.  So what the witness heard may be more than we have recorded and transcribed for this trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it is 6 o'clock.  Mr. Robinson, although it may seem inconsistent with our thoughts on economy of time, it is also of interest of fairness to the witness that if there were particular statements that he had made which you wish to contradict, it might be useful to actually do that, so that we can have his answers in relation to the contradictions, because it would assist us in the long run on credibility assessment.  So, although we shudder at the possible time that it might take, we think that in the end it might be the fairer way to do it. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I can do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it is now 6 o'clock and we shall take our adjournment now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, can you advise us as to which witness we will be hearing tomorrow and at which time, and Thursday as well, probably. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, our trial coordinator has indicated that an informal session was scheduled between her and counsel in the matter at 8:45 tomorrow morning, so we will resume at 10 o'clock in court with the continuation of the cross-examination of the witness who we have to hear at that time.  So that it is not likely that we will be able to continue with this witness until Thursday morning at 8:45.  We will let the witness be on standby so his testimony can continue when we are ready for him.

Mr. Witness, there are other activities the Chamber has to undertake tomorrow morning.  We do not know how long those activities will take.  What is certain, I think, is that it cannot be completed before lunch.  So you will have to be available to resume your testimony after lunch in the event that we have the opportunity to hear you at that time.  But I think if you coordinated with the registrar, he will be able to assist you in managing your time and availability.  But we suggest that you are available after the luncheon adjournment.  Yes, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
You are right, Mr. President, in those orders, but the UN also respects human rights, and you represent the UN; be this with regard to beliefs or human characteristics, or how we perceive and understand things.  Evenings are difficult for me.  As you know we are in the month of Ramadan; and I would ask that I be free in the afternoons to be able to rest.  This is a request, simply.  I'm not expecting any order from the Chamber.  And I will be here tomorrow afternoon.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much.  We will take the adjournment now. 
THE WITNESS:
Have you acceded to my request, Mr. President.  You thanked me, but I'm not sure if you have acceded to my request.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your request seemed to have been like a rhetorical question, and you seemed to have answered it yourself when you said you would be here tomorrow afternoon.  So at that stage, I thought that all that was necessary for me to do was say "thank you," which I did. 
THE WITNESS:
The interpreter must have misinterpreted me.  Pardon me Interpreters that is not what I said.  I said that because of the beliefs that I had and because this is the month of Ramadan, I asked the President to give me tomorrow afternoon so that I can come back instead on Thursday.  I thought that you had accepted my request, Mr. President; but the interpreter apparently did not render the message correctly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I had understood that you had requested that.  And then I thought that you ended by saying that you would be here tomorrow afternoon.  The point is, we are running out of -- we are running out of time.  And we think that we have to use the time that is available, and even though it is possible that you might not be required to give testimony tomorrow afternoon, it is a possibility that what we are doing may last longer than I anticipate.  We would want to be in the position to continue with your testimony if we had the opportunity to do so.  So what we are really asking you to do is to be on standby in the event that we can take you.  And you should liaise with the registrar who may be able to give you more detailed information as to the progress that the case is taking during the course of tomorrow.  Is that clear?  
THE WITNESS:
It is clear.  You have made a decision and I have to respect it.  I agree. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now, I can say thank you again.  

Okay I think it is time to take the adjournment now.  And we will do so.
