ÉDOUARD KAREMERA, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	If you recall, yesterday we were talking about various actions of the RPF at the time when the Arusha agreements had been signed, and I had already given you three documents.  And I'm going to give you a third one, which is document 21.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. Issa, please hand document 21 to witness.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, you have a document entitled "The cases of mine and explosive attacks as of 5" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sixteen, says the counsel, and 5, corrects witness.  Both are agreed on 5 September 1999 -- 1993.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	This document was drawn up by the ministry of the interior.  I would like to ask you to read the report on Kigali, as you lived in that city, and then I'll ask you to comment on the passage you read.  
A.	That will be on the first page?  
Q.	That's correct.  First page.  
A.	"Cases of mines and explosives attacks as of 5 September 1993.  

"One, Kigali.  On 19 March 1992 at the Kigali Nyarugenge station -- motor park" -- spelling of Nyarugenge, N-Y-A-R-U-G-E-N-G-E.  

-- "an explosion completely destroyed minibus JB1039.  It was a combination of explosives that were pasted to the right back and to the right left, linked to a triggering systems.  

"Results:  Casualties, seven serious injuries, 29 minor injuries; minibus JB1039 burned down; minibus AC1873 and BB2524 were partially damaged.  

"The suspects are Mugabo, Venuste" --  Mugabo, spelling, M-U-G-A-B-O.  Venuste.  

"Nsengiyumva, Anastase."  Spelling of Nsengiyumva, N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-B-A (sic).  

"They were taken into custody.  The file was drawn up by the CRCD and forwarded to the office of the prosecutor.  The perpetrators of the explosion were not identified.  
"Secondly, on 2 May 1992, in Kimisagara, Nyarugenge" -- spelling:  Kimisagara, Nyarugenge.  Kimisagara, Nyarugenge.  

"PVK, that is, préfecture of the town of Kigali, an explosion destroyed the minibus Hiace AB9794, killing four people and injuring several.  The explosive was not identified.  Investigations under a rogatory commission at" -- but the rest is -- has -- cannot be seen.  

"On 24 December 1992, in Kimihurura" -- K-I-M-I-H-U-R-U-R-A.-- "Kacyiru" -- K-A-C-Y-I-R-U.  -- "préfecture of the city of Kigali, an explosion in the Nightclub Kigali, near the dance floor, which was filled with dancers, including some French soldiers.  Casualties:  About 40 people wounded from burns, especially on their feet.  The roof of the house was blown away.  

"The file was drawn up -- the file was drawn up by the groupement Kigali.  Presumed perpetrator was arrested, in possession of a grenade, and placed under custody.  No other authors identified.  

"7 February 1993, explosion of a booby trap in a toilet in the bar known as Total in Remera.  On 12 February 1993, discovery of an anti-personnel mine in Rukiri cellule, Remera secteur."  Spelling of Rukiri:  R-U-K-I-R-I, Rukiri.  

"On 22 April 1993, the national post office in Nyarugenge, PVK" -- PVK stands for préfecture de la ville Kigali.  

-- "there was a booby -- no, an explosion package which was -- which comprised an explosive, and that was linked to a relay trigger.  

"Casualties:  About 20 people wounded, serious of -- two of whom seriously.  The building in -- where the post office was found was destroyed -- was damaged.  The file has been forwarded to the office of the prosecutor and the perpetrator has not been identified."  

Page 2 for the following:  "On 5 September 1993, an explosion of a -- an explosion in the Baobab Bar in Nyakabanda secteur, Nyarugenge commune.  

"Results:  One death and several people wounded.  Explosion of a mine in the Rugenge secteur."  Spelling of Rugenge, R-U-G-E-N-G-E.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  You have just read the report of the Kigali city, where you lived at the time, stating that there were a certain number of explosions which cost the life of people who lived in Kigali.  Now, could you tell the Court what comments you have.  
A.	Thank you.  Two comments, two quick comments.  Firstly, it is stated that this report, which was drafted in September 1993, reports a series of incidents which people had more or less become used to.  But when -- when this kicked off in early 1991 up to 1992, the general feeling in the capital was that people no longer dared into bars.  

People who could move about in private vehicles no longer wanted to use public transport systems -- means of transport.  And the people who could -- could afford personal security or zamu -- I remember that I was looking to have a bodyguard at the time, but the truth is that, when you didn't have somebody to guard your vehicle when you had parked, then you had to crosscheck it properly to know whether it had not been booby trapped somehow.  

So that was the atmosphere with mines and bombs in -- all over the city.  

Second observation is that the office of the prosecutor was unable to deal with this alone.  The government of Rwanda had sought the assistance of France and a service.  I can no longer remember how it was called, but I think it was the Rwandan centre for crime and documentation -- criminology and documentation.  That is -- that is the service under which the gendarmerie was.  

It was under the gendarmerie, and it was led by a French soldier who was there under military cooperation between France and Rwanda.  And so, from that French military cooperation, we succeeded in identifying not only -- although in the reports it is not stated that the perpetrators were identified, we were able to understand the nature of the explosions, thanks to the French military cooperations.  So I know this information.  

But when the report was made, I was no longer in the ministry of the -- I was not in the ministry of the interior, and I cannot -- you know, I was informed about it directly.  But I know about the events that have been reported in it.  I am aware of them.
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, according to investigations that were conducted, were the instigators of these explosions identified?  
A.	Yes, the findings of investigations, of course, were at the office of the prosecutor, and I have to say that, subsequently, they were published.  I mean, beyond this one, other reports were published, and they accused the RPF.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
Issa, would you be so kind as to give document 31 to Mr. Édouard Karemera.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, you have a document which is in English.  It is verified, and I wonder if you will be able to read it. 
A.	I will try.  
Q.	I'm going to ask you to look at the title, then you would read part 2, second paragraph, that is in the second title.  And when you are done, I will tell you what you have to read, the rest.  Do you understand me?  
A.	But, you know, I don't read English.  
MR. SOW:
Your Honours, may I ask the interpreters to read that passage for us?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Would somebody be willing to assist?  

Yes.  You have a volunteer.  
MR. SOW:
Merci, Monsieur le Président.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Interpreter, perhaps you could sit here.  
MR. SOW:
He should be given headsets also.  

Mr. Interpreter, do you have the document with you?  

First of all, I would like you to read the title, and then could you be so kind as to read title 2 in its totality.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'll try.  It's very hard to read, but I'll try.  

"The preliminary investigation report surround" -- 

This is illegible.  The next three words are illegible.  

-- "of some villagers in the Ruhengeri préfecture on the night of 17" --

Next bit, illegible.  

-- "November 1993." 

Then, "The investigation" -- 

I'm sorry, this -- it's -- if you have a clearer copy, that would be useful.  It is not legible at all.  

The first thing is "investigation", and I don't get the next word.  And then for the second title, "Summary of investigations conducted on 18 to 19 November 1991." 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is it '91 or '93?  On my copy it looks like '93.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour, I cannot vouch for the -- 
MR. SOW:
It's 1993, Mr. President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Brigadier General Dallaire, the UNAMIR force commander, ordered a preliminary investigation to be conducted in the murders of the above, which were reported at force headquarters of UNAMIR Kigali at 18 hours, 09 minutes, 15 seconds, November 1993, by the Rwandais minister of defence, 
	Minister Augustin Bizimana, to be carried out by" -- 

I can't see the first figure.  It looks like 10, or maybe 18.  

"10 minutes 00, November 1993, by Colonel Tikoca, the chief military observer of UNAMIR.  

"Two:  Lieutenant Colonel Nazwul Islam, the deputy chief operations officer of force headquarter relayed to Colonel Tikoca through telephone the report delivered by the minister of defence, and stated that he is sending Colonel Ephrem Rwabalinda, who is the RGF liaison officer for UNAMIR, to accompany the investigation team to Ruhengeri using a helicopter provided by the government.  
"Colonel E. Rwabalinda is to accompany the team while conducting the investigation.
"Two:  Summary of investigations conducted on 18 to 19 November 1993.  A special preliminary team of investigation design -- designed by the forces commander left Kigali by helicopter the 18th, at 11:15 a.m., and arrived Ruhengeri at 11:45.  

"The team was composed of the following:  Colonel Tikoca, CMO; Colonel Ephrem Rwabalinda, CLO RGF, CNE; Sheriff Ndoji, ADC.  

"After arrival, the team went directly to meet the préfet of Ruhengeri, who handed them a copy of the message number 710 sent to minister of interior relating the killings in the commune of Nyamugari, Cyeru, Kidaho and Nkumba.  

"After that, the CMO decided to visit Ruhengeri hospital to meet the wounded persons.  The first one was the mother of the bourgmestre of Nyamugari.  She was wounded with weapons -- foot, chest and arms.  Her name is Madam Mukarwera.  

"The second wounded was named Ribura (phonetic) from Kidaho commune.  He was aggressed by a big stick.  According to the -- to his -- according to him, 12 armed men came to him during the night of the 17th to the 18th of November to aggress his son and his family.  They took away 11,000 francs from him and 40,000 from his son.  They killed his wife, his son and his daughter-in-law.  

"After, the team went to see a child who is brought by his uncle alive at hospital.  But some time later, he died from his pain.  He was between 7 and 8 years old."  
MR. SOW:
Mr. Interpreter, I believe we can stop here.  Now, I will ask you, on the second page where item 4 is, and what can be considered -- there is a small 4.  Do you see him -- see it, sorry, starting with "according to"?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I do.  
MR. SOW:
Do you see it?  

Very well.  Could you please read from there until the point where it says "their house".  And I believe that will be enough.  You can go ahead.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"According to the population, it seems that RPF is behind the killings.  But there were some RPF candidates who were not elected, and with their complicity, the killings were executed.  

"The population of Kinoni could not say if they wear uniforms or ... confirmation"  -- but I'm skipping a word.  "Confirmation was given that RPF deserted their houses."

Is that it?  
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. Interpreter.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, you have just heard some excerpts.  We cannot read all of them because of lack of time.  So you have just heard excerpts of a document which refers to killings that were carried out in the Ruhengeri préfecture following elections.  Can you tell us what elections are being referred to?  
A.	Yes.  With the adoption of the constitution on the 16th of June 1991, the procedure for the appointment of local authorities was changed.  And this, more specifically with the occupation by the RPF of a major part of the northern regions of Rwanda, the populations fled, and their officials fled with them.  So in the area referred to in the report, it is an area that covers the Kirambo sous-préfecture.  Kirambo is spelled K-I-R-A-M-B-O.  

In the Ruhengeri préfecture.  And that sous-préfecture includes, I believe, the communes of Nyamugari, Cyeru and Butaro.  Nyamugari is spelled N-Y-A-M-U-G-A-R-I.  Cyeru is C-Y-E-R-U.  Butaro is spelled B-U-T-A-R-O.  

So the killings that are mentioned in this report took place, I believe, in October of 1993 or September of 1993, and the killings took place after elections that had been organised by UNAMIR in order to replace the vacant official positions in the sous-préfecture.  And this region was part of the demilitarised zone, which was supposedly monitored by UNAMIR but in which the RPF was moving freely.  

In order to organise those elections, the RPF had been the only party to organise a campaign, even though it was not official, because its men and its supporters were present in the field, and the other parties had not dared organise an open campaign.  It was unimaginable because everyone was afraid, and people didn't even want to become candidates for these positions.  People had waited until the very last minute to -- so as not to be killed before the elections.  

When the consultations took place and that -- the people voted under the stewardship of UNAMIR, because UNAMIR was supervising the area, the MRND candidates were elected, and this to the great surprise of the RPF.  The MRND candidates won over all the votes, and those were elections to appoint the people in charge of secteurs as well as the bourgmestres of those communes.  
When the RPF came to the realisation that it had not been able to have its candidates adopted in spite of the campaign it had organised, it adopted an extreme solution by killing all those who had been elected.  This was a very painful event for the MRND, of course, but also for the country as a whole.  

UNAMIR was requested to carry out investigations.  And as is shown in the report, a commission -- a multiparty commission was set up with representatives of the RPF, representatives of UNAMIR and representatives of the government.  

They conducted investigations; they submitted reports.  But what was surprising was that when the draft was finalised, it was given to General Dallaire, who was the leading UNAMIR, and he kept this report.  He hid it.  And I remember that journalists were -- repeatedly asked him, whenever missions were taking place, about this matter.  They were saying that General Dallaire was to submit his report, otherwise he would have to go.  So I am informed of all those events, and I know that they had a devastating impact on the situation in the country.  
Q.	Finally, was the report published at the time?  
A.	No, the report was not published.  It was because of investigators of accused persons before this Tribunal that it was possible to publish this report, and I believe it was so in the Military I trial with Aloys -- Major Aloys Ntabakuze's Defence team.  Otherwise, at the time the report was never published.  
Q.	I thank you.  Regarding the killings that took place, were the killings not sufficient to have everyone understand what the intentions of the RPF were?  
A.	Well, I believe it was clear enough.  But, as I stated previously, UNAMIR had done its best for the report not to be published.  I remember having read in Dallaire's book that he had not published or made the report public so as not to compromise the RPF.  It is written in that book.  If I had a copy with me, I would be able to -- to quote the precise excerpt.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, before I start with my fourth line of questioning, I wish to tender into evidence document number 19 that I discussed with the witness, and which is the statement on the arrest of the young RPF supporters on the 9th of October 1993 in Gakenge.  

I also wish to have admitted into evidence document number 20, which is the confidential letter that the minister of defence, Dr. James Gasana, sent to his excellency, the prime minister.  It is a letter dated the 9th of July 1993.  

Document number 21, entitled "Cases of attacks with mines and explosives on the 5th of September 1993", which we discussed this morning at the beginning of the proceedings.  

And, finally, document number 31 that we have just referred to and which is the confidential report that was made by Brigadier General Dallaire.  

So this is, in fact, for four documents.  Document 19 will be document D. K122 (sic) -- Exhibit D. K122.

Document number 20 will be D. K129.  

Document number 21 will be Exhibit D. K130.  

And document 31 will be Exhibit D. K31 -- 131.  

I seek for them to be admitted into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted in evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. K128 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. K129 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. K130 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. K131 admitted)
MR. SOW:
I am much obliged.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we are now going to move on to a line of questioning that is linked to the events on the 6th of April.  

Witness, as you know, on the 6th of April President Habyarimana, along with the President of Burundi and other high officials who were on the plane, were assassinated.  Can you tell us where you were when President Habyarimana was assassinated.  
A.	At the time of the attack of the 6th of April, in which President Habyarimana and President Ntaryamira of Burundi died, it was during the evening of the 6th of April, around 8:30 p.m., that I heard the news, and I was at home at Kicukiro.  Kicukiro is spelled K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O, Kicukiro.  I believe I had spelt it out yesterday already.  
Q.	How were you informed?  
A.	I received a telephone call from the former directeur de cabinet of President Habyarimana, Mr. Enoch Ruhigira.  Ruhigira, R-U-H-I-G-I-R-A, Ruhigira.  He called me.  He had come back.  As was customary when the president travelled, when he would come back he would be welcomed at the airport by officials.  But as it was during night-time and with the lack of security, the officials were no longer requested to go to the airport to welcome the president upon his return.  But his close colleagues, including security -- presidential security guards, as well as the directeur de cabinet or the minister to the president's office, had to be there.  So Enoch Ruhigira was at the airport when the plane was shot down.  He was waiting for the president's return.  
Q.	And what was your reaction when you heard the news?  
A.	I panicked.  I was appalled.  Panicked because immediately after I got that phone call, I believe it was not only at my house but everywhere else, there were so many phone calls, especially for those of us who were leaders of the party and were at the helm of the country.  

People were very concerned.  They were calling from everywhere, not only inside the country but also from abroad, which means that we spent -- we virtually spent the whole night answering the telephone, calling -- making calls ourselves.  And we were wondering what we were to do.  In other words, we were panicked.  

And you were asking me for my personal reaction, but I believe this was the situation everywhere in the country.  Personally, I was very concerned, but I had to answer the phone calls of people who were trying to get information, especially those who were far from Rwanda.  So we stayed on the telephone.  
Q.	From what you know, who was deemed to be the orchestrator of the attack on the president's plane?  
A.	The attack on the president's plane, for those of us who were active in politics in the country, for those of us who had been involved on a regular basis in the negotiations with the RPF representatives, there was no doubt in our minds as to who was behind that.  In our minds, it was the RPF that had shot down the presidential plane, especially since there had been rumours whereby the RPF was trying to do away with the president at any cost.  

Yesterday we dealt with a document on the scenario number 4 that had been discussed months earlier, which we had tried to denounce, and they had refused to acknowledge.  So, as far as we were concerned, it was -- there was no doubt that it was the RPF that had brought down the president's plane.  
Q.	Can you tell us under what circumstances you left your residence.  
A.	Throughout the night, because it was around 8:30, as I was saying previously, the telephone continued ringing until late in the night.  And around 3 a.m. -- I had already called Mathieu.  We had already exchanged views with Mathieu, with Joseph.  The phones were still working.  But around 3 a.m., Mathieu called me again to tell me that he had just received a message from Colonel Bagosora about a meeting organised on that very night with the special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Dr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh.  

So the MRND chairman was informing me that he had been warned -- or, rather, he had been informed by Colonel Bagosora that he had information to impart to us and that we were to meet as soon as possible the following morning at the ministry of defence.  

Mathieu Ngirumpatse also told me that when he got the information, he had asked Bagosora what we could do in view of the situation that was already not very safe.  

He confirmed to me that Bagosora had promised to send an escort to take us to the ministry of defence early in the morning, around six.  

For security reasons, the security escort in question arrived only slightly before six, and they came to my house first, because my residence was at a distance of 100 to 200 metres from Mathieu's residence, towards the east in relation to the centre of town.  
The escort, which comprised soldiers, first came to my house around 5:45 -- or, rather, 5:30 a.m.  Since I had been warned that the escort would arrive, I went into the convoy.  It was a double-cabin pickup truck with a driver in front and armed soldiers at the back.  And there was another pickup in front and another pickup at the back of the convoy, if I'm not mistaken.  So it was a strengthened convoy or escort.  

So we went to Mathieu's place.  He boarded the pickup truck.  We were inside the double-cabin.  It was a pickup truck with a double-cabin, so there was enough space inside for the two of us, as well as space for the driver who was in front of us, and a security officer sitting next to the driver.  I was behind the driver, and there were soldiers on top of the pickup truck.  

We went to Kicukiro.  We went to the centre of town, where the ministry of defence offices were.  And we found Bagosora there.  He was expecting us.  It was around 6:30 in the morning.  
Q.	After your meeting at the ministry of defence, did you go back to your home?  
A.	We met with Colonel Bagosora there.  He asked us a question.  I don't know whether I should answer this, since you are not putting the question to me, but the meeting did not last for very long.  And, in order to go back to our houses, we had to use the same escort.  But the -- we had a very busy schedule on that day, because after our meeting, Colonel Bagosora was to go to the residence of the United States ambassador at Kacyiru, and it was the same escort that was to take him there.  
So we stayed at the ministry of defence under guard, because there was -- there were reinforcements there.  We remained there until around ten.  And after Bagosora was able to go to the residence of the United States ambassador, he was to attend the meeting of the military secteur commanders, and -- who met at ESO on that same day, on the 7th, from ten.  

Once he was dropped at the ESO, Colonel Bagosora sent the escort back to us, and the escort took us back to Kicukiro, Mathieu and I, and we arrived there around eleven or twelve.  
Q.	And when you left your home once and for all, did you still need an escort, or were you able to leave without an escort?  
A.	I reached home around 11:30 or noon, as I said previously.  Since we had spent a sleepless night, we were extremely tired.  I believe I must have dozed off.  But around 3 p.m. there were gunshots that could be heard throughout town.  And the gunfire was heavy in all directions, and practically in all neighbourhoods, but more specifically in the Kacyiru neighbourhood, where the Presidential Guard was posted.  

The Presidential Guard camp faced the camp of the RPF contingent and the 600 RPF soldiers who were housed in the building of the Rwandan parliament.  The RPF had gone out of its barracks and had attacked the Presidential Guard camp so that there was an exchange of gunfire.  And everyone was frightened.  

	At my house I had two soldiers who were guarding the residence and two soldiers who would move around with me.  They were gendarmes, militaires -- I mix them up.  I mix up gendarmes and militaires.  In fact, we had gendarmes.  

So the four of them were there, but they were afraid.  They were even more afraid than we were.  So they started asking that I request reinforcements and that three or four additional units come as reinforcement and that ammunition be provided.  

I called Mathieu to ask him how he was doing, and he told me that he was facing exactly the same problems.  So I suggested that he ask the army whether we could be sent reinforcements.  

He called, and the answer was that there were not enough soldiers and that we could not be given more than what we already had, but that if we were afraid, well, we could perhaps go to the Presidential Guard camp, because that was where he had called.  But that was exactly where the gunshots were coming from, and Mathieu and I thought that we would not go there because it was not safe either.  

So we both decided, Mathieu and myself, to go to his house.  And that was how I left my house.  There was a 100-metre distance between the two houses, but my wife, my children and myself took a car to go to Mathieu's house, along with the two gendarmes who were ensuring my -- who were my escort.  

We went to Mathieu's house because next to his residence there was a gendarmerie brigade with duty gendarmes, so that when we were at Mathieu's place we felt reassured because there was more protection.  So this is the reason why I left my house to go to Mathieu's house on the 7th, around 5 p.m., and we remained there.  

And when people saw that I had gone to Mathieu's house, the people in the neighbourhood realised that there was more security at Mathieu's place, so everybody would go to seek refuge.  

There's a witness who joined us there, Mr. Shingiro Mbonyumutwa, along with his family.  He joined us there.  But there are many people from Kicukiro in our secteur who joined us.  

We spent a sleepless night at Mathieu's house until the morning, where we were standing guard to see whether we would be killed or whether we would be able to resist until morning.  

I don't know.  You haven't asked the question yet, so I'm sorry I pre-empted, because I believe I have answered your question.  
Q.	What Mathieu are you talking about?  
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	Now, tell me, Witness, according to what you've just told us, you were, first of all, taken unawares by that bad news.  You were terrorised.  Now, tell us, how come that the Prosecution alleged that -- that you are part of the extremists who had had the president's plane shot down in order to take over power?  
A.	I believe that the Prosecution -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, I'm trying not to object while Mr. Karemera's being examined because he should have a full opportunity to explain himself.  But the assertion or the premise of the question is simply incorrect.  There's no allegation that the extremists shot the plane down.  That question is unresolved.  It has always been unresolved.  That's the policy of the Prosecution in all our cases.  It's not unique to this case.  But I suggest that Mr. Sow rephrase his question.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour -- Your Honour, Mr. President, the counsel said that they -- he was calling on Prosecutor to take another look at the indictment, but that for reasons of -- of having the case progress, he would reformulate the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
May I proceed, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, please do.  Initially I had not heard the translation to your remarks.  But I have got it now, and you may continue.
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, according to what you have -- you have just told the Court, you told us that you were terrorised, taken unawares, and that you had serious problems in moving from one place to another.  

This situation on the 7th of April 1994, according to you, should it be considered that you and your political comrades were involved in any way in the shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane?  
A.	No.  I do not think that we can be considered to have played any role whatsoever in the attack.  It was of no interest for us to kill our president.  And before the Prosecutor objected, I was -- I was about to say that the Prosecutor certainly reviewed his allegations concerning the fact that these were manipulated information by Belgian journalists who had given the wrong clues to the Prosecutor.  

But since then, more information that has been crosschecked has shown who assassinated the President.  And I don't believe that the Prosecutor can insist on those allegations.  
But, as you have quite rightly stated, it appeared in the original indictment.  And I -- I am unable, as we speak, since I don't have the indictment before my hands, to refer to the part of the indictment that you have referred to.  Thank you.  
Q.	Witness, let us talk a little bit about the prevailing situation in Kigali.  Could you confirm that, as from the 7th of April, the RPF attacked?  
A.	Yes, I do confirm that.  
Q.	To the best of your recollection, could you tell us up to what date, for example, the telephone network continued to work in Kigali.  
A.	In the neighbourhood where I lived in Kicukiro, the last phone call was made on the 8th of April 1994 before going to MINADEF for the meeting of party officials.  That was about -- around 8 o'clock.  The phone -- the phone network went down around Kicukiro.  That's right.  

So, you know, the city was split up into two with regard to the phones.  So in Nyarugenge, in central town, the phone network went down -- was cut one week after, because the telecommunications centre had been bombed by the RPF, and every -- and the phone network went down.  It was the same thing for radio - short wave radio broadcasts.  
After the 10th and 11th of April, neither the telephone nor the radio in short wave would broadcast because the RPF had taken up the positions where the transmitters were found.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Could you now tell us about the conditions under which the interim government was set up.  
A.	Oh, that is very vast.  I wonder if you are going to allow me to -- more time to speak.  I'm going to be brief, as you requested yesterday.  

The setting up of the interim government -- and let me begin at that point -- was -- was a surprise, indeed, for the RPF and their supporters.  These supporters were powerful and numerous.  

But the fact that we were able to set up that government is likely the worst crime that we committed, because nobody could have imagined that, after having spent six months -- six long months -- to set up a transition -- a broad-based transition government that the international community had assisted us in negotiating and in sharing the cake -- let us call it by the right name -- with the various protagonists, the RPF, MRND, the democratic force for changes, the small parties, which we say were food parties -- after those six months in negotiating and to have arrived at that agreement with the president, no one believed that we would have been able to set up that government under the conditions in which we found ourselves on 8th April 1994.  
So what happened on the 7th, when Colonel Bagosora suggested the wise suggestion from Mr. Booh-Booh, UN Secretary-General representative, we told him that the MRND had no problems in designating a militant to replace President Habyarimana in accordance with the Arusha agreements.  
But we told Colonel Bagosora -- who was with General Ndindiliyimana, it must be said -- that we could not decide in lieu of the congress, that it was the congress -- indeed, it is -- Mathieu was speaking, as he was -- he was the president, because, as you well know now, the party has been disbanded, dissolved.  

He answered those officers that the MRND had absolutely no problems, obstacles, except security issues, and that, considering the state of affairs, it was difficult to convene the congress and to propose a candidate to replace the president.  

So we told him that while the urgent issue was -- was -- you know, there was insecurity, and people were worried, including those of the soldiers that we were seeing.  So we told him if -- "If you can stabilise the situation, we are going to speed up things and propose somebody."  

So they met, as I said a while ago, at 10 p.m. with all the military officials and -- at the higher military college.  And the decision that was taken was that, indeed, the soldiers were to ensure security in the country.  And then the politicians were to meet as a matter of urgency to see how to fill up the gap left by the death of the -- the assassination of the president.  

And in the afternoon of the 7th, around 5 p.m. -- maybe 4:30, I can't recall precisely.  In any event, the communiqué that was published and read by -- signed by Colonel Bagosora, I believe at around 5 p.m., indicated that the soldiers in charge of the military secteurs had met and had suggested -- and maybe taken a decision.  I don't know how to state exactly what the concerns of people were.  In any case, that they had agreed that they were going to ensure security first and that they were asking the political party leaders in government, that is, the incoming government, to meet as a matter of urgency to see how they could fill the gap that was created by the assassination of the president.  

In the evening of the 7th, Bagosora, who was the directeur de cabinet of the ministry of defence, telephoned once more to Mathieu, and on that occasion we were together at his house, because, as I told you, I had gone to his house, and told him that the same escort that had taken us in the morning and taken us in the afternoon would come back for us in the afternoon at 6:30 to -- for a further meeting of the minister of defence, with the other political party officials, the parties that were in government -- the MDR, the PRL, the PSD, the PDC, and the MRND, of course.  

And as promised, at 6, 6:30, the escort arrived, and we left Mathieu's house and went to the ministry of defence, that is, in central town.  And when we arrived there -- we were the first people to have arrived, I recall, clearly -- we discussed, Joseph, Mathieu and myself, because a colleague, Kabagema, was still blocked in Kacyiru, in his zone, his area of residence having been attacked and encircled by the RPF since the 7th, in any case, since the night of the 6th, so he was unable to leave.  

So we discussed quickly between the MRND president, the secretary general and myself, and we told ourselves, since we were going to meet all the officials of party -- party officials to form a government, first needed a president.  And that is how we decided quickly, all three of us, to go to the other side of the road.  

Of course, people here don't quite understand what the place looks like.  The ministry of defence was in a building which was just opposite the president Sindikubwabo's house.  So we went across the road and went to his house.  He had heard the news, that is, Sindikubwabo, while he was at home in Butare.  So he had heard about the president's assassination on the night of the 6th to the 7th.  And on the 7th, he -- he had, indeed, returned to Kigali to be on the field, because he was the third personality of the republic.  So as an official, he didn't have any choice.  

So we were in his house.  Mathieu told him the reason why we had come, that we were going to meet the other party leaders, that the situation required that we set up government and that the legal situation was such that -- sorry, I meant to say the security situation.  Contrary to what the representative of the secretary general had suggested, the MRND was unable to immediately propose a candidate to replace Habyarimana, and that we believed we should set up an interim government, but that the president of the CND, that is to say -- that is, Dr. Sindikubwabo, should be the interim during that period.  

The president asked us two questions.  Firstly, legally speaking, he wanted to know if what we were doing was legal.  And we stated that it was the only solution, taking into account the applicable provisions of the law, the constitution which had been adopted under his presidency, because the ratification of the Arusha peace agreements, which involved the peace agreement and the constitution of 10 June 1991, had been done under his chair.  

So he was aware of the stalemate in which the president's assassination placed us before the setting up of parliament or government.  

So -- so he told us that "If legally we are on the side of the law, you are reassured -- you have to reassure me politically.  Now, if I take up the responsibility as interim president of the republic, you're party, the MRND, is going to support me."  

The MRND chair, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, reassured him.  And President Sindikubwabo told us that he was in agreement, that he could not elude these responsibilities.  

So we took the -- returned to the ministry of defence, where we met the representatives of the other parties, especially that -- the representative of the MDR, Donat Murego, the secretary general of the MDR, Frodouald Karamira, who was the second vice-president of the MDR.  

For the PL, you had the chair, Mr. Justin Mugenzi.  You had the secretary general of the PLM Madam Agnès.  And both were already members of cabinet under Nsengiyaremye.  

Now, for the PSD, there was nobody.  For the PDC, we found Minister Ruhumuliza, who lived near the ministry of defence.  He was there.  And for the MRND, you have Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and Joseph Nzirorera and myself.  

So we got to work immediately.  And I'd like to state, in order not to forget it, that Bagosora only facilitated movements for us, because we couldn't move about.  But he did not participate -- at no point did he participate and take part in the discussions.  He gave us a meeting hall in the ministry of defence, and it is in that meeting that we organised ourselves to share the tasks amongst us.  

I remember the risks I took.  Let me state it, because it is the plain truth.  I took the risk of going to my office, which was opposite the Kigali bank.  For -- people who know the Kigali bank will know what I'm saying.  And when I arrived -- it was not really opposite the Kigali bank; it was right beside the presidency, and the presidency had come under sustained fire.  

And you had -- glasses were broken, window glasses and panes had been broken.  And when I went there, I went to take the two main documents we needed to see how, legally speaking, we could change the -- amend the protocol and set up the interim government.  

So I went to my office and got the official gazette.  Yesterday I had it with me, but I no longer have it.  But that is the only document with the code.  It's the only document I took away from Rwanda.  

I took them from my office because -- to amend the protocol and to ensure that what we were doing was legal.  We didn't just have to say so.  We, indeed, had to show to people attending the meeting -- you know, not everybody quite had a grasping of the gravity of the situation.  

So I -- I must admit that I did go to take the Arusha peace agreement and that we interpreted it together, and we didn't find any other solution apart from that which we applied.  That is to say, we didn't have to wait for the setting up of the broad-based transition government open up to the RPF that we had been trying to set up without success for six months.  We decided to set up an interim government which must not be confused with the government that had been stipulated in the Arusha peace agreements.  

We did this because we were of the opinion that the RPF had killed -- had assassinated the president, well aware that the situation was degenerate and would become a stalemate, and that they were going to advance the argument that, as there was no government, no president, on the opposite side -- as a matter of fact, I feel very sad to state this.  It was not only the president who died.  The prime minister, Madam Uwilingiyimana, had also been killed.  

The president of the constitutional court had also been killed.  In the meantime, some ministers had been killed, and we were aware of this when we were meeting there.  We were unaware of the amount of people who had been killed, but the things that were said on radio, we felt that it was a difficult situation.  

But we had to do something.  We did what we could, and that is the solution that we found.  And we decided to set up an interim government, mandated firstly to negotiate with the RPF, set up a broad -- a transitional government with participation of the RPF.  The second mandate was to manage the crisis situation.  And the third point on this mandate was to assist people who were in distress.  

I hope that I answered the question.  Maybe if you focused on something specific, I would throw more light.
Q.	Thank you, Édouard Karemera.  I believe that you have answered the question completely.  

So the interim government was set up, I understand, on the 9th of April, and on 12th April you left Kigali.  Could you tell us why you did that.  
A.	That's a long story because, even as we speak, there are people who were in the convoy when we left the Hôtel des Diplomates.  But what I didn't tell you, and which is important, is that when we finished our discussions, we met at the higher military college to meet President Sindikubwabo.  We noticed that there was complete insecurity.  

The interim army chief of staff, who is presently the minister of defence in Rwanda, 
	General Gatsinzi, Marcel -- he was the interim army chief of staff after the assassination of the head of state, Nsabimana, Déogratias.  He was very close to Mathieu.  He asked us not to return to Kicukiro.  He said he was not responsible for our return to Kicukiro because, "If you return there, you are basically signing your death warrant."  
So we were confined to Hôtel des Diplomates, which was close to the ministry of defence and close to the ESM.  It was in that hotel that we were confined.  And we are not alone, because in the meantime the parties had announced the ministers who had been chosen to be part of the interim government.  And since people were being killed in all the neighbourhoods, once the names of the ministers chosen were announced by Kambanda, Jean, General Gatsinzi -- at the time he was a colonel -- deployed soldiers to go and get all those ministers.  And they met us at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And so we spent the night of the 8th there.  On the 9th, they took oath of office.  On the 10th (inaudible).  The 10th, already insecurity in the hotel was complete.  

And I'm saying so -- I do not know how to say so in strong enough words -- there was total insecurity because there were infiltrators everywhere, and one did not know where anybody was.  It was chaos.  And what we had thought we would be able to organise in terms of security for the VIPs at the time was, in fact, total chaos.  

And, in addition, the hotel faced the Rebero position, the Rebero position that had just been -- had just fallen to the RPF.  If you have ever been to Kigali, I do not know whether you dared to look towards the Rebero hotel.  It was the hotel that belonged to the Habyarimana family.  It seems now that it has become the burial ground for Rwandan heroes.  

	But when one is at the Hôtel des Diplomates, one can see Rebero in that direction, and the position was already occupied by the RPF.  And it was for that reason that on the 11th -- or, rather, on the 12th, in the morning, the minister of defence, along with General Gatsinzi and General Ndindiliyimana, consulted with the president.  And I can say so now because I know it.  But, at the time, no one knew it, except for those three.  So they consulted with one another, and they decided to move the government from that hotel, because its security was not ensured.

1030H 
THE WITNESS (continued):
They made that decision very early in the morning.  And General Ndindiliyimana received an order from the minister of defence to ensure that transfer of the officials who were members of the government, along with the leaders of the party that had formed the government and to transfer them from Kigali to Gitarama.  And that was how, on the 12th, without warning anyone, a message was sent and circulated whereby we were to leave rapidly because the hotel was about to come under attack.  And it is in that turmoil that we left using our own vehicles and taking with us the little we could take with us.  

I think I should also say that I had left with my wife and my children.  General Marcel Gatsinzi, who had confined us at the Hôtel des Diplomates, had dispatched an armoured vehicle in order to escort my spouse as well as Mr. Ngirumpatse's spouse, who came to join us at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  Our wives were driving the vehicles they used to join us at the Hôtel des Diplomates, and on the 12th we left with them. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, it seems to me that it is now time for us to take the morning break.  I thereby -- I hereby propose that we break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  We agree.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1033H to 1115H) 
MR. SOW: 
Good morning.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, before we went on break, we were at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  I would like to ask you, Witness, because this has been said before the Chamber by one of the witnesses, and if my memory serves me well, it is Witness G, who was a Prosecution witness, who stated that some members of the provisional national committee of Interahamwe za MRND had been called to Hôtel Diplomates and that they allegedly held a meeting during which you -- at which you attended.  I would like to ask you what that is all about.  
A.	On 10 April 1994, as I stated a while ago, we were -- indeed all political leaders, that is, of parties 
	that -- those indeed that were participating in government, as I was saying, we had been confined in the Hôtel Diplomates for security reasons, and I was in the company of Mathieu and the other ones at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  
On the 10th of April, we had to draft a communiqué.  It was a meeting which indeed had brought together political party leaders.  Early in the morning we had discussed what we could do to support the government which we had just set up and strengthen its action and credibility to our militants.  And as had been the case on the 8th, I had been asked to draft on behalf of the -- these political parties the communiqué which had to be discussed and signed.  

So I was at the Hôtel des Diplomates, busy drafting this communiqué when my friends and comrades from the party, Joseph and Mathieu, met -- met some of the members of the Interahamwe provisional national committee.  I saw them arrive, but I was unable to attend that meeting, during -- neither during the communication that was made by Mugenzi, Justin, to them, who had been sent by the government to meet the MRND officials alongside those youth who represented the Interahamwe.  

That is what I can say with respect to that meeting.  I was indeed at the Hôtel des Diplomates, I was busy writing -- drafting the communiqué, so I can't say if in the communiqué which -- communiqués which deserves the attention of the Chamber, that does not appear, but if you so desire, I would be happy to comment it, because I drafted it before it was discussed and signed by the members of these parties.  Thank you.  
Q.	Do you confirm that you were not present at the meeting of the 10th between some members of political parties and some members of the national provisional Interahamwe committee? 
A.	I confirm that I was in Hôtel des Diplomates drafting the communiqué that was published on the 
	10th of April but that I did not participate in discussions between the youth and the party officials. 
MR. SOW:
At the end of the minutes, the communiqué we're referring to was submitted as evidence in D. NZ21A.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, could you, in a few words, tell us what the contents of the communiqué were? 
A.	In the communiqué we were inviting militants of our various parties to assist the Rwandan armed forces to get involved in each other's security to avoid ethnical dis -- regional or partisan separation, taking into account the crisis situation we were in. 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, still with regard to Witness G, he alleged that the pacification movement was simply meant to camouflage or hide the corpses of people who had been killed.  As far as you're concerned, what did this pacification movement consist of? 
A.	The pacification mission in the neighbourhoods that was assigned to those members of the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe was to go into the neighbourhoods and to disseminate the message in that communiqué and which we published the same day.  And even before the communiqué was published, we wanted youth, especially, who were at roadblocks and those who were in the neighbourhoods that had been crossed, should understand that we were completely against the chaos that was spreading in the city.  
So Witness G's allegation that their goal was go to and hide -- to go and hide corpses is senseless because, in any event, it was the Red Cross that was in charge of going out to pick up the corpses and to inter them.  It was a delegation of -- which this delegation of Interahamwe provisional 
committee -- national committee members had neither the know-how nor the means.  That is what they could have -- the only thing they could have done at that level. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, tell me, you talked about the interim government.  We would like to know how this was the only possible legal solution at the time, considering the prevailing circumstances with regard to the constitution and to the Arusha peace agreements.  Tell me, was that the only solution or there were other possible solutions?  
A.	We examined all the provisions of the protocol agreements signed on 4 August 1993 here in Arusha.  There was a series -- there were a series of protocols in that agreement, especially the protocol agreement on the final and miscellaneous provisions.  And this protocol agreement which was signed on the 3rd August, I think, the 3rd August 1993, had been designed after what had been noticed before the agreement was signed.  And as you know, this agreement is a collection of the six protocols which had been negotiated all along 1992 and most part of 1993 and the four last month of 1992.  You know they went from August 1992 to August 1993.  

So among the protocols that were adopted there was the protocol and power-sharing which provided for their establishment of institutions.  But, in general terms, when the negotiations were finalised in that it was necessary to sign the document, there were already questions that were being raised about the difficulties that would no doubt unfold at the time when the accords would have to be implemented, and it is the reason for which the negotiators deemed it fit to deal with the issues which could be dealt with immediately after signing the agreement so as to avoid any obstacle.  But unfortunately, if you take a look at this protocol -- this additional protocol on miscellaneous issues, the situation we were faced with after the president's assassination had not been foreseen.  And I can summarise the situation in a few words by saying that we had not thought that the president would be installed and that the broad-based transitional government and the transitional national assembly would not be established immediately, but that was what happened.  The president took his oath of office on the 5th of January 1994, but as he was planning to have the members of parliament take their oath in the afternoon, there were some obstacles.  And following those problems, the government was not set up so that up to the 6th of April the only transitional institution that was in place was, in fact, the president's office.  

And in the protocol I have just referred to and the references of which I have provided, the protocol and miscellaneous and various issues, provisions had been made for the actions that would be taken if the president was to die when the transitional institutions were already in place.  We -- according to the provisions, the parliament would observe that there was a vacancy, and the institutions would organise elections on the basis of the candidates that would be proposed by the MRND.  And this is what the secretary general and Mr. Roger Booh-Booh had proposed to Mr. Bagosora, saying that since the accords provide that the president is a member of the MRND party, if the president were to be replaced during the transitional period, it would be the MRND who would propose replacing candidates.  So you should ask the MRND to present such a candidate, and in that way the transitional institutions would be set up.  But he had forgotten that this fast track was not in keeping with the legal provisions as enshrined in the protocols of agreement.  

So there was no parliament.  There was no government.  And it was not even able to -- it was not even possible to legally ascertain the president's death.  So from the constitutional point of view and taking into account protocol which were the components of the fundamental law of Rwanda at the time, and it is for that reason -- or, rather, for those reasons, since we were not in a position to set up such institutions immediately, with the participation of the RPF, especially since we had just spent six months negotiating with that party, we thought that it was necessary to bridge this gap by referring to the constitution.  And that is why President Sindikubwabo was called upon to ensure the interim presidency as planned in the constitution of the 10th of June 1991. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  With reference to the interim government, can you tell us what were the means that were available to it in order for it to exercise its powers.  
A.	The interim government was doing with what was at its disposal.  And, frankly speaking, it did not have the necessary resources to implement its policy.  

Let me start with the basics.  Perhaps you might say that offices are not necessary for the government to be able to operate, but none of the ministers of the interim government ever set foot in the ministries because all the ministries -- or most of the ministries -- most of the ministerial buildings were in Kacyiru, and Kacyiru had already fallen -- was already at the front.  

I arrived late, but the ministers who took their oath on the 9th never set foot in the ministries because on the 12th, as was just recalled, the government was forced to flee Kigali.  So there were no ministries.  But, of course, one could do without offices, but the truth of the matter is that there were no employees.  The ministers were there.  I believe the president and the prime minister alone had secretaries.  We had found soldiers who were working at the secretariat of the president's office during the presidency of late President Habyarimana.  Since they were soldiers, they were requisitioned, and when we arrived in Gitarama they were put at the disposal of President Sindikubwabo and of the prime minister for them to be able to type the documents, the -- the documents the government was to issue, because you will observe that a number of documents were indeed published.  You can ask who was typing those documents.  So there was a secretariat, and the secretaries were soldiers who were already at the secretariat at the president's office.  

But I am digressing.  At the president's office since 1973 when the president had staged his coup, he came along with soldiers and they stayed there.  So there were secretaries for the president's advisers, but the secretariat itself was ensured by soldiers who had the trust of the president and his special assistant.  So those were the soldiers that were put at the disposal of President Sindikubwabo and Prime Minister Kambanda.  

But the other ministers did not have any secretaries.  I remember the minister of foreign affairs was able to have Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, his director of political affairs, come.  And he was the adviser but, at the same time, the secretary, along with one Fabien.  I believe he's now the public prosecutor in Rwanda.  At the time, he was the director-general at the ministry of foreign affairs.  

So Minister Bicamumpaka also had a secretariat with two of his colleagues, the director for political affairs and the director-general for administration that he had met in Gitarama.  And since they were there, typing machines were made available to them -- at the time there were no computers -- and that was what they would use in order to draft the note verbale.  

The minister of finance, Emmanuel Ndindabahizi, who was called upon to find the resources used to send people on missions abroad, was able to set up an office with a few accountants and employees of the general directorate for the budget.  And beds were also provided because everybody slept in dormitories.  When you will go to Murambi, you will see that in the building where we were accommodated it was, in fact, a building that was used for people who were on training.  There were no individual rooms -- there were a few individual rooms, but some slept in rooms with several beds.  So all the civil servants we were able to take hold of were accommodated there.  

All those who were there -- and I need also to say that we would all take our meals together.  There was a common kitchen and so it was like at scout's camp.  At lunchtime we were all to meet there.  We would eat once a day.  Sometimes it would be for dinner, sometimes for lunch, according to availability because we didn't even have enough food.  

As for the other resources at the disposal of the government, while it's the administration, but the administration had been completely dismantled, at the level of the ministry of the interior, perhaps I can say what I was able to observe even before I was installed as minister of the interior.  There were a few employees of the ministry, especially the director of cabinet, who were in Gitarama.  He had one or two secretaries with him, if I'm not mistaken.  And they had been able to find a small office in the office of the préfecture in Gitarama, and that's where they worked from.  So as not to come back to this matter, let me say that when I took the oath, the préfet found a small office next to his for me, but I never used that office because I only remained there for ten days or so.  
So the resources were scarce.  We were making do with what we had.  And what we would do was to reunite and discuss, and when we were done with that, we would try to write notes.  We would not wait for any civil servant to prepare documents for us to sign.  The ministers would prepare -- or draft the documents themselves if it was necessary for them to do so. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  

Let me once again ask you to speak at a slower pace in order to enable all of us to follow.  
A.	I shall do so. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, could you please provide document number 25 to Édouard Karemera.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, we are now going to look at two speeches of 
	President Théodore Sindikubwabo.  The first speech is dated 10th of April.  And, subsequently, I will request that document 26 also be provided to you.  For the time being, please take a look at document number 25, and I would request that you turn to page 7 of that document.  
A.	Yes, I am there. 
Q.	I wish to ask you to read out excerpts of this document.  The first paragraph -- you have the first paragraph, and I would like you to read it out, please.  
A.	I'm sorry I was far from the microphone.  

"Message of the president of the republic to all Rwandans.  My fellow Rwandan citizens, only two days ago your government was established and started its activities.  You have followed the address by the president of the national development council to Rwandans on the decision to establish a new government, a decision made by the leaders -- by the party leaders who are participating in the transitional government following the death of the head of state and of the prime minister.  

"We are in support of this government.  For that reason, the cabinet meeting which we chaired today, as well as the one that was chaired by the prime minister yesterday on the 9th of April, were focused on that objective to restore peace and ensure the safety of populations and of their property." 
Q.	Very well.  Well, maybe you could go on reading.  
A.	"All the directives were issued, and all the necessary means to implement them are being sought for.  We are -- we wish to attain these objectives rapidly so that the other objectives of the government will also be reached, notably, the negotiations with the RPF as well as the solution of the difficult problem of hunger, which is pervasive in several regions.  

"What is the contribution we are asking from the Rwandan people?  Your contribution consists of understanding that no one has the right to take the life of his neighbour, to seize his or her property or to damage such property.  And for that reason, directives were issued to the law enforcement agents at all levels for them to be even more vigilant and for them to sanction any person engaging in such criminal acts.  We should all be keepers of the peace.  

"Unauthorised roadblocks should be dismantled immediately.  The groups -- small groups of bandits and robbers who just wish to fish in troubled waters must disappear.  We should all show to the law enforcement agents the locations where robbers are hiding.  So we should all be united, and it is only if we are united that peace and stability will be restored and we will thus be able to have other activities which, for the time being, cannot be pursued." 
Q.	Please go ahead.  
A.	"My fellow Rwandan citizens, we wish to thank once again those who behave properly in such difficult times, and we are asking them to continue in this path.  We condemn once again those who have attacked their neighbours and those who still have ill intent." 
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, this speech that was made by the president of the republic, did it take into account the concerns as voiced by the government? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  I believe that the speech contained the directives that had already been issued by the president when he was attending the oath-taking ceremony of the members of the government the day before.  And he had also referred to these elements during his first speech in his capacity as president of the republic, that is to say, during the evening of the 8th of April when we had just agreed on the membership of that government and when he had just signed the presidential decree appointing 
	Jean Kambanda as prime minister.  
Q.	Witness, this speech was calling upon all Rwandan citizens from all walks of life to ensure the safety of their neighbours, this speech which was asking that those committing crimes be punished, and in spite of this speech there were killings.  How was the situation perceived by the government, even if you were not a member of the government at the time? 
A.	The government did its very best with the resources available to it in order to implement the directives issued by the president.  But the government was overwhelmed and was not in a position to restore the situation.  And it is the reason for which we are where we are today.  

But I wish to insist on the sincerity of this speech, and I believe it is time for me to say that I don't see anything expressed in code in this speech.  What is said here is what was felt by all the leaders at the time.  When you put your previous question to me, I told you to what extent we were at a loss as to what to do.  But we did our very best, and that is the truth.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. Issa, could you please give document number 26 to Mr. Édouard Karemera.  

BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, this is a statement made by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda on the 11th of April.  On page 15 -- could you please turn to page 15.  
A.	Yes, I am there. 
Q.	You will see, "Speaker, Prime Minister Jean Kambanda."  Could you kindly read out the speech up to page 16, perhaps, first or second paragraph.  
A.	Very well.  I shall do that.  
Q.	Thank you.  
A.	"Speech by Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.  We have also sent a message to the Inkotanyi.  The Inkotanyi have resumed hostilities.  They have resumed hostilities in the city of Kigali with the pretext of punishing the members of the Presidential Guard who, according to the Inkotanyi, wreaked havoc within the population.  

"As I stated previously, there is no evidence that the members of the Presidential Guard were those who went to create disruption within the population, but it is clear that there is the likelihood that some soldiers of this unit, just as other soldiers from other camps, might have shared responsibility in these criminal acts.  

"We have observed that the attack by the Inkotanyi had a negative effect on security in Kigali.  As a matter of fact, it is one of the reasons that led to the deterioration of the security situation in Kigali.  After having heard that the hostilities had resumed in the combat zone, we asked that the hostilities cease.  

"We wish to inform you that war cannot solve the political problems facing Rwanda.  We also wish to state that there will be no end to the political problems of Rwanda because there has been a victor.  Political problems need to be resolved through a negotiation.  Even with the resumption of hostilities, negotiations should continue.  Negotiations must be the path towards peace, and that is why negotiations are necessary.  We need to prove that they are necessary, especially since the 
peace accords had been concluded, that is to say, the Arusha Peace Accords.  

"We wish to reiterate that the government acknowledges the Arusha Accords.  This government has never rejected the accords, as some would want us to believe.  The government insists that the 
Arusha Accords be implemented.  We are thus asking the Inkotanyi to understand that the hostilities cannot solve the problems our country is faced with, but it is, rather, through the implementation of the Arusha Accords that such problems can be solved." 
Q.	I thank you.  Witness, can you tell me what the reaction of the RPF was to this appeal of 
	Prime Minister Kambanda?  
A.	The RPF had a very negative response because it refused to meet with the representatives of the interim government.  It refused to meet with the delegation of the interim government.  And at a given point in time, the RPF, and probably following some advice given to them -- I cannot talk about any pressure exerted on them, neither from Dallaire nor from any other individual.  So there was no pressure exerted on the RPF.  But in order to hide the situation as it prevailed, General Dallaire, who was the choice adviser of General Kagame, certainly suggested to him that he concede that he did not recognise the interim government but that he was ready to negotiate with the Rwandan armed forces.  

And in the days that followed the establishment of the government, it is true that General Dallaire was the go-between between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF.  It was General Dallaire who was obviously choosing those who were to go and meet with the RPF.  He would make suggestions as to those who might be welcomed by the RPF.  And we realised with hindsight that they were, in fact, the RPF's pawns among our ranks, because when he proposed that General Gatsinzi and 
General Rusatira be sent to negotiate with the RPF, we knew that it was the chief of staff of the 
armed forces that was going to go and negotiate with the armed forces.  But with the following -- the events that ensued, we realised that it was the RPF that was negotiating with the RPF.  But at the time we were not aware of that.  

So, to summarise, in spite of the goodwill expressed by the interim government, the RPF refused to discuss with it and refused to sit around a table with a delegation sent by the interim government, even when it was advised to do so by its advisers or supporters.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW:
I would like to state that this President Sindikubwabo's speech has already been submitted under 
D. NZ28.  That is why, Your Honour, I would like to pray that document 26 on the speech - 
prime minister's speech dated 11 April 1994 be admitted as exhibit -- admitted into evidence as 
Exhibit Number D. K132. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. K132 admitted) 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, were you a cabinet member on 9th November 19 -- 1994 -- 9 April 1994? 
A.	No, I was not a member of cabinet. 
Q.	Since when did you become a cabinet member? 
A.	I took oath of office as minister of the interior on 25 May 1994 in Murambi at 3 p.m.  
Q.	Could you tell us why you were appointed? 
A.	I was appointed to replace the minister of interior, Faustin Munyazesa, M-U-N-Y-A-Z-E-S-A, Munyazesa, Faustin, who had been reappointed as minister of the interior in the interim government, but -- but when the interim government took oath of office, Munyazesa was abroad because he had been part of the delegation who had travelled with late President Habyarimana on the 6th of April to 
	Dar es Salaam.  So when the other members of government took the oath of office he had been in 
	Dar es Salaam, and he never wanted to return.  We waited for close to a month, and after that we decided to replace him.  And that is how I was appointed as minister of the interior.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Issa, would you be so kind as to hand over the colour map to Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Okay, Issa, could you show the map.  

Your Honour, I would like you to authorise Mr. Karemera to move to the projector to be able to see that map and to explain it to us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Permission granted.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Mr. Édouard Karemera, please remember to use the microphone when you are speaking so that you would be heard.  

For now, we can't see the map, so just hang on a minute.  

Mr. Édouard Karemera, could you tell us who made that map? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, could you ask the witness to speak -- the microphone is not on.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	(No interpretation)

Sorry, we are not trying to accuse you of not having turned on the microphone.  The microphone isn't working.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. Hometowu.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	So, Mr. Édouard Karemera, could you tell us who drafted that map? 
A.	Okay.  I was trying to explain that this map is a map of Rwanda, and what I did design personally is the content, you know, but -- what is inside the map is what I did, but otherwise, it is a map of Rwanda, which everybody knows about.  So you can just cut and paste, so to speak.  So the map, so to speak, exists, but the content on the map, I -- is my design.  I'm the one who did the key.  
Q.	Tell me, Mr. Karemera, on 27 May 1994 when you became the minister of the interior, could you tell us what are the areas which normally were not yet under RPF control in Rwanda.  
A.	Yes, I will do so.  And I would like to refer you to the key.  You have the key.  You know, every map has a key, and it is the only way of understanding a map.  So you have letters "LF" in black which show you the front line as of 25 May 1994.  And you can see it on a map by this red line here.  You can see that the front line goes from the Ngenda commune south of Kigali rural and goes across to 
	Ruhengeri préfecture, which is the Cyeru commune, I believe.  It goes across the country and splits Rwanda into two because you can see the front line goes through the préfecture of the city of Kigali and goes across Kigali and to the southwest of the Byumba préfecture, crosses the Ruhengeri préfecture and right up to the Rwandan frontier.  

So the right side of the red line was already under RPF control, while the left side on the map and on the screen was still under the control of the interim government.  And maybe I should add, if you allow me, that the RPF had practically pushed back the population from all those parts who -- under its control.  It had pushed the population into the streets, onto the road, and it was, physically speaking, the situation on the field.  

You can see these green lines.  These are green lines which show the movement of displaced persons who were fleeing RPF advance.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Édouard Karemera.  I believe you can take your seat.  

Now, Mr. Édouard Karemera, you became minister on the 25th of May 1994.  I would like you to tell the Chamber on the 25th of May 1994, what are the means at your disposal to carry out your mission as minister of the interior? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  
THE WITNESS:
I had no means to carry out my duties -- or, rather, to try and fix the situation I just described to you.  And I must state that it was a catastrophic situation for everyone and I was aware that it was a difficult situation.  But I wasn't the only person in that situation.  It was the situation -- same situation for all Rwandans, including myself.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.       Were you able to bring together some of your collaborators? 
A.	Immediately after having taken office, I -- I met first the préfet of Gitarama, ****************, because I asked him, as he was a civil servant to the ministry of the interior, to assure me of his collaboration and his support, which he did, contrary to what he stated here, because, as he is in Rwanda, he doesn't want to compromise -- to incriminate himself with his former minister of the interior who is being indicted for genocide.  

So as a préfet of Gitarama could not do anything, he brought -- he assisted me.  He gave me a little office, as I said a while ago, in the building of the Gitarama préfecture.  It was a storeyed building.  In any case, it was not working -- difficult working conditions.  The offices were empty, and we had to furnish it.  He did that.  I also asked him to -- because he needed the civil servants in the ministry of the interior more than I did, at least the ones at low levels, because the directeur de cabinet and the general -- the general directors were the people I knew.  But -- so he had to identify these people for me because the directeur de cabinet, for example, I knew was in Gitarama and I had also asked for his assistance.  

So the préfet, ****************, gave me an office and a secretary.  I asked him to assist me in finding some workers of the ministry of the interior.  And I also asked the directeur de cabinet, 
Callixte Kalimanzira, to try and identify or find some civil servants who can -- could assist us in doing something, because -- because I was almost the Red Cross.  I was -- you know, I was informed of the situation, but I was -- I knew only what I knew in Gitarama -- around Gitarama because I stayed in Gitarama for a while.  But I did not know the situation in detail or have a full grasping of it at national level.  

So I insisted on having some collaborators -- to have some collaborators to join us, and I asked the préfet of Gitarama and the chef du cabinet to try and locate them.  I felt that the situation was -- on the whole could not be known beyond the préfets, that is, the people in charge of the préfecture.  So I convened an urgent meeting of préfets for the 28th of May.  And it is during that meeting with the préfets that we had a comprehensive idea.  Prime Minister Jean Kambanda himself presented me to the préfet, to which, I mean, was the list of things he had to do.  And then he told the préfets what was happening militarily because, as head of government, he had been informed by the minister of defence and the army chief of staff, and the préfets who were in attendance took the floor to describe -- to say what the situation was in their préfectures.  So, on the 28th of May we had a fairly updated description of the situation.  
Q.	Thank you.  Tell me, Mr. Édouard Karemera, what were your activities as minister of the interior from 
	25 May to 14 July 1994? 
A.	From 25 May 1994 up till 14 July of the same year, I was basically almost a Red Cross first aid.  I was playing first aid person, so to speak.  As I said a while ago, it was a disastrous situation at humanitarian level.  Almost half of the population of the country had fled because of the RPF advance and the things that they did.  And you know, we had one million displaced -- displaced people in the Nyacyonga camps around the camp -- around the capital, and to those about a million displaced persons, you had people who were displaced from Kibungo, those who had not been able to cross the bridge, because that was the only way of leaving Rwanda to the east, because to the east you have the Kagera, which is on the border with Tanzania, and you would have only the bridge.  And after the RPF had made its lightening match over the Mutara commune in the Byumba préfecture, crossed in a few days a large part of the 
	Kibungo préfecture, and on 30 April it occupied the Rusumo road.  

So as of 30 April, there was no means of leaving Byumba and Kibungo and seeking refuge in Tanzania or Uganda because the only exit route had been cut off.  The RPF pushed the people from Birenga, Sake, Mugesera, who continued to be in Bugesera in the Nyamata préfecture.  That's what it was called at the time.  Those who could escape escaped towards Burundi through Kirundo.  For the people who know the area, the RPF continued its speedy move.  It emptied Bugesera, all the three communes of Bugesera -- Kanzenze, Ngenda, and Gashora -- emptied these communes which crossed the Rwabusoro bridge and found themselves in around end April, early May partly Mayaga in the 
Butare préfecture and in the Mayaga of the Gitarama préfecture.  

At the time, around mid-May, the RPF was already at the entrance of Gitarama where the interim government had sought refuge.  And the RPF was also a few kilometres away from the city of Butare, because the entire Mayaga was a road half occupied by RPF, and the people had fled.  And we had camps both in the Butare préfecture and the Gitarama préfecture, especially in the Ruhango in the sous-préfecture.  We already had some in the Murama commune in Gitwe.  And we had people who had been displaced from communes such as Mugina, Runda -- no, not yet.  

In sum, the RPF was gaining ground from the east to the centre and towards the west of Rwanda.  And all the populations had fled before the RPF because since 1999, in any case, the RPF had already experimented, and the population didn't want it and so they fled each time that the RPF arrived.  So RPF had drawn lessons and did not spare anybody.  So people -- most people -- let me not say all -- were on the road.  And that was the concern of the minister of the interior during the 50-day period during which I was minister of the interior.  
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, last question.  During your movements, even though you were minister of the interior, did you faced -- face the assailants who at some point in time created some difficulties for you in terms of going through roadblocks? 
A.	The truth, as a matter of fact, is that it wasn't because one was minister or not or me being minister or not.  It was a matter of being in a situation, considering the chaotic situation that was prevailing.  There wasn't -- there was no authority, no respect in the country.  So it isn't something that is specific to me.  Everybody who moved about faced violence, and these violence were a result of the actions of robbers.  You know, the power was in the streets.  The streets had taken off -- taken over power.  And people who were moving about without an escort, a powerful escort, ran the risk, indeed, of being molested.  

And as a minister of the interior, I didn't face that sort of situation, but -- but before I took office, I used to move about, especially going to see my wife and my children now and then.  I would face problems at the roadblocks which were not official roadblocks because -- because the bandits set up roadblocks to ransom people.  And when you came and they did not know you, the first thing they did was that they arrested you to -- if you didn't have a strong escort you would be molested.  But I was molested a little bit at the -- some roadblocks, but I really didn't suffer much.  I cannot say that it is -- it's an incident that should be raised.  I mean -- but it did occur.  

But I know officers, colonels who were pulled out of their vehicles, although they had weapons.  But if, had they been alone, since, even among these bandits, you had deserting soldiers and they were armed and they were uncontrolled roadblocks, and if when you arrive them -- and as I have worked with soldiers, you know -- you know, during this war I noticed that soldiers feared a gun even more than civilians because they know the risk they are running.  And I faced situations like that, you know, when a colonel arrived and said that he was a colonel, and when they saw the person manning the gate loading their weapon and they would ask him to sit down, so he would sit down and hand over his gun so that they would not be shot.  I mean, that's reality.  It seems that is how they are taught to behave.  I am not soldier, but I saw that.

1230H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Well, I stated that that was my last question.  But I remembered, Witness, that in the speeches made where people -- people always talked about coded messages.  

Now, you might have noticed that when we're talking about work -- they said, "Get back to work" -- it was a means of telling people, "Go and kill the Tutsi."  

I would like -- I would like you to give us your version of what was referred to as an -- alleged coded messages.  
A.	I wonder if I'm going to satisfy you with my answer.  What I can tell you is that the meaning in Kinyarwanda of the word "gakura" means "work".  And work does not mean kill.  

So that coded meaning of -- started in all the speeches that were made during that event.  Before -- or after, I didn't find it.  But since -- since I am here in the witness box, maybe those people who thought there are coded speeches are going to be able to show me one of the speeches and discuss the meaning of words.  I am not an expert, but I am Rwandan.  And I know at my age -- I mean, you understand your mother tongue.  I read Kinyarwanda even better than French.  So I think I can explain.  But speeches in Kinyarwanda I can explain without any difficulty.  

So if you have any speech, maybe you'd ask me to interpret it.  But maybe you didn't find any.  That's why you didn't submit any.  So let us wait.  Maybe on the other side they are going to submit one, and then, at that time, I will comment on it.  
Q.	You are right, Witness.  I have searched, searched and searched again to see these coded speeches, but I must admit that I didn't find any either.  Maybe on the other side we will have those speeches later so that you can comment on them.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I have ended the part I am in charge of, and now Maître Diagne and maybe the other ones would express their will -- willingness or intention to examine the witness.  But Maître Diagne will carry on.  And when she finishes, our other Defence counsel -- colleagues would state if they wish to question Mr. Karemera.  

Before I sit, I would like to pray the Court to have admitted into evidence the map that was described by Mr. Karemera under Exhibit D. K133.  

As for me, I have concluded.  And since we're about to break for lunch, I would like to thank you once more.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  We order the admission of the exhibit offered by Mr. Sow.  
(Exhibit No. D. K133 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
          And we will take the luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed from 1232H to 1415H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Your Honours.  

Good afternoon to all the parties.  

As previously announced, Mr. President, I am going to continue with the exercise under way following my brilliant colleague, Mr. Sow, with the examination of Mr. Karemera.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  You may proceed.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Good afternoon, Ms. Diagne.  
Q.	Before the break with Mr. Sow, you were telling us about your arrival in Gitarama in the company of the members of the interim government, which was constituted quickly on the 12th of April; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	At what time?  
A.	It was around noon.  I wouldn't be very certain about the time, but it was probably a little bit before noon.
Q.	Thank you.  Can you please describe for the Chamber the conditions under which you arrived in Gitarama, as well as the time that you arrived in Gitarama?  
A.	In fact, we were woken up by what I referred to this morning as the panic movement, which caught up the persons staying at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And I was telling Mr. Sow that the Hôtel des Diplomates was right in the way of the shooting -- or firing of the RPF, which was stationed at Mount Horizon, which was previously occupied by UNAMIR forces.  

I had also indicated that the convoy was set up in a somewhat confusing manner, because everyone was saying, "The hotel is going to be taken over.  You must prepare to quickly leave the hotel."  So everybody was trying to quickly pack their small bags with which we had fled the first time around.  So between 8:30 and 9 o'clock in the morning, the convoy left the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And between Kigali and Gitarama is about 50 kilometres.  But, generally, since it's a tarmac road, it's a trip which could be done in 30, 45 minutes.  But, since there was a convoy and there were roadblocks throughout, before -- between the Hôtel des Diplomates and the bridge which crossed Nyabarongo river when you leave Kigali, we took an hour almost.  Because, as you know, news travels fast in Rwanda, as elsewhere in Africa.  

Despite the fact that the situation was complicated, people who learnt that the government was 
leaving -- everyone was fighting to join the convoy because that would have been the best guarantee for leaving Kigali.  Because people had already tried between the 6th and the 12th to leave the town, but it wasn't easy because of the roadblocks.  

What I also noticed, and which I should indicate here, is that the young men who were manning the roadblocks and the soldiers, they were mad at us.  And they were almost insulting us.  So it was difficult for them to remove the roadblocks.  But they did recognise some people in the convoy, and there were some people who were -- would be checked.  So if -- if that was the case, we would have to wait.  

Ndindiliyimana, the head of the army, had deployed gendarmes, and our pace was about 
10 kilometres per hour.  

So we arrived at about noon.  And when we reached Gitarama already -- after having passed the Nyabarongo river, people had already begun to ask themselves questions, because the vehicles were travelling slowly.  If you could talk to the driver, you could get out and go and ask other people questions.  Everybody was wondering where we were going.  

When we arrived in Gitarama -- 
Q.	Please stop there for a moment.  

I was interested in the situation you've just described to the Chamber.  

Now, when you look at this whole scene, generally speaking, in relation to the -- the fury of the Prosecution, because the indictment against you talks about power which you enabled -- enabled you to commit criminal acts, and yet, here in your account, you're saying that your situation is quite different.  It's chaos.  It's flight.  And I want you to explain to the Chamber how -- when -- how between the attack which had happened on the 6th of April and the acts that you have tried to speak about -- and you mentioned all this earlier -- and the morning of the 12th April, when you were woken up, people are packing their small bags and getting into vehicles in a convoy, and you stop and go; you stop and go.  

Can you please try and explain to us the difference in the two theories, what you have just described and what the Prosecution alleges. 
A.	Well, I don't know.  I don't have any particular thesis to present because I'm not accusing the Prosecution.  What I'm trying to do is to explain the situation as I experienced it.  And I told you that after our deliberations at the ministry of defence -- that was on the 8th -- General Gatsinzi advised 
	us -- or, rather, discouraged us from going back to our home in Kicukiro, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and myself, but he also took measures to remove from the neighbours -- neighbourhood the elected ministers who were to take the oath of office the following day. 

Now, on the 9th of April -- that was a Sunday -- the newly appointed ministers were sworn in at about 11 a.m.  And in the afternoon -- in the afternoon they held the first ministerial meeting at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  At the end of that meeting, they decided to quickly call a meeting with the prefét.  And we were at the Hôtel des Diplomates, and we saw the regular visits made by General Dallaire, who was supervising the situation as it obtained in town.  

But the situation was already very tense.  And, as I have explained, there was a lot of gunfire in town, especially on the side of Kimihurura, because the Presidential Guard, which had a camp on that hill in Kigali, had opposite it the RPF, which had come out of its encampments and was trying to progress and advance towards Kicukiro and towards Kanombe.  That was the situation that really obtained.  

Now, on the 11th, the préfets came to Kigali.  They held their meeting with their bourgmestres, a meeting which, by the way, only lasted two to three hours maximum, because the préfets arrived at about 11 a.m.  And with the roadblocks, if you take the préfet from Kibuye or Gikongoro, these were long distances and given also the fact that these roadblocks were there.  

So they came from their respective préfectures.  We were there at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  We could see the guests at the hotel increase in numbers every day.  And everyone was looking for salvation.  This was the Hôtel des Diplomates where the government members were and members of the other parties.  And it was also opposite the army headquarters.  So the risk of being killed by RPF infiltrators was less.  

But this influx of people to the Hôtel des Diplomates created an uncontrollable situation for the security department.  And that is why they decided, without advising anyone -- I don't know whether you read in the Kambanda case when he was tried by this Tribunal.  He stated that he himself was not informed.  

And, indeed, as I have said, I, myself, learned of this from my prison here in Arusha, about the decision which was taken by President Sindikubwabo on the report which was presented to him by the interim head of the army, General Gatsinzi, presently, and General Ndindiliyimana.  One was the head of the army, and the other one was the head of the gendarmerie.  They informed the minister for defence, or Augustin Ndindiliyimana, that the situation was difficult for them to manage and that they could not assure the safety and security of these personalities in government and at the same time face up to the RPF attack, because the hotel itself was the front.  
 
And this is why the two generals and the minister for defence -- the three of them went to see the president.  And the president, without waiting to bring together the members of government, decided that it was necessary to follow the advice of his technical advisors; in other words, the technical persons when it comes to war. 

So it is within this framework that we left the capital city.  We didn't alert anyone.  Not that we wanted to hide anything -- and that is my understanding now -- but because it was a security situation that one should not have revealed.  If we had informed everyone before we left the hotel, probably the RPF would have been able to block the only exit towards Gitarama.  And this is why we were told nothing.  Maybe we acted out of fear or out of group or crowd psychology.  You see, everybody was afraid.  
Q.	Thank you.  This brings me to put an additional question to you.  

On the day when you left your place of residence, did you think that you would not return there anytime soon?  
A.	No, not at all.  When I left my house, I was thinking that we were going to get together along with our escorts in order to ensure our safety.  At the time, I did not know how the situation was going to evolve.  But things evolved very rapidly, as I told you.  
Q.	Thank you.  My apologies for earlier on.  You had already arrived to Gitarama when I made you retrace your steps.  From now on, you can describe to the Trial Chamber the arrival of all of these people -- or, all this crowd at Gitarama.  
A.	In fact, as we were getting farther and farther away from Kigali, the convoy was -- there were more and more people in the convoy.  There were people who had gone before us.  Ndindiliyimana, who was wanted during the operation, had sent people to explain at the roadblocks that there was the government convoy that was to pass through, and when we would get there, they would be more flexible.  

Once we reached Gitarama, the president, who had left with the Presidential Guard, had already arrived there, along with his escort.  The president was not in the same convoy as we were.  He left before us.  And he arrived in Gitarama before we did and went straight to the prefét's house, the préfet being ****************.  

When we arrived in Gitarama and people heard the news, people were wondering whether we would continue to Kibuye or whether we were going to Gita -- Butare, and we were wondering where we were going.  And it was at that point that, in the discussion with the soldiers, General Ndindiliyimana, since no one could have known that he was leading this operation from the exit of Kigali, let it be known that it was necessary to observe a pause, and in order to do that, one had to go to the prefét's house.  

So the ministers and the heads of parties among our group ended up at the prefét's house.  We could not all settle in his sitting room.  President Sindikubwabo was already there.  But Sindikubwabo was our colleague for some of us, because he had been the speaker of the house.  He is a very amicable person.  In fact, people -- it had not sunk in yet that he was the president.  He was taken for what he was at the time, president of the parliament.  So it did not have the same impact.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, could you please reduce your pace, because the court reporter is suffering.  
A.	My apologies.  Let me repeat what I said.  

President Sindikubwabo had arrived in Gitarama before us and had been welcomed by the préfet, Uwizeye, in the sitting room.  Préfet ***********, who came here as a Prosecution witness, confirmed the information.  So I wish to confirm it once again.  The president must have agreed with the minister of defence and General Ndindiliyimana, who was supervising this flight operation, so that once in Gitarama, the members of the government, the prime minister and the party leaders would stop there, rather than continuing on their way.  We could not stop and stay in the streets.  And it is the reason for which we went straight to the prefét's house, probably following indications provided by that officer who was leading the whole operation.  

So, as I said, we were all in the préfet's sitting room.  We were served tea or Fantas, beers.  So it was around noon.  So we were given something to drink.  This is part of Rwandan tradition.  When people come to you, usually when -- unless you're poor, you have to serve something to them.  So that was only normal. 

Then questions started being asked here and there to know what we were to do.  The answer was that we would not go any further, that we would stay in Gitarama, but that it was necessary to have people settle down somewhere.  And since Préfet -- and as Préfet ****************explained, we were in his house, but we were also in his préfecture.  And, according to tradition, it is the préfet who welcomes the president if the president comes to his or her préfecture.  And, as a consequence, he was entrusted with the task of supervising the identification of the places where people were to be accommodated.  

Gitarama is a region where there are a number of school -- schooling institutions.  And since it was time for the holidays in Kabgayi, there were locations that were already occupied by refugees because there were displaced persons there, but it was possible to find a few places there.  At the Groupe scolaire of Bimana, there was a lot of space, and we could also go there.  
Five kilometres from Gitarama there was Shyogwe Groupe scolaire, where people could also be accommodated.  But it was decided not to go to these education institutions, but, rather, to go to the Murambi training city for caterers, which was an establishment managed by the civil service and employment ministry.  And that was where people underwent short training sessions for caterers.  But it was also there that training seminars were organised for civil servants.  

And, as I said this morning, there were dormitories there, but they were not too large.  They could accommodate five to ten people each.  

And there was a house -- I wouldn't say it was a hotel, because it was not a hotel as such.  But it was a house that had just been built with funding from the ILO, and a building that was to house the teachers that were providing courses there had just been built.  And in that building, there were 20 or so individual bedrooms, and those were the bedrooms that were given to the ministers, to the party leaders.  We were given rooms in that building and President Sindikubwabo stayed in one of the houses of the management.  

The prime minister also had a house.  There were three or four houses that had been built with the assistance of the Belgian corporation.  And those houses were free.  So there were the 
two personalities who were given houses.  As for the rest of us, we shared the individual bedrooms amongst ourselves.  So the senior civil servants who were with us shared the students' rooms as well as the small dormitories.  So that is how we settled there from the 12th onwards.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, we are at the 12th of April.  You are there, not in your capacity as head of party, but, rather, in your capacity as a senior officer of the MRND party; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, you are correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Karemera, regarding that specific period, the Prosecution has claimed that in your capacity as leader of the MRND party, you had authority over the territorial administration civil servants, paragraph 10 of the indictment.  

What do you say to this statement by the Prosecution?  
A.	I believe this is a misinterpretation of the situation, and it is likely that the Prosecutor was misinformed and was told about the period of the MRND, Mouvement révolutionnaire national pour le développement, at the time when the heads of administrations were holding administrative positions as well as political positions.  

But, in April 1994, the president of the MRND, the vice-president of MRND, leader of MRND or the president of the MDR, had no link whatsoever with the administration.  It did not confer any authority on them.  The administrative authority, with the promulgation of the constitution of 10th of June 1991, had been completely separated from the political authority.  So unless the Prosecutor is claiming that we had seized power, one could not have any authority on the civil servants at that time.  It was not possible.  
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Karemera, you referred with Counsel Sow to the time when you took your oath of office on the 25th of May 1994 as minister of the interior and communal development.  That is the exact title; am I correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	I thank you.  

On the 25th of May 1994, did you appoint préfets and bourgmestres in Rwanda?  
A.	On the 25th of May?  
Q.	Yes, which was the date when you took your oath of office.  
A.	No, I took the oath on the 25th of May, and it was -- as I said this morning, it was at 3 p.m.  And then there was a small reception where we drank beer and Fanta.  And night had fallen already, so it was not possible to appoint anyone on that day.  

I do not know whether I understood your question.  
Q.	No, you did not.  But let me be more specific.  I was telling you that you had been appointed minister of interior and communal development from the 25 of May 1994, and from that date in your capacity as minister of the interior, you were entrusted with the responsibility of appointing préfets and bourgmestres; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Thank you.  My question is linked to a specific allegation in the indictment.  Because, Mr. Karemera, from that date onwards, it is claimed that you abused your functions as minister of the interior in order to appoint people, on a partisan basis -- appoint préfets and bourgmestres who were handpicked in order to perpetrate the killings of the Tutsi.  
A.	Now I understand your question.  Indeed, first of all, I need to acknowledge the fact that the 
	minister of interior has, indeed, some responsibility in the appointments that are made.  At the time, just as today, as in any other country in the world, the minister of the interior participates in the selection and the appointment of territorial administrative authorities.  

But let me describe to you what the situation was in Rwanda at the time before I tell you about the appointments that were made when I was minister of the interior.  I am not going to refer to any of the articles because I do not have the text before me.  But I know how the administration operates quite well because I was minister of civil service.  So I know how appointments were carried out in the different sectors of the Rwandan administration.  In my capacity as minister of civil service -- and previously to that, I had been secretary general of that same ministry.  I know the procedure for the appointment of préfets.  It was enshrined in the 1975 decree under the organisation of the administration of the préfecture, which was the legal foundation for such appointments.  
But this decree was into effect until the constitution of the 10th of June 1991 was promulgated, which installed multiparty politics.  The appointments that were made by President Habyarimana following a proposal by the minister of the interior after deliberation during cabinet meetings with regard to the préfets were no longer conducted on that basis.  

The coalition government, led by Dr. Nsengiyaremye, introduced two innovations, and it was in 
June 1992, two months after that government was established.  In fact, the parties of the opposition, who were now part of the government, were complaining that all the préfets had been appointed by Habyarimana during single-party politics, and, as a consequence, they were not able to operate correctly in the context of multiparty politics.  So they demanded that the positions of préfets be redistributed.  

First of all, it was decide -- and it was a decision made by the government.  I was not a member of government, but I knew what was going on in the country.  So it was decided that from that date onwards, June or July 1992, the préfets would be appointed in the préfecture of birth.  In other words, the préfet from Kibuye had to hail from Kibuye, the préfet from Kigali had to hail from Kigali, the Ruhengeri préfet had to hail from Ruhengeri and so on and so forth.  And this was something new, because, prior to that date, the president would rarely appoint a préfet in his place of birth.  So it was something completely new.  

The second innovation that was introduced by the government of Mr. Nsengiyaremye had to do with selection of bourgmestres.  The préfets were appointed in their native préfectures, and they were to refrain from giving favours to any specific party.  There were instructions to that effect from the government.  The préfet could be -- could belong to a party, but in fulfilling his duties in the administration, he was to refrain from any partisan position, vis-à-vis, any specific party.  So that was the theory.  Of course, practice -- in practice, the situation was far from it.  

So for the bourgmestres and the heads of communes, it was the same thing until the June 1991 constitution was adopted.  Bourgmestres before that were appointed on the basis of a law from 1963 that had been amended in 1975 after the coup of the 5th of July 1973.  The communal law had been amended -- at least some of its provisions had been amended.  But it was still that law of 1963 that served as basis for the appointment of bourgmestres.  

In 1963 the law provided that the bourgmestres were elected.  But with the coup and with the suspension of parliament and the parties, the bourgmestres were no longer elected, but were rather appointed by the president following a proposal by the minister of the interior.  There was a decree, dated 1975, which would settle this matter of appointments.  

Once again, the 1975 decree and the appointment of bourgmestres was put in question by the opposition parties who had become members of government under Nsengiyaremye's leadership, because they were saying -- and the Prosecutor said the same thing when he provided the list of all the bourgmestres from Gitarama with Préfet ********** saying that they were all from the MRND, which was not true.  

So Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye and his government decided during a cabinet meeting that from that date onwards, in June or July 1992, bourgmestres would no longer be appointed by the president following a proposal by the minister of interior, but that they would be appointed.  But, before being appointed, the shortlisting of candidates would not be done by the minister of the interior because the minister of the interior, who was a member of the national committee of the MRND, was suspected of wishing to maintain the bourgmestres who were members of the MRND party.  

So it was decided that the shortlisting -- or, rather than having the election of bourgmestres by the population, as contained in the bill that had been discussed at parliament but not adopted, the government decided that there would be a shortlisting exercise at the level of each commune.  And this exercise took place -- or -- at the level of the communal development conference.  And that conference was a body comprising members of the technical commission at the commune level as well as members of the communal development council, as well as advisors, and to them were added the leaders of religious groups, leaders of political parties.  

So it was a body comprising figures of authority in the commune who participated in the selection of the candidate who would be proposed to the minister of the interior, who, in turn, would make that proposal to the head of the government.  So that was a procedure to select potential bourgmestres before one was able to have bourgmestres selected directly by the population, as is done in multiparty politics. 

So I'm sorry I took so much time to explain the situation, but it's because I didn't have the text before me.  I could have done that in less time.  

So that was the situation in 1994.  With the war, the possibility to shortlist bourgmestres was not possible.  And I am aware of that because I talk about such parts of -- at the Tribunal.  The 
minister of the interior testified before this Trial Chamber, and I know that he explained to the Trial Chamber what the situation was and how candidates were screened, who selected who.  And I wish to confirm that that was, indeed, how things were done in the absence of the minister of the interior, Faustin Munyaseza, who had remained in Dar es Saalam.  

It was the director of cabinet, Kalimanzira, Callixte, who was also a member of the préfectoral Butare committee of the MRND, who, along with Prime Minister Kambanda, selected the potential bourgmestres.  And he also assisted the government when the time came to select préfets -- to replace Préfet Bariyanga from Ruhengeri, who was killed on the 7th of April 1994 at Remera by the RPF.  He was killed amongst the very first, along with all his family.  

And it was Callixte Kalimanzira, in agreement with the prime minister, who also identified the candidate for the Gisenyi préfecture, who was Dr. Zilimwabagabo, Charles.  It was the director of cabinet, Callixte Kalimanzira, who identified, along with the prime minister and the president, since all of them -- the three of them came from Butare -- the candidate who replaced the late Préfet Habyarimana.  In other words, I can say that it was the director of cabinet who had identified the candidate who replaced the late préfet from Kibungo, Ruzindana, Godfroy (phonetic), who was unfortunately killed -- also killed during the events.  

And that identification would take place in agreement with political parties.  Because, I probably forgot to tell you, but the other innovation brought about by Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye for the appointments of préfets was that one should take into account the representation of all the parties who participated in the government.  And on the 17th of April 1994, the préfets who were there were probably -- were all -- their functions were all renewed and they remained in the government.  
Q.	Thank you.  On the 25th of May, according to the procedure you have explained at length, what -- who were the préfets that you had to appoint? 
A.	The situation I've just described is the one which prevailed before I was even appointed.  So their nominations or confirmations, which were done by the council of ministers, which met in Murambi on the 17th of April 1994 -- after my nomination, there was a change of two préfets.  On the 
	10th of June 1994, the préfet of Gitarama, ****************, was replaced by 
	Jean Damascène Ukuyikiyeyezu -- 

Maybe I have to spell that because it's a very complicated name.  Ukuyikiyeyezu is spelt 
U-K-I -- U -- U-K-U-Y-I-K-I-Y-E-Y-E-Z-U, Ukuyikiyeyezu.  

Maybe let me repeat it.  I think I was mistaken.  U-K-U-K -- again -- I-Y-E-Y-E-Z-U.  
Ukuyikiyeyezu, Jean Damascène. 

Now, that was the préfet of Gitarama.  Jean Damascène Ukuyikiyeyezu was in Bulinga commune in Gitarama préfecture, because the préfet had to be a native of the préfecture where he was appointed; whereas, ****************was from Mukingi commune, which was also in -- Gitarama préfecture.  

Now, that was on the 10th of June.  And on the 10th of June, also appointed was the bourgmestre was Mubuga commune in Gikongoro préfecture, because the person who had been in place earlier had been killed by the RPF.  I do not remember the name of the bourgmestre who was appointed, but this must be in the documents.  

Another nomination or appointment of préfet came about one week later on the 17th of June.  And this was the appointment of the préfet of Butare.  And the individual concerned was Alphonse Nteziryayo.  Nteziryayo is spelt N-T-E-Z-I-R-Y-A-Y-O.  Nteziryayo, Alphonse.

1500H
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE (continued):
Q.	That is number 34 on the spelling list.
A.	Alphonse Nteziryayo as replacing Préfet Sylvain Nsabimana.  Nsabimana is spelt -- 
Q.	It is not necessary.  That is number 30, 3-0, on the list.
A.	The newly appointed préfet, Alphonse Nteziryayo, replaced Nsabimana, Sylvain, who had been appointed three months earlier on the 17th of April 1994.  So those are the two préfets who were appointed under -- upon my proposal, and their appointment, before it came about, was discussed in cabinet of ministers on the 10th for Ukuyikiyeyezu and on the 17th for the other person, Nteziryayo.  It was Ukuyikiyeyezu who claimed that he was relieved from his duties on the 10th of May.  That is not true.  He was replaced in his duties on the 10th of June, and on the 12th -- 12th of June 1994, I went from Buringa, where I had already set up in flight in the Mushishyro parish, and this is in Buringa commune.  

So I went to Gitarama to supervise the handing over between the outgoing préfet, ****************, and the incoming préfet, Jean-Damascène Ukuyikiyeyezu.  And as we were discussing the situation, we were shot at, because for ten days we had left Gitarama because the RPF had already occupied Kabgayi, and Kabgayi and Gitarama is the same place.  But we had not passed the Gahogo hill.  Those who know Gitarama will know what I'm talking about.  The Gahogo hill was a position, and it was the front line in Gitarama.  And that position had been defended by the soldiers of the FAR for a period of ten days.  So the RPF had already occupied Kabgayi from the 3rd of June, but Gitarama only fell on the 12th or the 13th.  

And while I was supervising the handing over of powers between the outgoing and incoming préfets, sustained gunfire reached the building and we all scattered in different directions, and I ended up in Mushishi towards the beginning of the afternoon, and the newly appointed préfet joined me there.  He was a soldier, but he was just as afraid as I was.  So that is what I can say about the appointment of préfets.  If you wish, I can conclude with the bourgmestres.  
Q.	That is not necessary because the objective, you see, Mr. Karemera, is that the Prosecution is claiming in the indictment that by exercising control over the préfets and bourgmestres, you, yourself, were responsible for the criminal acts with which they could be charged.  So this is going into the next question.  I know that the prosecution witness, in other words, ****************, did say here that he never reported to you in any way whatsoever concerning the situation.  

The second Prosecution witness over whom you were supposed to exercise some authority, in other words, Witness FHA, confirmed that he never made any report to you either.  Now it's my turn to ask you the question, you, my witness.  As has been claimed by the indictment, did you regularly receive préfets and bourgmestres who gave you reports dealing with the security situation in their respective administrative constituencies? 
A.	No, I cannot categorically say that I received reports.  That wouldn't be correct.  But what I am going to dwell on and insist on is the situation which obtained at the time.  Means of transport or communication that we had in order to remain in touch with the administration at the grassroots level was nil.  The post was no longer operational, and it was very risky to move about.  And préfets and the bourgmestres themselves did not have officers like they had in the past, as was done during the colonial times, to have a letter and have it taken directly to the superior authorities.  

So, in brief, there was no means of communication.  Communication was very difficult between the minister and -- furthermore, the minister did not have an address.  He was of no fixed abode.  But whilst we were in Gitarama, even if we were saying in correspondence that we were in Kigali, that's another matter.  

Maybe the Prosecutor can ask me that, why were we saying that.  We were in Murambi, and everybody knew that the government was in Murambi.  So if one had a problem, if one was at all costs looking for a solution to a problem with the administration, one could, indeed, go right up to Gitarama.  It was possible.  But it was difficult.  

Second thing, the administration was not operational.  It was not functioning.  And this is why I said this morning that I made myself a helper, a first-aider.  We were trying to do something, and what I was trying to do myself was -- what I wanted to tell the Chamber is that on the 28th May 1994, I, indeed, called a meeting, and the prime minister himself came and supported me.  It was the meeting of the préfets that I spoke of this morning.  I was speaking about this when I was responding to questions put to me by your colleague Maître Sow.  And during that meeting, I, in fact, received from all the préfets present at the meeting verbal reports.  We went around the table, and it was the prime minister who was directing the discussions.  All the préfets expressed themselves.  Some even came with written reports.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you are anticipating my questions because -- at any rate, we shall be coming to that meeting with documents in support.
A.	No, I just wanted, into words, to say that the reports that I was able to receive were reports which were made verbally during the rare meetings that I called and held with the administrative authorities, and these reports -- these meetings can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  If you ask me the question, I will give you the answer.  
Q.	Thank you.  Before I continue with your activities as minister of the interior as of the 25th of May 1994, I would like us to take a small break.  Let us stop a little bit, Mr. Karemera, you and I, and deal with a meeting which is thought to have taken place on the 18th of April 1994 in Gitarama.  The meeting was apparently called by the préfet, ****************, who testified before this Chamber.  

Now, my first question regarding this meeting is, quite simply, were you there?  
A.	No, I didn't attend that meeting of the 18th of April.  I wasn't there. 
Q.	However, Mr. Karemera -- and I'm sorry to insist on this -- because another witness, FH, also claimed before this Chamber that you had attended that meeting, and the two claimed, and thus corroborated the Prosecution on this theory -- the two claimed that you even spoke during that meeting in order to defend the Interahamwe and the MRND  and also to encourage them to commit the acts of violence.  

They said that you attended this meeting at the same time as the bourgmestres, at the same time as the heads -- as the leaders of political parties at the local level.  And to refresh your memory somewhat, the objective of the meeting was generally to discuss the security situation in the country.  Does this raise any comment on your part? 
A.	Yes, I am going to make two or three comments, and the first is that Witness FH, when he testified I was there.  I followed his testimony and also read the statements he made to the Prosecution.  And I would like to state that this witness declared that I was minister for education at the time, and this was in one of his statements.  

And let me specify that I did not know this witness but his CV indicates that at the time he was a (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)....he was mistaken with regard to the person occupying the post of minister of primary and secondary education.  There's something that is not right.  This witness, FH, should certainly -- since he was from Gitarama, he should have known the ceremonies that took place in Murambi.  

When he testified, he did not seem to admit or acknowledge that he was aware of my taking up office on the 25th of May 1994 as minister for the interior.  And yet on that date he was (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover).  He was supposed to be interested in the prolonged absence of the minister of the interior, and certainly he should have been interested in the appointment of the new minister of the interior.  Apparently when he testified before the Chamber, he was not sure or maybe he did not want to acknowledge that he was aware of that ceremony.  That's the first comment that I wanted to make.  
Q.	I'm sorry, Mr. Karemera.  I can see the presiding Judge's microphone and I am suspecting that we are thinking the same thing at the same time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I just wanted to make a comment.  He referred to the specific position that Witness FH had, which probably is protected information.  So I would just like to redact that from the record in two places.

BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Yes, following what the President has said, this is why, regarding ****************, who was not a protected witness, I am giving his name and his surname, his first name and his surname, but (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover), that's why I am using his pseudonym.  Please be careful about the identities because, you know, your statements will be available.
A.	No, I was just commenting regarding the testimony which he made and which was biased, and knowingly so.  But I am aware that, indeed, making the comment that I made, I may have revealed his identity and I am sorry for that.  I am going to continue -- 
Q.	Please, could you wait for the presiding Judge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not with any intention to be ironical, but as your counsel was explaining the position to you, she also mentioned his occupation, which we also have to redact.

You may continue now.
THE WITNESS:
It's very complicated, Mr. President, because, well, you know, these witnesses, we will have the opportunity to come back to this, but it is the rule of the Tribunal, and I'm the first to respect the diligence which your Tribunal has acted with, but I am not, however, convinced that these protective measures represent something truly solid, and witnesses who come here know this.  They know very well that it is provided for in the rules and they claim.  But I do apologise one more time that I did not wish to reveal the confidentiality of the term that may reveal the identity of the witness, but this does not reveal anything that people do not know.  

But anyway, Mr. President, let me request that Ms. Diagne put me back on track, as it were, because I have somewhat lost my train of thought because I'm not quite sure where I was, but I do not wish to waste the time of the Chamber.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Karemera.  We were trying to discuss the meeting of the 18th of April and statements that were made or testimony before this Chamber whose objective was to corroborate an allegation made by the Prosecution.  

Now, to put you back on track, despite everything, you were in Gitarama; you did not attend the meeting.  Because that was my question.
A.	No, I wasn't in Gitarama.  The second comment which I was getting ready to make was, in fact, that on that day of the 18th of April 1994, I had left for Gisenyi with the minister for defence, Augustin Bizimana, and we had effected a mission to Gisenyi in Ruhengeri, which mission gave rise to a report which I signed, and it was in the Prosecution exhibits.  So I think logically the Prosecution cannot say that I was in Gisenyi and at the same time that I was in Gitarama to participate in that meeting. 
Q.	I do apologise.  Mr. Karemera, once again, please, can you slow down and enable us to disclose the report, your mission report, which you wrote on the same date.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. Issa, with your assistance, I would like you to please give the witness and the Chamber document number 1, which is entitled, "The Mission Report for the Mission of Gisenyi, Ruhengeri from the 
	18th to the 19th of April 1994."  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Karemera.  
A.	Yes, Ms. Diagne. 
Q.	Can you see right from the first page that this document is one which was admitted as an exhibit.  It was tendered by the Prosecution itself as P. 189A.  Did you see that on the document that you have? 
A.	Yes, I can.  But let me say that the Prosecutor, in fact, used this report and it did -- it was a document, and he can't claim -- the Prosecution cannot claim that I was in Gisenyi as well as in Gitarama.  Maybe my logic is not logical, but that's what I would expect. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, when you look -- can you look at the title of the document, the mission report, Gisenyi, Ruhengeri on the 18th to the 29th of April 199 -- 18th to the 19th of April, I beg your pardon, 1994, and please go to the introductive paragraph which tells us that the minister for defence, Mr. Bizimana, Augustin -- this is number 4 on the spelling list - Bizimana -- Augustin is the first name -- accompanied by the first vice-president of the MRND, Mr. Édouard Karemera, carried out a working visit to Gisenyi and Ruhengeri in order to get to know of the situation prevailing in those two préfectures, militarily speaking and politically speaking.  

Now, I have just this question to put to you, Mr. Karemera:  Can you confirm that you are the signatory of this report and that you, indeed, took a mission to Gisenyi, Ruhengeri on the 
18th and the 19th of April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I confirm, and I wish to refer you to page 3.  I have not changed my signature up to this day.  I still sign that way today.  So it is, indeed, my signature. 
Q.	Thank you.  But I was asking you, when I was saying that you were in Gitarama -- I know that on that day we got evidence of the effect that you were not in Gitarama -- and when I am saying this I am referring to the period.  My question to you was whether you had heard about that meeting of the 18th of April.
A.	Yes, I heard about the meeting, first of all, on the radio because I said this morning that the short wave programmes could no longer be tuned into, but the programmes of Radio Rwanda and FM were operational, and everybody would listen to the radio all day long because we were expecting -- it was the only way to know what was happening, even if the event was taking place at a distance of a few kilometres from where you were.  So, in spite of the fact that I was in Gisenyi, I listened to the reports that were made during the evening, and upon my return from that mission you will see that on the 20th we were already back and I learnt about that meeting.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
As a reminder, there are minutes for this meeting dated 19th of April 1994 as broadcast by Radio Rwanda and admitted into evidence as exhibits by your Defence, Mr. Karemera, under 
Exhibit No. D. K36.  So this is just a reminder and this is for the record.  

And, Mr. Issa, it is exhibit -- or, rather, document number 6 in our bundle, and would you be so kind as to provide a copy to Mr. Karemera, who will briefly comment on it.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have the document.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	When you look at the comments on the report of -- on that meeting -- of that programme following the meeting, do you confirm, once again, that you did not attend that meeting of the 18th of April? 
A.	I confirm that I did not participate in that meeting and -- yes, I confirm.  I confirm it.  But I thought that you were going to ask me to make comments on an excerpt I might have heard over the radio even if I did not attend that meeting, because what was broadcast I heard, and I can also confirm that. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  But had you been in Gitarama on the 18th of April, would you have had any reason to attend that meeting? 
A.	No, I would not have had any reason to participate in that meeting because, as I heard over the radio and as I talked with those who had participated in the meeting, it was a meeting of the préfectoral security council which was extended to include political party leaders operating in the Gitarama préfecture and to the leaders of religious congregations.  I was not a leader of any religious congregation, and I was not a member of any organ of the MRND party at the level of the Gitarama préfecture.  

In addition, the préfet who had convened the meeting had extended invitations to the participants, and he did not show that any invitation was sent to me and that I had responded to it.  So I believe, Counsel Diagne, that all seems to indicate that I had no reason whatsoever to be attending that meeting of the security préfectoral committee in Gitarama extended to the leaders of parties at the level of the préfecture and to the leaders of religious congregations.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, when looking at the clock, I realise that it is time for us to take the break, and with your leave we should perhaps break now.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1535H to 1600H) 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  With your leave I may proceed.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, a while ago we mentioned your joint mission with the minister of defence to Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Mr. Issa, can you please give the witness the document in question.  It's document number 1.  In English it's number 1A.
THE WITNESS:
Ms. Diagne, I have the document.
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Now my question is as follows:  This mission to Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, what was the objective of that mission? 
A.	Thank you, Ms. Diagne.  I would like quickly to take you to the structure of the report.  You can see the report and its first paragraph announces the objective of the mission.  It was for us to become aware of the situation prevailing in the two préfectures, politically and militarily speaking.  So without necessarily referring to the report, if you allow me, I can quickly summarise what the situation was, firstly politically speaking, and then I'll give you the reasons which justified the mission of the minister for defence, militarily speaking.  

Politically speaking, the préfecture had just gone without a préfet because Préfet Sylvestre Baliyanga had been killed on the 7th of April 1994 in Remera.  So the préfecture had gone by without an official for one month in terms of decision-making.  

Gisenyi préfecture was also experiencing the same situation because the préfet there, Préfet Joseph Habiyambere of Gisenyi, had been dead for more than three months, if my memory serves me right, and when the RPF resumed hostilities, the préfecture did not have a préfet.  It was being administered by an acting sous-préfet.  

And the two préfectures, Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, were préfectures which bordered a zone which was already conquered by the RPF, and I was going to say with the complicity or at least the facilitation of UNAMIR because the RPF was present in the demilitarized zone, which was contiguous to Ruhengeri préfecture, and when hostilities were resumed Ruhengeri and Gisenyi were targets of the RPF.  
Politically speaking, we had a major difficulty linked to the refusal of the minister for the interior, Faustin Munyazesa, to return to his post, and the fact that the ministry of the interior remained for a whole month without an officer on the post, whereas it was the most active ministry.  Given the movement of the populations that I spoke of a few minutes ago, they were told that these were the actions of the accomplices of the RPF.  If not, the party realised that the ministry could not remain for so many weeks without a minister, given the situation which was in place.  So it was said that the MRND was an accomplice of the RPF, but, rather, we could not have suddenly become the allies of the RPF.  They knew who were the allies of the RPF.  

There was also the second criticism against the party, and that was the refusal by the director of cabinet who was returned to his post, Mr. Enoch Ruhigira.  He was taken back to his post at the same time as other ministers who took the oath of office on the 9th, but the directeur de cabinet did not have to be sworn in before he took up his job.  And, as if by magic, the day after the swearing-in it was heard that he was already in Nairobi.  He had accompanied his family to Nairobi.  It was believed that he was coming back but he never did.  

So we promised Dr. Sindikubwabo to help him and support him in his activities, and Dr. Sindikubwabo was complaining that the directeur de cabinet who had been chosen for him did not want to come and take a post and to tell him what the situation was obtaining.  And so he was a bit overwhelmed.  

Our partners, the other parties participating in the government, made it known to the MRND that Enoch Ruhigira was probably the only person who was a friend of Rwanda because he was the immediate assistant of President Habyarimana, who died a few days earlier.  So it was not understood why the MRND did not manage to convince Enoch Ruhigira to come and tell us who were the friends of Rwanda.  We wanted to have them come to our assistance, since he had the 
telephone numbers -- the telephone numbers.  

So when the president died with his personal secretary, Colonel Sagatwa, and Juvenal Renzaho, there was only the directeur de cabinet who would provide information to the government.  Unfortunately, he didn't take up his post.  So, politically speaking, we had all these difficulties that we needed to check on to reassure our partners within the government.  

Militarily speaking -- and that's where I'm going to conclude -- Minister Bizimana was to make a report to the government practically on a daily basis regarding the situation.  And everyone was aware that Gisenyi and Ruhengeri were préfectures which were desired or coveted by the RPF because it was to the north, northern part of the country, and the RPF wanted to cut off the country to the east.  So Minister Bizimana who was making reports on the basis of telegrams sent to him by his soldiers on the ground, he had believed that it was appropriate for him to go there to see personally for himself what was happening, but also in order to encourage the soldiers, the troops, who were on the northern front.  
So I left together with him so that politically, since both the ministry of defence and the ministry of the interior were ministries which -- whose ministers came from our party, I went along with him so that politically we could strengthen the reports that he would make to government, and it was not by chance that the report was returned.  We wrote it together.  But I signed it as the vice-president of the party because, politically speaking, we thought -- and I am still convinced that this was a good thing -- we thought that this would reassure our partners within government about our faithfulness and loyalty.  

So there you are.  Those are the objectives of the mission that we carried out together with the minister for defence to Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  Ms. Diagne, thank you.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  Mr. Karemera, it was also said before this Chamber by ****************that you met in Murambi with Mr. Ndindiliyimana.  Unfortunately, this was a meeting which he places on different dates.  First of all, he spoke of the 14th or 15th April.  Then he spoke of 
	21st April or 25th of April.  At any rate, the same meeting is placed by the Prosecutor on the 22nd of April.  So let's try and enlighten the Chamber and tell the Chamber whether this meeting, as described by the Prosecutor and corroborated by **************, indeed, took place.
A.	Yes, I am going to explain to you very quickly that, indeed, Préfet ********** did not speak the truth.  I do not know whether this was because he couldn't exactly remember the sequence of events and the date or whether it was because he did not attend that meeting and he was speaking about things he did not know.  But I am inclined to believe that it was rather because he didn't really remember the date very well, the date of the meeting, for him to have made contradictory statements, and he sought to rectify himself but he was not very explicit as to the date.  

But I can confirm that the date which is mentioned in the indictment is the correct date.  Why do I say this?  Because that security meeting, indeed, took place, and we within the party, we were informed of it.  We were informed of that meeting in what way?  In Rwanda, since the breakout of the war and even a little bit before, we had what we called interministerial committees.  Initially we had an interministerial steering committee, and during the war it was beefed up.  

Since we had a new structure, before the interministerial meetings were led by a minister responsible for the most dominant secteur, but with the appointment of Prime Minister Nsengiyaremye, interministerial security committee was converted into a national security council, and that council was presided by the prime minister himself both during the time of Nsengiyaremye as well as during the time of Agathe Uwilingiyimana as well as Jean Kambanda's time.  

So the meeting that took place on the 22nd of April 1994, around president -- Prime Minister Kambanda was in order to discuss the security situation in the country but more so in Gitarama préfecture.  

The prime minister, who was directing the meeting, the minister for defence, who was himself accompanied by the head of the gendarmerie headquarters, General Ndindiliyimana, and the head of the army, who could not move because the front was advancing towards Kigali, so General Bizimungu had himself replaced by General Rusatira.  And the minister for justice at the time should have been there at that meeting if he was not on mission, but it was sure that minister for defence Augustin Bizimana was there.  

The minister for the interior, Faustin Munyazasa, was not there.  He was not present because he had left and he was still in Dar es Salaam.  He had not come back to his duties.  And the head of the department of intelligence, maybe he was there.  I am mentioning all this from memory, but I believe he was there because he himself had been newly appointed.  

Furthermore, all these people were living in Murambi, and if the minister for defence had convened the meeting, this was because at national level there were problems and also locally at Gitarama there were problems.  Préfet *********** must have surely attended that meeting because the security which was supposed to be discussed was the security of Gitarama préfecture.  

But at the time Édouard Karemera was not minister for the interior.  He was not a member of that national security council either.  He had no reason to attend that meeting.  So why would ****************** think that he should have said that I was there?  I don't know.  I believe the way in which he explained my presence in and of itself demonstrates that he was inventing things.  He didn't say anything other than repeat what he believed he said, that I said on the 18th, whereas on the 18th I wasn't there, but above all he was not clear in respect of the date that meeting was held.  

I'm saying what I'm saying because after that meeting Minister Bizimana, who was an MRND minister and who indirectly was summoned to explain the actions of the youth wings of the parties, especially the youth wing of the MRND, and I remember fortunately Nzirorera, who wasn't living in Murambi, was passing by, and he told us that the government was asking all the parties, but particularly asking the MRND, to ask their youth wings to behave appropriately and not to get carried away; that we needed to support the army, but it was not required that they themselves be the perpetrators of the damage that everybody was seeing.  

So we took due note of this requirement by the government, and we brought out a communiqué on the 23rd, the day after that meeting, the 23rd of April, and in that announcement we were asking the Interahamwes and MRND to refrain from getting involved in the acts of violence, in the looting and killings.  We did what we could do at the leadership level of the party, and I and the secretary -- the national secretary Joseph Nzirorera and myself, first vice-president, signed that announcement.  
But this is different from what Witness **************** said.  What he said doesn't have any meaning because what he said was not true.  If he had been correct, if he had been appropriate in his behavior and his conduct, he would have explained how and in what capacity Édouard Karemera was there alone in a meeting of a well-known body or organ.  If he said that I was there, he should have said that I was there with members of another party.  The MRND was not there.  The PL was there.  The PSD was there.  

Generally speaking, during this period of time we had to come on air on Radio Rwanda, and all the parties which were in the government and more so the four parties -- because the small parties, like the PDC, did not intervene -- each time it was necessary for us to organise something, all the four of us would have been there.  So I don't see why Édouard Karemera alone would have been invited without inviting to that meeting all the leaders of the other parties.  And this is a sign that Witness ***************** quite simply wished to involve me and that is not appropriate.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  Now, we get to the 25th of May 1994, and there you are as minister of the interior, and you are replacing Faustin Munyazesa, who was the minister who should have come back to his duty but he did not.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Now, Mr. Issa, I would like to request you once again to kindly place before the witness documents 
	19 and 20 from my bundle of documents, please, 19 and 20.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, you -- do you have document 19 with you? 
A.	Yes, I do.  But I'm trying to put things in order because it seems that there is lots of stuff here which is illegible. 
Q.	Yes, in this document the first part is in English and it's the same text.  There is English, there is Kinyarwanda, and lastly there is French.  Naturally I'm going to deal with the French part.
A.	Very well.  I am with you.  But it is barely legible.  Yes, I am with you, Counsel.  What is illegible is proven by age.  We are speaking the same language.  It is the directive to the ministry -- the prime minister to the préfet.  And it's dated 25th of May 1995.  
Q.	Yes, that's correct.  Now, Mr. Karemera, would you be able -- there are five pages.  Would you be able to give us a summary of the directives of the prime minister issued to the préfet regarding the organisation of civil defence? 
A.	Yes.  Maybe, if you will allow me, I should begin by telling you that these directives were signed on the 25th of May, the day on which I joined the government, but they were discussed for a long period of weeks.  The political parties that participated in the government were even solicited so that they can express their views on the appropriateness of the organisation of civil defence.  
I led a meeting of the MRND politburo which dealt with these directives, the meeting of the 
13th -- 12th to 13th of May 1994.  And these directives were examined together with another document which you have just given me and which I also signed on the 25th of May, the implementation of the directives of the prime minister on the organisation of civil defence.  

I'm making that clarification because I would wish the Chamber to be informed of the way in which these directives and the implementation measures were examined.  Not that I want to deny my having signed the document, but I want to explain that I signed the document -- and even the document which is signed demonstrates this -- I signed this document because it was discussed at the same time as the directive.  It wasn't signed on the -- it wasn't discussed on the 25th after 3 p.m.  It was discussed earlier.  And the two texts were examined on several occasions by the council of ministers, and I can say even the political parties in the government were informed of them.

1630H 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	I am sorry to interrupt you at this stage, Mr. Karemera.  You were talking about the sequence of events to explain the process to the Chamber and in this regard, I have a proposal to make.  Perhaps, we should look at document number 18 for you to be able to read out to the Trial Chamber the press release of the MRND politburo signed by yourself and Mr. Nzirorera.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Issa, my apologies.   I would like you to produce document number 18 so that Mr. Karemera will be able to read it since it is not a very long document. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	It is on page 8, Mr. Karemera. 
A.	He brought a lot of documents to me.  And if the print is still fine for you, I might read it for you.  
Q.	The communiqué is on page 8, the press release.  
A.	Yes, I can read it.  

	"The speaker, Joseph Nzirorera, national secretary, press release.  The MRND political bureau met on the 12th and 13th of May 1994 in Murambi under the chairmanship -- but I remember of its 
	Vice-president Mr. Édouard Karemera to assess the political and military situation following the assassination of the president of the republic as well as the action of the government conducted since the 9th of April 1994.  Following the discussions, the MRND political bureau made the following recommendations:  

	"One:  The exceptional situation currently prevailing in the country does not allow one to comply with Article 42, paragraph of the constitution of 10th of May 1991, with regard to the replacement of the president of the republic.  In that regard, the MRND political bureau is of the view that the constitutional amendment is necessary to fill the institutional vacuum that would be created on the expiry of the 
	Three-months period provided in the first article if elections not be organised.  

"Two:  In order to deal with the numerous problems linked with the resumption of hostilities, the MRND political party commands that positions currently vacant within the institutions at the presidency and at the CND be filled without delay.  

"Three:  To further expedite decision making and the enforcement of decision, the MRND political party recommends that the government set up a crisis committee to ensure the efficient prosecution of the war, as well as the multidisciplinary committee to reflect on the multiple political, economic and social problems bedeviling the country, and to propose solutions to the government.  

"Four:  The MRND political bureau appeal to the people of Rwanda and to all public and private enterprises to continue and enhance their support to the Rwandan armed forces.  In the same 
vein -- in the same vein, the government must spare no effort to speedily translate into action its decision to organise the civil defence system.  

"Five:  The MRND political bureau thanked the entire population for the positive response to the pacification message jointly conveyed by the government and representatives of political parties in their respective préfectures, to such an extent that acts of vandalism and the violation of human rights has virtually ceased throughout the country.  Nevertheless, the political bureau wishes to condemn the recalcitrant individuals now replacing such reprehensible conduct with some unwarranted settling of scores.  The MRND political bureau here directs the authorities concerned to do everything possible to neutralise all those wrongdoers.  

"Done at Murambi on 13th May 1994, Édouard Karemera, first vice-president, Joseph Nzirorera, National Secretary."  
Q.	I thank you, and I wish to recall that this document was admitted into evidence, it is a 
	Prosecution exhibit, P. 247A.  

Now, Mr. Karemera, you were telling us when I interrupted you that -- 
A.	I was telling you, Counsel Diagne, that the two documents, that is to say, the prime minister's directives and the note on the implementation of such directives, had been discussed during a cabinet meeting, and that on the 25th of May, the prime minister were to sign and if I had not taken my oath of office on that day, the director of cabinet, Mr. Callixte Kalimanzira, would have signed in my place because the directive would have not -- would have been meaningless if such had not come along with these implementation measures.  
	
	This is something that was being organised at the national scale, and I wish to insist on that, at the national level, but it was not anything new, since the war broke out -- and since September of 1991, at the Mutara front, notably in Gisege (phonetic) commune in the Mutara commune, self-defence had already been organised within the population because of the criminal acts perpetrated by the RPF.  So that was not new in relation to what was being done.  Every single time the RPF launched attacks on a specific area of the national territory, the population would try to organise to face such attacks.  But at that time the RPF had attacked the whole national territory and the face of the war had changed.  

	And I wish to insist on that aspect for it to be understood and for it to be seen as what was prevailing at that time.  It was no longer a conventional war, but it was a conventional war that went hand in hand with guerilla warfare with clandestine brigades disseminated throughout the country as well as with infiltrators up to the highest level of the state, because I told you about the situation of the interim 
	chief of staff, Colonel Gatsinzi.  I told you about Colonel Rusatira, who was in charge of training of our officers.  But I can also give you the example of Iyamuremye -- Iyamuremye - 
	Dr. Iyamuremye, Augustin, who was the director general of the central intelligence service at the prime minister's office, and he was -- currently a senator.  When we thought that he was collecting information for the government, he was, in fact, gathering information for the benefit of the RPF.  So there were infiltrators, and we were not aware of it.  At least I was not aware of it, and the measures were not anything new.  

	But it was the first time that the government intended to organise self-defence at the national level, and that is the reason for which the deliberations of the government on such measures took the time they took.  And when I became a member of the government on the 25th of May, the text was ready.  The stencil was brought to me and I signed.  You will see that the signature was not made directly.  At the time we did not have computers.  So we would sign the stencil, and when it was a letter of such a category about what we did.  So I signed this document.  I confirm that it is, indeed, my signature because, as I've said previously, we had been informed of this at the level of the party.  But if I was becoming a member of the government, it was not an order to obstruct any attempt to organise the defence of the nation, but rather to accept the policies devised by the government.  And since this was a directive which emanated from the prime minister, in my capacity as minister of the interior, I have no reason to delay signing this document.  That is why I signed on the 25th.  I could have signed it on the following day but I deemed it to be useful.  Unfortunately, we did not have the time to implement it.  We were caught unawares.  Because of the rapid evolution of the situation, we did not have the necessary resource nor did we have the time to be able to implement these directives as we had planned.  I believe I have been able to answer your question.  
Q.	Thank you.  And I wish to apologise for somewhat belabouring the point, because I have observed two things in the charges brought against you by the Prosecution, first of all, that civilian defence was a matter for the MRND, and also that this civilian self-defence was deemed to be a criminal act.  I observed that the MRND was consulted on the issue and came up with a communiqué on the 
	13th of May 1994.  I wish to ask you whether this concept emanating from the government of the time had been endorsed by all the political parties. 
A.	It is necessary to explain the rationale behind the civilian self-defence system, but I would have sufficient time to do so.  What I can say is that the population from the border between Rwanda and Uganda all requested that the government organise the population so that they would be able to protect themselves against the attack of the RPF.  As the front line progressed and as the military situation evolved, adjustments were made to the organisation measures, but there was one constant feature in that actions that could be organised were roadblocks, night patrols.  And in those areas that were not far from the frontline, the population was asking for weapons, but Rwanda was poor and did not have the necessary resources to provide weapons to all the inhabitants.  And this is why such actions were always organised through administrative structure -- through administrative and military structures.  

	From a technical standpoint, it was the commander du place or area commander in the region where the front was who was to take charge of the organisation of this self -- of this civil defence operation.  And from the administrative standpoint, the persons -- the people in charge of the population that has confirmed were those who monitored the night patrols as well as the setting up of roadblocks and the distribution of weapons that were made available to the local authorities.  And such weapons were provided to those who were involved in night patrols, and the following morning those persons would return the weapons to the depot until those who were to take over from them would go and get the weapons for the patrols.  That was how the system was organised.  

But when war spread throughout the country, it was not possible to follow this organisation and this is the reason for which everything had to be written down and put in a text to know who would do what and who would make the necessary resources available.  So that was the rationale behind it.  But as I said previously, unfortunately, time was not on our side and we were not able to put this civil defence strategy to the test, because the RPF increased its pace of attacks.  There was an embargo against the government.  The international community demonised the interim government and all the initiative we tried to adopt were countered.  And this signed the fate of this attempt to organise the population for it to defend itself. 
Q.	Mr. Karemera, in your letter -- and this is document number 20 -- in the letter on the implementation, but you signed on the day you took office, according to you, and looking at the numerous measures listed in this letter, do you believe that this was enough in order to supervise the populations that were to implement the civil defence system? 
A.	I have not understood your question.  Would you be so kind as to repeat it in more explicit terms because I do not understand the question you are putting to me, because I explained to you that we did not have the necessary time or resources to implement such measures.  So I do not know whether you are putting the same question to me or whether you are putting another question.  
Q.	Mr. Karemera, I do understand that you did not have the necessary time to complement the measures as determined, and it is clearly stated that civil defence was never implemented.  But now I am referring to the intent that was yours when that letter was signed.  I see that there is a long list of measures in that letter for the implementation dated 25th of May 1994.  And my question was:  Do you confirm that you wished to organise in the best manner possible this civil defence system? 
A.	Well, with hindsight, I might agree with those who criticised us.  At the time we were blamed for focusing too much on administrative aspects and that in a crisis situation such as the one we experienced, people did not understand that we complied with the Arusha Peace Accords, even if today we are accused of having blocked them.  I hope I will not come back to this issue, but if I am given the opportunity, I will be able to prove that it was not the MRND -- the Rwandan government, let alone the MRND that prevented the institutions from being established.  But this is another matter altogether.  

Regarding the specific case of civil defence, our concern was to make the situation clear, because it was inevitable that there were would be slippages, and we did not want to end up in a situation where we would be organising civil defence which cannot be reproached to anyone, but also find ourselves in a situation in which crime or criminal offences would be perpetrated.  And that is the reason for which the government made sure that -- adopted all necessary measures from the organisational standpoint, but it is true that in so doing a lot of time was wasted in discussions, and at the time when the text was ready, the situation was no longer under its control, because the RPF did not wait for us.  The RPF did not follow any orders in its action.  It was acting, and it conducted the acts that we are all aware of today, that is to say, shoot down the president's plane and prevent the institutions from being established.  So that was our concern.  I stand by it.  That was our own view of what the administration should do in its supervisory activities of the population and in the organisation of policies at all levels. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Karemera, on this very issue, you have talked about responsibilities in order to avoid possible slippages.  Regarding the organisation of civil defence and its supervision and on the basis of the explanatory table you have provided which is document number 31.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. Issa, which I would like for you to show it to the witness, Mr. Karemera -- or, rather, it is 
document number 32, as I am being told by Ms. Ndour.  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Mr. Karemera, on the basis of this table which is going to be shown to you, could you explain to the Trial Chamber how you tried to show rigour in the organisation of the supervision of civil defence? 
A.	Do you believe I would be able to explain it with the overheads, in which case I should be given the original text because the copy is illegible?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Very well. 

Mr. Issa, I have here with me a colour copy and -- 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, may I move?  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Could you switch off your microphone before leaving, Mr. Karemera?  
THE WITNESS:
Counsel Diagne, could I ask you to kindly repeat your question?  
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Using the table which now appears on your monitor, I wish for you to explain to the Trial Chamber your concern -- or, rather, the concern of the government to exercise rigour with regard to the organisation of the supervision of civil defence by the population. 
A.	Thank you.  Let me specify that as you can see, this table comprises six columns, at the national level, at the level of the préfecture, at the level of the commune, at the level of the secteur.  And at the level of the secteur, you note that it is equivalent to the level of the cellule in urban centres.  So this is the first clarification I wish to provide.  And I would very briefly explain that civil defence or 
	civil self-defence or self protection of the population, and the organisation of the population for 
	self-protection, I mean, was organised at the grassroots.  And from the territorial standpoint, this is the level at the secteur in the rural entity -- the rural communes.  In the rural communes civil defence was to be organised at the level of the secteur.  And in the urban entities, self-defence or civilian defence was to be organised at the level of the cellule, taking into account the population density.  

If you go to the secteur level, in column number 1, you have the secteur level, and column 2 at the top of the column, you have the supervisory level.  And this is to specify that civil defence was an operation which was supervised at all of these levels.  There are four levels -- the secteur, the commune, préfecture and national level.  So supervision was the responsibility of the administrative authorities.  
(Pages 59 to 64 by Haruna Farage)

THE WITNESS (continued):
The coordination role was ensured by committees made up of people who were generally elected and this appears on column number 4.  So with the coordination committee at the secteur level, the supervision is done by the conseiller des secteur and the secteur committee composed of four persons, three of whom were elected.  With regard to the activities per se, and here I will be summarising what was expected of the officials dealing with civil defence at the secteur level.  They were to carry out awareness building, the mobilisation.  They were to provide leadership and ensure that there was discipline and to organise training.  This was necessary because the objective was to defend the country.  And for that it would be necessary to have discipline and training.  Maybe it's a bit pompous, but the reality of the situation required that.  

Now when you come to the organisation, when you come to the commune level, I would like to specify that in Rwanda the communes had between 8 and 15 secteurs.  So the large communes would 
have 10 to 15 secteurs and small communes would have about 10 secteurs.  So in one commune with 10 secteurs, the supervision role of the civil defence operations throughout the commune would be the responsibility of the communal authority, in other words, the bourgmestre.  Coordination was to be ensured by a coordination committee composed of four individuals, three of whom were to be elected.  

The activities required at this level is what you have in column number 5, and it was specifically to deal with the coordination and close follow-up of the activities in the communes, what was being done in the various secteurs, and the body responsible for the assessment to see whether the operation was meeting the expectations was the commune council for civil defence.  And it had in it representatives of the commune, in other words, the various secteurs composing the commune.  At the préfectoral level, the supervision role was incumbent upon the préfectoral authority, in other words, the préfet.  There was a coordination committee in place at that level.  And you can see its composition, five individuals of whom three were elected.  These were the persons who were not elected, were the soldiers or the policemen who were to play a technical role within the committee.  It was not necessary for one to look for them elsewhere because at the préfectoral level there was the commander du place, the area commander who -- these were people who were included in this structure because even before the war they were given that job of looking after the security.  They were the technical persons in the committee for coordination.  The activities of this committee you will see under column 5 and this was again a matter of coordination, but at this point in time it was at a higher level because it was a coordination of what was being done at the secteur level.  And this also involves what was done at the commune levels, because a préfecture such as Kibuye, the smallest in the communes -- in préfectures in Rwanda, had nine communes.  And it had about 100 secteurs or a little bit more.  Therefore coordination at the préfecture level was necessary in order for one to know how the civil defence operation was to be organised throughout the préfecture.  And in order to carry out an evaluation of the beneficial -- beneficial or negative effects of that operation, it was necessary to have an assessment or evaluation body and that was the préfectoral council of civil defence and its members came from the communal committees for civil-defence 
 
Now let me come to the national level.  At national level you had the supervisory role played by the minister of the interior and he was the chairman of the committee of civil defence at national level.  That committee was composed of eight members who were all appointed depending on the functions that they carried out at national level.  And this is how I found myself accused of being the president or chairman of this committee of civil defence at national level.  It's not because I was elected or that I had played a major role.  In order to be chairman of the civil defence committee, I was found in that committee because I was minister of interior.  But unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to try out that civil defence operation apart from the fact that I signed documents and also probably because some of the discussions I had in passing during some meetings with the communal authorities of the time.  

The committee was composed of eight members, and I am going to not mention who they were, but let me specify that the minister for interior was included.  The minister for defence was also in the committee and that is probably why the Prosecutor believed that civil defence was a matter pertaining or belonging to the MRND because both the minister of the interior and the minister for defence at the time were ministers who came from the MRND party.  But the reality is that this operation was not a party operation but it was indeed a government activity, and it was a government initiative in its attempts to try and save what could be saved.  Unfortunately, it did not succeed.  

The activities or the responsibilities of that committee and for civil defence at national level can be found in column 5.  We were called upon, given the time to draw up plans, we had begun to do this with relation to the directives and the implementation of those directives, and the activities included the mobilisation of resources.  I managed to mobilise 50 million Rwandan francs throughout the country -- it's about 300,000 dollars, I believe -- in order to organise the defence of the country which was being attacked from the outside, with only 300,000 dollars.  I am not putting my hands in a fire, but it's not as easy as that.  

The evaluation was left to the government.  Rwanda did not have much resources but we more so did not have time.  And here also the time did not enable us to manage to supervise anything because it didn't take off.  Evaluation much less so because there was nothing to evaluate it.  It's only the Prosecutor who evaluated and found that the operation which was a project had served to exterminate Tutsis.  But I am saying that this is false.  Civil defence had nothing to do with the massacres, which we unfortunately regret and for which, Mr. President, we are charged before the Tribunal.  Thank you.  Over to you, Ms. Diagne.
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Karemera, for having tried to show the structuring of the civil defence organisation.  And I also thank you for having told the Chamber that, unfortunately, civil defence was not, in fact, implemented because of lack of time and resources.
 
Mr.  Karemera, can you please tell the Chamber what you were able to succeed in in relation to activities when you were appointed on the 25th of May 1994 as minister for the interior?  I heard you say, indeed, that you could have been called the minister of the Red Cross.  But I would like you to give a few details to the Chamber regarding your priority activities when you were appointed minister for the interior on the 25th of May 1994. 
A.	Yes, I am going to oblige.  Let me begin with the meeting which I have already partially spoken of, the meeting with the préfet on the 25th of May.  So that would be three days after I took up office.  That is the 25th -- 28th of May 1994.  I found myself with the préfets in Gitarama at a meeting presided over by the prime minister who introduced me to the préfets.  Most of them knew me, by the way, if not by name, at least for having heard me intervene in the past during the events because I had taken part in the discussions organised by Radio Rwanda.  They knew my position on the war.  They also knew my commitment to the defence of the republic.  But I needed to know -- not personal relations with any of the préfets, but I needed to know what was the commitment of the people with whom I was going to try and carry out this mission impossible, that of righting the situation.  

	It was during that meeting that I was in fact briefed on what each one was trying to do in his préfecture and on the difficulties that were facing the préfets.  Among those difficulties was this problem, a major problem of people on the move.  Rwanda was -- well, I don't know about Rwanda, but Rwandans were on the street.  They were moving, and yet they didn't know were they were headed.  And violence continued because three months of war which were added to four years of intermittent war, because we had been at war since October 1990 in reality, but more also since the resumption of hostilities after the assassination of the president.  Chaos was widespread.  Killings were innumerable and this had been noted everywhere.  So all of this was known by one and all.  

	But the war was continuing.  The RPF was continuing.  And the RPF had decided to push the Hutus into Lake Kivu.  That was the motto.  That was the slogan.  They were saying that the east had been cut off.  They couldn't go to Tanzania.  Burundi was hostile.  Uganda, I am not saying anything about that.  So there was only the Congo, Zaire, present day Congo, and to go to Congo there were only two ways because if you look at the map which I spoke about this morning, to the west of Rwanda there's Lake Kivu which separates Rwanda from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  I wouldn't suggest to anyone to cross the lake because it's impossible.  There were no boats at the time.  So all that was left was to run towards Cyangugu in order to cross through the only port of Rusinzi.  The bridge is so narrow that two vehicles cannot pass at the same time.  You have to cross in single file.   

	The same thing happened in the northern part of Rwanda.  For you to be able to cross the 
	Rwandan border on the Corniche -- I think that is what it is called, and I believe that it has not 
	changed -- once again you have to go along in single file, and it took me two days before I could cross, and yet I was minister for the interior.  So at the time when I took up office, I said the population was fleeing the advance of the RPF.  And in that flight, since people were hungry, people had lost members of their families, so in brief there was total chaos and the responsibility of the interior was very great, even if you were only to provide some encouragement to the population by his presence, and that's what I tried to do, it wasn't easy.  It was not easy.  

	I remember towards the end I had lost my voice.  I had lost my voice, Mr. President.  Because you had to speak.  You had to tell these people who were in flight not to complicate the situation further by killing one another, because even in flight -- and it wasn't only the Tutsi who were fleeing.  Because there were Tutsis among the Hutus who were fleeing.  And this is not being acknowledged by the Prosecutor that there were Tutsis; there were Hutus.  And these people were still killing one another for stupidities.  And if you were found with a vehicle, that vehicle was going to be taken away from you so that those others could go quicker.  So there were people with bags on their backs, and if they found someone with a pickup, they would arbitrarily set up roadblocks and they would take people away from the pickup and they would take the pickup.  The authority at the time didn't seem to exist.  And it was necessary to be very courageous.  We needed a lot of courage.  I am sorry.  It was necessary to have 
a lot of courage in order to continue.  This is what I have to say, Mrs. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Karemera.  
A.	I am sorry.  I wasn't following.  I apologise. 
Q.	Yes, just take a drink of water and then we will continue. 
A.	Yes, I am sorry.  I am listening now. 
Q.	No, problem, Mr. Karemera.  Maybe we should have the document that you commented on this morning and which was already admitted into evidence.  You made comments on it with Mr. Sow and I was concerned that we describe the situation of the displaced persons to the Chamber.  But more so even if it's difficult in the concern of explaining to the Chamber what you tried to do.  When you were appointed minister for the interior on the 25th of May 1994, explain with images.  Explain to the Chamber the situation of the displaced persons. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Now, Mr. Issa, I am asking you to put the exhibit in question -- it's the map which was commented on this morning and admitted into evidence this morning with Mr. Sow examining Mr. Karemera -- so that he can explain and demonstrate to the Chamber how he tried to provide succour to the population in distress.  The people who were fleeing when he took office on the 25th of May 1994. 
THE WITNESS:
May I move to the table, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may.  
THE WITNESS:   
Thank you. 
BY MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Q.	You switch off your mike, please, Mr. Karemera. 
A	Once again I am going to use this map and starting from the legend which is to the left-hand corner of the sketch.  I won't go back to the demarcation line from the 25th of May 1994 when I took up office.  But I would like to stress the fact that the lines that you are seeing in red, in fact, represent the movement of the RPF attacks. 

	The RPF left Uganda and it occupied a small portion in this triangle of Rwanda in Mulindi, which should be somewhere here.  And with the resumption of hostilities, you can see that the RPF attacked in all directions but particularly to the east.  It was in the east that it had greatest facility because the command of the Rwandan armed forces which was the region -- in the Mutara region had a traitor, and as by chance he was known as Habyarimana.  That Habyarimana, who was a major, was the assistant of the secteur commander of Mutara.  And he was an agent of the RPF because he had been in the ministry of defence under the RPF regime, but afterwards he served -- he was forced to flee Rwanda, and now he is among the opponents of the Kagame regime in Rwanda.  So he was the one who facilitated the disorganisation of the Mutara secteur and the fall of Mutara as a region.  

	You can see the east.  And I am saying this quickly because I have already done this.  Here is the Rusumo bridge.  The small camp of Kibungo was rapidly dismantled and they managed to close the exit at the Rusumo bridge, but there were people who managed to escape and flee because that's how you come to see the three -- they are not crosses.  I don't know what they are.  If you look at the legend you will see that one small sign like this is symbolising displacement camps, but if you have three of them they would be refugee camps outside.  So this was to the east where we see people who managed to cross before the RPF closed the border, the only bridge that links us to Tanzania.  Those people were already in Tanzania.  But the flight of the population in the face of the advance of the RPF, I have already said this afternoon that for the people from Kibugo who were unable to cross the border before the RPF closed the Rusumo bridge, they were pushed towards Bugesera in the south -- to the south of Kigali.  And you can see they were able to close.  And there's a camp here in Burundi, and they passed through Kirundo.  
	If I now turn towards the west, here you have the big dot, and that is the Nyacyonga camp.  At the entry to Kigali town, you had displaced persons who came from Kibugo and Byumba, and they were here in Kigali and this is how we symbolised this, with a dot, which is smaller than the dot for Nyacyonga.

Now, the fleeing of the population was not of their own will.  It depended on the advance of the front.  As the RPF conquered territories, it liquidated the populations which had not left, and this is why everybody was fleeing in its advance.  So you have Byumba.  Some went to the north, and they passed through Gisenyi and found themselves in camps in the republic -- the Democratic Republic of Congo which was then Zaire.  And this is symbolised by two camps here, but there were more than two camps in and around Goma.  There was the Kibumba, Gahondo, Mugusa and other camps.  Still from Kigali you have the itinerary authorities used.  They left Kigali.  They went to Gitarama.  They remained there, and that is the big dot that you see here.  This is Gitarama and Kabgayi where there were about 
	30 war-displaced persons.  And when on the 3rd of June 1994 the RPF arrived at Kabgayi, all the displaced persons who were there in Kabgayi dispersed and left.  Some went to the west going through Kibuye, which is here.  The others went southwards.  They separated at Butare.  Some went to Burundi.  

	And you have camps in Burundi, but there were not many people who dared go to Burundi because the regime was hostile to Hutus who were fleeing Rwanda.  But those who were quite close went there because when you flee, you don't choose.  You say, "rather than die now, I am going to flee there, even if I die there.  Maybe I would be lucky enough not to be killed."  So there were people who went there to Burundi, and this is how you see the camp here.  

	But there were others who didn't dare go towards Burundi, and they preferred to take the long road.  From Butare they went to Gikongoro.  In Gikongoro, let me say that there's this big dot, and this is the displaced camp of Kibeho, which contained more than 10,000 people who were killed under circumstances that everyone knows now internationally.  And from Gikongoro, people continued -- I said that there was a road which was passable.  They went right up to Cyangugu as you can see, and that is where they exited in the south towards the Democratic Republic of Congo.  And you had camps, numerous camps in and around Bukavu.  And we have symbolised this with two camps, but there also were many, many camps, many, many camps.  

	This doesn't come to mind right away because I was trying to explain.  So now leaving Gitarama there were also people who went by Kibuye.  Before they got to Kibuye -- Kibuye is here.  But before -- we first of all had a big camp here in Nsanze in Kivumo commune.  There was another camp, an enormous camp, here in Kurutare Rwandaba.  That is what it was known as.  But there were particularly many refugees here at this dot in Mabanza.  In Rwengera there was a big secondary school which sheltered many displaced persons, especially those who had left before Gitarama fell.  They had 
	anticipated this was coming and they occupied the school buildings because this was the holiday period.  There were many people there.  And also in Kibuye there were two main schools, the Minyashaba forest training school -- no, there were even three.  There was the Minyashaba school, the technical school or technical college and women's technical college.  So there was a boys' technical college and the girls' technical college.  All these public buildings were occupied.  The stadium was occupied.  

	Everything was occupied by refugees when I came to office on the 25th of May between 
	the 25th of May and 14th of -- or 13th of July when we fled.  But already from the 13th of July people who were in Gisenyi began to cross and the people who were in Kibuye were moving.  And Gikongoro and Butare, they had already been on the move from the 4th of July.  Kigali fell on the 4th of July, and Butare fell on the same day.  So people left Kigali.  They went through Muhondo in 
	Kigali rural préfecture.  They went through Ruvunga in Ruhengeri.  Others left Gitarama, and they did in Nziradede.  As the other witness was explaining, they left Gitarama and went through Buringa, arrived at Gururero, Kabaya, Mukamira, Gisenyi, going through Nyundo or to Kibumba as they crossed through the customs post at Gisenyi, the small customs post.  There's another one at the la Corniche, but there's another one when you reach Kibumba.  So those who were from Kibuye went through Cyangugu.  Others went to the north and came out at Goma.  So, in sum, everything you have here in the country symbolises camps.  When I am talking about displaced persons camps within Rwanda, these are camps which were like what we saw in Nyacyonga where people remained for months and months.  Whereas during the period when I was minister of interior, these were small camps.  People would stop there when they were tired.  They would stay for two or three days and when -- before they gathered their strength the RPF were there and they had to move -- I haven't mixed the colours but if that had been possible -- but one cannot place everything on the map.  But what is also true is that in this part where you have the green which symbolises the movement of the population in flight, there should have been a lot of red dots, because the RPF was present not only within the people who were on the 
	move -- that was their system of infiltration, but rarely in many communes there were RPF bases, their brigades, their accomplices which could have been symbolised with red dots, but I didn't feel that it was indispensable to show this on the map because my objective was to show to the Chamber that during the 50 days that I assumed the functions of minister for the interior in Rwanda, I was only on the run.  I was only running always.  

	But, Mr. President, I was not preparing my trial because I didn't know that I would have this trial but the Prosecutor seized my notes.  I didn't even have a diary.  I had to buy an exercise book in which I didn't note everything I did, but the events which bear testimony are reproduced in this diary, as the Prosecutor refers to it, but I call it my notebook.  I wasn't campaigning, but I noted the events, and that's my fault.  I noted the events.  What I noted down in this exercise book, Mr. President, Your Honours, I admit to what I wrote.  Thank you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I see that it is now time for us to adjourn today.  I wish, before we do so, to have admitted into evidence the table prepared by Mr. Karemera to explain to you the organisational structure of civil defence because the map was already admitted this morning.  

And this would be under reference D. K134, Issa, is that correct? 
MR. MJUI:  
Yes, the document would be D. K134.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. K134 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
And we take the adjournment now and resume tomorrow morning.
	(Court adjourned at 1740H)
