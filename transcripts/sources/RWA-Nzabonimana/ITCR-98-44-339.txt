P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 14th of July 2008, for the continuation of the trial, in the matter of 
The Prosecutor vs. Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Sow.  
MR. SOW: 
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, before Mr. Sow starts -- Mr.  President, may I inform the Chamber that I am back;  my respects to the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Welcome back, Mr. Weyl.
MR. MORLEY: 
May I attract Your Honours' attention on a housekeeping matter.  Your Honours may recall that, dealing with witnesses last week, there were a number of exhibits which were offered into evidence by the Prosecution with respect to the witnesses KBL and LSP.  And Your Honours had in mind resolving the issue of those exhibits' admission this morning.  Is now a convenient moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours will recall then that, in respect to the witness KBL, there are two documents which have been offered.  A third document was not the subject of argument and was entered into evidence, and I should add, ought to have been entered into evidence under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry.  Could we correct that now?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Registrar, can we endeavour admission and put that document under seal. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And to help the registrar, that is the statement of the witness, KBL, which is dated the 28th of September of 2007, and was -- 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, for purposes of speeding up the proceedings, may I propose, since I have already spoken to my client regarding this document, that we deal with these matters immediately after the break -- the morning break -- since I have to discuss this with my client?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  We can do that. 

Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The next witness I anticipate to be called by the Karemera Defence team is the witness TXL.  May I put Your Honours on notice now that this is a witness about whom there is considerable material.  I have inherited this witness and, indeed, will be dealing with all the witnesses throughout the week.  And it may be that, when the time arises for Prosecution cross-examination, I will have an application for some time.  I don't know yet, but I put Your Honours on notice of that at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, may I, first of all, inform the Chamber and all the parties that, over the weekend, TXL arrived so he will appear shortly.  Then we have CTB as well.  He is present.  Then we have LWU -- is also in Arusha. UKL is also present, and RQU is also in Arusha.  Now, WKL, in principle, should be arriving on Wednesday, at the very latest.  That is the situation regarding our witnesses Mr. President. 

Mr. President, I would like to make two applications regarding TXL.  CRWU and UKL, these witnesses, Mr. President, are protected witnesses.  They now reside in safehouses, and they would wish to have the Chamber waive the protective measures in their regard so that they can live in a hotel, a local hotel.  Regarding TXL, he would like the Court to maintain the protective measures while he keeps his protective -- his pseudonym, UKL, as well.  As for RWU, he wishes to waive the protective measures provided for in his regard.  That is the first application. 

The second application, Mr. President, concerns Witness TXL.  He has asked me to request the Chamber to allow him, after his testimony, to meet with detainees at the UNDF.  He has not seen those detainees for a very long time, and he wishes to meet with them in order to present his condolences to them, because they have lost their relatives or parents.  In the intervening period, the persons concerned are Colonel Muvunyi, M-U-V-U-N-Y-I, Tharcisse Muvunyi; Major Ntabakuze, Aloys, N-T-A-B-A-K-U-Z-E; and lastly, Mr. Éliezer Niyitegeka, N-I-Y-I-T-E-G-E-K-A.

The very same witness, TXL, following his testimony, would like to be allowed to meet the Accused.  These are the two applications, Mr. President.  Now, the last piece of information concerning the witness appearing shortly for examination-in-chief, I will need one-and-a-half hours; in any case, less than two hours -- about one hour, 45 minutes.  These are the estimates that I would like to give to the Chamber.  Except for what Mr. Morley has said, it will be possible for us to have one witness testify everyday, and every couple of days, about three witnesses should be able to testify.  Following what Mr. Morley has said, I believe, perhaps, it will be more reasonable to expect to have just one witness testify a day.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Morley. 
MR. MORLEY: 
In respect of lifting the witness protection orders, previously when such an application has been made, Your Honours may remember that Your Honours have sought a note, at the very least, from the witness himself, rather than simply relying on the ever helpful submissions of counsel, as a protection order is a significant matter, something issued personally by the Bench to the witness, and it's a matter for 
Your Honours whether the practice of having some written communication needs to be continued.  

As for visiting other detainees at the UNDF, the Prosecution, in respect of the Karemera case, has no particular observations.  But, in reality, the person in charge of the UNDF may, himself or herself, have an interest in whether somebody who's come to testify in one case can go and visit defendants in another.  And there it is.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley.

Mr. Sow, with regard to the issue of the waive of protective measures, that's an issue which, as you recall, we have already indicated that we expected the Defence team to adduce evidence.  You will recall that when the application was initially made, the Chamber considered that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the granting of protective measures, but we made temporary measures to the provide assistance and to facilitate the Defence and granted protective measures for everybody on the understanding that, in due course, evidence would be produced on an individual basis for the relevant witnesses to determine which ones really needed protection or not. 

Now, in these circumstances, we don't think we can waive the order just on a statement by counsel.  We need to get something from the witness.  And so the waiver of the protective measures would depend on hearing something from the witness.  As soon as that is filed, we will address it as soon as it is before us.  With regard to the issue of visitors visiting the -- at the UNDF, we will manage the visit to the -- in our case, as we have always been doing.  But we think that the application to see other prisoners have got to be launched in a different forum to a different authority to get permission for that to take place.  

I'm not in a position to advise you at the moment as to what is the proper authority.  I ask the registrar to make some enquiries, but you also could enquire as to what is the proper authority to present your application to.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have taken due note of your remarks, but let me point out that I have requested a waiver of protective measures only for Witness RWU.  As for the two others, TXL and UKL, these witnesses are requesting that the protective measures be maintained.  However, they are requesting only to be relocated to a hotel.  

So the situation is somewhat different.  The only person who wishes to waive his or her protective measures completely is RWU.  I expect that he will appear and explain why to the Court.  But all the three would wish to be housed in hotels, as opposed to safehouses.  That is the problem, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, that's not a problem that I think we can manage here.  I think a special application has to be made.  As far as I understand -- and I don't consider myself to be -- to have complete knowledge of this matter, but as far as I understand, the issue of protective measures is ill-consistent with people saying in hotels.  We have had one instance with one of your witnesses already who stayed at a hotel and complained of events which he said caused him some terror.  And I think that it would be inconsistent.  I would not willingly cooperate with a witness who is under our protection being in an environment where protection cannot be properly provided for him.  So that is an issue which would require something more than just standing up in Court and saying that you wish it to happen.  So we could not adjudicate on that now.  
MR. SOW: 
I have understood, Mr. President.  I believe we can now call the witness to appear.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The last point:  The comment about one witness per day has also rung some alarm bells.  We don't think that that seems an appropriate way to proceed.  If your examination-in-chief is going to last one-and-a-half hours -- I'm not certain, exactly, what type of application Mr. Morley is going to make, but we would want to have at least two witnesses addressed today completely -- or, perhaps, even three, if that's possible.  So your witnesses have got to be available to testify when required.  
MR. MORLEY:
Can I assist with the sort of application I might be making?  At the end of the evidence in chief, which I'm now hopefully told is going to be short, about an hour and a half, it may be that I'll be inviting 
Your Honours to allow me to cross-examine after lunch, which would mean if that application was allowed, that the second Defence witness would be coming in to give his evidence in chief this morning.  And I would still be, in my mind, fairly confident of getting through both witnesses in the afternoon.  But that's the sort of application I might be making, if it helps with time-tabling. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  It helps very much, because it would mean that the Defence would simply have to ensure that both witnesses are available for testifying in chief this morning.  And that may be a way of getting over the issue of scheduling.  

Mr. Sow, so what we would suggest now would be that, as a contingency, the second witness would be available to testify in chief this morning, and they would both probably be cross-examined this afternoon.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I would still have to grapple with the problem of making disclosures regarding the two witnesses, because, as far as I'm concerned, the first witness would require the half day, and in the afternoon we'll have the second witness.  We have already informed the second witness to appear at about 11:30 a.m.  But, if he were around, and I completed my first examination-in-chief, in order to proceed to the second examination-in-chief, we would have the same problems of disclosure of documents.  So Mr. Morley's concerns would remain in tact.  

So, Mr. Morley should handle the issue of disclosures after the first witness's examination-in-chief.  And in that case, it will be possible for us to start the examination-in-chief of the second witness early in the afternoon, and then have him cross-examine that same witness in the afternoon.  I believe that would be the most appropriate solution. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
There's something I don't understand.  If you have five witnesses who are going to testify this week, then you should be ready to do the examination-in-chief of all of them.  

MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe I have given the order of appearance of witnesses to all the parties.  The Prosecutor was fully aware that this morning the first witness would be TXL.  He did not state that he, himself, would wish to cross-examine that witness later on.  And may I add, Mr. President, as you have seen all last week, I was busy with the video link testimonies.  On Saturday and Sunday, all I did was to prepare the witnesses to appear this morning.  

So, Mr. President, I believe that I have done my best, my level best.  In principle, on Friday, when we requested that witnesses be called this week, if he had said that he would wish to postpone his cross-examination to this afternoon, we would have taken other measures, Mr. President, to pre-empt the problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think we should just start now.  So, if you can, call your witness; let's move forward.  
(Witness entered the courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As a preliminary to giving evidence in the trial, you have to make a declaration, or take an oath, to tell the truth.  And the registrar will now administer that to you. 
(Declaration made by Witness TXL in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, in connection with the issue you had raised concerning visitations, the registrar has made enquiries.  There is no objection in principle, except that there needs to be some information concerning the proposed visitor.  So application will have to be made through our registrar, who will assist in making the logistical arrangements for it to occur.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You will now be giving your testimony for our trial by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose.  And you will respond, first of all, to Mr. Sow, who is representing Édouard Karemera.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, you told me earlier that you were waiting for the witness to be here to put questions to him regarding protective measures.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, as you are aware, the Chamber made an order, a protective measures order, in your favour.  One element of it would have been the concealment of your identity as a witness from the public.  

Do you wish that the order that we made should be waived, or do you wish to continue enjoying the protection that had been provided by the Court?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, I would like to continue to enjoy those measures.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Could you indicate the reason why you would like to -- the protection to continue?  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, I would like to let you know that security is never a hundred per cent assured.  You know, even in Europe, where we live, people continue to disappear in a mysterious manner and we can't tell how.  And we need the security measures to be maintained because we don't know if this is going to happen to us.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The Prosecution's becoming a little troubled by the general allegation of people disappearing in, for example, Europe.  And Your Honours may welcome some further information.  But we know one unfortunate event in Europe, although it appears that that event has not been investigated as a murder, but, rather, it was -- I understand -- either an accident or a suicide.  

But the general allegation which we have from time to time from witnesses who are living abroad that people are disappearing, Your Honours may want to have further information on that, because it's quite a serious thing to be suggesting.  I leave it in Your Honours' hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Both, Mr. Morley and Mr. Sow, we have decided that the witness has given an explanation of the reason why he's afraid.  We don't think we should conduct a collateral investigation on the issue on the details of the security situation in Europe.  We think that would be collateral to our trial.  

On the other hand, the explanation given by the witness reinforces the importance of the protection package that the Tribunal provides as a whole, and it would make it inconsistent with the concept of guaranteeing security for the witness if the witness was allowed to leave the protection provided by our security officers and just go and live in a hotel, where he would be exposed to any risk.  

So we will maintain the protective order that we have.  And we do not think that we have any justification for directing WVSS to vary their system and allow the witness to stay in a hotel.  
THE WITNESS: 
Your Honour, this is not the first time that I am testifying in this Tribunal, and I wonder if there are times when security is ensured in the safehouse, and others when they are less.  Because, both times I came here, there were times when I was at the hotel, and others when I was at the safehouse.  I wonder what the difference is.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, I'm afraid I can't get into a debate with you on these issues.  I, myself, I'm not an expert in the provision of security measures.  But the Tribunal has established a system for dealing with these matters, and the advice that I have been given, and upon which I am acting, is that the -- part of the package of the protection of witnesses includes protecting them when in the place where they live, that there is an arrangement for providing such protection in the safehouses, but they are not able to offer similar protection when people stay in hotels.  

Now, whether the others that are -- this is not an area of my expertise, but I think I have to rely upon the arrangements made by the Tribunal in this regard.  And, as I mentioned to Mr. Sow before you arrived, that if there was a desire for a variation of those protective measures, then it would have to be addressed in a different manner with people who have probably more knowledge than I do on these issues.  But I don't think that I would be justified in making an order at this stage for removing the protection which is provided in the manner.  

Yes, Mr. Sow. 
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I would like to apply for a closed session to put some questions which could reveal the identity of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We're going into a closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 9 to 11] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera).
(Pages 1 to 8 by Lisa Smith)




BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, you have to be careful when you provide answers in order not to reveal your identity.  

Witness, as far as you are aware, what was the situation, the political situation in the Kibuye préfecture during multipartyism?  
A.	Well, as someone who did not have to take part in political activities as a result of my duties, after the advent of multipartyism, I tried to observe things.  At the advent of multipartyism, it could be seen that political parties were rather linked to regions and préfectures.  

For instance, one could see that the Butare préfecture, and part of Gikongoro, were predominantly in favour of PSD.  Around the centre of the country in the Gitarama préfecture, it was the MDR, which was predominant.  And when you move up north to the préfectures of Gisenyi, part of Ruhengeri, I should say, the MRND was predominant.  And in other préfectures, it was a mix.  You could find almost all political parties.  And in the Kibuye préfecture, the MDR and the MRND were ahead of the other political parties.  That is my -- what I observed, personally.  
Q.	In the Kibuye préfecture, who -- which party was majority between MRND and MDR?  
A.	I could say the MDR tended to be leading over the MRND.  
Q.	Still, at the préfectoral level, according to the information that you have, what was the situation of the youth wings of parties at the level of the préfecture -- the Kibuye préfecture, that is -- and more especially, regarding the Interahamwe in Kibuye?  Was there an organised structure of the Interahamwe in Kibuye?  
A.	As I said a while ago, I didn't have opportunities to return to my préfecture, my commune.  Furthermore, when you're referring to Interahamwe, I distinguish -- if my understanding is that Interahamwe is the youth wing of a political party which had been set up for political animation in favour of that political party, and which had the representation of these political parties in the Kibuye préfecture, then I can presuppose that there was also a youth wing connected with that political party in that -- in the Kibuye préfecture, although there was a concentration of these youths of a political party mostly in the capitol.  
Q.	Do you know anything about the evolution of youth wings of political parties in your commune origin?  
A.	As I said, I did not have occasion to go to my commune of origin, so I do not know very much about the evolution of youth wings.  
Q.	Witness, where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	On the 6th of April 1994, in the evening and all night, I was at home.  And I had spent the whole day of the 6th in the office in Kigali.  So I was in Kigali.  
Q.	Can you tell the Chamber for how long you were in Kigali up until your departure?  
A.	I stayed in Kigali as of April up until the 4th of July at about 7 a.m.  That is when I left the town centre to go to Gisenyi.  That was when people decided to abandon Kigali town.  
Q.	From the 6th of April up until the 4th of July, what were you doing in Kigali?  
A.	On the 6th of April and even before then, I was ************* of a unit in charge of ************************** of the **************************.  And my command post was in ******.  That was where I discharged my duties as *************************.  Thereafter, I became *******************************, that is, of 
	the 9th, 10th of April up until late May.  In late May, I became ****************************************** **************************************.  I remember up until the 4th of July, as I stated, that was when it was decided that the town be abandoned.  
Q.	Did you, at any point in time, leave Kigali during that period to go to another location?  
A.	I never left the town centre.  My duties were such that I was not allowed to be absent, even for a few seconds.  So I remained in Kigali from the 6th up until the 4th of July.  
Q.	Witness, during that period, did you go to your commune of origin?  
A.	I believe that this is not the first time I am answering that question.  I have always stated that, as of the 1st of January 1994 till date, I have not been to my commune of origin.  
Q.	Witness, I am putting this question to you, because Prosecution witnesses have asserted that weapons were distributed to Interahamwe in your commune of origin, and that you, yourself, participated in such weapons distributions.  Are you aware of such allegations; or, rather, in any case, what would you say to such allegations?  
A.	Well, I was not aware of that.  I am just hearing about this for the first time here.  And I have stated that I did not step foot in the commune.  Mr. Karemera is here.  Perhaps, he, too, has testified to that.  I am also considering the situation of the army even before the 6th, notably, the problems we had regarding stocks of weapons.  

By the way, those problems were a handicap when fighting resumed.  Furthermore, I had nothing to do with the youth wing of the party, such as to be in a position to go and distribute weapons, even if we had had such weapons.  So I never went to the commune, even just to visit, and even less so, to distribute weapons which we did not even have.  I believe these allegations must be made by the fabricated witnesses who came here to give false testimony, quite simply.  
Q.	Witness, do you know Mr. Édouard Karemera?  
A.	I know him very well.  He held high offices in the country as a minister, and other positions.  I was in Kigali.  We were working in Kigali and we used to see one another.  He is also from my *************, hailing from a ************************************.  
Q.	Witness, are you aware that Prosecution witnesses stated that you specifically distributed weapons with Mr. Édouard Karemera in your *********************?  
A.	I can only repeat what I have stated, if I did not go to the commune.  And in the army we had a problem, a problem of equipment.  Besides, I had nothing to do with the Interahamwe of the MRND.  I did not practice politics.  I, therefore, do not see how I could have gone there to distribute weapons with Mr. Karemera.  I am, therefore, saying that I did not go there, and I never distributed weapons with Mr. Karemera.  
Q.	Witness, do you know *********************************?  Let me spell out that name:  *****************************.  
A.	I know him very well. 
Q.	Please, tell us about him.  
A.	Well, **********************was my *****************.  When I *****************, he was already there.  He was a gentleman who had been involved in a serious accident, and he had been withdrawn from active service in units that were referred to as combatant units, and he was now working in the administration, because he was militarily handicapped.  He used a stick to walk.  

In '64 he was dismissed from the army and sent back to my commune.  He could not leave that commune.  He remained there a long time without working, and he was sustained by the meager salary of his wife, who was a nurse.  And when he was released from the army, he returned to Kigali to live in his plot near the airport, and he remained there without working.  It was only subsequently that he obtained employment at the Kicukiro breweries up until 1994.  And after that, he fled, like the others, to the Democratic Republic of Congo.  
Q.	Witness, may I request you to try, to the best of your ability, to spell out the names that you have mentioned.  If you need a piece of paper and a pen, may I request the registrar to give you such materials so that you can spell out those names in order to enable the court reporters to correctly record them.  I thank you in advance for your understanding.  
MR. SOW: 
Madam Registrar, I also thank you for your assistance. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	You have talked about the place where he worked, that is, the Bralirwa breweries.  Could you please spell out that name?  
A.	Bralirwa is spelt as follows:  B-R-A-L-I-R-W-A.  Rwandan Breweries that was in Kicukiro.  Is spelt as follows:  K-I-C-U-K-I-R-O, Kicukiro. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Do you know ************************?  ***************** is spelt as follows:  ****************.  
A.	I also know *************.  He was also my ********************.  
Q.	Can you tell us about that gentleman? 
A.	****************** was also dismissed from the army in 1974 after the coup d'état.  He also vanished into thin air.  He could not be seen because he did not have any work.  He struggled here and there looking for work.  And I would say that he was also living off the meager salary of his wife, who was also a nurse, I believe.  

And it was in 1980, 1981, when the ******************************** development project was launched that he was able to obtain employment as chief of personnel.  He remained there working at Byumba.  That was where the headquarters of the project was based.  And when the fighting spread to the entire préfecture of Byumba, he returned to Kigali up until when he fled the fighting in Kigali and went to the commune in Kibuye.  And then he eventually returned to Rwanda.  That is where he is currently.  
Q.	Witness, between Byumba and your commune of origin, what is the approximate distance? 
A.	It is a long distance.  This -- it's like the distance from Kigali to Byumba.  Byumba is in the north of Kigali.  You have to leave Kigali, go to the centre of the country, and then go to the east, because Kibuye préfecture, it is in the east of the country.  So it is a very long distance.  I am unable to give you an estimate of that distance in kilometers, but it is quite far.  
Q.	Witness, one Prosecution witness, namely, BDW, testified -- and this is recorded in the minutes -- that some officers were in charge of providing military training to Interahamwe in your commune of origin.  I would like you to tell the Chamber what you think of that testimony since you have talked about those two persons whom you know very well.  
A.	Well, since I was not there, I would only say that I was not there.  Since I have described to you ************************** as someone who was physically handicapped and unable, therefore, to carry out rigorous military activities --  and such activities are very vigorous -- he could not have provided military training to people, whereas he himself could not even carry out such exercises.  If you want to teach someone, particularly in our country, you have to be able to show that person what that person has to do.  And from the physical standpoint, he was not able to do that.  

Regarding ******************************************, I believe that, given their background, those people would not have been satisfied with a regime that had dismissed them, because, since 1974, they had been dismissed from the army for reasons I do not know.  One went to the commune, the other was unemployed for several years.  So they could not have been pleased with that regime -- and I mean the President Habyarimana regime.  

So, if we reckon that the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND party, that is, the president's party, I suppose that those people who are not pleased with the regime could not have accepted to train the youth wing of that regime.  That is my opinion in light of my knowledge of those people.  I have completed my statement.  
Q.	Witness, you have stated that both persons worked at places that were very far from your commune of origin.  Is it reasonable to think that the same persons would leave their jobs on a daily basis and go to your commune of origin, precisely, to provide the training to the youths?  
A.	So long as their offices were operational -- because there were some that were not operational because the regions in which they worked had already been conquered by the RPF and they didn't know where to go.  But if their offices were still functional, I do not see how they would have left their offices to go and train people who were not members of the services in which they worked.  

	So I suppose that they continued to go about their usual duties at their respective places of work.

1030H 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I believe it is time for us to take the mid-morning break, by the Chamber's -- if the Chamber so wishes.  Maybe I could stop here.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we could.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Sorry.  Before Your Honour rises, I'm doing my best to accommodate Your Honours' time keeping.  If Your Honour was to say that instead of the mid-morning break being 15 minutes, but Your Honour was to say that we could come back at ten past 11, I will be ready to cross-examine this witness when my learned friend finishes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  We can make such an order. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1034H to 1130H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Sow, you may continue, please.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we are going to proceed.  We had stopped at the level of those two captains who -- who were cited as Prosecution witnesses as being people who had been in charge of training Interahamwe militia in your native commune.  I would like to put the following question to you presently:  Did you know the Ndoha woods, spelling N-D-O-H-R-A (sic)?  
A.	Yes, I know the area.  It is an -- was an area with bushes, shrubs which did not -- shrubs and bushes which did not allow the scenery to be seen properly, plus marshy area.  I remember that about 50 years ago, while I was in primary school, in that marshy area there is a water source from which water springs, fresh water which is loved by stock, especially cattle.  So, we went there to use it as a watering hole for cattle.  

And it's a long while ago.  And I was saying that it is the marshy area such that even cattle, which were thin, were not authorised -- were not allowed to go there because they would get stuck in the mud.  Therefore, it is an area which is far from the commune to the northeast of the commune.  
Q.	When you're saying that it is an area that is far from the commune, could you evaluate the distance in terms of kilometres or metres?  
A.	Now, there's no road leading to it.  The path which we used, we used by trekking, and it went through high mountains.  But maybe 25, 30 kilometres, I would say.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Was it possible at that place, Ndoha, to organise military training in Ndoha? 
A.	Well, I told you what the terrain looks like.  When you are going to train people, you have to choose a terrain according to the exercise which you want to make.  As a soldier, I can't see what type of exercise can be carried out in that area where there was no open area and an area which is so marshy. 
Q.	Witness, I'm not a soldier, but I can see in movies, I can see commandos going into marshy areas.  Couldn't it be possible that for people to be trained, this could also be the case?  
A.	Were Interahamwe soldiers?  Commandos has a special training that is required.  And for you to reach that level of training, you need to have adequate training as a soldier.  And this is an elite corp.  It is not just the rum-drum soldier. 
Q.	Witness, did you know the playground of the ***************************? 
A.	Yes, I know the football pitch, the playground.  That is where *****************************.  
Q.	Could you tell us what is around that playground? 
A.	Well, the primary school belonged to the *****************.  And as it was with other parishes, the priests had shrubs around the parish and close to the football field, or the playground.  There is a eucalyptus tree wood. 
Q.	How can you locate the playground in relation to the road? 
A.	It is longitudinal to the south and to the left, and is close to the road.  There is no space between the road and the playground. 
Q.	Therefore, from the road you can see the playground? 
A.	It is right close to the road, at the road side. 
Q.	Based on your knowledge, Witness, is it possible to organise military training on that playground? 
A.	Well, as I said earlier, you choose the terrain depending on the exercise.  And on a playground, 
	football field, militarily if you want to train people in exhibition exercises, the football field is appropriate.  But for tactical information -- tactical training, it is not appropriate.  If you are -- for the record, if you're organising training for drill -- drillings -- drills, it would be okay.  But for tactical training, the football field would not be okay.  
Q.	Witness, do you know the Mashyiga valley, M-A-S-H-Y-I-G-A? 
A.	Mashyiga is the river that springs from the Congo Nile crater and moves eastwards and has an outlet into the Nyabarongo.  So it's a small river that flows to the north, but close to the ****************.  And it is a river that flows between two hills.  And at some -- and at some points, you might find fields 
	on -- land on both sides, but which are not -- maybe 100 metres from the river.  And these fields are used by farmers who farm various crops:  Potato, sorghum, beans, so on and so forth.  
Q.	Witness, I would like you to describe the spot.  And if you could, to kindly draw it out on a paper.  

MR. SOW: 
And I would like to add, Madam Registrar, if you do have a plain sheet of paper, kindly give it to witness for him to describe that valley where the Mashyiga valley flowed and locating the playground which was referred to a while ago. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Could you assist us with that?  
A.	It's difficult to draw the valley -- but I'll try -- since they are between two high mountains. 
Q.	Maybe you don't have to draw the mountains.  At least do a sketch which would enable us to have an overview of the area.  
A.	I will try.  
Q.	If on the sketch you can show the Mashyiga river, the road and the playground, and so on and so forth, so that it will be clearer to the Chamber and all parties.  

Witness, I know that you are not a talented painter, such as Picasso, but --
A.	I know, but I'll try to move as fast as I can. 
Q.	Are you done, Witness?  
A.	I did it in haste, but, well --
Q.	Witness, you have just sketched for us the area involving the Mashyiga area which was not far from the school.  Could you tell us if, based on what you know, the valley, as such, was an appropriate place for training? 
A.	Well, if you talk about the border valley, you'd understand that it is a valley just as you'd find on the borders of any river.  These were very small area -- land areas.  You know, in Rwanda farm lands are rare.  And these lands are always occupied with farms of potatoes, beans, and sorghum.  

At that time, I can't tell you what was planted in the fields there.  But when we carried out exercises, we avoided walking over peasant farms.  We sought lands that were on farms.  And if the Interahamwe had to be trained, we were not going to choose peasant farms instead of choosing the football.  But there, there was a eucalyptus wood, and the training would have been done there instead of going to wreck the plants of the peasants.  In my view, it was not the appropriate place to choose.  
Q.	But didn't you show the market on the sketch which is not far away from the playground?  
A.	All along the field, and going to the west towards Kibuye, there was a whole range of shops.  Then there's a little road to the left going towards the centre where you'll find the market.  It is close to the road, and there's no difference. 
Q.	The shops, how far would you say they were from the playground? 
A.	It's only the road that separates the playground from the shops.  And the shops are along the road. 
Q.	Thank you.  

MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I would apply for this sketch to be admitted as exhibit. 
MS. NGOWI:  
The number will be D. 92.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Exhibit No. D. K92 admitted)
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, I am going to conclude by this line of questions.  We are in April 1994.  Would you confirm that you were, indeed, in Kigali? 
A.	I do confirm it.  I was in Kigali. 
Q.	Could you state to the Chambers the prevailing situation in Kigali? 
A.	As from the 6th of April 1974 (sic) -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness said '74. 
THE WITNESS:
-- after the assassination of the president of Rwanda and Burundi, the situation degraded significantly.  And the following day, on the 7th, it was stated that the RPF started fighting in the afternoon.  But I know that in the afternoon around 1500 hours they had already invaded -- they started in Amohoro, the UNAMIR area.  And the Remera gendarmerie brigade, that is to say, they had not begun the fighting at that time.  Indeed, it had been before.  And then, quickly, Kigali city became a battle ground.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, did the army have the means of bringing the disorder and the killings to an end? 
A.	Firstly, the army had its mission.  And the Rwandan armed forces, after four years of combats, were worn out.  They were warning -- worn out personally and with regard to equipment.  And at some point in time, it had been thought that recruitment should be made to replace the people who were most worn out in the army, and we also had to renew equipment which was either outdated or broken down.  Because we were of the opinion that if the PLA -- and if there was peace, we would have the weapons.  But if there was no peace, we should have been able to carry on with the fight.  But that was not done.  Maybe -- as far as I'm concerned, because there were disagreements between a government that was led by the opposition, and the president.  Because, according to some, if the army was reinforced, it means that the president will be reinforced while people were fighting for -- one another to win -- to win elections.  The army continued in that situation without new weapons or new equipment until a point when the RPF re-launched hostilities on 6th April. 

And when, on 6th April, the fighting started by RPF, it stationed its men everywhere.  They immobilised people.  And -- and when you don't have reserves, as we had not been able to recruit people, we found ourselves in a situation where we didn't have enough soldiers.  Everybody was already deployed, and we did not have reserve soldiers to be deployed and stop the massacres and provide security.  And, therefore, we were engaged in combat, and because we did not have enough soldiers, they didn't have enough soldiers to intervene here and there.  And so what we did is we asked the RPF to stop the combat for us to ensure that security returns to the country.  But the RPF did not agree. 

Part of the gendarmerie, also, which had to ensure security as one of their main missions, was 
affected -- no -- was deployed in combatting with the Rwandan army.  Therefore, we didn't have the means to intervene, and we were busy facing off the RPF advances.  
Q.	Witness, I have listened to you carefully.  However, although you state that you suffered from a shortage of staff members, you said that the youths were hired to fight alongside the army.  What is the situation exactly? 
A.	While I was in ***********************************************, I remained there up until when we abandoned the town.  We understood, from our assessment of the situation, that the RPF had dispatched an elite force to capture Kigali town as quickly as possible.  And as you know, if you captured Kigali, the capital, you won the war.  

I could not have confronted that elite force with youths who did not even have the minimum military training.  So I worked with soldiers, and I do not know what happened.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I have just completed my examination-in-chief.  

Witness, I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to some further questions.

First of all, do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. Sow has asked all the questions I could have put to the witness, so I do not have any questions for the witness.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  
MR. NIMY: 
Good morning, Mr. President -- good day, Mr. President.  I have no questions for the witness.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much.  

You now have to respond to the Prosecutor who will be putting his questions to you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, I have an application to deal with this witness's evidence in closed session.  

My apologies to the public gallery.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For the benefit of the public, the Chamber has -- the Chamber has made an order for the protection of this witness, and we have to go into closed session now to protect his identity from being revealed.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 23 to 49] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 17 to 22 by Vicki Eastvold)



















MR. MORLEY: 
While we are changing the witness, may I mention to Your Honour that there would be, in the usual way, an application to offer some material into evidence in respect to this witness.  Practice seems to be developing.  That may be an argument which we can hold later unless Your Honour feels that this is a good time to do it.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, how long are you going to be in-chief with this witness, with the new witness?  My question is, are we likely to finish the examination-in-chief this afternoon?  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, it would be impossible for me to complete my examination-in-chief because there is less than one hour left.  So I wouldn't be able to be done with it, Your Honour, according to my estimate.  And of course, it depends on the witness in the stand because he doesn't have the same level as the preceding one.  So I might need a minimum two hours to be done with him.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you very much.  May I say that, having heard my learned friend say a minimum of two hours, suggesting, therefore, perhaps more, all I have, as I recall it, is two sentences as to what this next witness is going to talk about.  We don't know very much about him, and to some extent, to a very large extent, I'm entirely in the dark as to what's coming, and when my learned friend mentions more than two hours, Your Honours will note that he's skillfully dealt with the present witness who has just left the box in just under two hours, and that was a witness who had quite a lot to say.  It's a little trouble that we might have a long witness, more than two hours, about whom notice is, as I have it, two sentences.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, I stated precisely that this is a witness that doesn't have the same intellectual level, the same training, as the preceding one.  There have been accusations made against Mr. Karemera concerning the secteur in which that witness is found.  I should be in a position to over view with him all the accusations and details to enlighten the Chamber, and that is why  I insist on stating that if the witness answered the questions put to him in a very concise manner, evidently, I shall not need that much time, and I shall remind Mr. Morley that he has had to use a lot more than what was allowed him the last time.  I think it's known that I don't drag the examination-in-chief lengthily unnecessarily.  In the beginning, I think I made a motion.  So I do everything in my capacity not to waste time, the Chambers' time, and I think that is a well-known fact here.
MR. MORLEY: 
I take it, Your Honours, that we're now going to proceed to the next witness, and may I invite Your Honours' considerations as to when would be a convenient time, perhaps tomorrow morning, to deal with what are now the exhibits to be filed in respect of three witnesses -- TXL, KBL, and LSP. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we might have the witness get started now, particularly in light of the comments herein, and then we'll deal with that as effectively as we can tomorrow.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin giving your evidence, the Registrar will administer an oath to you for you to tell the truth when you are giving your evidence, and the Registrar will do that now.  
(Declaration made by Witness CTB in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you will give your evidence by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers designated for that purpose, and you are now to respond, first of all, to Mr. Sow who is representing Édouard Karemera.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, before examining this witness, I would like to state that he is still a resident in Rwanda and that the entire examination be done in closed session.  It has to do with his security, and I can state to you that last time I was telling you that one of our witnesses were to come from there was, indeed, prevented from doing so, and I would not like him to run any risk of any problems when he returns.  Therefore, Your Honour, I would like to apply that you order a closed session, and this will enable him to feel freer to provide all answers to the questions put to him.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The application is resisted.  As a general principle, for a witness to give evidence entirely in closed session, simply because they are resident in Rwanda, Your Honours may feel is a difficult precedent to set.  Although the last witness was cross-examined entirely in closed session, Your Honours will know that the nature of the cross-examination involved repeatedly identifying who he was.  My learned friend is invited to consider to what extent he can examine in-chief in a way which does not identify the witness, which is what we often do.  The application is resisted because it sets up a principle without foundation.  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, Your Honour, the Chamber needs to understand the difficulties that Defence faces in order to bring witnesses from Rwanda.  This witness used the road to go to a neighbouring country and to be here, XCU.  When we tried to bring him here, that was not possible, and it is not for nothing that whenever we insist on the identity of people, these people.  Ever since they had to come, they were visited not only by the police but by the ministry of justice.  We have major problems in doing that.  Everyone who is on the stand is going to return to Rwanda, and I believe that for his security and to enable the Chamber to be enlightened, and Mr. Morley is well aware of this fact that witnesses who have been here, for the most part, have been subjected to a very restricted closed session.

The one who just departed was cross-examined completely in closed session, although he is abroad and not in Rwanda; therefore, Your Honour, I cannot even begin to describe to you the difficulties that we have in getting witnesses from Rwanda.  That is not the same thing from the Prosecution who can move about in Rwanda as he wishes, who has relations with the state, and who can have all the information that he requires who is not the same thing for the Defence team.  I believe for the safe security of this person, I am of the humble opinion, Your Honour, that he should be authorised to present his testimony in closed session.   
MR. MORLEY: 
I know Your Honours have the point, but it's very clear now that this is basically a blanket application in respect of all Rwandan witnesses, and it sets a dangerous precedent.  It means the entire Defence case, in respect of Rwandan witnesses, is likely to end up in closed session.  
(Pages 50 to 52 by Kelly Surina)























1652H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, contrary to your suspicions -- your suggestions, we think that we do understand a bit of the problem to which you asserted.  But we are not satisfied that the proposal that you have made is the best way to address it.  We have to comment that the evidence summary that was provided was not sufficient informative for us at this stage to exercise any independent decision as to what this witness is actually going to say. 

And so, what we propose in the interest of justice is that he starts his testimony in closed session, and as we hear what he's saying, we may re-evaluate whether his testimony could be given in open or not.  It would depend on the content of his testimony that we prefer to exercise our discretion on the issue of the relationship between closed and open sessions.  But we'd allow you to start in closed session now, and then we will see how the evidence develops.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Lordship.  I would like to apply for a closed session to ask a certain number of questions to him which could reveal his identity.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
For the benefit of the public, this witness has been the beneficiary of a protective order for security reasons.  And one element of that is that his identity should not be revealed to the public.  For that reason, to just avoid the possibility developing, we are going to go into closed session now.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour.

(Page 53 by Lisa Smith)













BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness, we are in open session, so please be very careful so as not to reveal your identity.  

Witness, can you tell the Court the political parties which were active in your secteur? 
A.	The predominant party in the secteur was the MRND -- it was -- in fact, the predominant party was the MDR, second to the MRND, which was second (sic).  
Q.	Before the advent of multiparty politics, that is, before 1991, how were the youth organised in your secteur?  
A.	At the time, the youth were in charge of various aspects.  There were some associations; there were various sports activities; there were football tournaments; there were festivals.  And during feasts, there were competitions that were organised.  
Q.	With the advent of the -- of multiparty politics, what was the situation of the youth?  
A.	Upon the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda, the youth continued to go about their business, their regular activities, namely, joining associations and various recreational activities as usual.  There was no problem affecting the youth.  
Q.	In April 1994, more specifically, on the 6th of April 1994, where were you? 
A.	I was at home.  
Q.	From the 6th of April, did you stay in your secteur throughout? 
A.	I stayed in my secteur throughout that period.  
Q.	And when, precisely, did you leave your secteur? 
A.	To go out of my secteur, then I left my secteur to go into exile.  Otherwise, I did not leave my secteur to go anywhere else.  
Q.	Witness, with further regard to April 1994, can you tell the Court whether, as far as the centre is concerned -- I'm not going to specify that name; I am sure you would understand, as I had advised -- was there a roadblock? 
A.	No, there wasn't any roadblock at that centre.  
Q.	Throughout the time you were there, was there any roadblock? 
A.	I never saw any roadblock at that location.  I lived in that centre.  If there had been a roadblock, I would have known.  
Q.	Witness, between the 6th of April and July, did you see Mr. Édouard Karemera at the centre?  
A.	I did not see Édouard Karemera in that centre.  
Q.	Did Édouard Karemera convene a meeting with the -- convene a meeting or convene the population to a meeting at that centre between April and July 1994?  
A.	No meeting was held in that centre between April and July, and Karemera did not hold any meeting at that centre.  
Q.	Witness, would you be surprised to learn that somebody claimed that he held a meeting to urge the population to go to Bisesero and kill the Tutsi? 
A.	If somebody purported that Karemera held a meeting at that centre to incite the members of the public to kill the Tutsi, that person would have lied, because that has never happened.  And I lived in that centre and I did not leave throughout that period.  
Q.	Did you hear members of the public mention that meeting? 
A.	Nobody mentioned that meeting.  If that meeting had taken place, I would have been informed about it.  
Q.	Witness, I will put a name to you, and tell me, please, if you know that person.  And, thereafter, I will proceed with my questions.  
MR. SOW: 
Registry, please could you assist me in circulating this document which bears the name of somebody?
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Kindly look at that document and tell the Court if you know that person.  
A.	I know that person.  
Q.	It is not necessary to mention the name.  Just take it that you know the name.  Very well.  (Microphones overlapping)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Overlap, Mr. President.  Could counsel repeat his question?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Counsel.  
THE WITNESS: 
That person lived in Gisovu commune, G-I-S-O-V-U, in the secteur. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Sow, we didn't get your question.  Could you put it again, please?  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	After the witness had seen? 
MR. SOW: 
After the witness had seen the name of the person on the piece of paper, I asked the witness if it's the place of residence of that person whose name appears on that piece of paper.  
BY MR. SOW:
Q.	Witness did you understand? 
A.	Yes, I have explained that that person lived in Gisovu commune in the Rugaragara secteur, which is spelt:  R-U-G-A-R-A-G-A-R-A, Rugaragara.  And to be more specific, that person was a citizen of the commune -- a member of the cellule.  
Q.	Do you know the exact place where his house was found?  
A.	Yes, very well, indeed.  I know where his house was found.  
Q.	Could you tell the Chamber how far his house is from the centre? 
A.	Between his house and the centre?  The house is -- people who leave their banana farms -- I would say it should be -- between the centre and his house, there is a distance of about 300 metres.  
Q.	Witness, is it possible for people at this home to hear others talking at the centre?  
A.	No, that is impossible.  If that person was at their home, they would not hear a voice from the centre.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  I noticed that it is time.  I wonder if this is not the right time to adjourn until tomorrow.  Also, I believe that the witness is answering in a precise manner and this is going to enable us to carry on quickly.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Sow. 
MR. MORLEY: 
May I just enquire, how much longer in chief, if my learned friend has any idea?  
MR. SOW: 
I believe, Mr. Morley, that, reasonably speaking, we could use an hour, maybe an hour, 15 minutes.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  One more matter of housekeeping, Your Honour, when the witness retires from the witness box, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we're going to take our adjournment for today now.  And you will have to come back tomorrow morning to complete your testimony.  I should let you know that -- 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
-- during this or any other adjournment while you are a witness, you are not to discuss the case or your evidence with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I do, perfectly so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  You are excused now.  You may retire.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MR. MORLEY: 
As the witness retires, may I just enquire of my learned friends, am I right in believing that the witness after this one will be RWU, and the witness after him will be UKL?  And if that is right, might I invite consideration to having both witnesses here tomorrow?  
MR. SOW: 
Your Honour, that is the order we had announced before.  

MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  That's helpful.  

May I just mention that it would have been considerable, or of considerable assistance to me if it had been made clear that the purpose of this witness is to rebut the testimony of the witness, AMO, or have been made clear it was to rebut the testimony in respect of the Gasenyi centre, G-A-S-E-N-Y-I.  

The only information I have relates to how he's going to talk about local affairs and knowing Édouard Karemera.  I have overnight to deal with matters, and, of course, everything will be ready.  But may I just put a marker down that having simply that extra piece of information would have put this witness in sensible context for preparation by the Prosecution.  Thank you.  
MR. SOW: 
Prosecutor, you are well aware that this witness comes from the secteur you have just indicated, and he had official duties there.  As you heard, if a meeting had been held there, he would be in a position to state so.  As a matter of fact, he did state so.  I feel there's no point in going into further detail.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I want this to be clear, please, because it's only for future reference to be of assistance so that there aren't applications by the Prosecution to adjourn to prepare for cross-examination.  

My learned friends know, and I think the Bench knows, that I try my best to be diligent in having everything be ready.  I don't ask for three weeks' adjournments when people pop up and give evidence which isn't expected.  All that we know in respect of CTB is that he comes from Kagunga secteur in Mwendo.  It would simply have been of assistance to mention that he was going to rebut the testimony in respect of Gasenyi centre sightings of Karemera.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
I would like to further the information provided by Mr. Morley by referring him to a motion submitted by the Karemera Defence team on 14 April, where there is a résumé of what this witness was going to say, and where it states that Mr. Karemera was going to speak of the unfolding of events in his area, which -- that he had never sensitsed the people in his commune for hate and ethnic segregation.  

This résumé, which is, indeed, a résumé, shows in a few words used the main topic on which this witness was going to testify, that is to say, the meeting in his commune.  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY: 
And without -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, I think we've heard enough.  We would just like to say that we think it would be of assistance if there was a bit more information in the witness summaries that have been provided.  It would assist in making the trial move a bit more efficiently and effectively.  And this would be in keeping with the principles of disclosure, which we have tried to emphasise throughout the trial.  And we don't consider, as the appeals Chamber has ruled, that the obligations are identical with those of the Prosecutor.  But that information should be provided to facilitate a smooth trial process.  

With that note, I think we can take our adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1740H)
