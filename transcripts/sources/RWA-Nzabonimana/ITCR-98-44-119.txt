P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning.  Mr. Registry, could you call the status conference, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, 24 March 2005, for a Status Conference in the matter of the Prosecutor vs. Rwamakuba, Case Number ICTR-98-44C-I.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Appearances, please.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor is represented by myself, Don Webster, Dior Fall, Tamara Cummings-John, Greg Lombardi, and we have a new addition to the team, Mr. Iain Morley.  I'll let him introduce himself since you are familiar with the rest of us.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please.  Your microphone.  Your microphone, please.
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honours.  I appear from London, having arrived recently, and I'm here as best I can to assist you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, your microphone.  Thank you.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Good morning, Your Honours.  I am Andreas O'Shea and I appear for Dr. André Rwamakuba.  Now, I welcome Mr. Morley to the court.  And also I apologise; I think we were all under the impression that we were going to be robed.  I mean no disrespect by that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't mind seeing you robed.  Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are still trying to fine tune our scheduling plans and we have developed a number of options.  Now, one of them involves completing the -- making an assessment of dealing with both the Prosecution and the Defence cases before the December recess.  We allocated, I think -- was it six weeks or 12 weeks?  I think we allocated a total of 12 weeks, which would be in two or three sessions.  Now, when would be the earliest time that you could start?  Could you start on the 6th of June?  I notice in your written note you had suggested a session from the 15th of June to the 15th of July, but we were wondering whether you could squeeze a start a week or two earlier than that, or is that your earliest date?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I can.  As I have indicated earlier, I want to be very cautious with regard to the medical position of Mr. Hooper and respect, if I may, the advice of the doctor.  That being the case, the earliest date that Mr. Hooper can be in court is the 9th of June.  We, of course, have to have a pre-trial conference.  I would, of course, prefer if Mr. Hooper was here for the pre-trial conference, and it may very well be that as time moves on, Mr. Hooper may get better faster than we have been told.  My suggestion to the Court would be that we have a pre-trial conference on the 9th of June.  If it's absolutely necessary to push it further, and there aren't any difficulties with Mr. Hooper, of course, I can deal with the pre-trial conference alone.  

With regard to the issue of the length of the first session, I think Your Honour will understand that if we do start in June, it would be my preference to have a shorter session of three to four weeks, to begin with, to accommodate my commitments in another international tribunal, if that's possible.  If it's not possible, then I am left with the task of trying -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You've given a date of the 15th of July. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that be appropriate?  If we allow the session to end on that date, would that suit your convenience?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I can work with those dates, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Then as far as the dates in the December session, at the moment, that's not - you're open for finding the balance of the time between September and December?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Your Honour, there's no difficulty with the December session.  I would like to indicate to the Court that I do not feel comfortable at this stage giving a very clear indication to the Court as to how much time we would require between the Prosecution case -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that.  
MR. O'SHEA:
-- and the Defence case. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, let's start with one premise.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would not be less than six weeks.
MR. O'SHEA:
In December. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There would not be a gap of less than six weeks --
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- between the Prosecution and Defence case. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, I'm grateful for that indication. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would that be an adequate period?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I don't know, but theoretically, yes.  It's a bit early for me to commit myself on that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll address the issue of scheduling, Your Honour, because it impacts upon the other trial, but for most of the substantive issues that Mr. Hooper -- excuse me, or Mr. O'Shea or the Court is going to raise, I'm going to have my colleague, Dior Fall, respond.  But on the scheduling, that sounds appropriate to me.  I would recommend that we actually take the opening statements on the 9th and that Mr. O'Shea handle the pre-trial conference.  If we wait until the 9th for the pre-trial conference, we should have at least a week delay before the opening statements because it serves no purpose to gather for a pre-trial conference and not have time to address any issues that may come up.  So I don't think it would be appropriate to have a pre-trial conference on one day and have the trial start on the following day.  Perhaps Mr. O'Shea can be here a week earlier, handle all the pre-trial issues, and then we actually start with the opening statements on the 9th, and start with -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You think that you may a need a full week delay between the pre-trial conference and the start?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no idea.  It depends on what comes up at the pre-trial conference.  And I am simply thinking ahead.  The purpose of the pre-trial conference is to prepare ourselves to actually start the trial, and if there are issues that the Defence raises during the pre-trial conference, it may take a few days to address them.  So I have no idea.  I'm assuming everything is ready.  We are prepared to start the trial.  We are not trying to slow things down.  But as a practical matter, a pre-trial conference would be valuable only because it gives the Court and the parties an opportunity to address issues that need to be addressed before we actually start the trial.  It's at the Court's discretion.  I mean, if we have to have a pre -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we are trying to be practical as well because we want to make certain that our schedule works. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's why I suggested, and looking at the calendar, the 9th is a Thursday, I believe, so if we dispense with the opening statements on the Thursday, then we can start taking testimony on Monday, the 13th, which would be a practical way of proceeding with WVSS in terms of bringing witnesses back and forth, and witness prep and so on and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me.  The 9th of this month?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Aren't we talking about June?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
June.  That's right.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if we have a pre-trial conference on Thursday, the 2nd, for example, then that would give us a full week to address any issues.  I don't know what issues would come up.  It's possible that there would be no issues at all to address, but if there are things to be addressed, it makes sense to allocate time for that purpose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
May I ask Mr. O'Shea a question.  Mr. O'Shea, why the 9th?  Why a Thursday?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Because I can see that the Court is squeezing days into the picture, and I've just calculated 12 weeks from Mr. Hooper's surgery. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's the 9th. 
MR. O'SHEA:
That's the 9th of June. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that's the case, right, why can't we have the pre-trial conference on the 6th or the 3rd, on the Monday of that week?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I agree with Mr. Webster.  It would be senseless to have the trial on the next day, but I think we can work with three days. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why not Friday, the 3rd, then?  Would Friday, the 3rd, be better?  
MR. O'SHEA:
I would prefer the 6th simply to increase the chances of my lead counsel being here.  I appreciate that I can do it myself, but it would be better. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, thank you very much.  

Mr. Prosecutor, if we were to look at starting Rwamakuba, have their pre-trial conference for the 6th of June, it would seem useful that the pre-trial -- the pre-trial brief, the witness lists, and other preliminary documents would be filed in advance of that date, in advance of the 6th of June.  The date that we are thinking of is the 23rd of May.  I don't know.  I'm asking you, first of all, would you be able to comply with requirements to file all the pre-trial documentation by that date?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That would not be a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, would that give you sufficient time to start the trial?  Would the 23rd be an appropriate date for the filing?
MR. O'SHEA:
For some of the filing.  There are two matters that concern me in relation to that date in filing.  The first is with regard to the witness list.  I think we've reached informal agreement between the parties that the current witness list should be the final witness list.  Helping the Prosecution to finalise the witness list earlier helps us to avoid the need for further investigations. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What date do you suggest?  
MR. O'SHEA:
I would suggest in the next week, for the witness list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness list. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes, for the witness list.  And for my part, I don't see any reason why not. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I agree.  Thank you.  Mr. Webster, is there any reason why witnesses can't be filed within the next week?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, that will also not be a problem.  I think it's an item we discussed informally, so I assume that this conversation is simply to formalise that agreement. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, there is a second matter in relation to that, the issue of filing, which is the issue of the expert.  Now, we're all on the same page that we want this trial to run smoothly without any delays whatsoever.  And it really would assist us to have a very, very clear position on the expert as soon as possible.  And again, may I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As soon as possible means before the 23rd of May?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  I was more generous in my proposals to the Court and Mr. Webster earlier, but if it were possible within the logistics of the Prosecution, I would suggest that mid-April would be better from the point of view for making things run smoothly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mid-April for what?  
MR. O'SHEA:
For the expert report.  That would enable us to look at those documents and consider what expert testimony, if any, we need to counter it and enable us to prepare in time for cross-examination, because the experts in this Tribunal tend to span quite a wide range of issues, much wider than we're used to in national courts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I've confirmed with Dr. Alison Des Forges.  She will be available to serve as our expert in this case.  I think April is a date that's a bit too soon for her to complete the report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Doesn't she have her report more or less ready?  She has been the most used expert of the Tribunal. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I was going to continue along that line.  And I would use those facts to inquire of the Defence why an addendum to the reports that she's previously filed needs to be available by April in order for them to prepare for her testimony.  She testified in Akayesu; she testified in Butare; she testified in Cyangugu.  I believe she testified in the Bagosora case.  She filed reports in all of those cases.  Those reports have been filed with the Defence as well as her previous testimonies.  There's nothing that she's going to say in the report she prepares for this case that should take the Defence by surprise.  It's simply to narrow her analysis to the facts of Butare hospital or Butare and Gikomero.  And, in fact, what she will do is probably rely on her previous reports to generate something for this trial.  She's a very busy person; she's constantly on the run.  I would prefer to give her the time that she -- an appropriate length of time to do that.  But nothing she says in her report for this case should take the Defence or anybody by surprise.  My suggestion is that she file that report by the date of the pre-trial conference, on the 6th of June, which would be before the opening statement and would give the Defence an opportunity to have the whole case in front of them before we start the trial.  But I rely on the Court's discretion.  
MR. O'SHEA:
With respect, Your Honour, that would be far too late.  Surprise is a relative concept.  
Ms. Alison Des Forges has produced masses of material, and we, although we've been involved in this case for a long time, we cannot possibly hope to get to the level of Ms. Alison Des Forges in terms of all the reports she's filed before this Court.  

In order for us not to be surprised, in the fair sense, we really need to know what documentation the Prosecution will be relying upon.  The issues of Butare and Gikomero have not been extensively canvassed in her previous work.  So in relation to that, we really need to have proper advance notice of any documentation in relation to those areas of the Rwandan conflict.  

And in order to be able to properly examine this -- cross-examine this witness, we may need to consult our own experts.  And it's just not reasonable in the time frame of this case to expect us to go through all her previous reports.  If the Prosecution is going to rely on her report, and if it's a report that's already been disclosed, they can simply identify it.  "It's her report of such-and-such a date that we are going to rely upon and use during the course of the evidence."  And that would be sufficient for us.  We can get that report.  And any new stuff that she's going to come out with on Gikomero and Butare, we really, really need to see well before the trial, in my submission, if we're to avoid any possible delays.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we think you could make a more meaningful proposal than the 6th of June, in the sense that I would imagine that -- you mentioned earlier that the bis report you are going to rely on was the Akayesu testimony and the Akayesu report.  But I think we understand that the -- it's likely that there'll be completely new material relating to Butare, which was not previously disclosed in the reports.  

Now, I don't think it would be reasonable for that new material to be disclosed as late as the pre-trial conference.  It should be before that. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Let me clarify.  Alison Des Forges testified in the Butare trial.  She submitted a report for the Butare trial.  That report is already available.  It was disclosed to the Defence previously.  She testified in the Akayesu trial.  Her testimony in Akayesu is much broader than her testimony in the subsequent -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But which -- have you decided which report is going to be your bis report for this trial?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We would ask her to produce an addendum to -- I don't believe she submitted a report in Akayesu.  She testified extensively in Akayesu.  There were reports that were submitted in the subsequent trials.  We would rely on the Butare report and her testimony in Akayesu.  

And to come back to the Court's question.  Perhaps the 23rd of May, when the pre-trial brief is due, would be an appropriate date to commit to providing her document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Again, Your Honour, I do submit that we need more time than that.  And also it's absolutely essential that if we are dealing with previous reports, that they be identified.  It's not adequate to say "we will rely on previous reports and there will be an addendum."  We need to know exactly which documents are going to be relied on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he said that.  He said he's relying on the Butare report and the testimony in Akayesu.  And he's going to ask her for an addendum. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Okay.  Well, can we have it on record that those are the only two previous reports which will be relied upon, and can we have the dates of those reports?
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you have that, will the 23rd be a satisfactory date for the addendum to be served?
MR. O'SHEA:
 My submission, Your Honour, I would still ask for an earlier date.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What date would you ask for?
MR. O'SHEA:
I would ask for the end of April as a compromise.  Let me put it in this way.  This case is about Butare and Gikomero, and chances are this addendum will be -- I say chances are -- I don't know, but chances are it will be the most crucial aspect of her evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My suggestion is that the Court simply set a date and by that date we will provide the report, we'll identify the report, we'll hand in the addendum.  I don't want to make any undertaking at this time.  Everything will be done in relation to the date that the Court gives us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Are there any other issues that we need to --  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, on deadlines.  Now, I can assure Mr. Webster that I am not in any way trying to be difficult.  I know that the Prosecution has sent a CD with a reel of witness statements which they are helpfully trying to produce as a bundle which we can work on during the course of this trial.  However, I would like to respectfully ask Mr. Webster to have another go.  The reason is this: that document is a PDF document, which Your Honour may be aware, it's very, very difficult to work with a PDF document.  Ms. Fall mentioned in the last hearing that we should reconstruct ourselves the bundle if we wanted to, but you can't do it with a PDF document that consists of witness statements end to end.  If it's going to be in electronic form, I would suggest that there be separate files for each witness, otherwise, it is difficult to work with the document, and that it be TIFF form or Word form.  And moreover, I would request that that bundle also include copies of the exhibits that the Prosecution intend to rely on.  That way, because we are dealing with a fast and furious trial here, that way, the Judges, the Prosecution, the Defence all have one bundle that they can refer to which is paginated and indexed.  

I should add, with regard to the index, although it's been said it's been sent to us, we don't have it.  So perhaps the Prosecution can simply send that again, if Your Honours aren't against me on this.  But it's not that I am trying to be difficult.  I'm just trying to ensure that we're all working off the same page, that we all have the documents in an order which enables us to go forward expeditiously, and would suggest that the Court -- and I don't mind terribly what the deadline is, but the Court set a deadline for resubmitting a document which can usefully form a bundle. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought that the parties had already reached a level of cooperation on this issue, that an order was not required.  

What's the problem, Mr. Webster?
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll request that my colleague pick up from this point, Your Honour.  

My understanding from our informal meeting in December was that we would provide an electronic text that was paginated.  The pagination would be tailored to each witness, so it would not run from 1 to 500.  It would be Witness GIN1, Witness GIN2, so on and so forth.  So it can be shuffled afterwards, so that when we provide this electronic text, the Defence would then print it out and organise it in a manner that was convenient for them, and then when the witnesses testified here, we wouldn't need to bring in two or three binders of materials.  You would simply bring the materials tailored to the witness that is testifying. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that's Mr. O'Shea's complaint.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea's complaint is that the format it is presented in makes it difficult for them to work with it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I would disagree, because our obligation was simply to provide the system of pagination, which is indicated in the electronic text that we provided.  So they can print out the statements and organise them the way they would prefer, or they can take the statements they already have and use the pagination that is indicated on the electronic text to renumber the pages.  That's what we agreed.  I believe the notes or the minutes of that meeting reflect that, and I see no problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, we don't understand what is the problem or why there is a problem which needs our intervention.  From what we understand of the situation, the problem is sufficiently minor for it not to warrant our intervention.  You can manage it.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I agree.  Well, I agree in the sense that I can't understand, for my part, why the Prosecution is not willing to go that little bit further for me.  It's not difficult.  If it was in a TIFF format, it would be much easier to work from. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can they transform what has been done into a TIFF format now?  
MR. O'SHEA:
 Well, it would have started as a Word format.  It wouldn't have started as a PDF format.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I know.  But what's been done now, can it be transformed into a TIFF format?  My first question was if they can do it, why can't you?  
MR. O'SHEA:
You can't transfer from PDF to anything else.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The entire job has to be done over again.  
MR. O'SHEA:
It's not a difficult job, Your Honour, I would have thought.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time does it take?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, they presumably have on their computers the original format in which they put it all together, and then they would have converted it into a PDF document, unless they deleted that other document.

But let's put the technical matter aside.  If I may, Your Honour, there is the other issue, which is the issue of the exhibits.  Now, I know that technically I may not be entitled to demand copies of all the exhibits, necessarily, but, again, you know, this is going to be a short -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Didn't the Prosecutor agree to give the exhibits?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, every time I ask the question, I never get an answer.  It don't think it's deliberate, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I understood that you had agreed to do that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I see no disagreement.  As a matter of fact, they already have copies of the exhibits, because everything was placed on CD-ROMs and disclosed to all four accused when it was one joint case.  Now that the case has been split, we will simply make a shorter list of the exhibits that pertain to Rwamakuba by himself.  We can put those on a separate CD-ROM.  But as a practical matter, they already have copies of everything that will be used as an exhibit.  We have nothing else to disclose.  It's simply a question of the form.  There's no problem in establishing the exhibit list, which is part of the pre-trial brief, which would be filed on the 23rd of May, as we agreed, and at the same time provide a CD-ROM with the separate exhibits that pertain only to Rwamakuba.  But as a disclosure matter, the Defence already has copies of the exhibits.  

Getting back to the issue of the bundle of witness statements, to me, we're having a ridiculous conversation.  Everything has been --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  But they have a problem. 
MR. WEBSTER:
They can print out every document and organise it however they want to.  We're not opposed to anything in principle.  It's a matter of practicality.  We started out this discussion back in November of 2004.  At that time, my submission was that the bundles were not even helpful to the process because we're dealing with witness statements witness by witness.  We don't need three binders in order to move forward.  We conceded to Mr. Hooper's request at that time.  We did everything that we undertook to do.  That stuff was all sent to the Defence in the form that we agreed to provide it.  So to come back now months later and readdress the same issue seems -- it's a waste of time and it's aggravating.  We have done everything that the Defence has asked us to do in relation to these bundles.  The bundles are a waste of time.  That was my position to begin with.  I went along with the Defence because the Court encouraged us to do so.  That's the way Mr. Hooper likes to organise his case.  He can take the same witness statements and scan them and put them on a computer disk and do anything he wants with them.  Everything that we should disclose has been disclosed.  If they have a particular form in which they want to organise their materials in order to deal with cross-examination, they should do that.  Why should that burden be passed back to the Prosecutor?  We would like to be reasonable.  If the Court thinks that we're taking an unreasonable stand, simply give us an order and we'll comply with the Court's order. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. O'Shea, we don't think we should make an order about the form of the presentation of the matters here. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're willing to make an order to just confirm counsel's undertaking with the delivery of the exhibits on the CD-ROM. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  And if I could just request that that undertaking be clarified that it will be in a paginated index form as well.  This is not to only help us, Your Honour.  This is to help the whole process, the Judges as well.  I mean, if -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you are saying is that there is -- what is a paginated index for?  You see, now, they are saying that they have done that.  You are saying what they have done is not a paginated index form.  Why should they use the same language to create another dispute?  
MR. O'SHEA:
They're not willing to go along with -- or understand my technical problems with regard to what they've done with the witness statements.  What I am saying now is, do what you've done with the witness statements with the exhibits as well, and then we'll do what we can.  But, really, at the moment, we're not getting anywhere.  I'm not trying to waste the Court's time, Your Honour.  We have experience of these proceedings and of the Prosecutor producing documents after the other and of the various parties and the Judges trying to get on the same page, trying to use the same numbers.  We know how time can be wasted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I understand -- 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
-- is that you have got the witness statements in a bundle form.  You have got them in a format which, with a little bit more work, you can organise them exactly how you want them to?
MR. O'SHEA:
No, but I won't press the point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that's -- that's my understanding.  Now, the Prosecutor has undertaken to disclose the exhibit list and put the exhibits on a CD-ROM and deliver it on or before the 23rd of May.  That's what I understand.  And we are just going to crystallise that in form. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that seems to cover the issues that you have. 
MR. O'SHEA:
On this matter, yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any others?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, yes, there are a few others.  There's some more logistical, practical matters that I would like to address.  Firstly, this, of course, is the first time that this Tribunal has been faced with a retrial scenario.  So we're going to be coming across novel problems.  And one of those novel problems which concern us is the question in relation to whether the Prosecution can discuss the evidence with Prosecution witnesses who were examined in chief and cross-examined during the previous proceedings.  

Your Honour will be aware that, in accordance with Rule 89(C), the Chamber may admit -- sorry, not 89(C).  89(B).  "In cases not otherwise provided for in this section, the Chamber may apply rules of evidence which best favour fair determination of the matter before it and are consonant with the spirit of the statute in the general principles of law."  In my submission, with this particular novel problem, a fair rule would be that the Prosecution should not be permitted to coach those witnesses who have already been cross-examined in the previous trial.  In my submission, there is essentially no distinction for these purposes between the situation where a witness has started to give evidence and is in the middle of their cross-examination and a situation where you have a trial, the witness is cross-examined, and then re-examined and cross-examined in the new trial.  In both cases, if the form of coaching that happens in this arena were to take place with those witnesses who have already given evidence, that may cause us prejudice because it may place the witness in an unfair position, having already been cross-examined by us.  So that is my submission, that this Court should make an order that in relation to witnesses, Prosecution witnesses, who have already been cross-examined in the previous proceedings, that to avoid any possible prejudice that might arise out of it, that the Prosecution not discuss the evidence with those witnesses.  

They are going to be testifying to the same issues.  It's a difficult point, Your Honour, and it may be that Your Honours would prefer not to make an order today.  I am quite happy for Your Honours to hear submissions from the Prosecution and perhaps come out with a written order, at a much later stage, but it's a -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much later?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, whatever time is needed for Your Honours to consider the issues, because I appreciate that it's a novel issue.  But it would be helpful to have an interim decision until such time that Your Honours have determined what is fair, and that in the meantime the Prosecution not coach their witnesses who have already been cross-examined.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would the Prosecutor have any immediate response to that?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel's microphone, please.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I will leave this matter up to the Chamber and let the Chamber decide on what Mr. O'Shea has said.  I do not know where in the Rules or in the Statute the Prosecutor is not allowed to conduct its own prosecution as it wishes.  We're in a new trial.  We have witnesses, and a list of witnesses that we have disclosed.  We have to deal with them as Prosecution witnesses, and the Statute gives us the opportunity to prepare our witnesses, and, if we wish to respect the Rules and the Statute, we should proceed as we wish.  

This is not the first time in this Tribunal that we have dealt with trials that have to recommence.  Take the example of Kajelijeli, Kamuhanda, and in those both of those trials the witnesses were heard and called back to the box and heard again by the Prosecution.  I think that that request is unreasonable from Mr. O'Shea, and excuse me for that term, but I should ask that the Chamber evaluate this issue on its own.  I've never seen this type of request before, and I don't see why the Prosecutor in a new trial would not be able to speak again with previous witnesses, Mr. President.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, the legal basis, so I can just be very clear about that, as I've already indicated, is Rule 89.  This is a situation which is not provided for in the Rules, and therefore it is for Your Honours to decide what would be fair.  Of course, the proceedings before these tribunals are somewhat different from the proceedings before my own jurisdiction.  And I am not trying to sway the Tribunal to adopt what happens in my own jurisdiction, but in these proceedings before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, it is the general practice that once the witness has started to give evidence and is in the middle of cross-examination, that the Prosecutor no longer have the opportunity to coach that witness.  

What I am suggesting to the Court is that there is essentially no distinction here.  If there have been cases before where the Tribunal has been faced, not with the retrial, but where there has been a similar issue of witnesses giving evidence again, there may or may not be distinctions with this scenario.  But the important point to remember is that the point I am raising may never have been raised before.  But that's not a reason to not consider the validity of it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, we don't quite at this stage see that the position is similar between somebody whose cross-examination is underway and somebody who starts the evidence afresh.  So as presently advised, we're not disposed to make the order you request.  
MR. O'SHEA:
May I just seek this clarification from the Court.  As I understand it, you are saying that you do not wish to make any order on that issue at this stage or -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No.  No, we're saying we don't agree with you. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Right.  So you are ruling on it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're ruling on it.  This is not to stop you from making the application again.  But the point is that, as you have presented your application, no, you have not persuaded us. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And so we're ruling against you. 
MR. O'SHEA:
So if I were to put in a motion later, Your Honours would not consider it as res judicata.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can't prejudge what we will do at a later stage.  But the point is -- I'm not making an order -- you can -- I can't say what we would say then, but the point is, as presently advised, as you have presented your argument, no, you have not persuaded us.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Very well.  The other practical issue, Your Honour, concerning the fact that this is a retrial is that a lot of -- some of these witnesses have already given evidence and there are obviously transcripts of their evidence, and I don't say this to gain any advantage in the trial or anything like that.  Again, what I am trying to do here is to save Court time.  It's seems to me, if I may submit, that understand Rule 89(C), which enables the Chamber to admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value, that the Chamber does have the power in the appropriate circumstances, if it is going to facilitate the course of the trial, to admit evidence in advance of the trial.  

Now, the reason why I refer to that is, I say that if Your Honours were to admit the transcripts of the testimony of Prosecution witnesses who have already given evidence wholesale, prior to the trial, and allow the parties and everybody to have it in electronic form, it would save us an enormous amount of time when it comes to the giving of evidence of these witnesses.  It is clear that those transcripts are going to be referred to again and again, at least by us, and perhaps by the Prosecution.  And in those circumstances, it would be a practical measure to do something of that nature.  The evidence will remain on the same issues, the witnesses are giving evidence on the same issues that they gave before.  So I don't think there's any difficulty of probative value here.  So that would be my application in relation to that.  Does Your Honour follow me?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I am just wondering whether -- what else I was thinking was a preliminary thought, was whether that would have been appropriate for you to make a motion on.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I can do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, it's not really appropriate for us to address that issue now.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I can deal with it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One of the reasons is a question of time, and I think it does require some consideration.  An immediate problem I have with what you have said is that you ask for a wholesale admission.  And it seemed -- that by itself, seemed to warrant a narrowing down somewhat, and there should be some relation to utility.  One doesn't just want to just put material on the record that is not useful. 
MR. O'SHEA:
There is, of course, also the alternative of simply marking the materials for identification. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but I think it requires some examination.  We don't have the time to discuss that this morning. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I agree.  I agree.  I'm sorry.  Your Honour, just three more things that I conveyed to the Prosecution, for the record.  We have received six new CDs.  It may be that they were disclosed by the Prosecution some weeks ago.  They have come to the attention of us recently, and they involve some 15,000 pages, 10,000 to 15,000 pages.  I just wonder whether the Prosecution can provide us some sort of indexing for that material so that we can work with it.  I mean, the Prosecution can just say yes or no.  I don't want to belabour the Court's time.  

The other matter is that there is a new witness, a completely new witness called AWZ.  I called Mr. Hooper's chambers recently and discovered that we had, in fact, received witness statements in hardcopy format.  I would be grateful if the Prosecution could e-mail me the electronic form.  And they -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Why do you need to use me to convey messages of that nature to the Prosecutor?  It seems to me such a simple matter of communication between the two parties. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  I'll tell you why, Your Honour, because I need to have it on the record.  That's why.  I'm not suggesting that Mr. --
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you could have had an agreement and I could have made an order.  This is something which could have been done before you came into court.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, what sometimes happens is that requests are made and then they get forgotten about.  And the advantage of having them on the record is that it ensures that they are not forgotten about.  I'm afraid to say, Your Honour, that simply asking for things informally has not worked in the past, in my experience.  But anyway, I take Your Honour's point, and I won't belabour it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
These matters are so straightforward.  Why do I need to be involved in resolving them?  

Ms. Fall, is there any problem with these issues? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, as I said, there are no major disputes, and it would be more desirable for the parties to agree more on these issues, to resolve these types of issues.  

As regards the CDs that have been sent containing 10,000 to 15,000 pages, these were disclosures made before the severance, and these documents can be discussed with Mr. O'Shea, and we can explain the situation.  And I don't believe that those CDs will figure into the Rwamakuba case.  And so, as you said, I think that is important.  Without prejudice to the Defence -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I make a suggestion?  We are running out of time here.  Isn't that a matter that if you need to have the Court staff involved, that our trial coordinator would be an appropriate person to assist in completing this discussion on this issue?  So you can follow it up with Ms. Denis and resolve it in that way.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would like to bring this session to an end.  Is there anything else that's necessary to be discussed before doing so?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, no.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

There's just one issue.  In the -- what the suggestion is is the -- normally in the pre-trial conference the Court has the -- would have an opportunity to order the filing of admissions and contested matters and that sort of thing.  I am wondering whether it would be appropriate in our scheduling order now to direct that those matters be addressed one week after the 23rd of May, the filing of the pre-trial brief.  The parties would then submit a document listing the issues which were admitted and the matters which were contested issues.  Would that be appropriate?
MR. O'SHEA:
I need to be frank with the Chamber in that dealing with admissions with Dr. Rwamakuba has not been easy in the past.  We've not got to the point where we have been able to persuade our client.  Our client needs to cooperate with the Prosecution on uncontested matters.  That's a practical issue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if that's the position, that's -- if there are no admissions, there are no admissions. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But even the filing of that document would advance us in identifying what are the issues that need to be examined in the trial, because we would not want to allow investigation in the matters which aren't necessary, not to exclude investigation into the matters which are necessary.  So you would assist in narrowing the issues for trial or identifying the issues for the trial. 

MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  And the other difficulty, of course, is with regard to speaking to the client in the sense that Mr. Hooper won't be here for a while, and I don't know what my position is going to be, but that's another practical issue with regard to admissions.  But I take Your Honour's point that Your Honour could set a deadline, we could come forward with nothing, and the matter could be resurrected later if necessary.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because the time frame that we are suggesting is nearly two months. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So there would be adequate time to address these issues. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  Very well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster?  Ms. Fall?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we have no particular issues to address at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm bringing this status conference to a close.  I think I should note an express appreciation to the parties for the working sessions that were held during the course of this week.  I think it would be fair to say that the discussions between the parties were fruitful, and I think that the main issues that were raised do not seem to be contentious anymore.  

We have received proposed scheduling of the trials, and I think that I am -- what we would like to do is to just organise in a more formal way the discussions that we had this morning with regard to the scheduling.  Basically, this will take into account the steps for the dates, the deadlines, for the filing of the preliminary documents leading to a pre-trial conference on the 6th of June.  And we would also, I think, include that in our view on the windows -- the proposed dates for the December session as well. 

We thought that it would be useful to make some directives for the proceedings, and basically, we would require that where it is necessary to file motions, that they are brief and well structured.  On the translation issues, we think that's a crucial matter for the proper administration of the case, and we expect that there's a common sense used and use the tools available at the Tribunal to reduce the possible impact of this issue on the pace of the trial.  Of course, this requires, I think, cooperation between the parties, and I think that perhaps, in this particular case, where we know that the counsel for the Defence is an Anglophone defence team, that it might be useful for the Prosecutor to file in English, as that will take away the need for counsel translations and reduce the possibility of delay.  So we will require that your best efforts be used in that direction.  

We would like to recall that official communications for the attention of the Trial Chamber must be filed through the Court Management Section and not through the trial coordinator, and the Chamber would request that the parties file electronic version of the documents, where existing, along with hard copies of that file.

I will now give an oral decision.  This is an oral decision on Rwamakuba's motion requesting that the Trial Chamber exercise its good offices with the Registry, and requests, or orders, the Registry to indicate the result of the Registry's efforts concerning the obtaining of Rwandan court dossiers.  Now, as was pointed out during our working sessions, the Defence has received a copy of the letter from the Rwandan special representative about that motion.  In that letter, it is noted that the concerned authorities in Kigali are set to facilitate the obtaining of the requested documents.  That was contained in a letter dated the 9th of March 2005 from a special representative of the Rwandan government to the Tribunal, which was copied to the Defence.  In addition, the special representative declares himself to be ready to assist the Defence in obtaining the requested documents if his assistance is necessary.  We conclude that there's no longer a pending issue on this matter and the motion is denied as being moot.  

Now, we also would like to make an order on the time limits to file replies under Rule 73(E).  Except where it is otherwise decided by the Chamber, any responding party to a motion is instructed to file any reply no later than five days.  The replying party to the said reply shall file any reply no later than five days.  

We had intended to make a scheduling order, an oral order, given this morning, but due to the developments, I think it might be better to just spend some time having them accurately recorded.  So the scheduling order will be delivered later today in accordance with the arrangements that have been made at our discussions here.  So I think this brings to a close the status conference on the Rwamakuba matter.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. FALL:
Allow me to address two small issues before we adjourn.  I simply wanted to inform the Chamber that, to date, we sent a memo to the parties regarding Rwamakuba for the supporting materials of the indictment of 23 February 2005.  This should enable the Defence to conduct its preliminary investigations, and we wanted to make the Chamber aware of that news.  That was the issue that I wanted to raise for the attention of the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Fall.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm grateful.  Am I to understand from what Ms. Fall is saying is that I will receive that today?  Is that what she is saying?  
MS. FALL:
That is correct, yes.  The second issue that I have just remembered, and this is in the interests of justice and balance between the parties.  May we request the Defence to give us an idea, approximately, of the number of witnesses they intend to call?  This would also enable us to anticipate the investigations we need to conduct.  If the Defence can, as quickly as possible, provide us a list of the approximate number of witnesses they intend to call, this would greatly assist us.  Thank you.  
MR. O'SHEA:
When we've completed our investigations, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's too early for us to make an order in this direction, but we'll monitor the situation.  
MR. O'SHEA:
I am not making a commitment, Your Honour.  I am just --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I accept.  But it is too early for us to make an order.  But we'll expect you to do it within a reasonable time frame.  

Well, we need to close our session now.  I don't know if you need to leave the courtroom or if you can call the Karemera case immediately.  
(Court adjourned at 1138H)
