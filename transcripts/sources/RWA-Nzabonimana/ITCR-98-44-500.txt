MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. KIYEYEU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 16th of September 2010, for the continuation of the Defence case in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Édouard Karemera and Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you, My Lords.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues this morning.  And you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began.  

Mr. Webster will continue with your cross-examination.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to the Court and to the parties. 
EMMANUEL HABYARIMANA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And to you, Mr. Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	When we left off yesterday, we were talking about Marcel Gatsinzi.  And I'd made the suggestion to you that some members of the FAR command independently issued a communiqué on the 12th of April proposing a ceasefire with the RPF.  Wouldn't you agree that there is some similarity between that communiqué of the 12th of April and the Kigeme declaration that you signed in July?  

And to facilitate matters, let me hand up a copy to you.  This is D. NZ734.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We have it in evidence in English.  The French original was never admitted.  So I'd like to give a copy to the registrar and a copy to the two Defence teams in French.  This copy, highlighted, can go to the witness.  

And I'd ask the Court to admit the French as D. NZ734 as well.  

Mr. Issa, I was suggesting that you give the French to the two Defence teams.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So back to you, Mr. Witness.  Again, my suggestion to you is that there's a certain parallelism between this communiqué on the 12th of April and the one that you signed in July in Kigeme.  

Is this the first time that you're seeing this communiqué, Mr. Witness?  It's only four short paragraphs.  
A.	Mr. President, once again, thank you for giving me the floor.  I heard mention of this document, but this is the first time that I am seeing a physical or a hard copy.  
Q.	Have you finished reading it? 
A.	Mr. President, yes, I have.  
Q.	So could you respond to my suggestion, please.  
A.	Mr. President, similarity -- well, as far as the page before me goes, yes, indeed.  
Q.	Here -- well, the similarity that I would suggest to you is that the 12th of April communiqué was one that was issued without going through the interim government.  In other words, these commanders took it upon themselves to issue a communiqué, which is what you did in the Kigeme declaration; right? 
A.	Yes, Mr. President.  As I read through the communiqué, I see at the end, on behalf of the 
high command of the Rwandan armed forces, the following officers participated at the meeting and they signed accordingly.  So I think this was a working group that had been set up by the general staff of the armed forces to review the situation and make proposals as to how to deal with the tragic situation in the country.  
Q.	Well, that's not what I'm suggesting to you, Mr. Witness.  What I've suggested is that some members of the FAR, the ones that signed this document, took it upon themselves to issue a communiqué on the 12th of April.  And some members of the FAR, including yourself, took it upon themselves to issue a communiqué on the 6th of July.  That much we can agree on; right? 
A.	Mr. President, yes.  There -- there are some similarities in what is written in the document.  That is a matter of fact.  But the document was signed on behalf of the high command of the 
Rwandan armed forced; whereas, the document signed in Kigeme was signed by us engaging our own personal responsibility -- that is, those of us who were signatories, and that is the distinction between those two, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And your testimony was that your Kigeme declaration was not well received by the interim government and that you were -- the signatories were dismissed.  And my suggestion to you is that this 
declaration -- or this communiqué of the 12th of April similarly was not well received by the 
interim government.  
A.	Mr. President, the Prosecutor has made a suggestion, but I was not a signatory to that document.  
At that time I was not there.  So I have nothing to say about it.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  That's an appropriate answer.  In any case, we learn from Gatsinzi's statement -- from 1995, in any case, that he attempted to meet with the RPF following this communiqué of the 12th of April.  Initially, the interim government was not sympathetic to that proposal, but Ndindiliyimana convinced them and he was finally able to meet on behalf of the FAR with the RPF on the 15th of April.  
And my suggestion to you is that Gatsinzi was removed as acting army chief of staff the very next day.  

Don't you think that that would have been -- his removal would have frustrated attempts to negotiate 
a ceasefire? 
A.	Mr. President, yesterday we talked about the -- is it dismissal or resignation?  That -- that term needs to be clarified.  Gatsinzi was appointed interim chief of staff, and then, subsequently, a proper chief of staff was appointed.  And at that time Gatsinzi returned to his ordinary duties.  And so there was no particular reason to say at that time that Gatsinzi had been dismissed because of the communiqué of the 12th.  That doesn't seem to be a proper analysis to my mind.  

You see, about ten officers -- about ten of them had worked up until the end of July with -- or in the armed forces.  So if there was talk of dismissal of the signatories, then all the signatories should or would have been dismissed.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, my suggestion to you was that he was removed, not that he was dismissed from the FAR.  So if you use -- if we adapt the more neutral terminology -- he was removed and he was replaced by Augustin Bizimungu; right? 
A.	Mr. President, now the Prosecutor is suggesting that we use terminology that is acceptable.  So what I would propose is that, he ceased to hold that ad interim office and went back to his normal duties -- in place of the word "removal", which is difficult to interpret in French, by the way, Mr. President. 
Q.	Gatsinzi was replaced by Augustin Bizimungu by the interim government on the 16th of April 1994; right? 
A.	Mr. President, I would not say that he was replaced.  You see, Gatsinzi was ad interim chief of staff, and Bizimungu was appointed full chief of staff.  So can you talk about the replacement in such a case?  I do not know.  It's a matter of interpretation, and I believe that the Prosecutor's interpretation to -- to that fact appears not to reflect the reality in military terms, because one can only be replaced if there is a position that has been replaced at the same level with the same level of commitment.  
Q.	Can we agree that Marcel Gatsinzi had the reputation of being a moderate, politically speaking? 
A.	Mr. President, now, moderate is also another term that was invented for reasons that I don't know.  Reference has been made to moderate Hutus and moderate what have you.  I do not know what that exactly means.  

What I can say is that Gatsinzi was an officer who conducted proper geopolitical analyses and came up with proposals as was his duty.  So to use the word "moderate" would appear to me to be an inappropriate choice of terminology.
Q.	Well, did Augustin Bizimungu have the same type of reputation back in 1994; in other words, the same as Gatsinzi?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Mr. -- Mr. Bizimungu, unfortunately, and luckily for me, is somebody whom I knew very well.  We come from the same area.  We attended the same school, in primary and secondary school, and we entered the same profession -- similar careers.  

I knew what he did within the army and how he worked within the army.  And I am in a good position, personally, to assert that he was a good and exemplary officer in spite of the mishaps and the tragedies that befell our country and the circumstances in which he was appointed chief of staff.  

Just like Gatsinzi, these were good and exemplary officers who sought to find solutions to propose to the administrative and political officials of the state with a view to solving Rwanda's tragedy.  
Q.	Well, going back to your explanation yesterday, Mr. Witness, when we went through the Kigeme declaration at great length, you explained to the Chamber that your group at Kigeme was criticising extremists on both sides:  On the government side and on the RPF side.  Who did you have in mind on the government side when you were criticising those extremists? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I attempted to explain this and to present the facts yesterday and maybe the day before.  On the government side the reference to extremists had a double connotation.  I explained the composition of the Presidential Guard at the time.  And then I stated that these were persons who came from the same village as the late President Habyarimana, who had been murdered.  
Some of them felt that, because of their positions at the Republican Guard battalion, that the government having been based in the Bushiru area, that is, President Habyarimana's area -- Bushiru is spelt B-U or B-I -- 
Q.	Before we go much further in your answer, I'm really at this point trying to elicit specific names from you.  And if we go back to the Kigeme declaration, there is a line here where you say, "Considering that all of the Rwandese tragedy stems from the bloody selfishness of small extremist groups avid for power" -- I think in the French you used the word "groupuscules".  

So in these small extremist groups on the government side, who did you have in mind? 
A.	Mr. President, I was answering the question actually, and if we use the term small groups, it is because we deemed it more appropriate to talk about a group rather than individuals.  We could have done so at that time, because it is the concept of a group that had more relevance and meaning at the time of the signing of the Kigeme declaration. 

So this small group was a -- a handful of soldiers and civilians from the Bushiru -- Bushiru -- 
Bushiru area.  And I spell Bushiru:  B-I-S-H-U-R-U (sic).  

These people felt that at all times they should have been at the epicentre of the government and to have continued to have benefited from it.  That handful of persons -- that small group of persons may have been up to 100 or 200 persons.  So I don't know whether I can provide a list of that many people.  
Q.	Well, I wasn't asking you for a list of 100 people.  I was asking you to mention names among the leadership of this group.  We could begin with Bagosora.  Doesn't he fit into that category coming from the north among the Bushiru? 
A.	Well, I talked about officers -- soldiers of the Republican Guard.  I do not know whether Bagosora was of the Republican Guard, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	So is it your evidence today that you weren't talking about anyone in leadership positions in the army -- or in the government when you said that there was small extremist groups avid for power whose 
bloody selfishness led to the Rwandan tragedy?  
A.	Mr. President, I have said that this was a small group from Bushiru.  There is a history to this and a background, namely, what has been referred to as the Akazu.  You see, back then, rather than base divisions on ethnicity, people were divided along regional lines.  And, as I explained, before Habyarimana took power in Rwanda, the general understanding was that power lay in the hands of a small group from the south.  Now, when Habyarimana took power, the general opinion in Rwanda was that power had shifted to -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...excuse me for interrupting you, but I think we're getting a bit far removed from my question.  I'm not asking you for a dissertation on Rwandan society.  What I'm suggesting to you is that you seem to have had a specific small group of people in mind when you criticised them in July 1994, and if you can't explain that now, we'll simply move on to something else.  

Can we agree that the negotiations between the RPF and the government were stalled because the RPF refused to negotiate with a band of criminals, which is how they characterised the 
interim government, and the interim government refused to allow the FAR -- or members of the FAR -- to negotiate directly with the RPF after that 15th of April meeting? 
A.	Mr. President, the Prosecutor's description of the facts does not appear to correspond to reality.  In any event, the RPF had signed an agreement with part of the forces.  And when there is a subsequent reference to a band of criminals and a refusal to negotiate, I believe personally that it all amounts to 
bad faith.  
Q.	Well, did you ever learn during the course of events that the RPF proposed to negotiate with patriotic soldiers of the FAR? 
A.	Mr. President, I have just found out about that.  I'm just learning about that.  You see, the RPF was known as the patriotic front and its army was the patriotic army.  So did the RPF want to negotiate with itself, being that patriotic?  I -- I don't know.  Maybe the Prosecutor knows something that I'm not aware of.  
Q.	Well, let's move on, Mr. Witness.  Now, you gave us a very lengthy explanation of why you thought the war and genocide persisted for three months, even though it was clear to you that the war was lost by the 12th of April.  Would it be accurate to summarise some of what you told us yesterday by saying that the government army was unable to stop the mass killings because they were too busy at the front lines fighting the RPF? 
A.	Mr. President, yes.  That is part of the answer.  And that -- and it is correct -- what the Prosecutor says is correct as part of the answer.  
Q.	And you, yourself, were at the front during the period 7 to 12 of April 1994 -- isn't that so -- in Mutara? 
A.	Yes, Mr. President.  I can confirm that.  
Q.	And your troops were the buffer between the RPF in Mulindi -- or in the north and the city of Kigali; right? 
A.	Mr. President, I did not quite understand the question.  I was in the Mutara sector.  Now -- now, you've made reference to Mulindi.  Which Mulindi are you talking about?  There are several Mulindis in Rwanda.  Is it the Mulindi in Byumba at the border?  Is it the Mulindi in Kibungo at the border with Tanzania?  Is it another Mulindi, which I may not be aware of?  

So I'd like the Prosecutor to be more specific as to which Mulindi he is referring to, and that will enable me to answer his question.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	How many -- how many Mulindis were the headquarters of the RPF? 
A.	Now, Mr. President, the headquarters of the RPF was in Mulindi in Byumba.  But in his question the Prosecutor referred to the troops -- 
Q.	Isn't it obvious that I was referring to the Mulindi that is the RPF headquarters? 
A.	To my mind that was not clear, Mr. President.  Counsel talked about Mulindi -- 
Q.	Thank you.  Your troops in the Mutara -- were between the RPF troops to the north and the city of Kigali to the south; right? 
A.	Mr. President, I do not know.  Maybe there is a translation problem.  When you talk of interposing or being between, that means that it was a force that did not belong to the armed forces that came from elsewhere in order to -- in order to intervene.  But our forces had to fight the RPF, and gradually, as I said, through delaying tactics, we went -- we went right to Kigali.  If that is what the Prosecution was referring to, then that is correct.  
Q.	The RPF troops in the north had to pass by your troops in order to get to Kigali; right? 
A.	In this case as well, I do not know whether it is a translation problem.  Going through our troops, I do not know what that means.  We had to beat back our troops in order to go to Kigali.  If that is what counsel means once more, then that is correct.  
Q.	And you explained yesterday that you adopted a strategy of retreat; right? 
A.	Mr. President, I talked about delaying tactics.  Moreover, I remember that the question asked to me was whether delaying tactics meant tactical retreat, and I said delaying tactics are different to military manoeuvres because a retreat is simply leaving without fighting; whereas, a delaying tactic consists of delaying the enemy to gain time and perhaps reorganise yourself.  
Q.	And using your explanation, you delayed them for two days; right?  Your delaying tactics managed to restrain them from arriving near Kigali for 48 hours.  That sounds like a retreat.  You arrived in Kigali on the 12th of April.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Initially, we did not -- or we thought we were going to defend ourselves on the spot, that we'd take defensive positions.  Then we realised that the RPF troops were very strong -- far stronger than our troops.  So we decided to put in place delaying tactics.  We were hoping that we'd gain one or two months or even one year and that thereaft -- but our (sic) forces were far superior to us.  The delaying tactics accelerated until we decided to say, "Well, we'll only have to defend Kigali."  
Q.	Thank you.  Is it also your understanding of the situation that the killings in Kigali were perpetrated by the population who feared the advance of the RPF and were killing at the roadblocks in order to try to rout out infiltrators?  Is that your understanding of the killings that took place in the first part of April? 
A.	Mr. President, that is not what I observed.  What I observed, as I explained earlier, is that after the president's plane was brought down, when the president and the civilian authorities with whom he was, as well as the Burundian authorities were brought down in the president's plane, and followed by the attack against the Presidential Guard by the RPF unit, soldiers of the Republican Guard thought that they had been betrayed -- that they were betrayed first by politicians.  

I explained how politicians -- Hutu politicians were first to be exterminated.  That was the first deadly act.  The assassinations of civilian populations -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, I'm not trying to get you to repeat everything you said.  But with regard to the last portion of this last response, is it your suggestion that government troops were actively involved in the killings of civilians? 
A.	Mr. President, I did not talk of government troops.  Government troops, as I explained, were engaged on four fronts, in fact, particularly on three fronts.  I talked about troops of the Republican Guard who were in the Republican Guard camp -- 
Q.	Thank you -- 
A.	-- near the CND.  
Q.	So your evidence is that government troops were not actively involved in the killing in April? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	If someone were to suggest that a few undisciplined soldiers may have participated in the slaughter, does that comport with your understanding?  Is that what you also would suggest? 
A.	To some extent I will agree with that.  
Q.	Is it also your position that the killings among the civilians in Kigali was a spontaneous and uncontrolled response of Rwandans to the death of the president? 
A.	Mr. President, the assassination of the president, and the outbreak of hostilities that followed the assassination of the president and then the guerrilla warfare in which the RPF engaged escalated the violence, and I believe this is what, unfortunately, triggered the killing of the civilian population, especially in Kigali.  
Q.	So I'm not understanding your response.  Was it a violent reaction -- a violent spontaneous reaction to the -- to the death of the president or not?  I'm simply trying to understand your view, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Mr. President, I do not think one can say that the assassination of the president was the only reason.  You need a more holistic view of the situation that prevailed at that time.  The assassination of the president took place.  Then hostilities resumed.  Then the bombing of camps, as I explained 
yesterday -- the camps of displaced persons in Nyacyonga and so on.  

This escalation of violence provoked violence -- in my opinion, led to these killings that took place, particularly beginning with Kigali.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  In any case, Mr. Witness, what I've been suggesting to you -- the propositions that I've just put to you were actually coming from a report in the Washington Post newspaper on the 28th of April 1994, following a press conference that Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Justin Mugenzi gave in Nairobi.  And that's how they were explaining the events of April 1994.  
MR. WEBSTER:
This is in evidence as P. 277.  There's another exhibit from the French radio -- or a summary of the French RFI reporting on the same press conference, which is P. 276.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And just to be clear to you, Mr. Witness, I only have it in English.  According to Mr. Mugenzi -- he was accompanied by Ngirumpatse, they were both present at the same press conference representing the interim government -- the government army were unable to stop the mass slaughter because they were too busy at the front lines fighting rebel groups; that Kigali citizens feared the -- the Tutsi rebels and launched widespread massacres as a way of assisting the army to rout out guerrilla infiltrators.  And that the best way of stopping those killings was for the RPF to stop their advance, and that government troops were not involved, only a few undisciplined soldiers.  And that the violence, for the most part, was a spontaneous and uncontrolled reaction by Rwandans to the death of the president.  

Now, do you think that that was an accurate way of reporting on the situation in Rwanda on the 28th of April 1994? 
A.	Mr. President, I do not think this is an accurate account, even though that account contains some truth that doesn't faithfully reflect the events of 1994, particularly the events that occurred in April 1994.  
I would like to point out that the media propaganda was also a weapon that was used, especially in Rwanda, since the outbreak of the war of 1st October.  It is in that context that, I, personally, questioned the truthfulness -- the accuracy of the information given out by some media, including inform -- the Washington Post.  
Q.	But if the Washington Post was accurately reporting on the press conference in Nairobi, you would agree that that was not an accurate way of describing the situation in Kigali in April of 1994; right? 
A.	Mr. President, my account is an account of what I saw.  The Washington Post has its own methods of investigation.  The Washington Post also has its own way of understanding things in a certain context.  So what the Washington Post said commits only that press organ.  
Q.	My question to you was, if the Washington Post accurately reported on what Mr. Ngirumpatse and what Mr. Mugenzi said, what they said did not accurately reflect the situation in Kigali in April of 1994?  
A.	Mr. President, I believe I've answered that question.  It partially reflects the reality of what happened.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you made a statement to the Office of the Prosecutor in 1999; right?  I think you went over portions of it with Mr. Weyl.  Did you have an opportunity to read that statement before you signed it, or was it read back to you? 
A.	Mr. President, I had the opportunity of reading the said statement.  I read it in its entirety.  
Q.	And it's your -- is it your testimony that it accurately reflected your views at the time?  You were making an effort to be forthright and truthful when you spoke to the OTP back in October of 1999; right? 
A.	I confirm that.  
Q.	I'd like us to look at that statement for a few minutes.  If you'll give me one second, I'll pass a copy up to you.  This is a copy that you signed, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could give this to the witness, and I do have the French translation.  If you give me 
one second, I will pass it up.  

I apologise for the delay.  

Mr. Issa, when you are coming back, could you bring a set of documents that I'd left with the court interpreter, please, right -- to your right there.  

The statement that I'm referring to is the last set of documents that were stapled together that I distributed yesterday.  And if Mr. Issa could give this to the witness.  This is the French translation.  

BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	When you were interviewed back in 1999, didn't you have at least one specific example of the type of extremist that you held responsible for the genocide of 1994, specifically Callixte Nzabonimana.  Your statement was essentially about him, wasn't it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  When I gave a statement at the time referred to, I was asked to give evidence on Nzabonimana, who had been my minister when I was director of sport in the 
ministry of youth and sports.  
Q.	If you look at where I've circled number 2, as I've numbered the paragraphs in the French text there for you to follow along, you explained back in 1999 that Nzabonimana used the budget of his ministry to finance propaganda for youth -- MRND youth in the commune; right?  Isn't that what you say, if you look at paragraph 2? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  
Q.	You specifically identified him as being a strong member of the MRND political party at paragraph 3, where I've numbered; right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	You identified the Interahamwe as the youth wing of the MRND political party and described their uniforms and said that you saw them with guns and grenades coming to the meetings -- to the office of Callixte Nzabonimana.  When was that?  Was that in 1992, 1993 or 1994 when you saw these Interahamwe with guns and grenades? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  A few Interahamwes whom I saw armed and who arrived -- well, it is necessary that I describe very well the situation.  
Q.	I didn't ask you to describe the situation.  I asked you:  Were you referring to 1992, 1993 or 1994 in relation to that specific information?  
A.	Mr. President, I can say that it was mainly in the course of 1993.  
Q.	Can we assume -- or, isn't it reasonable to assume that anyone with a gun must have received training on how to use it; right? 
A.	That is reasonable.  
Q.	In that same paragraph you talk about these youth -- these Interahamwe youth using government vehicles to attend rallies and demonstrations.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So wouldn't you agree that these Interahamwe, who were receiving propaganda at government expense from Callixte Nzabonimana and who were going to government rallies -- or rallies in government vehicles, were armed? 
A.	Mr. President, I did not quite understand the Prosecutor's question.  If he can kindly repeat, please.  
Q.	Don't these efforts in 1993 appear to you to have contributed to the violence in 1994?  The arming and training of civilians, mobilising them.  
A.	Mr. President, I think what I said at that time with reference to some Interahamwes whom I saw with weapons was correct.  That was a fact.  But to say that that fact could establish a direct link with what happened subsequently seems to me, on the basis of the research I carried out, not to be correct.  
Q.	Well, if you look at paragraph 6, where you say that the Habyarimana government had sensitised the Rwandan Hutu population against the RPF, the sensitisation and the planning of the 1994 genocide had started after 1990 when the MRND government started killing Tutsi.  What did you mean, if not that? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I've just said, and, moreover, as I had said earlier, there was a certain view of the facts at that time.  As I usually say, the events that amounted to the Rwandan tragedy, I described them as the truth hidden behind a mirror, the real facts and the apparent facts.  The facts that you perceive initially with time become different.  They are different from the real facts.  And that is why I am saying that what I said at that time seemed to me to be evident, but after some research -- after some analysis I found something else, Mr. President.  
Q.	Well, when did you make that analysis, only after 1999? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  As I explained, before the year 2000 I was carrying out administrative duties.  In the ministry, when I resumed political activities in 2000, and after this interview -- this made me task myself to try to understand exactly what happened.  So I carried out some research, some questioning, some cross-examination, investigation -- counter-investigations in order to identify what actually happened in Rwanda.  

It is in that context that I talked about the assassination of Gatabazi, Gapyisi.  But initially, that was not my perception.  And this is exactly the same thing with regard to some facts relating to Nzabonimana, Callixte.  I say "some facts" because the fact that he was a minister, that there were Interahamwe who came for rehearsals on the playground of the minister of youth affairs, I do not question that.  
Q.	So in other words, for the first six years following the genocide of 1994, from 1994 all the way up to the year 2000, when you became minister of defence, it was your conviction that these MRND politicians had trained their Interahamwe and mobilised their Interahamwe to kill Tutsi.  But somehow after the year 2000, you began to make another assessment; is that your evidence? 
A.	Mr. President, it -- it is not curiously -- it -- it is reality.  Because it was after 2000 that I had access to some documents in the ministry of defence.  And from that time on I was able to meet soldiers of the -- some soldiers of the president of the republic who told me some truths.  And so I pieced one 
and two together and came up with that reality.  So the answer to your question is, yes, that is true.  
Q.	Well, what documents were these that gave you more information about the role of the Interahamwe in 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The document on the role -- the documents on the role of the armed forces in general were available to me, but the documents as to the exact actions and activities of the RPF were the new documents that I received, which revealed to me how from the '80s -- around 1986, the RPF had planned to attack the country.  Their meetings -- minutes of their meetings and what have you, those are the new documents that I had access to.  
Q.	I'm not asking you about the RPF.  I'm asking you about the MRND and the interim government and the Interahamwe.  What was the new information that you received about the MRND that now leads you to distance yourself from what you said in 1999? 
A.	Mr. President, the issue is not to disassociate oneself.  It is simply a quest for understanding.  I could have found documents in the military archives in Rwanda dealing with any material planning to kill Tutsis.  I did not find any such material.  I could have found documents in other offices.  

Although some documents were damaged, I tried to find out whether there were any meetings and any documents reporting on any meetings where planning to kill Tutsis had been discussed.  I searched to the best of my ability, and I did not find any.  Then I went on to find out what the RPF was also doing, and that is how I found out in various documents how the RPF had planned or prepared the invasion and what their objectives were.  

So it is not a matter of simply not paying attention but, rather, seeking to discover the truth and 
find out -- and finding out what the reality was in terms of the facts and the actions.  
Q.	Callixte Nzabonimana was a minister in the interim government; right?  He was a part of Jean Kambanda's interim government of the 8th of April 1994.  
A.	That is true.  
Q.	Look at your paragraph 7, where I've numbered 7 in -- in your statement, Mr. Witness, where you say:  

"I will tell you from what I know that people like Callixte Nzabonimana planted the seeds of genocide in Rwanda.  This contributed -- contributed immensely to the events of April to July 1994 that took the lives of almost one million innocent Rwandans..." 

"If he and others who were in positions of ultimate authority had objected to the genocide, I do not think we could have had genocide in Rwanda.  Instead he and others folded their arms, incited the 
local population, provided finances and trained the Interahamwe to kill the Tutsi and other moderate Hutu."  

In the last line of your statement:  

"He should be held responsible with others who were in the same capacity as him and had all the powers to stop the killings, but instead encouraged the killings."  
A.	Mr. President, the Prosecutor is right when he refers to this paragraph.  Quite sincerely, at the time when I was answering the question from the Tribunal, I firmly believed in what I was saying 100 per cent at the time.  But as I have explained, later on when I dug deeper into the matter I happened upon some material that was divergent.  And so the problem of the Rwandan tragedy, even for this Tribunal, is -- is -- is a very complex and complicated issue.  

You see, sometimes what might appear to be an illusion can be an appropriate reflection or could be also represented as a mirage -- or something that doesn't reflect the true nature of the item.  So I think this is the very difficulty that this Tribunal is faced with.  And it makes the Rwandan tragedy and the whole problematic (sic) of the Great Lakes region to -- to be extremely complex.  

As I said, there was media coverage; there was very strong RPF propaganda at that time and even thereafter.  

Now, to -- to -- with your leave, Mr. President, let me illustrate what I'm saying with an example.  
Q.	I think you've answered my question.  This was your conviction back in 1999, but now you think differently; right?  Isn't that the sum of what you're telling us? 
A.	Yes, almost.  It's not that I'm thinking differently.  It is that the real facts are different from the impressions or the apparent facts that were present on my mind at that time.  
Q.	But when you gave this information about Callixte Nzabonimana and when you made characterisations of the MRND leadership and the leadership of the interim government back in 1999, that was based on what you observed, what you yourself observed in 1994, wasn't it?  You weren't doing research in 1999 when you gave this statement.  You were telling the investigators information based on what 
you yourself observed and lived through.  
A.	Yes.  I was providing information based on my understanding of an apparent reality that seemed to emerge from something else.  And this came as a result of propaganda and media coverage and distortions of the truth and what have you.  

So maybe I was not the only one who came to these types of conclusions.  Any person of good faith would come to the conclusion, as I have, that such was the case in the situation -- or, rather, relating to the situation in Rwanda and in the Great Lakes region at that time.  
Q.	So as you testify before this Chamber today in 2010, you have a revised reading of the past.  You've revised your understanding of the past as you understood it in 1999; right? 
A.	Well, I have cross-checked facts and matched them against reality.  Some of the facts were confirmed, while others were not confirmed.  And, again, I must say that in the days ahead as I pursue my investigations I might find other material that would lead me to other conclusions.  Now, what I attempt to do is to find out what the true real and genuine facts were or are.  
Q.	Well, let's just take the fact that you mention in paragraph 7 of this statement where you talk about Callixte Nzabonimana being like others who folded their arms, incited the local population, provided financing and training to the Interahamwe to kill the Tutsi which led to the genocide.  Just think about that fact as you reported it to the Office of the Prosecutor back in October of 1999.  

What new information now causes you to revise that single sentence?  Or maybe you don't want to revise it.  Maybe that's one of the sentences that you've now -- that you maintain was still accurate.  
Tell us.  
A.	What stands is that, as a figure of authority and a minister, Nzabonimana had some measure of -- and still has some measure of moral responsibility regarding what happened in Rwanda in the same manner as other ministers and other figures of authority.  That is a fact.  

It is also true that financing for political organisations, particularly the MRND, did take place.  Nzabonimana was the minister of sport at the time.  And I interviewed the general director of youth and sports and asked him what the -- his directorate -- how -- or how his directorate was organised.  
N-G-O-M-B-O-S-K-A.  That is the name of the minister -- or, rather, the director general, Ngomboska.  

This youth directorate was in charge of financing youth activities and various associations, but unfortunately, there was a tendency for the youth wing of the MDR to benefit more from that type of funding.  And that is the same system which is in place in Rwanda today.  And unfortunately, this system happens to obtain across the African continent and maybe elsewhere, namely, that those in power tend to -- 
Q.	In that same paragraph you talk about "Nzabonimana and others".

"If he and others who were in positions of ultimate authority had objected to the genocide, I do not think we could have had genocide in Rwanda." 

Is that a statement that you revise now, based on your new investigations, or is that a statement that is still accurate? 
A.	Mr. President, I -- I -- I review that sentence entirely.  Yes.  That assertion, I review it entirely because the Rwandan genocide was caused -- or was a result of several actions taken by internal and external actors from several angles.  And we need to take all of those thrusts into consideration and abstain from focusing only on a very restricted understanding, which does not fully take into account the geopolitical dynamics of Rwanda and the Great Lakes region.  
Q.	In any case, when you refer to figures of ultimate authority, wouldn't you agree that the president -- or the executive leadership of the MRND party would have authority over its Interahamwe youth wing? 
A.	I can review my position on that point today, as I have already stated.  You see, in any event, I have already told you how the tragedy unfolded beginning from Kigali.  I do not know whether those authorities had the capacity to face that situation.  
Q.	In any case, thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to move the witness statement into evidence, both in French and in English as the next Prosecution exhibit.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. MJUI:
The document will be P. 529.  Five-two-nine.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 529A and P. 529B admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:  
Q.	I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about the Kigeme declaration with you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And if Mr. Issa could hand up this copy to the witness.  This is the same copy that Mr. Weyl circulated, but I've made highlighting on it so that I can go through it more easily with the witness.  And for the record, this is P. 481, which is in evidence.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, when you were going through this document with Mr. Weyl, the understanding I had of your testimony was that you -- you thought you were criticising the RPF in that the criticisms in this document were really directed to the RPF.  

But as I read through the document and place it in context, I'd suggest to you that that's your revision in 2010 of a document that had a very specific meaning and a very different meaning in July of 1994.  
If you look where I've numbered paragraph 1 where you say, given the fact that the installation of political and administrative institutions is being orchestrated in the midst of terror, weren't you referring to the convening of a transitional national assembly on the 4th of July in Gisenyi, just two days before you signed this document? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Our opinion was, rather, in relation to the government that had been set up during the first half of the month of April.  That was the government we had in mind, much more than the Gisenyi government.  
Q.	Well, in any case, it's the same government, isn't it?  That was the interim government of ministers that was set up on the 8th of April 1994 and then on the 4th of July.  That interim government assembled a new parliament or a national assembly with Joseph Nzirorera at its head.  The same people on the 
8th of April and on the 4th of July 1994; that's who you were criticising, weren't you? 
A.	Mr. President, we were referring mostly to the institutions, as I have said, that were set up in early April.  Now, if the Prosecutor feels that it was the same institutions that remained in place -- well, that appears to be correct then.  
Q.	And towards the end of that same paragraph, you say that the majority of the political, administrative, military and ecclesiastical authorities are only executing the injunctions of minor extremist groups out of intimidation.  These minor extremist groups -- I believe you explained who they were to us earlier this morning.  Are you suggesting that the government was being run -- this government of April -- 
April of 1994 was being run by these Republican Guards from Bushiru?  Is that what you meant? 
A.	Mr. President, even within that government some of those members we're referring to were there and were influential and were transmitting the decisions.  As is always the case in a dictatorship, those who are influential are also part and parcel of the same organisation.  They are not outside of the organisation.  They are within the organisation and bring their influence to bear from within the organisation.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you used the same terms several times in this document:  Minor extremist groups, small extremist groups avid for power.  And it's clear, given the context -- the historical context and the context within which these sentences appear in this two-page document, that you're talking about groups within the government -- within the interim government, the extremists on the government side who were organising the killing.  
A.	That is also valid for the RPF, that is, both for the government and for the RPF.  When we made reference to that, it was in relation to the two parties.  As the Prosecutor has said, those groups unfortunately happened to be operating from within the institutions.  
Q.	You said that your group, the nine officers that signed this declaration, were removed by the interim government after this was circulated in the press; right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And when you issued this declaration, weren't you trying to encourage the RPF to stop their advance and to put in place the Arusha Accords?  You say so quite explicitly at paragraph 4 that I've numbered; right? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	But you were opposed -- you and your group were opposed by the interim government; right?  The RPF didn't oppose this initiative, did they? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The RPF did not respond officially to our document, so I do not know what they said or did not say.  However, when we returned, and as I explained previously, we were questioned and we were referred to as not being patriotic because we had accused the RPF.  And that is what happened.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us that six of the nine people that signed this declaration were welcomed into the RPF in 1994.  And you've just told us that the nine of you who signed this declaration were dismissed by the interim government.  It's clear the interim government opposed you; right? 
A.	Mr. President, on the one hand, yes, indeed, the small extremist group within the interim government did not appreciate our take on the political situation at the time.  That is a fact.  And I agree with the Prosecutor on that point.  
Q.	Who was this small extremist group within the interim government?  It can't be more than 25 names that come to mind.  Which ones are you talking about? 
A.	Once again, Mr. President, when reference is made to a small group -- and I have already dealt with this matter at length -- what one is referring to is, in fact, people who are within the government.  But the communiqué dismissing us was signed by the prime minister at the time on the proposal of the chief of general staff.  So that was the official position.  

Now, when we refer to a small group, it may be other persons, as I have already mentioned, who had an influence on those decisions.  

Now, later on, when I was in exile, I was told that the proposal for dismissal came more from people from Bushiru who -- with whom I had been in contact when I was working in Ruhengeri.  That is in my own personal case.  
(Pages 1 to 17 by Jean Baigent)























1030H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And when you mention the army chief of staff, you're talking about Augustin Bizimungu, the man that replaced Gatsinzi.  He's the one that dismissed you, or submitted a proposal to the interim government that you be dismissed, or your group be dismissed; right? 
A.	Mr. President, yes.  That is the official position. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Right.  Your Honour, I see the time.  I was hoping to finish before the break, but I think it'll take me another ten minutes or so.  If we break now, I can assure you that it won't be much longer once we reconvene. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

We take our mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1033H to 1104H)  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are discussing the Kigeme declaration, and I was suggesting to you that -- or you were explaining to us that the interim government, Jean Kambanda and the army chief of staff dismissed you after this came out.  

If you look at the little paragraph right underneath where I've numbered 2 -- I'll read it in English:  "Considering that only those bitten by remorse due to their crimes can oppose our initiative."  

Weren't you referring to some of the very same people that then dismissed you because of the proposals you made in this declaration? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not know whether I should answer by yes or no this time around, but in any event when we talk of those who had remorse or who were opposed to our declaration -- or should I say to our platform, we were making a general statement which did not target a specific individual or two.  We were mindful of the scope of the tragedy in Rwanda.  And we felt that those people, the groups of extremists on both sides, could be opposed to our platform. 
Q.	Well, I think that's a rereading or a revision of the past, Mr. Witness, because clearly when you look at the document as a whole, you're distancing yourself from the interim government and you're trying to appeal to the RPF and the international community.  

And in respect to that subparagraph that we've just read, clearly you're anticipating a negative reaction from some quarters to this initiative that you took, this independent initiative.  And you say, you warn them:  "Only those bitten by remorse due to their crimes can oppose them."  That's clearly the 
interim government, and the army chief of staff who removed you when this was published.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is the Prosecutor's interpretation, I believe.  My own interpretation, since you ask for it, is broader because we were referring to people of bad faith on all sides.

By the way, the declaration -- the Kigeme declaration -- must not be limited because -- with the President's leave -- let me say, that this is what we explained in our memorandum, which was issued one month later; namely, that the scope was much broader and we should not look at things from 
one point of view exclusively. 
Q.	If you look where I've numbered 3, you say:  "We reject any possible idea of partition of our country in whatever way."  Isn't that a reference to Opération turquoise when the French arrived and a secteur of the country to the west came under French control, through their soldiers in Opération turquoise.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  At the time of the Kigeme declaration, those who drafted it in the main were in Kigeme with students from the school, the military school, and trainers.  And our idea was that it was possible to engage negotiations with other members of the armed forces and we did not entertain the idea of the government forces crossing the border to go to the east.

So we knew and recognised that the RPF was very strong.  And while in Kigeme, and in the hotels, we could not ask the international community and the RPF to engage in negotiations while part of the ex-FAR and members of the population were on the other side of Mwogo while the other half was occupied by the RPF.  

And so we knew that such was the situation and we were mindful of those considerations because we had heard rumours that the RPF had wanted to create a Tutsi land, its own country.  Although we didn't couch the statement in those terms, but that is what is meant to be said. 
Q.	Witness, clearly, that is your revision of the past now.  You're talking about a declaration that was made on the 6th of July before the interim government and the FAR crossed the border into eastern Congo.  This is the 6th of July.  And you're rejecting "any possible idea of partition of our country."  You're not talking about the Congo.  Clearly, in context on the 6th of July you're talking about the arrival of 
	French soldiers in Opération turquoise? 
A.	The border we're referring to is not the border with Congo.  It is the border between the 
	Rwandan armed forces which had been pushed back and were all, more or less, entirely across the Mwogo river.  It is that part of the country we were referring to as being one part that was occupied by the armed forces at that time.  

And the other part below was occupied by the RPF, from the border to Mwogo around Kigeme -- or, rather, Kibungo.  That is what we were talking about.  You see there were rumours at the time that the RPF was now in a position to say:  Now we're in Kigali.  We have the government.  We will remain there.  And let those other people remain on that other side of the country.  And that is what we were referring to in the Kigeme declaration.  

We were not talking about the border, because if we had crossed the border into Congo already that will not be a division of the country, it will be a total capturing or overtaking of the country.  And there would be no need to talk about dividing the country. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, on the 6th of April -- excuse me, the 6th of July, the RPF was on the verge of a complete military victory.  They would have had no interest in partition.  

As I understand it, the rumours about partition for the country were rumours circulating in the 
interim government camp, because they were trying to hold on to a little piece of Rwanda that could be obtained for them by French soldiers.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I am not speaking here on behalf of the interim government, because then they were in Gisenyi while we were diametrically opposed to them in Kigeme.  So when we made the statement we were not vehicling the desiderata of the interim government.  These were suggestions made out of the convictions of the signatories of the Kigeme declaration.  It has nothing to do with the interim government, and I want to repeat that once again. 
Q.	You were opposing the interim government.  You opposed them all throughout this declaration.  And specifically the idea that was being floated of having international troops secure a piece of the country for them, since essentially they were retreating and being pushed across the border into the 
	Congo from Rwanda, which is where they wanted a partition.  You opposed that.  That is what I'm suggesting to you.  
A.	But, Mr. President, if the interim government went to Congo, it would've meant that it had abandoned the country, and that would not be a division of the country.  

So what we were saying, contrary to what the interim government may have been saying, is that while in Kigeme we could call on the international community to engage negotiations for the implementation of the Arusha Accords.  That was our thinking.  

I believe that the interim government also was not opposed to a contribution from the 
international community, contrary to the RPF, which held that whoever would come to the 
Rwandan territory will be considered as an enemy.  

So our position in Kigeme was what has been expressed.  The interim government had a different opinion and exiled itself or went abroad, but that was not our position. 
Q.	Exiled itself and went abroad because it could not secure a foothold to the west of the country.  They fled because there was no partition.  That's essentially the point I'm making, Mr. Witness.  
We can move on to something else if you have nothing further -- 
A.	Mr. President -- Mr. President, I would like to again state that our idea was the idea of the signatories of the declaration, and it had nothing to do with the position of the interim government. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  We have your response.

Let's look at where I've numbered 5:  "We invite the members of the Rwandese armed forces and all the living forces of the nation to unite themselves and disassociate themselves from the authors of the genocide."  

Isn't it clear from that paragraph that you're talking about the extremist elements within the FAR and the interim government, the authors of the genocide?  You're not talking about the RPF there.  You're talking about the same persons that you've been criticising throughout this document.  It was the 
interim government and those elements of high command that were organising genocide in the country. 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That paragraph refers to the armed forces and there's another paragraph for the patriotic front.  So we felt that both sides had to make an effort to stop the killings, particularly the genocide of Rwandans.  That is what appears in our memorandum.  And that was our position in the declaration and it is the position in our memorandum. 
Q.	As I read -- the only reference to the RPF in this document, you ask them to stop the fighting -- to stop the fighting that displaces the population.

And at paragraph -- where I have numbered 5, when you're talking about the FAR, you ask them to disassociate from the authors of genocide.  There's a clear distinction between the two, Mr. Witness, back in July of 1994.  
A.	Mr. President, it all depends on the perception.  We call on the Rwandan Patriotic Front to show proof of patriotism.  And that word "patriotism" must be heard to include several things, including stopping the fighting.  And we knew it is the fighting that actually was at the basis of the bloodshed in the country.  And that is what we state in the declaration regarding the RPF.  So we do deal with each party according to the issues that relate to that particular party without any favours. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, throughout your direct examination you were blaming the RPF for extending the war.  But I would suggest to you that it's actually the inverse.  That there were several moments, key moments, over the course of April, May, June, July of 1994 when the war could have been brought to an end, but it was extended by the interim government because their strategy was to kill the domestic 
	Tutsi population because they knew their army would not prevail against the RPF.

The RPF was fighting a war and the interim government was perpetrating genocide, thinking that would end the war.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  If I have understood what the Prosecutor has said correctly, it would mean that it was the government forces that launched the attack.  I think that the person who launched the attack could stop the attack at any time they chose to.  And that would have enabled any transactions to be taken forward for peace within the country, but it continued its attack until it captured the country.  

Now, to say that it is the RPF which wanted to stop the fighting, whereas it is the RPF which launched the attack, I think, Mr. President, there seems to be some contradiction in such an assertion. 
Q.	You told us -- excuse me.  You told us that you thought the war was lost by the 12th of April; right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	I'd suggest to you that the communiqué that was signed by those ten or so officers on the 12th of April also was a significant concession.  They wanted a truce.  They offered a truce, which could almost be characterised as an agreement to surrender when you look at that document in context and in history; do you agree?  The communiqué that we reviewed yesterday of the 12th of April.  
A.	Mr. President, the fact that the government forces called for a truce or ceasefire, yes, I agree on that point with the Prosecutor. 
Q.	Bagosora, testifying in his own defence, also claimed that by the 12th of April when the 
	interim government fled Kigali, as far as he could see, was tantamount to losing the war.  And he says this on the 9th of November 2005 on page 8 in the English text.  

Again Bagosora, testifying in his own defence, said that when he came back from buying arms in 
South Africa on the 22nd of June he was simply waiting for defeat, which was obvious, which he said on the 10th of November 2005 in his own trial at page 13 in the English text.

Bagosora, again testifying in his own defence, talked about a conversation he had with 
Prudence Bushnell, assistant secretary -- an official in the US State Department, who told him on the 28th of April that the war was already lost.  Your own assessment is consistent with information you have from several other sources, Mr. Witness, that militarily the interim government and the FAR were on the losing side; right? 
A.	Mr. President, what I have said was my assessment on the ground.  And Bagosora's position is also his assessment relying on material that was available to him.  I did not consult him to come to my own determination as someone who was on the ground.  But allow me to say that there appears to be a contradiction when it is said that he was convinced that the war was lost.  And then why would he go on to buy the arms.  Was it not to continue the war?  Or what would it have been for?  
Q.	Well, to answer a question that you posed to me, Mr. Witness, I think there's testimony in this trial that the arms that came from South Africa and Seychelles on the 18th of June were dispatched to Kigali.  And Kambanda gave a speech on the 19th of June saying arms had arrived for civil defence.  

So what I'm suggesting to you was that Bagosora and the interim government weren't fighting a conventional war against the RPF.  They were arming the civilian population to kill the Tutsi.  And I think that's the position that you took as well -- a conclusion that you made back in 1994 and 1999 and it's only changed recently, in the last year or two.  
A.	Mr. President, without even going as far as referring to my investigations, my ongoing investigations, now if the Prosecutor's position is that Bagosora opted for guerrilla warfare in Kigali that would not reflect reality.  

You see, in June, and as I explained earlier on, there was an RPF battalion at the CND which was expanded from 600 to 3,000 men, including several other battalions, which means therefore that Kigali was practically under the control of the RPF.  So I don't see what Bagosora could have achieved by the end of June in Kigali in spite of all the weapons he had just acquired.  So there is some inconsistency at that level. 
Q.	Don't you believe, Mr. Witness, that members of the interim government and of the political parties that comprised that government, persons in authority on the government side, should be punished if it was their negligence, or their acts, or their omissions which contributed to the killings of the civilian population in 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  By omission or negligence, especially in situations as tragic as the one in Rwanda, any person who did that, I would agree with the Prosecutor that such a person should be punished.  That is normal.  In fact, it is necessary for such a person to be punished. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you.  I have no further questions, Your Honour.  I'd simply like to provide Mr. Issa with a copy of the statement to be admitted as P. 529.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And I thank you, Mr. Witness, for your testimony.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted in evidence.

Mr. Weyl, do you have any further questions for this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  And I thank you for giving me that opportunity.
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I would like to revisit some points regarding which you were examined by counsel for the Prosecution.  I'd like to revisit those points in order to have your comments as far as possible.
The first point:  When you were being cross-examined, the Prosecution referred to the manner in which the RPF created obstacles to the implementation of the Arusha Accords before the 6th of April 1994.  He made reference in particular to pretext -- pretext to prevent the entry of the CDR in the transitional institutions.

Witness, do you know whether the entry of the CDR -- the issue of CDR's entry was being -- or was in the process of being resolved before the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  The CDR issue was put to me -- the CDR question was put to me and I answered it.  I said for my part I do not see why a political party approved in the country could not be part of the transitional institutions.  

Probably there were negotiations, but to be candid I did not follow clearly what the negotiations were.  However, my conviction is that the CDR party, like any other party, should have been part of the transitional institutions, as we agreed with the Prosecutor. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.

To your knowledge, on his return from Dar es Salaam on the 6th of April 1994, did 
President Habyarimana have to object to the implementation of the Arusha Accords, or on the contrary, did he have to support the putting in place of the transitional institutions? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  According to information available to me today, when the president was summoned to Dar es Salaam, it was to put finishing touches on the Arusha Accords.  According to that information, it was agreed that the Arusha Accords -- as soon as the president returned to Kigali, that the accords should be implemented. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.

Witness, yesterday in the afternoon in answering a question put to you by the Prosecution, you agreed that when RPF political leaders left Kigali and the CND shortly before the 6th of April 1994, it was not an encouraging sign for peace.  The attack against the president's plane took place on the 
6th of April 1994 and you said that this was a phase of the war.  Do you make any link between the withdrawal of RPF political leaders from the CND and this phase of the war, as you described it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I did not make a link.  But as I said, the attack against 
	President Habyarimana's plane was a phase in the escalation of the war.  I also said that if it was a phase, it means that there was a preparation.  

Now, the fact that politicians withdrew, was that part of that preparation or phase?  That is a hypothesis which can be examined just like any other. 
Q.	Witness, as a distinguished soldier, do you think it is usual for politicians to be left in the heart of a battlefield, a possible battlefield? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  That is a delicate question, because in any case political leaders may stay to have a battle -- a potential battlefield or not.  It all depends on the organisation of the system.  If -- or if that were the case that would be their strategy.  Because in any case if the political leaders of the RPF had remained at the CND, nothing may -- well, I think this was to adopt a diplomatic approach to show the international community that the government did not want to implement the Arusha Accords, or perhaps it was a way of exerting pressure on the government, in order to show that the government was not doing anything and that it was therefore necessary for the RPF to return to Mulindi and start the war again, all that is possible.  

	But staying at the CND would not -- there would not have been any threat for the politicians who stayed at the CND, especially as the RPF would ensure that nothing would happen to them. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness, for this clarification.

Witness, were you aware of a protocol agreement between political parties on the 7th of April 1994 -- or, rather, the 8th of April 1994?  A protocol agreement defining the missions or the duties assigned to the interim government. 
A.	Mr. President, personally, I did not see that protocol agreement. 
Q.	Were you, nevertheless, aware of the duties assigned to the interim government? 
A.	Mr. President, yes, more or less.  These missions included guiding the population, negotiating with the RPF, negotiating a ceasefire.  In fact, that was the main objectives -- the main objective, which was to ensure that the Arusha Accords would follow the path they were meant to follow. 
Q.	Witness, we in fact have that protocol agreement in our case file, that is, Exhibit 66.  This was tendered into evidence by the Prosecution.  And, in fact, I have before me the said document.  That document clearly states that the signatories thereof, this is in article 4, "That the signatories agree to request the government to carry out the following missions:  1. Ensure the effective management of state affairs by laying special emphasis on the rapid restoration of law and order and security of persons and goods."

Does that reflect what you remember of the first mission assigned to the government? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The second mission was to continue discussions with the Rwandan Patriotic Front for the putting in place of transition -- broad-based transitional institutions within a time frame not exceeding six weeks.  

Does that confirm the fact that one of the main duties or missions assigned to the government -- the interim government that is -- was to continue negotiations with the RPF? 
A.	Yes, that confirms it. 
Q.	Witness, in his questionnaire the Prosecutor seemed to give the impression that the government did not want to negotiate with the RPF, and that it did not want any negotiations between the government forces, that is, the FAR and the RPF; do you share that view? 
A.	Mr. President, in my understanding, I think counsel for the Prosecution is of the opinion -- if I understood what he said -- counsel for the Prosecution is of the view that somehow the government was seeking to negotiate with the RPF. 
Q.	Witness, I have a document which has been extracted from a document tendered into file D. NZ735.  I've made a few copies of that document and I would like a copy of it to be given to you, of course, after it has been verified by the Bench and the parties.
MR. WEYL: 
I would focus on page -- pages 22 to 24.  The document in question is 7 -- yes, D. NZ735.  And I would be concentrating on pages 22 to 24. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you have that document before you? 
A.	Mr. President, I have been given the document. 
Q.	Can you concentrate on the last but one paragraph on page 22.  Direct your attention to that and tell us what it is about on the basis of your understanding? 
A.	Did you say the penultimate paragraph on page 22?  The last but one paragraph on page 22?
Q.	Yes, that's it.  
A.	"The meeting between the RPF and FAR is still expected.  Today we know the conditions of that meeting.  Each party, the RPF in particular, asked that the new president and the new government should renounce, et cetera, the end of the military operations."  
Q.	Witness, when this declaration was made, we know the respective positions of the various parties regarding the negotiations, and the preconditions that each party -- each side laid down; do we agree? 
A.	To some extent, but I do not know whether this contains everything. 
Q.	Witness, I would like you to go to page 23, line 5, and tell us what is said there.  
A.	"Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi, the interim chief of staff of the Rwandan army, has been promoted 
	brigadier general and preserves his position as brigade commander."  
Q.	And what next? 
A.	Should I continue reading?  
Q.	Yes. 
A.	"Colonel Léonidas Rusatira, commander of the military academy, has been promoted brigadier general and preserves his position as commander of the ESM, in other words, the military academy."  

And lastly: "Colonel Gratien Kabiligi, commander of the operational sector Byumba, has been promoted brigadier general and transferred to Ruhengeri secteur as commander of that secteur."  
Q.	Witness, regarding Colonel Gatsinzi and Colonel Rusatira, does this information reflect, according to you, one of the missions or a promotion? 
A.	Mr. President, I will address the question from two angles.  First of all, from a point of view of military hierarchy in terms of ranks, this is a promotion.  It's a promotion for Gatsinzi and Rusatira.  From the angle of duty, I do not see any change.  It is the same situation for the two generals.  Therefore, we cannot talk of a mission.  From the point of view of duties it is the same thing, but it is a promotion from the point of view of their respective ranks. 
Q.	Witness, in this document you do not see any indication of punishment? 
A.	Mr. President, I do not see any indication of punishment.  On the contrary, from a point of view of rank, it is a promotion and they have maintained their same duties, so I do not see how this in any way amounts to a punishment. 
Q.	Witness, in the next paragraph -- can you tell the Court what the next paragraph is about? 
A.	We have been talking for the last -- for the last two days of a possible meeting between the 
	high command of the RPF and the high command of the Rwandan armed forces in order to have some discussions, which discussions should as soon as possible lead to an end of hostilities, which resumed last week.  This meeting started yesterday.  We have -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Cannot hear what was said. 
THE WITNESS:
-- and when the two delegations of the two sides met in the hotel to exchange documents, documents that were to be used as a basis for the discussions, this first contact was made in the presence of the commander of the UN forces, Roméo Dallaire, and the special representative of the 
Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  

Now, do you see any disavowal in this information or any obstacle to the starting of negotiations between the high command of the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  On the contrary, this reflects the willingness to discuss -- to find solutions. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I would now like you to go to page 24, the second paragraph.  
A.	"For his part, the chief -- the interim chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces, 
	Colonel Marcel Gatsinzi, who has just been promoted brigadier general, for his part asked or called for an immediate end to fighting, infiltrations and sabotage of infrastructure of institutions and facilities."  
Q.	And a little bit further down, the next paragraph.  
A.	In a document defining the mechanisms to put in place to facilitate a return to peace, Colonel Gatsinzi asked for the -- an end to creative expeditions.  And also requests that there be frequent meetings organised between the leaders of the Rwandan -- RP -- the leaders of the FAR and the RPF, so as to restore confidence.  "And that soldiers who are straying about should be neutralised soldiers participating in various acts of looting against the population."  
Q.	Witness, does all of this seem to amount to a disavowal, a rejection, of the attempts to restore peace -- a rejection of the negotiations to restore peace in which Gatsinzi was involved? 
A.	I take this -- I consider this to be a positive step. 
Q.	Witness, I have a last question on this document.  And go to the next subparagraph.  What do you say to that? 
A.	"Lastly, the Rwandan armed forces request that the forces of law and order should carry out preventative patrols and should pursue recalcitrant criminals while underscoring that gendarmes, police officers, cannot do anything so long as the RPF cannot hear what was said."  I suppose that a sentence is missing here. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, does this appear to you to reflect your understanding of the situation in the days that followed the production of this document in 1994? 
A.	Yes, it seems to reflect my understanding, at least as far as the willingness to negotiate is concerned, the willingness to restore public law and order. 
Q.	Including the inclusion of the Rwandan armed forces? 
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	Witness, I thank you.  

Now, I would like to go to a document which was disclosed to you by the Prosecution.  I do not know whether you still have it before you.  This is the communiqué of the Rwandan armed forces.  
A.	Mr. President, I do not have the document referred to.  I do not have it before me. 
Q.	Perhaps -- Witness, you told this Court, if I understood you, that the difference -- the formal difference between the communiqué of 12th April 1994 and the Kigeme declaration, is that on 12th April 1994 
	on -- on behalf of the institutions the -- Gatsinzi took a position.  He signed on behalf of the institution, whereas the Kigeme declaration had been signed on a personal basis.  

Did I clearly understand the difference that you wanted to establish between the two documents? 
A.	That is correct.
(Pages 18 to 28 by Melissa Hook)









1200H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  "Before the signing" -- moreover, I am reading.  "Before the signing on behalf of the high commander of the Rwandan armed forces" -- this, indeed, is a declaration.  Do you confirm that this was signed on behalf of the high command? 
A.	Mr. President, that is correct. 
Q.	A little bit above there is a paragraph that seems to me to be crucial.  It begins with "afin" in French, "in order to".  Can you please read that paragraph. 
A.	"In order to facilitate that dialogue and bring an end the panic that prevails among the population, it is desirable that fighting be suspended.  To achieve that goal, a ceasefire is proposed by the Rwandan armed forces to the Rwandan patriotic armed forces.  That ceasefire was entered into force from 13th April 1994 at noon, 12 midday." 
Q.	Witness, the follow-up of that communiqué, the fighting -- was the fighting suspended? 
A.	Mr. President, fighting was suspended in July, when the RPF attained its objectives. 
Q.	Witness, the high command of the Rwandan armed forces proposed a ceasefire, a truce, from the 13th of April 1994, at 1 p.m.  The RPF forces, did they accept that proposal, the proposal of a truce? 
A.	Mr. President, if the proposal had been accepted, fighting would have come to an end, but probably the fighting did not end. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, based on those various elements, do you think that it would have been possible to stop the killings while the RPF continued the war? 
A.	Mr. President, I have already answered that question, but once again, let me provide an answer.  It would not have been possible, particularly given that there was no -- or, rather, there should have been a general mobilisation of people to stop the war at the time the UN was leaving the country and that both sides should have had to stop the killings. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, as far as you know, or to the best of your knowledge, what were Colonel Gatsinzi's activities on the 16th of June 1995 -- 16 of June 1995?  In fact, what was his position?  What were his duties? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not have a written chronology of his functions, but I do recall, if I am not mistaken, that he was the deputy chief of staff of the Rwandan Patriotic Army. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, according to a statement that the Prosecutor used in cross-examining you, Mr. Gatsinzi, the then-chief of general staff of the APR, allegedly stated, in relation to the communiqué of 12th April 1994, that the said communiqué was drafted unknown to the government, which was reticent in endorsing the proposals of the communiqué.  Do you believe that the position of Mr. Gatsinzi reflects the situation as it obtained in April 1994? 
A.	Well, Mr. President, I was not present when he signed the communiqué.  But from my observations, my ongoing investigations, as I have questioned a number of officials or officers whom I met and who were signatories of that communiqué, it emerges as a general conclusion and a unanimous conclusion that the communiqué was produced by a group appointed by the high command of the armed forces and that the communiqué concerned or related to the armed forces. 

Now, if Gatsinzi's position is contrary to that information, all I can say is that, once again, I was not present when he made the statement, and then maybe it might be his own objection that he is expressing.  In any event, those whom I questioned unanimously told me that this communiqué was a reflection of the position of the high command of the Rwandan armed forces.  That would be my answer, Mr. President. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, relating to what we mentioned a short while ago about the government's position, do you think that this communiqué was at variance with the government's position? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  If this communiqué is compared to the communiqué issued by members of various parties who were part of the government, I do not see any contradiction between those 
	two communiqués. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, further down Gatsinzi allegedly stated:  "On 15 April the UNAMIR brought the 
	two delegations into contact.  I was the FAR representative.  We discussed matters.  The RPF laid down prior conditions for the discussion which we had to examine, and we agreed to meet again at a later date." 

And I continue.  "We were in agreement with the RPF preconditions."  Now, do you think that the 
FAR delegation's mission was to agree with the prior conditions laid down by the RPF? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I would like counsel to explain his question.  I'm not sure that I quite understood what his question was. 
Q.	Now, was it the mission of the FAR delegation to approve or to agree with the prior conditions laid down by the RPF? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I do not believe that it was their mission to approve or to disapprove the prior conditions.  Their mission was to dialogue and to examine the situation with the RPF solution -- with the RPF delegation with a view to finding a solution.  You see, when there is a delegation commissioned to negotiate, they must have some margin to make some measure of concession.  That was my understanding. 
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, when you read Mr. Gatsinzi's mission and his attributions -- or his statement, rather, you can -- it is stated that "We were initially in agreement with the prior conditions of the RPF, namely, to stop the killings."  From that reading, and mindful of what you have already told us about how impossible it was to satisfy Colonel Gatsinzi, do you think that Colonel Gatsinzi was in a position to meet those prior conditions? 
A.	Mr. President, I had understood that idea differently.  You see, the prior condition of stopping the killings appeared to be quite logical, to my mind, initially.  And it would have meant to lay down the necessary conditions that would lead up to stopping the killings.  That was my understanding. 
If that was the prior condition of the RPF, and if such a prior condition was accepted by the 
armed forces, then the next step would have been to lay down the modalities for stopping those killings.  Now, that was my understanding.  But maybe there is another understanding of that consent. 
Q.	Now, knowing that the RPF had a precondition for the ceasefire, namely, to stop the killings, do you think that the said RPF prior condition was achievable? 
A.	Well, on that fact the armed forces were not in a position to restore and organise public order because they did not have the necessary resources to do so, and this could only have been possible if the hostilities had stopped through a ceasefire.  That would have put the government in a position to have the physical resources that would enable it to achieve that task.  The contrary would not have been possible.  So maybe I did not understand things properly initially, because I thought that there was reference to a ceasefire as a prior condition. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  In your Kigeme declaration, last paragraph of page 1, it reads as follows:  "After several discreet and informal contacts which were unsuccessful from the time of the launching of the hostilities in 1994".  That segment, what are you referring to?  What were those discreet and informal, unsuccessful contacts that took place from the beginning of the hostilities in 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  In a very tragic situation, such as the one we are dealing with, and in times of conflict, particularly in times of armed conflict, parties usually or often engage in official and visible negotiations, but there are other types of negotiations which are more discreet.  That is normal practice in international diplomacy.  

I have explained that among us there were distinguished personalities who had been involved in these negotiations, whether at the official and visible level or at the officious and invisible level, or even on a personal level, who -- being as discreet as I am referring to.  But these negotiations did not succeed. 

And a case in point is General Gatsinzi, who was assigned to carry out that mission.  When he was so assigned, his scope of duty was not limited to the visible and open negotiations.  He was free to use all types of negotiating techniques to obtain the ceasefire.  And General Rusatira had a similar mission, as well as other persons. 
Q.	Now, from what you were able to gather from the co-signatories of the Kigeme declaration who may have been involved in those discreet and informal contacts, what was the position of the RPF as reflected in those contacts? 
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  I believe that I have already raised that point with the Prosecutor, but allow me to revisit the point since it's been raised again through this question.  As far as I am concerned, and from my own point of view, mindful of the numerous documents that I subsequently consulted, I believe that the RPF's strategy was the following:  

I will show good faith at the diplomatic level.  At the military level, I will win the war and attain my set objectives.  At the media level I will portray myself as being unavoidable and as being the only person who can restore peace and stop the killings.  So I think this was the RPF's strategy, and this is what I was able to gather. 

So during the negotiations the RPF would play out on all those strategies in pushing forward its global strategy. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I thank you.  Let me now say a few words, Mr. Witness, and discuss with you matters relating to your statement of October 1999.  I do not know whether you still have that statement before you.  Otherwise, I will ask Mr. Issa to place a French version of that statement before you, and the French version would be more useful for you and for me. 

Do you have your statement of 1999? 
A.	Yes, I think I do. 
Q.	Do you have the document? 
A.	Yes, I do have the document.  Yes, I do. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, turn with me to the third page of the statement bearing K number K0159819. 
A.	I am there. 
Q.	Turn to the paragraph that the Prosecutor identified as number 2 circled.  I would like you to look at the sentence beginning at line 5 and ending at line 6.  Can you read out that statement. 
A.	Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President.  "The bourgmestres sometimes invited Bikindi to their respective communes to sensitise the local population against the Rwandan Patriotic Front." 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, at that level of your statement, were you referring to sensitising the local population against Tutsis? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  It is clearly stated that it is against the RPF. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, go to the next line -- no.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  The next paragraph, please, beginning with "Callixte".  
A.	"Callixte relegated to the background most important functions of the ministry of youth and sports and concentrated most resources and attention to the sensitisation against the RPF." 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  According to you, and relying on your 1999 statement, who was Callixte sensitising against? 
A.	Clearly against the RPF. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, turn over to the next page and read the beginning of the penultimate paragraph identified by a circled number 6 by the Prosecutor, beginning with "The Habyarimana government"? 
A.	"The Habyarimana government had sensitised the Rwandan Hutu population against the RPF." 
Q.	Who was the population mobilised or sensitised against? 
A.	The Rwandan Hutu population was sensitised against the RPF. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, Mr. Witness, in your 1999 statement, we can agree that somehow you level accusations against Callixte Nzabonimana; is that the case? 
A.	Yes, that is true, as I stated to the Prosecutor. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, is there any paragraph of your 1999 statement which accuses Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Mr. President, no.  No.  I had no reason for accusing him. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Mr. Witness, please do not take what I am going to say badly.  In 1999 what was your position?  What was your occupation? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I had just been appointed, if I recall properly -- I don't remember the exact dates because things happened very quickly, and I might not be very specific.  If I was not a secretary general, I was the secretary of state at the ministry of defence.  It must have been one or the other, depending on which dates we are looking at. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  At that time could it be said that you were rather close to the RPF? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I said from the very beginning that this would almost sound like asking me whether in early 1990 or in 1991 I was very close to the MRND.  Let me state that I am a soldier.  I have never had any leaning towards any political party, whether the MRND or the MDR or the FPR.  I have already mentioned that I was invited to join the RPF, and my consistent position has always been that I am a soldier at the service of his country.  And that was final. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness, for a sincere answer to the question. 

In answering the Prosecutor a short while ago, Mr. Witness, you said that your answers of 1999 were influenced to some extent by propaganda.  Do you maintain that position? 
A.	Mr. President, I think that this is the correct answer, because there was some measure of propaganda and also ignorance of the facts on my part, as well as a lack of opportunity to maybe analyse documents and come to a correct interpretation of facts.  That is the picture as it was at the time. 
Q.	Now, one more question on that point, Mr. Witness.  It has been your testimony that in 1994, after you returned to Rwanda, after the month of July, you stayed in what I may refer to as a solidarity camp.  Maybe I am mistaken, but I think you used an even stronger word.  "Brain drain", is that it?  Or maybe it's just my impression.  But at the very depth of your conscience, is it possible for you to think that the way you perceived things in 1999 was somehow, to the slightest extent possible, conditioned by your experiences upon returning to Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	Well, Mr. President, I do not think that such was the case.  Propaganda and the -- we can even call them internment camps which we went through.  I do not think that those experiences influenced my thoughts.  

You see, the shortcomings that I was able to correct in respect to that previous statement arose from the general propaganda and the media coverage, the excessive media coverage of all these events from 1990 to '92, '93, '94, '95, and what have you, whether it be media coverage at the domestic or international levels, and also the lack of access to a number of documents, but above all, the fact that I was not able to meet members of the other party who were in action at the very onset of the war in 1994 -- and I am referring here to members of the RPF.  Now, when I was able to do all these other things that I hadn't done before, I came up with another vision or another view of things which appear to my mind to be more realistic. 

You see, when Gatabazi was killed in 1994, I felt and I thought -- even in relation to my relatives, prior to discovering the true facts and the true documents, I felt at that time that this -- that the hand of the RPF or the Rwandan armed forces was involved in those killings.  But at that time I could not claim that I was intoxicated by anybody, although it is true that there was brainwashing at the time, but I think that this brainwashing or intoxication could only have affected those who were able to be affected. 

Now, it wouldn't have had a bearing on someone who knew what he was doing and knew what he wanted. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  We have a few brief questions to deal with, and I would like to crave the Trial Chamber to allow me conclude with a few brief statements or a few brief questions on the 
	Kigeme declaration, which I would like to revisit briefly. 

Now, Mr. Prosecutor insisted that after the Kigeme declaration you were dismissed or removed from office.  Now, question:  In July 1994 did the rules of military discipline or whatever they were called in Rwanda at the time -- did those rules allow soldiers to express their ideas over the press or by any manner of statement or declaration on such sensitive topics? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  We can look at this question from two angles.  There is a school of thought which held that soldiers do not express themselves so long as they are within the army and that the only expression they can put forth is in terms of constructive suggestions for the development of a plan, which once adopted has to be implemented for the general good.  But the truth is that soldiers all over the world have the right to express themselves. 

Secondly, at some point the laws provide that soldiers execute orders, but these orders must uphold the laws in place before the soldier is bound to execute such orders.  You see, you cannot be obliged to execute an order which is contrary to the law by committing a murder or an assassination.  That is why I agree with the Prosecutor that anybody who engages in a mission that is contrary to the law should be punished pursuant to the law. 

So we were able to make this declaration, because under the law we had the possibility to do so whenever we noticed that any of the activities that were being undertaken were contrary to the law.  That's my answer. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, from your answer it would seem that the Kigeme statement's signatories engaged in a legitimate activity.  Now, do you think that from an administrative and formal point of view your hierarchical superiors could have assessed matters differently and rejected what you submitted because they did not agree with it? 
A.	Well, Mr. President, what we were concerned with at the time was not to determine whether they were right or not in sanctioning us.  We simply did what we had to do according to what we believed in, and they probably acted along the same lines.  But over the years, we -- now, in hindsight, we may or may not have been able to see where the discrepancies lay. 

Now, we were conscious of what we were doing, and I think they must have been conscious of what they were doing.  What we did we believed, and we still believe, was in the interest of our people.  And if they acted in the way they did, they must have probably acted -- maybe because they lacked some information or because their analysis was faulty.  But in any event, we felt that we had been removed from office because somehow the state had proceeded in that manner, although we did not agree with their position. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, Witness, as far as you know, and based on what you saw and heard and what you knew of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, was he, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, part of that small group of extremists which issued orders and intimidated government officials? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I have already answered that question, but I will answer again.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse, since I knew him from my childhood, could not have belonged to that small group of extremists -- particularly the extremists -- because he is someone who lived with everybody, who had friends from all communities, who worked with everybody.  I even went as far as talking about 
	Eden Garden, I believe, and I think that all those who knew Mathieu Ngirumpatse would testify that he would never have been an extremist. 

Now, the position he held, I think, is one in which he operated or functioned in good faith.  My personal opinion -- and I am not the Court -- is that Mr. Ngirumpatse is a good man. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I have two more questions for you.  In your contacts with the authors of the 
	Kigeme declaration before, during and after its drafting, did any of those authors at any time whatsoever, those co-signatories -- did any of them at any time find fault with Mathieu Ngirumpatse in any manner whatsoever? 
A.	Well, Mr. President, to this date I have never heard anybody in my neighbourhood, including those with whom I worked, as well as those with whom I collaborated, and even from the time when I was in the country living alongside Tutsi members of the population, many of whom were my friends -- quite sincerely, I did not hear anybody blame Mathieu Ngirumpatse for anything whatsoever. 

But given that things are the way they are, I believe that life is unfolding the way it is, and I have nothing else to say. 
Q.	One last question, Mr. Witness.  At the end of your 1999 statement, you make reference to those who should be responsible and who had the power to stop the killings but who rather encouraged the killings.  Now, the Prosecutor put a last question to you, and in answer you stated that those who negligently or by way of omission allowed crimes to be committed should have been punished.  

Do you think -- based on your knowledge of Mathieu Ngirumpatse and on what you have seen, heard or discussed with him, do you think that Mathieu Ngirumpatse encouraged?  Do you think that he had the power to stop the killings?  Do you think that he had any power whatsoever that would ascribe the guilt of omission and negligence to him in the Rwandan genocide? 
A.	Mr. President, I agreed with the Prosecutor, and I do state again that negligence and omission, as far as I understand them, at that level cannot be spoken of in terms of preparation of the genocide.  When we talk about negligence and omission, then we can only come to the conclusion that this cannot hold. 

As for negligence and omission, my presence before this Tribunal is -- you see, if I had omitted to do something, I should have been punished, and that is a fact.  So I agree with the Prosecutor as to omission and commission -- and negligence, rather.  But as far as Mathieu Ngirumpatse is concerned, let me say what I have already said, I do not see how he could have been able to stop the genocide or the killings. 

As it has already been stated, there was need for a ceasefire to first be in place for any meaningful efforts to be made towards stopping those killings.  There were negotiations for the ceasefire.  And if he had positive political influence on those negotiations, that is a good thing. 

Now, failure to achieve that ceasefire is another point entirely.  But as far as I am concerned and to the best of my understanding, anybody who assassinated or exterminated people should not be exempt from punishment, because people ought to be personally liable for their personal acts.  If anybody had in mind a desire to take advantage of the opportunity to exterminate the Tutsis, they should be punished.  So like Kagame, who took advantage of the war to exterminate the people, particularly the Hutus, he too should be punished for that.  That is my answer to your question. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, I thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
And right now, Mr. President, I must state that I am really very sorry for overstepping the time.  And I was looking carefully, but it was in the depths of the discussion that I went overboard somewhat, and I'm sorry for that, Mr. President.  

I have come to the end of my redirect, and I would like to apply, as usual, if the witness so desires, that measures be taken for the witness to meet Mathieu Ngirumpatse before he leaves.  

I thank you very much, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we forgive you for overstepping the time, if that is any consolation, and we thank you for concluding your examination of this witness. 

And, Mr. Witness, we thank you too now that your evidence has come to an end, as is true for all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  But you are now excused and free to go. 

The registrar will make arrangements to grant the request made by Mr. Weyl. 
MR. KIYEYEU:
We have taken note, My Lord. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

We take our luncheon adjournment now. 

Mr. Weyl, who could we start -- who do we commence with this afternoon?  Is it Witness SNJ -- ZNJ?  
MR. WEYL:
That is correct, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We take our adjournment now.

(Court resumed at 1408H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, what's the status of this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, we've already advised the Chamber that the witness had decided to waive the protective measures.  But like -- as we do with all witnesses, we prefer the Chamber to test -- to find out from the witness. 

Mr. President -- Mr. President, my assistant is telling me that in my absence the witness appeared before the Chamber and he has already renounced his protection. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, the registrar also reminded us.  But the way he put it is that we have already made an order rescinding his protective measures.  So the witness is testifying as an unprotected witness. 

Mr. Witness, the registrar will assist you to take an oath to tell the truth, which is a procedural necessity before you testify.
(Declaration made by Jean Mpambara in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl will examine you on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse.
JEAN MPAMBARA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Monsieur le témoin, bonjour.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	Please remind us of your name, your surname and first name.  
A.	My name is Mambara (sic), Jean. 
Q.	Witness, let me advise you how we are going to proceed.  We are both French speakers, and whatever we say has to be interpreted into English and also recorded into the transcripts.  So I am requesting two things of you:  The first one is to pause between my questions and your answers; and secondly, to speak sufficiently slowly to enable the interpreters and stenographers to follow you.  

This is -- has been the standard practice here.  We know also that it is difficult to stick to that all the time.  So whenever necessary, I will remind you of that.  

The third rule is to spell proper nouns as they crop up.  I think your name is known to the stenographers and to the Bench.  But let's begin with you spelling your name.  
A.	Mambara (sic) is as follows:  M-P-A-M-B-A-R-A. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You must have before you an identification sheet.  I want you to go through carefully, check to make sure that it does not contain any errors.  And if that identification sheet -- the information in -- contained in the information sheet is correct, then sign it.  Or if there are any corrections to be made, please do so.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  On the last line, "Current address", there is an error there.  My current address is -- 
Q.	Witness, maybe just give us the -- the town and the country.  
A.	It's Rouen in France.  That is my current address.
Q.	Witness, I will now request you to make that correction and date it as 16th September 2010 and then sign.  
MR. WEYL: 
And I would like to request Mr. Issa to collect the document and show it to the Bench and the parties.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, for purpose of the records, I would like you to give -- give us your first name.  
A.	My first name is Jean. 
Q.	Your date of birth? 
A.	I was born 1st January 1954. 
Q.	Your place of birth? 
A.	I was born at Rukara-Kibungo, Rwanda. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to request the Chamber to admit into the record the identification sheet of this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
MR. MJUI: 
The document will be D. NG120, one-two-zero.  Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. D. NG120 admitted) 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Thank you, Registry. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Chamber your academic background, your education -- educational background, academic training? 
A.	I did my higher education at the national teaching training college in Rwanda.  And as a result of that, I became a lecturer accredited to teach history and geography.  I had to be a teacher in colleges and secondary schools in Rwanda.  That is my training. 
Q.	Please tell us, Witness, what were your professional -- your occupation -- what has been your occupation from when you completed your studies? 
A.	When I completed my studies in 1980, I was a teacher in para -- in the institute for paramedics up to 19 -- from 1980 to 1982.  After that I worked in the ministry of national education from 
	1982 to 1984.  After that I was transferred to the presidency of the republic from 1984 to 1989.  In July 1989 I was appointed bourgmestre of the Rukara commune in the Kibungo préfecture and that -- until April 1994.  Took very concisely, those were the various positions that I occupied in Rwanda. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Are you able to tell the Chamber, probably in a more detailed manner, what your activities were from 1984 to 1989? 
A.	In 1984 when I was transferred to the presidency of the republic, I was assigned to the legal department.  And I was in charge of the -- I was in charge of the gazettes.  So I had been in charge of the gazette ever since I was called to the presidency until July 1989 when I was appointed bourgmestre of Rukara. 
Q.	Witness, when you were carrying out your -- when you occupied that position in the presidency, in which town did you live? 
A.	When I was working in the presidency of the republic, I lived in Kigali.  
Q.	Witness, what happened in your professional life in April 1994 (sic)? 
A.	In 1989 I was transferred to Ruka -- Rukara as a bourgmestre. 
Q.	Witness, are you able to tell the Court how your appointment to the position of bourgmestre of Rukara commune happened? 
A.	In the course of the year 1989, the person who was the bourgmestre of the Rukara commune, called Munyadoze (sic), François -- Munyadoze is M-U-N-Y-A-N-Z-O-G-E-Y-E (sic).  Munya --
	Munyazogeye, François.  

So as I was saying, in the course of the year 1989, he died following an illness.  And since there was need for a bourgmestre in that commune, I was appointed to replace him.  That is how I was appointed.  

So since there was no substantive bourgmestre in the commune, the minister of the interior contacted persons who were native of that commune.  And I recall at that time the important personalities of the Rukara commune.  Among us, there was one called Shunguina (sic), François.  Shunguina is N-S-H-N-G-U-Y-I-N-K-A (sic).  Shunguina, François.  He was a préfet of the Gisenyi préfecture.  

And at the same time they contacted Mr. Habiyakare, François.  Habiyakare is H-A-B-I-Y-A-K-A-R-E.  Habiyakare, François.  At that time he was the minister of employment and civil service.  Both of them are from Rukara.  

So the minister of the interior contacted them, asking them to propose somebody that they thought was able to man -- to run that commune.  And since they knew me, they contacted me and proposed me -- for me to be appointed bourgmestre of that commune.  

Since I'm not a politician, initially I refuse -- I turned it down.  I told them that I was -- I was fine in Kigali with my family; and, therefore, I did not want to give up my position and go to Rukara.  I told them categorically that I was not interested.  

In spite of my refusal, three days or so on I was informed that I had been appointed as bourgmestre of the Rukara commune by the president of the republic.  And since the decree had been signed, it was difficult for me to refuse the president's offer.  I therefore decided to take the position of bourgmestre of the Rukara commune, because I did not have political ambitions.  So that is how come I took up the position and acted as bourgmestre of Rukara in spite of my hesitance when the offer was initially made. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you.  
Q.	You did say that politics -- you were not interested in politics.  

Now, being a bourgmestre, is it -- political position or an administrative position?  
A.	During that period in Rwanda, the bourgmestre at the same time -- the bourgmestre was in charge of administration and politics in his commune.  And since I was not interested in politics -- I was a mid-level technical officer, and that is why I was hesitant to accept that position.  

So bourgmestres were in charge of administration and politics within their communes. 
Q.	Witness, this was in 1989.  In 1989 did you belong to any political party? 
A.	During that period in Rwanda, every Rwandan was a member of the MRND because it was a party state.  So automatically, I was a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	You did say that you were kind of resigned to the idea of being a bourgmestre.  Now, for you being a bourgmestre, was that just a problem of geographical -- being taken away from -- geographically from Kigali, or was it a way of rewarding you? 
A.	Not at all.  As I said earlier, I was in Kigali.  I had a position.  I was a director in the president's office.  I had a fairly high salary.  I had an official house, an official vehicle.  
So I realised that I had more advantages being in Kigali rather than being a bourgmestre.  Because in relation to the position I occupied, I could say that being -- being a bourgmestre is a climb down, because the salary of a bourgmestre was lower than the salary of the -- in the position I occupied.  So materially, I think I lost.  I lost taking up the position of a bourgmestre.  

But since that was the decision of the head of state and given the fact that a civil servant had to go and render service wherever he is called -- the state calls him to do so, he had to go.  
Q.	In other words, you had no choice.  
A.	No.  I had no choice.  I don't know.  Maybe if I had refused, they would have destroyed my career.  And I did not want to take that kind of risk.  I wanted to serve my country in any position that they will appoint me. 
Q.	Witness, do you have any special skills that place you in a good position to be appointed bourgmestre? 
A.	No.  I did not have any special skills because I had not been trained in a school of administration, in a school of politics.  I was a teacher, but I did not have any special skills apart from the fact that the people at the time thought that I could be useful as bourgmestre in that commune.  But I did not have any special training in administration or in politics for me to be appointed to that position. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	Thank you too, Counsel. 
Q.	Can you give us an idea of the characteristics of Rukara commune when you arrived there as bourgmestre in 1989.  
A.	Rukara commune is located in the north-west of Kibungo préfecture.  In 1989 when I was appointed there, that commune had a population of about 500,000 -- between 500,000 (sic) and 
	800,000 (sic) inhabitants.  The surface area of the commune was 280 square kilometres.  

It was bounded to the north by the Murambi commune in Byumba préfecture, to the west by Murasi (sic) commune, to the south by the préfecture of -- Kayonza préfecture, and to the east there was the Akagera Park, which continued right up to the border with Tanzania.  

So Rukara commune was -- or -- well, to the east of that commune, the commune shared -- or was near the national park of Akagera.  The national Akagera Park was an area of tourism in Rwanda.  That park was managed by OTPN.  The Rukara commune was bordering on that park.  

So I considered the surface area inhabited by the population as the surface area that properly belonged to the Rukara commune. 
Q.	Witness, perhaps you could give us an idea, for comparative purposes, so as to be able to understand what 280 kilometres would represent -- what 280 square metres (sic) would represent?  Was it a small commune or a big commune?  
A.	It was a big commune.  If I were to compare its surface area with the surface area of other communes, it was a big commune.  It was populated.  Say, it had a population of 58,000 inhabitants or more.  That was not small.  

Furthermore, beyond the boundaries of the commune, there was part of the national park, which was practically an extension of the commune right up to the border with Tanzania.  So it was a big commune with -- that was densely populated.  I do not know any other piece of information that I could give you. 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  Mr. President, I'm on my feet, and I want to draw the Court's attention to this line of questioning.  For over 30 minutes I don't think we've heard anything that is relevant to this case.  So with the 
	Court's indulgence, I think Mr. Weyl should move on to some other line.  Lack of relevance. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, we tend to agree with the Prosecutor.  I myself may have been wondering why it's necessary to have such a detailed introduction to this witness's testimony.  So maybe you could come to the testimony that's germane to the case now. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, it seems to me that I'm coming to the main point.  I would like Mr. Mpambara to tell us the situation he met in his commune and the resources at his disposal, the resources that enabled him to cope with his -- or carry out his duties in a commune which is -- Mr. President, can I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yeah.  I was just wondering.  How is that related to the -- to this case?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, the situation of the commune in which Mr. Mpambara was bourgmestre and the situation which prevailed in that commune from 1989 -- and to be more precise, from 1990, a few months after he became bourgmestre of the commune, seems to me to be directly related to the issues of security confrontations between the inhabitants of the commune, like Mr. Mpambara's.  I think, for a context, these matters are of importance. 
MR. SENDZE:
Respectfully, we don't think 1989 has any relevance to this case.  And again, the Prosecutor led no evidence on any events that happened in Kibungo.  So even the mere fact that the witness is here from Kibungo is not relevant.  And then to start talking about 1989 compounds the issue of the irrelevant nature of the testimony so far.  

So if we can get to 1994, I think we will be able to accommodate the Defence. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I -- I'm surprised to hear the Prosecution say that Kibungo is not of importance.  It is even contained in the indictment.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, could you tell the Court what the situation of your commune was from a standpoint of its organisation and security as of the 1st of October 1990, its situation -- or, rather, was it the -- the same situation in October 1999 (sic) as on 30 September 19 -- on 1st October 1990 as of -- as in 30 September 1990?
A.	When I was appointed bourgmestre of Rukara commune in 1989, the situation -- the security situation was perfect.  There was no problem.  There was no problem of any type.  The people carried out their normal, usual activities.  There was no ethnic tension.  The people lived -- cohabited peacefully.  They shared their lives as was necessary.  They were concerned by matters of development and well-being.  And this continued right up to October 1990 when the war broke out, when the RPF launched or started a war.  

That war disturbed the security situation.  It disturbed the inter-ethnic relations amongst the people of Rukara.  Therefore, the security situation in the commune was disturbed with the outbreak of the war which started from 1 October 1990, the war between the RPF and the Rwandan army.  I should say that ethnic tensions were born.  Security matters also came to the fore as a result of the war.  
Q.	Witness, what were the difficulties -- perhaps you should give us some information about this.  What are the difficulties that emerged amongst the people?  And after mentioning the difficulties you may have encountered, you could also mention the resources that you used in order to cope with those difficulties.    
A.	Thank you.  The difficulties that emerged as a result of the war were, first of all, the security issue, the security issue that arose as a result of the war.  When the RPF attacked the country, one week, that is, seven days, that is, around the 8th of October, RPF troops arrived in Rukara commune, passing by the national park that shared a border with that commune.  RPF soldiers killed, slaughtered people in the secteurs that lived along the national park.  And this caused a major security problem.  

The resources -- well, they attacked the Nyamanyoni (sic) secteur; Rukara secteur, which shared the border with the park; the Nyakabongo (sic) secteur; the Nyawera secteur.  So the people in those areas were slaughtered by RPF troops who arrived in that part of the commune.  Furthermore, it became necessary to manage or handle that security situation.  

Also as a result of the war, it could be said that inter-ethnic tensions were born, inter-ethnic tensions between the Hutus and the Tutsi.  Before that ethnic tensions were -- could not be noticed.  But with the war the inter-ethnic tensions were revived.  

So it became necessary to manage all of this.  As a bourgmestre you have to -- you had to manage all the people, irrespective of their ethnic origin, so that ethnic tensions should not arise.  
The resources available to the commune were really meagre.  At the time referred to, the commune had seven communal police officers who had to ensure security.  

But since it was a time of war, the Rwandan armed forces came and they confronted RPF soldiers.  Thereafter, the inhabitants or the local population was displaced inside the commune so as to avoid being exposed.  

This also disturbed the security situation in the commune.  Such a situation -- or this disturbance lasted throughout the period of the war in the country.  In fact, we were confronted with RPF troops who attacked the population from Akagera Park.  

We were also confronted with ethnic problems which came into being because it was said that the RPF was made up of Tutsis who were attacking the country.  Consequently, there were suspicions.  Each one was suspecting the other.  Confidence, trust amongst the two components -- ethnic components of the commune disappeared.  So this was a difficult, delicate situation to manage, at least in 1990 when the war broke out in the area. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  When you made reference to the resources available to you, namely, seven police officers for 280 square kilometres and 50,000 (sic) inhabitants -- these resources proved adequate to enable you to both overcome the difficulties and to solve disputes, prevent conflicts, as well as contain RPF activities?    
A.	Thank you.  The commune did not have the resources, neither material or human resources.  The commune had all in 'all seven police officers who -- well, seven communal police officers who were not people trained to engage in war.  They were officers who just worked with the local population, so seven police officers for more than 50,000 (sic) people was not enough to ensure their security.  

Furthermore, the material resources available to the commune were not enough.  The commune did not have a telephone line that would have enabled it to communicate with administrative authorities.  The commune did not have any other resources.  It was only seven police officers.  

So when RPF troops arrived there in the commune, I informed military authorities.  They came.  So the commune became a battlefield when war broke out in that area.  

So with these resources, with the limited number of police officers at my disposal, I could not ensure the security of the population and security in the border areas.  I was therefore in a rather difficult situation.  I could not ensure both the security of persons and property during the period referred to. 
Q.	Witness, you made reference to killings, massacres.  Can you tell the Court, perhaps in a more precise manner, who were targeted by those killers, what was the scope by those killings, who were the -- what were the consequences regarding the population's mindset or state of mind.  
A.	When the war arrived in the area, in the region, of course, the population was massacred, killed in great numbers by RPF troops in the secteurs that I've already mentioned, in particular in Nyamanyoni (sic), Nyakabongo (sic), the Gacaca cellule of Gachara (sic), and Yawera (sic).  So if my memory doesn't fail me, I believe over 200 people were killed.  

Furthermore, their livestock was also stolen.  So the people were reduced to a state of misery.  They had to move within the commune in order not to expose themselves to killings.  It therefore became very difficult for these people to manage inter-ethnic tensions.  All the more so as the Hutus were saying that it was the RPF, which comprised Tutsis -- that they were responsible for all these
problems -- that they were at the origin of the ethnic tensions.  

So the ethnic tensions were really rife because of the RPF attack.  This was at least the case among the people of Rukara. 
Q.	Witness, did the situation become normal subsequently, or did the problems persist after 1990, in the months and the years that followed 1990?
A.	In October 1990 the security situation, inter-ethnic tension did not abate.  So in October 1990 there was war.  After one month in the area under consideration, the war diminished, at least in its intensity.  

But I do clearly remember the information from the government.  The government said -- in fact, there were even songs of joy indicating that peace had returned.  It was believed that the war had come to an end.  

Yet a few months subsequently the war resumed.  But the intensity of the war moved to Byumba préfecture as well as Ruhengeri préfecture.  But at the national park, there were also cases of infiltration, and this disturbed law and order as well as security in Rukara commune.  

This happened since the onset of the war, as I told you, and this situation continued right up to 1991.  In 1991 there was -- there were upheavals and infiltrations by RPF el -- element who came through the park and who came to kill people in the areas bordering on the park.  This situation lasted until April 1994. 
Q.	Witness, in 1993 the situation you experienced in Rukara, did it evolve?  Did it change?  And can you also tell the Court what made -- or what events made the situation in Rukara change in 1993.  
A.	The war caused all these difficulties from 1990.  In 1991 there was a security problem.  There was also the problem of inter-ethnic tension.  And I have -- I had to cope with all this.  Since there was mistrust among the people, since no one trusted the other, since I had to ensure everyone's security, that is, the security of all the citizens, I had to sensitise the people.  I had to tell them that they had to live in harmony; they had to coexist peacefully; that they should not fight one another; that they had to be there and wait for peace to be restored.  

I tried as much as I could to organise meetings in various secteurs.  During the said meetings I sensitised the people to the need to live in peace with one another.  On several occasions I -- well, from 1991 I tried to set up committees, committees comprising Hutus and Tutsis, in order to survey the 
ways and means of always ensuring the unity of the population.  

But in spite of all these efforts, the situation did not improve.  The mistrust increased from day to day.  

The RPF started recruiting young Tutsis among the local population.  They recruited these young people and trained them.  The young people would return to the commune.  So there was a -- a lack of trust between the Hutus and the Tutsis, because young Tutsis went to receive training from the RPF and they would return among the local population.  

This led to some provocation.  People said that these young, trained Tutsis would kill the Hutus when war would resume or when they would win power.  This lasted from 1992 to 1993.  
Q.	Witness, do you have specific examples of such cases of provocation?  And if yes, can you enlighten the Court on this; that is, can you comment on those who went -- young Tutsis who went to receive training and returned into population to provoke them? 
A.	There are many examples of such cases of provocation.  Young people who left the local population in Rukara commune, who went to receive training from the RPF, when they returned among the local population, they would tell them that they had weapons.  They would tell them that soon the RPF was going to win the war and that they, that is, the local population, will be massacred.  

So when they compared what happened when the RPF arrived in Rukara to what the young people were telling them, they had this constant fear -- constant fear to the effect that they could be massacred one day by -- or the other by the RPF when the RPF would win the war.  So that led to tensions.  So there were these cases of provocation by young Tutsis who returned and caused such incidents.

1500H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you know where these young people received training from the RPF? 
A.	The young people, as I was saying, went to Mulindi, where the RPF headquarters was located.  Or sometimes they went to Uganda in order to receive training -- in order to receive weapons, weapons that they were going to use at the appropriate time. 
Q.	Witness, did -- did the situation continue in that manner, or did any special circumstance cause an aggravation of the security situation which you experienced in Rukara?  
A.	The security situation in fact reached its -- got very bad in the month of February 1993 when there was a major attack by the RPF.  That major attack caused the people of Byumba to be displaced.  

The communes concerned were Muvumba, Ngarama.  Muvumba is M-U-V-U-M-B-A, Muvumba.  Ngarama is spelt N-G-A-R-A-M-A. Ngarama.  The Bwisige commune, G-W-I-S-I-G-E (sic), Bwisige.  The commune -- the Gituza commune, G-I-T-U-Z-A. 

In fact, there were -- these -- there were about six communes of Byumba where people were displaced.  And the displaced persons were settled in Murambi commune.  Murambi is spelt as follows:  M-U-R-A-M-B-I.  

Murambi commune shared a border with Rukara.  So all the people of these communes were assembled or gathered in big camps.  And since this was quite near the Rukara commune, and since these people lived in risky situations, they often came to Rukara to look for food -- to beg for food from the people of Rukara.  So this also created some situation of insecurity.  

They also told the people of Rukara about the atrocities they had gone through, how many of them had been killed, how they were slaughtered or killed by the RPF.  And this also created tension -- created some fear among the people of Rukara, who did not view the Tutsi in a favourable light, the Tutsi who recruited their children in the ranks of the RPF.  So this situation also aggravated the security and ethnic tension in Rukara commune. 

Among the war-displaced persons in Byumba there were people who had means, and such people looked for houses in which they could live in Rukara commune.  And these people gave accounts of the situation they had gone through:  How they had been killed, how they had been massacred, harassed by the RPF.  And all of this heightened ethnic tension amongst the people of Rukara.  And I -- this should also be pointed out, this is the -- a situation which prevailed in 1993. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Maybe you could tell the Chamber about the number of people who were displaced and -- who got to the outskirts of Rukara and who significantly raised the number of people that you were administering. 
A.	If I should estimate, given the fact that on -- the average commune in Rwanda had 50,000, a population of 50,000, I can estimate that the population of people in the Murambi camp should be about 200 and 250,000. 

That population, and the fact that they came -- they came to recount to the local population the bad treatment they -- that was inflicted on them worsened the situation.  Some of them mixed up with the local population, so it created difficulties that had to be managed and -- with this new population that had come into the region. 
Q.	Witness, during this period were the infiltrations of the RPF -- or, activities undertaken by the RPF from Akagera, had they stopped or did they continue to disturb the security of your commune? 
A.	Infiltration by RPF elements did not stop in October 1990.  It, rather, intensified, such that they will infiltrate -- they will come, kill the population, sometimes they will go back into the park.  So it created terror in the region. 

And given this terror, and the trauma inflicted on the people, I reported the situation to the 
préfecture authorities.  And the préfet contacted the military establishment, and to try and resolve this problem a military detachment was positioned in the Rukara commune for them to undertake a -- patrols and ensure peace so people can sleep.  

So a military detachment was positioned in the region so as to ensure peace in the -- in the region and ensure security.  But that was not the case.  There were still attacks, sporadic attacks.  They would attack and recoil and the population was harassed for the entire period of the war. 
Q.	Witness, you made reference to military detachments.  Are you able to tell us if this was a large detachment, how many troops and what equipment?  
A.	I said a military -- military detachment.  But it was, rather, a group of gendarmes, about 15 and 20 of them who came on patrol along the park, because that is where the infiltration was coming from.  So it was not a significant detachment, 20 -- 15 to 20 men.  I cannot give the specific number because they were under the direct -- direct command of the gendarmerie commander in Rwamagana.  He is the one who decided on the number of men to send, depending on the situation report given him by the gendarme.  But it was a small group of between 15 and 20, not more than that. 
Q.	Witness, this group was sent upon your request, but to whom was the request addressed and who was -- were they your direct supervisors? 
A.	The request was made to the préfet of the Kibungo préfecture.  I told him about the harassment, the consent fear that the local population living along the park were suffering.  So the authority -- the préfet reported this to the political authorities.  So the commander of the Rwamagana gendarmerie sent a gendarmerie detachment to Ru -- Rukara upon the préfet's request.  And these soldiers were to ensure the security of the people who were harassed and traumatised by infiltrations of RPF troops.  
Q.	Witness, you said a while ago that you set up committees.  Did these committees continue with their activities, and did your direct supervisors authorise this, were they aware your -- of their work and what was the nature of the work? 
A.	In an attempt to contain the inter-ethnic tension, I used that measure to bring about harmony between Hutus and Tutsis.  I organised meetings with the local population and the -- the local population elected from among themselves people, Hutus, Tutsis, who were considered to be wise persons, peaceful persons, to bring peace among the people.  So they will meet often to discuss all these issues, ethnic issues, which could create problem among the people. 

Now, as you asked -- since you have asked the question, this procedure, this measure was appreciated by the higher authorities.  And sometimes I got wind of the -- what was being said, that I was doing well to contain the situation, and they were urging other bourgmestres to do the same to ensure that -- to contain the inter-ethnic tension.  

So that it is how it was appreciated.  I even recall that following a -- situation reports that I sent, the 
then-minister of the interior wrote a letter to the president of the republic in which he told him about the existence of inter-ethnic - inter-ethnic tension and the illicit circulation of weapons in the Rukara region.  So it means there was a follow up to these measures that I took to ensure peace among the local population. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Witness, you have just referred to -- talked about weapon trafficking, or illegal trafficking -- illegal sale of weapons. 

So what kind of weapons were being trafficked and what was the consequence? 
MR. SENDZE:
Sorry.  We object again.  Lack of relevance. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if the issue of weapon trafficking and circulation of weapons in the region has no relevance to our case, then I'm wondering which indictment we are working with. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)...indictment are you referring to now?  

Where does this relate to the indictment?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, it appears to me that generally, and I even think that one of the relevant -- one of the accusations, serious accusations that was brought against Ngirumpatse being involved in trafficking of weapons, that reference is made to what happened in the indictment, that is, the insecurity that prevailed and weapons that circulated in Rwanda in the period that preceded 1994, I find it -- that this is in addition to issues that -- in relation to which a lot of evidence was brought by the Prosecutor. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, just try and address this aspect of your defence concisely, please. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I must point -- I must say that if I am dealing with this issue it is because it flows directly from an answer of the witness who talked about trafficking of weapons.  And I cannot do it any faster than that, than saying that: "Witness, you made reference to weapons trafficking.  Can you give us further details?"  You cannot be more concise than that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, you see I didn't quite follow you when you explained how this was relevant to the Defence you're presenting.  And I thought I'd give you an opportunity to present it, so perhaps we might see the relevance in due course.  But just do it concisely. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, can you then tell the Chamber what -- weapon trafficking that you reported and what kind of weapons were being trafficked. 
A.	The arms trafficking that I'm referring to, I told you that there was intense fighting in the 
	Akagera national park between the Rwandan armed forces and the RPF. 

This fight -- as a result of this fight there were soldiers killed on both sides, so they left their weapons there.  And there were some soldiers who may have left some weapon depots in the Akagora -- Akagera park.  And when the war front shifted the local people living in the -- around the parks fell on these weapons left -- left by the belligerent forces.  And those who had criminal intentions could keep these weapons to carry out illicit activities. 

There were poachers who come to those parks, fall on those weapons, and use them in an illicit manner, such that, in that region there was a lot of armed robbery.  Sometimes there were cases of grenades killing children who were playing with grenades that had been left here and there. 

So that was part of my concern, because those weapons there could be circulated among the people and probably across the whole country in an illicit manner, thereby heightening the insecurity.  So -- so there were these -- all these weapons left by the belligerent forces.  It was a problem, and this circulated among the population, costing security, and could be used to kill, to steal, and undertake all sorts of illegal acts. 

So I thought I had to report on that, weapons that were left there which was not guarded.  That it was a source of danger for the local population.  I think that is where those weapons came from, weapons left in the region where the war took place. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Now, to your knowledge, such weapons, were they collected -- were they collected or did they remain in the hands of the local population who may have used them in different ways in the days and months that followed? 
A.	The weapons were not collected systematically.  There were weapons -- as I said, there were people who were collecting those weapons and hand them over to the communal authorities.  There were others who kept them.  There were others who were not necessarily natives of Rukara who came to the park to poach, fall on those weapons and then use them for other uncontrollable activities.  

So the weapons were not systematically collected, they remained there, constituted a source of insecurity, such that it was difficult to know who had a weapon and who did not.  Besides, I have told you that there were the young Tutsi who came back from the RPF and who were saying that they had obtained weapons to come and kill people at the appropriate time, because they were not saying when.  But they were saying that they were going to massacre and that they were sure of their victory. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

Witness, are you able to say when and how you heard about the attack against 
President Habyarimana's plane?  
A.	This unfortunate news about the death of President Habyarimana was brought to my attention on -- in the morning of 7th April 1994.  It was Major Michel Havugiyaremye who told me this.  Havugiyaremye is spelt H-A-V-U-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E. 

He was the commander of the Rwamagana gendarmerie post who came early in the morning to collect the -- his gendarmerie detachment that I referred to.  He is the one who told me that the head of state had been killed in an attack.  That is how I got to know this.  Then I tune on my radio, which announced so many times that the head of state had been killed. 
Q.	From when you learnt about the death of the -- of the head of state, what did you do? 
A.	My normal programme was -- was disturbed, particularly given that on the national radio there was a -- a press release from the ministry of the defence advising people to stay calm and stay at home. 

So, that very morning, I went to my office and I waited in my office.  I saw a group of persons who were coming to the office to inform me about the bad news. 

So more specifically, I saw a group coming from Gahini secteur, a group of three persons, including one Butera, Jean-Bosco Butera.  Butera is B-U-T-E-R-A. 

Another one call Gacumbitsi, Samson.  Gacumbitsi is G-A-C-U-M-B-U-T-S-I (sic).  Gacumbitsi, Samson. 

And another one called Gasana, Sam -- Samuel.  Gasana is G-A-S-A-N-A.  

They came aboard a vehicle and told -- and asked me if I had heard what had happened and I said yes, I had heard that the head of state had been killed.  So they asked me what was to be done, so I told them that -- they had heard the press release which advised the people to remain calm and stay at home pending further instructions which may come on radio, or from the local authorities.  

When these three -- the group of three persons left, the communal policeman who was there close to me told me that there was a group of people fleeing and that they were at the Rukara parish.  Since Rukara is close to the communal office I went to the parish to see these people, who they were, where they came from.  I asked them where they came from, and they told me that they came from the Murambi commune.  As I said, Murambi commune is neighbouring to Rukara.  And I asked them, "What are you here for?"  They told me that they were fleeing, because they said that there was crisis in the Murambi commune, and that they had started killing people. 

When I was talking to these people -- there was about 20 people who had left Murambi to come to Rukara, one of them called Santos, or the priest was called Santos, had just finished saying Mass and came to ask me what was happening.  The population was made up of men, women -- and repeated what they had told me, that they were fleeing from killings and that they had started killing people in the Murambi commune. 

The dis -- the situation was disturbing and I decided to go through the Rukara commune so as to prevent such crisis.  The parish priest, Father Santos, told me that, "If you want to go, then let me accompany you."  So we go and see what was happening.  To save time we split ourselves into two groups.  I told Father Santos that, "You go with one policeman", that is, the inspector of the 
judicial police of the commune.  He's an officer of the commune who was also in charge of security matters. 

And I said that I would cover another region and that we come back and meet at the parish and that way we would be able to have an overview of the security situation in the parish. 
Q.	Witness, those persons who were fleeing, and were talking about killings, did they tell you who was doing the killing and who was being killed? 
A.	They did not give names.  They said, "They are killing people and we are fleeing.  Houses are being torched, people are being killed."  They were saying it in an impersonal manner.  They did not mention names.  It was said in an impersonal manner, so I did not ask who was doing that.  My concern was to ensure that there were no such incidents, no such killings in the Rukara commune.  But they did not say who was killing and who was being killed.  It was in a very impersonal manner. 
Q.	And in your own commune were there killings?  What was the security situation? 
A.	As I said on the 7th, I went around -- I went round the commune and Father Santos' group also went round.  We met halfway and we found that as of -- as of that date, the 7th of April, everything was calm in the Rukara commune, apart from people who had come from the Murambi commune and had started fleeing to the Rukara parish.  That is where they went, probably because they knew the priest who was also the parish priest in the Murambi commune.  And that is probably why they came there.  So when we left in the morning there were -- there were 20.  When we went around the commune we came back around 11 and there were already about 100.  So that influenced the Rukara population.  Those who were afraid were uneasy and those who were uneasy also started fleeing towards the Rukara parish.  But in the Rukara commune, as of that date, 7th of April, there had been no attacks or killings, to my knowledge. 
Q.	Did things remain the same the following day, the 8th of April?
A.	No.  The situation changed.  The 8th of April, in the morning, the chief of the local -- of the
	communal police, his name was Ruhiguri, R-U-H-U-G-U-R-U (sic).  Ruhiguri.  He was the chief of the communal police.  On the 8th of April, around 8 a.m., he came to see me in the communal office and he said there had been killings in the Gahini secteur, close to the Gahini hospital.  Gahini is G-A-H-I-N-I. 

This was a hospital belonging to the Anglican church, and there had been killings.  So when I -- when the chief of the communal police told me this I immediately went there to see what was happening.  Upon my arrival -- upon my arrival I saw that there had been killings. 

The local residents -- the local residents and bandits took advantage of the crisis, at a time that everybody had to remain at home, to attack Tutsi families.  I got there and I realised that they had attacked the family of one Rugomwa.  Rugomwa is R-U-G-O-M-W-A.  They had attacked that family, killed his wife, call Anatolie. 

I moved on a little -- I moved on further, got to another family, and I realised they had killed one Shabayiro.  Shabayiro is C-H-A-B-A-Y-I-R-O (sic).  Shabayiro, François, he had been killed.  And they had killed his sister, called Dina, as well as his two children. 
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, would that be -- would this be the appropriate moment to adjourn for the day?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, this is a convenient time. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, we -- we have to adjourn at 3:30 and -- and we do not sit on Fridays, so you're going to have to continue your testimony on Monday.  I want to advise you during this or any adjournment while you are a witness, you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody. 

Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

We can take the adjournment now. 
(Court adjourned at 1536H)
