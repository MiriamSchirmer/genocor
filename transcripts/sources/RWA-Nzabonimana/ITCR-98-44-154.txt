P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could we have the proceedings.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg, and Judge Gustave Gberdao Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, 30th August 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

In relation to the matter that was -- that had our attention just before the adjournment yesterday afternoon, we have decided to allow cross-examination on the document.  We intend to reserve on the question of the admissibility -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I -- the witness has got her earphones on.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry. 

Witness, could you remove your earphones.  Yes.  

We reserve our ruling on the admissibility of the related examination, and this will depend on the receipt of authentication -- authenticating information.  When we thought about it overnight, we thought that the Prosecutor should provide information of the steps taken to obtain the document.  But we also thought that the Defence should assist in this procedure, because it is possible, or likely, that a certificate could be obtained from the authority that produced the document.  If it was -- came from the bâtonnier, the bâtonnier could give a certificate of authenticity.  

The point is that the decision on admissibility will depend on the establishment of its authenticity in due course.  

Yes, Madam Witness.  Can you hear me now?  

THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President.  I can hear you now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...afternoon, and I have just given my ruling on it.  

Your examination will continue this morning, and you are still under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony had begun.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Mr. President.

WITNESS ALW
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Madam Witness, I just want you to look at this document, please, which is a map of Butare hospital.  And this has been -- is unmarked.  You have -- we have looked at them before and you are familiar with it.  It's an unmarked copy of page 49.  We are all familiar with it.
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. Issa, it can go straight to the witness, I think.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And can you -- I just want you to put a cross where you say the vehicle was on the two occasions that you saw it, cross or crosses, or you can put a one -- or, we can see how we go.  
A.	I have finished. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Madam Witness.  

All right.  Well, that can be shown.  And for the record, you have put a cross at the back of maternity.  

Now, yesterday, Madam Witness, you may remember that we went through the statement that you had made to the investigating prosecutor in the case of Geoffrey Gatera, and I think we completed that exercise.  And you can remember making that statement; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Now, a short while after that -- in fact, is it right that you gave evidence in the case itself? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And that was a public hearing that was held in Butare.  Is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Indeed.  Is it right that there were such public interest in the trial that the court was full to overflowing and they ended up with loudspeakers outside relaying what was going on?  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's true.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Just give me one moment.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And it's right, is it not, that not only did you give evidence -- and I don't know if the tick list is available for you.  Oh, this is the one you saw.  Sorry, if I could just pass this up to you; just one moment -- that you gave evidence in that case, and also, number  5, 6, and 7 gave evidence.  That's GIO, HF and RJ, as we know them -- or `TM; they gave evidence as well.  And is it right you were present during their evidence, particularly, for example, number 5, because you gave evidence immediately after her, didn't you?  
A.	I told you that I did not know that person.  If she gave testimony in that trial I am not aware of it. 
Q.	Did you hear anybody else give evidence in that case?   Because I understand witnesses, once they give evidence in Rwanda, and even before, can sit in court? 
A.	Since I did not know the other witnesses, I was not in a position to determine who had given testimony and who hadn't at this trial. 
Q.	But they give their names in open court.  It's not like here; everyone is named.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	When you hear someone's name for the first time, it does not mean much to you.  Besides, when we finished giving testimony, we went back to our normal occupations -- 
Q.	I take it -- 
A.	-- unless one was a witness who had nothing else to do, who was idle.  Otherwise, when we finished giving testimony, we left and went back to our normal business. 
Q.	Well, I can't help but point out to you, when you say that when you hear people's names for the first time, you don't pay much attention.  In your case, Rwamakuba seems to have been an exception to that; is that right, when you heard his name on the radio, or later? 
A.	This does not mean that I remembered his name when I heard it on the radio.  The fact is that when his name was mentioned to me, I remembered that I had heard it before, elsewhere. 
Q.	Now, despite the fact people were named in court, you don't remember those names of people, in fact, who you were working with and have been for ten years almost.  If -- or at least at the same institution.  Nevertheless, it is right, is it not, that you were present in court when people, whose names you don't remember, were giving evidence about events in the hospital?  Is that right? 
A.	Look, generally, that was the procedure.  Witnesses were in one place and -- they were kept in one place, and they would come into the courtroom one by one.  I could not, therefore, know the names of these witnesses.  I really can't spend much time on that because I don't know their names.  But what I can tell you is that witnesses go into the courtroom one by one.  
Q.	All right.  Let me just ask you this finally.  Did you sit in court and listen to any other witness's testimony, any other person's testimony?  
A.	When I finished giving testimony, I had a child that I had left back home, so I went home and I went to look after this child. 
Q.	And let -- finally on this, did you listen to what had happened on the radio, the broadcast about what had happened in the Gatera case, or did you read about it in the newspapers? 
A.	I did hear that Gatera's trial was ongoing.  As to details or information, supplementary information, I was not privy to that. 
Q.	All right.  Now, let me come to the evidence you gave, and I am going -- I am looking at a document here that's been translated into my language, and which is, I suggest, your evidence in the case, and I will ask you some questions about it.  This is a note that was kept, I understand, by the court at the time.  On *************** 1998 -- is it right that was the date you gave evidence?  Can you remember?  
A.	I can remember the year, that is, 1998, but I can't remember the exact date or the month. 
Q.	All right.  Now, this statement starts off -- and we are in open session so I am not going to read, but it gives the -- it starts off with your name, and I won't read that, obviously, and then it follows that you are the daughter of, and it names your father; and we can see that that's correct because we have your details that you acknowledged; and it names your mother, both sadly, of course, murdered in the genocide.  It doesn't say that, but I -- we know that because you told us.  And it says where you are living and where you are working, and it gives your age, which would be correct for 1998.  None of those details I am going to speak out loud in court, for your protection, all right?  And, then, amongst the detail, there's a question, "How did you" -- you talk in it about a club or a weapon that Gatera had, and the question is this, "How did the small club look like?"  And your answer is, "It looked like a little axe, and he was wearing it on his thigh." (French spoken), in French.  So the adjective there is "little," which doesn't appear in the English, I think.  It looked like a little axe and he was wearing it on his thigh.  Is that right, that that's what you remember Gatera had or that he was wearing it on his thigh?    Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then you were asked if you know any patients who had been discharged from the hospital before they recovered, and you give these names: Mukagashugi, Ariete; Munyentore, Eric; Murekete, Marie Grace.  Is that correct?  Are those people that Gatera ordered to be prematurely discharged from the hospital? 
A.	Yes, indeed. That is true.  These people were ordered to leave the ward where they were hospitalised. 
Q.	Then there is a reference to people -- the word is "crawling" towards, or taken to the tents where the Burundian refugees were staying.  Were there Burundian refugees staying there? 
A.	Yes.  There were Burundian refugees and they were located at the place I have indicated to you. 
Q.	You say, "I do not know how these tents were removed." Do you remember saying that? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	All right.  You say, "There was a woman with them who made lists of people, and those who didn't have their identity cards were considered as Tutsis.  On these days, she was accompanied by soldiers."  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is right.  The lady in question was drawing up lists of Tutsis, and she was always busy drawing up these lists of Tutsi names. 
Q.	It's not something -- a detail you have told us in this trial, nor that I have seen in other sources, but it's something that you are recorded as saying in the Gatera case itself, in the trial itself, and you agree that that's a detail that you knew about and you gave.  And you also were asked what you can add.  "What I can add is that he" -- you are talking about Gatera -- "Organised meetings at dermatology and that he was chasing the patients instead of treating them.  He searched everywhere throughout the hospital to see if there was anyone hiding." Is that right? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	You make a reference to a Dr. Mbarutso.  Is that a name you knew?  It's a name you must have known to give it in this trial.  Who was he, Dr Mbarutso? 
A.	This was a doctor who worked in the maternity service.  
Q.	You are asked what the objective of meetings was, and you say, "They were aimed at the extermination of Tutsis, and since Gatera used to be very furious coming out of these meetings."  Is that right?  Did you see him furious coming out of a meeting?  
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	You mentioned someone called Sister Théopiste.  Was she at the hospital? 
A.	Yes, and she was present.  In fact, she was summoned to appear before a Gacaca court of the town.  She was asked to come and give testimony in regard to the events that she had witnessed. 
Q.	You are said to have said here  that she chose -- "Sister Théopiste chose children to give them food."  Was she selective who she fed?  Is that what you are saying?  
A.	It must be said, instead, that she was wicked.  Sometimes when we went to ask her for food, we were beaten.  This was a wicked person. 
Q.	You were asked if you knew -- "Do you know if Gatera liked to go to the maternity?"  And you say this, "Yes, he liked to go there, since there was a women called Agnes from Musange."  I don't know if I have pronounced that right, Musange or Musenge.  "Who gave birth to twins, and he ordered that it be checked if they were boys, and if they were that they be killed, because the combatants had left the country when they were young."  Is that right?  Is that something that happened, that you gave evidence about? 
A.	Yes, that is how it happened.  
Q.	So all those names you provide here, which we haven't heard, of course, and details and events, are things that did happen and which you gave evidence about, and they have been accurately recorded in the statement that I am holding of your evidence.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Now, here's another question you were asked, and I will read it and the answer.  The question is towards the end of this -- of your evidence:  "Do you know the names of those who collaborated with Gatera?" This is your answer, "Twagirayezu and other doctors, whose names I do not know but whose faces I can recognise."  I will repeat your answer.  "Twagirayezu and other doctors, whose names I do not know but whose face I can recognise. " Just like your first statement that we went through yesterday, here's this statement where you were being asked who collaborated with Gatera; no mention of André Rwamakuba.  Why not?  Given he was so prominent and so much in your attention, you told us.  
A.	You cannot say everything about what you saw during the genocide.  I did not mention Rwamakuba's name because I did not know where he was.  I did not even think that he could be found, and at that time the questions that were put to me concerned Gatera.  That is why I didn't even give more names; that is, referring to people who may have worked with him closely, or from a distance. 
Q.	Hadn't you heard, in fact, by then, that Rwamakuba had been arrested somewhere?  We have heard from one witness that was the case in the hospital being talked about.  Our Witness GIO, 1997, heard about his arrest.  You didn't hear about that or anything like that; is that right? 
A.	I did not hear about it. 
Q.	And by September '97, well before you give evidence, witnesses 5, 6 and 7 have all made statements, but you didn't know anything about that; is that right? 
A.	No, I was not aware of that. 
Q.	And now, I want to come to the beginning again of this statement where after you are sworn, you declare this.  This is the question, "Do you know Dr. Gatera?  When did you get to know him?"  And your answer is, "I didn't know him before.  I got to know him in April 1994."  Is that correct? 
A.	I did not quite understand what you meant by what you read there. 
Q.	Well, let me say it slowly, both the question and the answer.  Question:   "Do you know Dr. Gatera?  When did you get to know him?"  Answer:   "I didn't know him before.  I got know him in April 1994." 
A.	No, I don't know how that happened.  I knew him well before.  But as to the particular features of this gentleman, I can say that I got to know him closely in 1994, but it is true that I knew him before as a doctor who worked at the hospital. 
Q.	All right.  Next question:  "Do you know why he is now being prosecuted in front of all these people?"  Answer:   "The reason is that he is accused of having exterminated people who were at the hospital during the genocide, and must answer for this.  These people were so many coming from various regions of Rwanda, but mainly from Gikongoro, a lot of those who came to the hospital were wounded, and he was chasing or killing them."  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	So (inaudible) like the other answers, in the main, they got that, right?  

Next question:   "Did you see the persons he had killed? " Answer:  And listen very carefully, please.  "I only saw three men who were killed by him.  They were from Runyinya.  Two of them brought to the hospital a certain Kazasomaho, Innocent.  Upon their arrival, Gatera, accompanied by soldiers, stabbed them with bayonets, and he beat them with a small club saying that their time had come.  They then took them beside the medicine intern block in order to kill them."  Would you like me to read that answer to you again? 
A.	I have already understood.  I told you that these people were attacked in front of the surgery ward and taken away, but I cannot say where they were taken to.  There were various pits, common mass graves in the area.  There were people -- there were other vehicles that carried them.  There were several vehicles, but I cannot tell where these people were taken. 
Q.	Yes.  Well, that's not quite the focus on the question, is it?  Let me just read what you have said here.  "Upon their arrival, Gatera, accompanied by soldiers, stabbed them with bayonets, and he beat them with a small club saying that their time had come."  It's a completely different story to the one you told this Chamber, isn't it? 
A.	It is not a contradiction because I told you that Dr. Gatera was always in the company of other doctors, and, at the time, the questions that were put to me focused on one person, just one.  
Q.	The first thing is, yesterday you told us that when you saw these men, immediately before they were attacked and killed by Rwamakuba with his axe by the tents, by the surgery block, that you hadn't set eyes on these people before. Secondly, you didn't mention Gatera at all. Thirdly, you didn't mention soldiers at all . Fourthly, you didn't tell us that they were stabbed with bayonets, which, of course, is what soldiers possess. Fifthly, you didn't tell us Gatera beat them with a club. Sixthly, you didn't tell us that he'd said at the same time as he did that, that their time had come.  Seventhly, you didn't tell us that they were taken behind the medicine intern block to kill them.  You told us one was dead and one may have had a bit of life in him, but they were taken off and put on a red pickup.  And all that was done by Rwamakuba talking about snakes, "Get rid of this filth."  How can you sit there and tell these Judges you are telling the same story or anything like it?  
A.	I told you that you cannot give an exhaustive account of all one saw during the genocide.  I am talking to you about matters that I witnessed and which are in my memory.  You, for your part, are limiting yourself to what you find in documents.
Q.	And sit there and you brazen it out, like you did when I asked you if you knew RO, and you said, "Only since last month," your colleague and friend, in your statement.  You can sit there and just brazen it out, can't you?  
A.	I answered you in the way I did because I knew that you had problems with that individual.  I did not wish you to put too many questions to me.  One must make a difference between various cases. 
Q.	"Stabbed them with bayonets."  Where's the axe blow by Rwamakuba to their heads?  The one blow that kills them; where's that? 
A.	I am saying that these are two different people.  Rwamakuba did things, so did Gatera.  I also told you that I couldn't narrate all the events to which I was a witness or that I saw during the genocide. 
Q.	You end up with two different men killing the same two people in different ways.  And can I remind you of your last answer, penultimate answer here in this context; remind you of it.  We have been through it, so I'll just read it to you again so we are reminded of it.  "Do you know the names of those who collaborated with Gatera?"  Who do you mention?  "Twagirayezu, other doctors whose names I do not know but whose faces I can recognise."  You have come here and lied, haven't you, about Rwamakuba killing like that? 
A.	I think you are trying to make Rwamakuba look not guilty, whereas he did actually kill these people.  The day when he killed these two people, that was the same day when I saw Gatera.  Gatera also committed these acts.  They were together.  As to saying that I am lying, I am telling you of the things that I was an eyewitness to.  Of course, because of the number of years that have passed, I may forget details, some of the details, but I am telling you about the events that I was a witness to. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
The only matter that remains are exhibits, and perhaps I can deal with those, not necessarily in the witness's presence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, the counsel for the Accused has completed his examination, but you have to answer some other questions as our rules and procedures permit the Prosecutor to ask you some further questions at this stage.  So you will have to answer questions from the Prosecutor now.  Do you understand that?  Did you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Madam Prosecutor.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness. Good morning, Madam.  As the President told you, I shall do your re-examination, and I shall return to a few matters that were raised by the Defence.  

I would like to start with the events that occurred in Kigali regarding the press conference that was organised.  If I am not mistaken, I believe this occurred on the 26th of July 2005.  Regarding this event, you were told -- you said that you saw the Defence counsel, and you attacked him because he had given your names ****************.  

Madam Witness, I shall put a question to you in that regard.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just interrupt and say that wasn't the evidence, and that is a distortion of the evidence.  And, I think, given the circumstances, my friend should be quite careful to get it right.  She never said that.  She said there was no contact between myself and her, and that what she had heard, she had heard from ********************************.  And that was a very strange thing that you -- she then related that she heard, as you know, from context, relating to HF.  

So, please, don't put words -- I ask the Prosecution not to put words like that in this witness's mouth.  It is very important that there is no leading at all done on this subject.  
MS. FALL:
I am not leading anything at all.  You have all the leeway you had -- you had all the leeway to put all the questions you wished regarding the matter.  I shall not go beyond bounds in that area.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	 Madam Witness, I would like to put a question to you:  Did the fact that ********************************** call you, that is, you and the other people who were with you, is this the fact that embarrassed you, or when you talk about security matters, are you referring to something else?  
A.	I was not personally embarrassed by what the ****************** said.  What caused me some alarm was the meeting that I had with people whom I met near my home, and who almost harmed me.  
Q.	Can you tell us what happened to you? 
A.	When I went back home it was in the evening.  I met two men.  They seized me.  They took hold of me, and they asked me to give them the dollars that I had brought from Arusha.  I told them that I did not know Arusha.  When I was denying that I did not know Arusha, then they saw a light.  It seemed to me that it was the light of a motorcycle.  So they ran away, but before they did that they hit me with a stick.  But afterwards I realised that it was a car that was approaching.  I did not call for help because I was frightened that I might be asked what had happened to me.  I only told the story to my husband.  It is he -- it is to him that I said, or I narrated what happened to me that evening. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  

Witness, you are aware that Mr. Hooper is a Defence counsel.  He has the right to go to the premises of the hospital to take photographs and conduct any investigation that will help him to cross-examine our witnesses.  Can you tell us what it is about Mr. Hooper's attitude that caused you alarm?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Nothing has been said about me, Mr. President.  I am concerned that the Prosecutor, nothing having been said, is asking a question which I assume she has no idea what the answer is going to be at all. There has been no suggestion by this witness that there has been any difficulty caused by me.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I had informed the Trial Chamber that we were on a slippery slope when Mr. Hooper brought this matter up and put all the questions that he wished to put.  I am asking the witness this.  She knows that Mr. Hooper is a lawyer; she knows this.  Events occurred that everybody is aware of.  I would just like to ask -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the problem with that question is why it would be a leading question -- is that the witness had not said before that she was alarmed -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse me, Mr. President, there are too many microphones open.  I think, counsel for the Prosecution --  
MS. FALL:
I think I shall put my question anew.  I shall reformulate it. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us if there is a problem with Counsel Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, that's still a leading question.
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, you spoke of security problems or problems of safety.  What were your problems of security or safety?  
A.	I have told you what happened to me, but especially my anxiety, my fears.  My concern is that when Counsel Hooper finished taking photographs, he went into the office of one of the nurses working there and held a meeting with that nurse, ***********************************************************************************. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well -- 
THE WITNESS:
*********************, and that is what is causing my anxiety and perhaps a source of our insecurity.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, first of all, there seemed to be a question that the Prosecutor may have been hunting down the answer, may have had some foreknowledge of it which they haven't shared with me.  I would like to make something clear, and put on record the fact that when I was at the hospital, I held absolutely no meeting with any potential Defence witness.
MS. FALL:
Monsieur le Président.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I would like to assure this witness that no such meeting took place.  The only place I went, together with my legal assistant, and by arrangement, was the archives.  And I was there concerned with looking at paper and not with talking to people.  Throughout -- throughout the entire visit to the hospital, I was -- except in archives, I was accompanied by this director that she speaks about, I believe.  No meeting took place.  Certainly no reference was made to this witness while she -- while I was there.  Certainly her name was not -- and I would not disclose.  So I hope that, at least, goes some way to putting this witness's anxieties to rest.  

And I am still very concerned at what is happening this morning in this public forum with the Prosecution asking questions which they either know, or think they know the answers to, or they don't, concerning myself.  There have already been considerable difficulties caused in Rwanda by misinformation, by broadcasting things that are completely untrue, unfounded, and not said in this courtroom from last Monday, just a week ago.  They get blown up and distorted.  They have been misreported by the media agency here, Hirondelle, and they have then been further distorted with when they get to Rwanda.  

Now, we all know and share the history of this, and I am sure, some of us, the concern.  I am very concerned that my friend is -- appears to be on a -- this fishing expedition.  Alternatively, there has been conversation between the Prosecution and this witness which has not been related to me, which I have not been in a position to assist.  I hope that the position is made clear:  There was no meeting at the hospital with anyone, as this witness has suggested.  There was no divulging of names, hers or anyone else's.  And I don't know where she has come to this position where she thinks there was a meeting held in the hospital, when, in fact, the directors of that hospital were in my investigator's and Mrs. Pouplard's company from beginning to last, with one exception, of archives.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Counsel, but I wasn't asking you to testify in this matter because it is a matter that's pursuing its course -- pursuing its course, and we could have avoided -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'd like -- 
MS. FALL:
Please allow me to finish what I am saying.  Thank you very much.  

There wouldn't have been any problem if during cross-examination you hadn't lengthily dealt with this matter.  If you have another -- anything else to say --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel, switching her microphone on and off.  I am sorry we missed that sentence.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, let us continue.

You were told, in respect of this matter, that you left with two other people, and you were then questioned as to your knowledge of those people, what you knew about those people, which included Witness HF, and you answered that you had known her for a month.  Is that correct. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you were giving testimony on the 25th of July, if I remember correctly -- 25th of August, I am sorry, excuse me, if my memory serves me right, and the events in Kigali occurred on the 25th of July; is that correct? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	I did not hear the answer.  
A.	Let me try and remember the date.  I think the meeting, the conference, was not on the 25th of July.  I think that on the 25th of July is, rather, the day that Mr. Hooper -- Counsel Hooper went to Butare. 
Q.	Yes, and was it that day you were ***********************? 
A.	It was a Monday, the 25th of July.  The same day ***************. 
Q.	And was it that day that you met Witness HF? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I am sorry, that is a leading question. 
THE WITNESS:
I think it would be better to give me a list -- the list of names, then I will know who HF is. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel for the Prosecution does not have her microphone on.  
MS. FALL:
Could the registry assist?  The list submitted by Mr. Cooper -- Hooper, sorry, the names of witnesses in this trial.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, she can write down the name in the circumstances.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I did think that the way the question had originally been formulated was leading.  
MS. FALL:
Could you please hand her the list?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Could I invite, if this is an exercise that is going to profit anyone, that the witness be asked to write down the names at this point, not be assisted by a list at this point.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that this list, the list of names, it was submitted, tendered, admitted.  I think it is an exhibit, evidence, and for the witness, as she has requested to know who we are referring to, that she be given that list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
I merely suggest that we don't know what name the witness is going to come out with, and the list, therefore, becomes in its way an assistance to a question, and to that extent leading.  We don't know the names that the witness is going to give us from one moment to the next. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, Counsel Hooper undertook this exercise at length.  She has already seen the list with the names of witnesses' pseudonyms, and it is on that list that he based his questioning of the witness as to what she knew of those people.  She does not remember the number of people, therefore, the names that are there.  She would like to be given the list to know who is HF.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, the problem could be solved very simply, if the witness indicates who she travelled with.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The problem really is that I don't think that the issue of the pseudonym is something which the witness is entitled to be familiar with.  So it's natural that she would not know.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us who you travelled with? 
A.	I travelled with two ladies. 
Q.	Could you write on a piece of paper that the registrar is going to give you, could you write down the names of those two ladies?  Are you in a position to do that -- able to do that? 
A.	I should like to ask to be given the pseudonyms of these people next to their names. 
Q.	That is not necessary, Madam Witness.  

Madam Witness, you have written down two names.  Can you tell us possibly in brackets, in parentheses, the person whom you say you met one month ago?  Could you write down, in parentheses, one month, close parentheses, next to the name of that person?  Have you finished?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	With regard to the second name, the other name, where you have not added anything in brackets, could you -- could you, in brackets, put when you met that person?  Add when you met that person, in parentheses.  
A.	I have finished. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. FALL:
Keep the document.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us whether, following those incidents, you made any statement to anyone whatsoever? 
A.	No, I have made no statement to anyone. 
Q.	Do you know whether, following the events that occurred, any investigation -- do you know whether any investigation has been undertaken after those occurrences? 
A.	I do not know anything about that. 
Q.	Witness, we will now go on to another topic.  

I should like, first of all, to hand you a document that was shown to you by the Defence.  It's a photograph of part of the hospital.  It is drawn from the document, the Prosecution's document P. 2, page 53, photograph number 6, K number K0275281, K0275281.  Witness, do you recognise the buildings in this photograph?  You have already recognised them.  
A.	Yes, I do recognise those buildings. 
Q.	Can you tell us what is the building right at the back in the photograph? 
A.	I see the maternity ward in the photograph. 
Q.	Can you put a cross on the picture where you see the maternity ward, if you have a writing implement? 
A.	I have done so. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us what other building you recognise here in this photograph? 
A.	I also see the outside door to the surgical ward. 
Q.	Was that where you were with your aunt? 
A.	Yes, that's where we were. 
Q.	Could you put a circle at the entrance to that ward?
A.	I have done so.
MS. FALL:
Could you pick that up?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Requests counsel of the registry.  
MS. FALL:  
Mr. President, I should like this document to be entered as Prosecution Exhibit P. 62 and that it be recorded, put on record that the witness indicated with a cross the maternity ward and with a circle the admissions ward where she was. 

Apparently I made a mistake. It's Exhibit P. 65.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is the only thing you are exhibiting at this stage?  
MS. FALL:
I have other documents. Perhaps I could take this opportunity -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)... it doesn't matter, I just wanted to assist.  You could exhibit the others subsequently, if you wish.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, later.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, Mr. President, sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P.  65.  

Mr. Registrar, is that confirmed?  
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour, P. 65. 
(Exhibit No. P. 65 admitted) 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, we are coming back to another topic.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to be much longer?  It's 10:30.  Do you want to complete or do you want to take the break now?  
MS. FALL:
I think we could take a break, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we will take a short recess.  
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 1 to 15 by Judith Baverstock)















(Court resumed at 1100H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume the hearing. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Madam Witness, when you saw André Rwamakuba for the first time, you told us that it was the students who pointed him out to you.  Afterwards you mentioned the name of Eric Gashongore.  Was Eric Gashongore one of the students? 
A.	He was a student and he was one of a group of students. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you recall the time when you learnt that André Rwamakuba was a medical doctor?  
A.	I became aware of it when his case was started and mention was made of his -- of him, but before that, I did not know that he was a doctor. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall return briefly to your statement before the court in Rwanda.  I would like to make some clarifications thereon.  Do you remember how many times you appeared before the court in Rwanda? 
A.	I went to court when questions were put to me about the Gatera trial. 
Q.	Regarding the Gatera trial, how many times did you give testimony before the court? 
A.	I only gave testimony once. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you told the Trial Chamber that during this Gatera trial you did not mention the name of Dr. Gatera.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I beg your pardon -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Corrects counsel.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	-- Dr. André Rwamakuba, and you gave the reason as follows -- for this as follows:  It was the Gatera trial.  Could you explain to the Trial Chamber why in this Gatera trial the same acts of which you accuse André Rwamakuba are mentioned, practically the same? 
A.	It is because they were constantly together.  In most of the cases, they were together. 
Q.	Madam Witness, in telling us that the two men, ********************************, were killed by 
	André Rwamakuba, are you able to tell us whether Dr. Gatera was present when this happened? 
A.	He was present. 
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement you state that these two people were hit by André Rwamakuba; Dr. Gatera was present, you say.  You add that they were finished off by the Interahamwe and their remains taken away.  Did you see how the Interahamwe finished them off? 
A.	I did not follow them. 
Q.	In giving testimony in the Gatera trial, Madam Witness, were you able to recall all the events that had occurred at the Butare hospital? 
A.	I was able to remember what had happened in Butare at the hospital. 
Q.	Did you give any details about everything that happened in Butare hospital insofar as Dr. Gatera was concerned? 
A.	I provided details about what happened insofar as Dr. Gatera was concerned. 
Q.	Did you provide details about other events that occurred but which did not involve Dr. Gatera? 
A.	Sometimes I spoke in general, but in most instances the details I gave were -- concerned Dr. Gatera. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us at what time you got to know the name of Dr. Twagirayezu? 
A.	I got to know his name when I heard him being talked about. 
Q.	Can you tell us when you heard him being talked about, that is, Dr. Twagirayezu? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	Could you perhaps tell us whether this was before the events that occurred at the hospital, during or after these events? 
A.	I learnt his name after the events at the hospital. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I shall now move on to the events that occurred before those of the Butare hospital, very briefly.  In your statement you gave a date, that is, the 19th of April.  Why did you remember that date? 
A.	Because this was the date on which they began to kill people and it was the date on which we fled our home, which was burnt down afterwards. 
Q.	Apart from the 19th of April, can you tell us how you were able to determine the times when events occurred at the hospital? 
A.	My reference point was the date of the 19th. 
Q.	Madam Witness, you told us that before you arrived at the hospital you were wounded.  You indicated that your aunt was wounded as well.  You said that you were wounded in your limbs, on your leg and your arm.  Do you have scars of these wounds? 
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Witness, if you were asked, would you be willing to show these scars to the Court? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  I shall now come to events concerning the time when you were in the ward.  You told us that there were patients, some were taking drips, some didn't, and you mentioned 30 patients receiving care.  Did you know the people who were hospitalised in that ward? 
A.	I did not know the patients. 
Q.	Madam Witness, since you said that identity cards had been taken away, can you tell us when these cards were taken?  Was it before or after the arrival of André Rwamakuba and the people who accompanied him?  
A.	The identity cards had been confiscated before the arrival of André Rwamakuba and the people who accompanied him. 
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell us what the ethnic group was of the women who were attacked? 
A.	They were from the Tutsi ethnic group. 
Q.	Can you tell us why you can confirm that these women were of Tutsi origin? 
A.	Because at the time it was the Tutsis who were being targeted by the killings; it was the Tutsis they were killing. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that André Rwamakuba personally hit five patients on the head.  Did you yourself see him hit these five patients? 
A.	I saw him. 
Q.	Can you tell us where exactly he hit these five women? 
A.	He hit them on the head. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I shall now move on to the events concerning the two men.  I shall do so briefly, as we have already mentioned them.  You say that it is André Rwamakuba who hit these two men, do you?  When he met them, that is, when you were hiding under the tent, when you sought refuge under the tent, that is.  
A.	I was not inside the tent; I was outside it. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately where you were located, that is, in relation to André Rwamakuba and his group? 
A.	I would say I was about eight or ten metres away from them. 
Q.	Could you see clearly all that was happening?  When you saw him, what did you observe?  What happened? 
A.	I saw him hit two of the men, two men on the head with a hatchet, and he said that there was no refuge for snakes.  
Q.	When you say "he", are you referring to André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Witness, you said that these people were taken away.  You do not know exactly where they were taken to, but you said in your statement that there were mass graves at the hospital.  Can you say exactly where these mass graves were? 
A.	These common graves were below the maternity around the internal medicine unit near the clinic. 
Q.	Madam Witness, did you, at one point or another, have the opportunity to go and see these common graves? 
A.	I never went to see them. 
Q.	So, how did you know that these common graves existed? 
A.	I could hear people say that that is where victims were disposed of, and after the war, some of the remains were exhumed. 
Q.	Madam Witness, questions were put to you regarding the tents that had been set up at the hospital, since you said that there were tents that had been put up, where refugees were housed.  You said that you left the hospital sometime after you saw the events that occurred when André Rwamakuba was hitting these two men.  You were not, however, able to give an exact date.  Do you remember whether, when you were leaving the hospital, the tents were still up? 
A.	I left the hospital when the tents were still up. 
Q.	Can you explain to us -- because in the Gatera trial, it is observed that you said that the tents had been brought down, so can you tell us exactly when you realised that the tents had been taken down? 
A.	I returned to the hospital, and I observed that the tents had been dismantled. 
Q.	If it is possible, can you tell us how long after you left the hospital you returned? 
A.	I do not remember very clearly, but it is between May and June. 
Q.	Witness, can you explain to us for what reasons you returned to the hospital? 
A.	I returned to find out whether my aunt was still alive. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where your aunt died? 
A.	She died in Huye commune. 
Q.	In your statement to the investigators, it is said that your aunt died in the hospital.  Did you have the opportunity to make corrections to your statement? 
A.	What I remember is that all I said was that my aunt had died, but I did not say that she had died at the hospital. 
Q.	In your statement to the investigators, there is clear -- it is clearly stated that your aunt died at the hospital.  Were you given the opportunity to correct that statement? 
A.	I never did correct that passage. 
Q.	Witness, when you left the hospital, you said that you spent the night in farms on some occasions, and on other occasions you spent the night with people who gave you shelter.  You were asked whether you knew these people, because your statement refers to friends, and you answered in the affirmative.  Can you say whether there was any blood relationship with -- between you and the people who gave you shelter? 
A.	These people and I were not related. 
Q.	In reference to the people who gave you shelter when you had trouble -- when you were fleeing, would you consider them friends or enemies? 
A.	Since these people were good to me, I would consider them as friends. 
Q.	Madam Witness, yesterday you were asked whether there were survivors whom you knew, as you had given a name in the Gatera trial.  You answered that there was one Immaculée.  Afterwards, the Defence told you that the name that you mentioned during the Gatera trial was the name of Mukagatera, which seems to imply that this does not refer to the same person.  If you can remember today, could you give us the exact -- exact name of the person who survived? 
A.	This person's name is Immaculée Mukagatera. 
Q.	You gave the name of Immaculée, and Mr. Hooper named Mukagatera.  This reminded you or refreshed your memory, and you were then able to say that it was Immaculée Mukagatera; would that be correct? 
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Thank you, Madam Witness.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  I do not know whether it is possible for me now to tender into evidence documents as Prosecution exhibits.  Am I allowed to do so now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not necessary for the witness to be present when that is taking place, so I think I will excuse her now. 

Madam Witness, you have been examined by both the Prosecutor and the counsel for the Accused.  As Judges, we don't have any questions to put to you, and your testimony has now ended and you are free to leave.  I'd just like, on behalf of the Tribunal, to thank you for coming to give testimony here. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Ms. Fall. 
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  There are only two documents that I wish to tender.  First of all, the sheet of paper with the two names the witness gave us of the people who accompanied her to Kigali.  I should like that to be entered, admitted as P. 66, unless I'm mistaken, and under seal. 

And for the record, I wish to specify the witness has indicated how long she's known both other witnesses.  One month in the case of one and in the case of the other, the date they met, which apparently was in 1996. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just observe that that is not an accepted fact and we know that the witness asked for the pseudonym.  What's happened is that the witness has allocated to RO who she said that she knew a month, a date, I think, in 1996 -- 1st of December 1996.  So it's contrary to her evidence. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The paper is admitted under seal, Exhibit P. 66. 
(Exhibit No. P. 66 admitted, under seal)

MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
The other document is also a sheet of paper on which the witness wrote the names of the victims who had been killed at Butare university hospital, and that would be P. 67, 
Exhibit P. 67. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted P. 67. 
(Exhibit No. P. 67 admitted)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Nothing further. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor.  

Mr. Hooper, are you ready to tender your documents? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I am Mr. President, and I hope there's a -- yes, thank you very much, I misplaced mine.  It's just a proposed list for the assistance of the registry and Your Honours.  These have not been admitted obviously yet.  And the first of the proposed witness -- exhibits it is proposed to tender is D. 104, which is the tick list for the last witness, ALW, unmarked and to be kept under seal.  It contains nine names, including that of RO.  We understand that will be D. 104. 
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour, the next Defence exhibit is D. 104.
MR. HOOPER:
Following on that, a sketch of the university -- of the Butare university hospital, marked by the witness to indicate the ward in which her aunt was hospitalised as D. 105. 

I should add that this also indicates with a blob the position of the defendant at the time she alleged that she saw Rwamakuba -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, in order to save time, I would like to enquire from the Prosecutor, is there anything contentious on this list?  If there's not, could I just ask the registrar to read it into the record and -- and that would be -- probably save us a few minutes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, or -- might we deal with this when we rise with the registrar and he can confirm it then when we sit this afternoon.  It's just that we can then ensure that there is no slip-up between what we claim and what we've got. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the Prosecutor should also be involved in that exercise.  
MR. HOOPER.
Yes, very well.  We'll do that as soon as we arise for the luncheon adjournment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Ms. Fall?  That's okay.

Yes, we are ready for the next witness.  Could you bring the next witness in, please. 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, the following witness will be led by my colleague, Counsel Morley. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness, can you hear me?  I'm the Judge speaking to you. 
THE WITNESS:
I can hear you, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  We thank you for coming here to give testimony in this trial.  The first thing that will happen, is that the registrar will ask you to take an oath to tell the truth. 

Mr. Registrar. 
(Declaration made by Witness XV in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Now, you will now be examined by the counsel for the Prosecutor.  The Prosecutor will ask you questions at this stage and you must answer. 

Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave. 
WITNESS XV,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are the witness known as XV.  Can I please show you a document, which I would ask Mr. Issa to show first to the Defence and then to Your Honours, and may I invite that when 
	Your Honours look at the document, particular attention is paid to the occupation, both presently and in 1994 that is mentioned there. 

For obvious reasons, I don't propose to mention the occupation in open court, but Your Honours' attention is invited to it; it is obviously relevant.  Perhaps if the document might be shown to the witness, please. 

Now, Mr. Witness, are you able to read on that document your name? 
A.	Yes, I see my name. 
Q.	Are you able to read on that document your year of birth? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Are you able to read on that document the cellule, and the commune and secteur and préfecture where you were born? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The cellule, the secteur, the commune and the préfecture, where you were in 1994? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And are you able to read on that document the cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture where you are currently residing? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, on the document, may I ask you, are you able to read English? 
A.	No, I do not know English. 
Q.	On the document there is a section for your occupation.  Do you understand what I've said to you?  
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	Are you -- without saying what is on the document -- able to read what the document says was your occupation in 19 -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I say, there is no dispute on this man's occupation then and from what he's indicated there up until to date.  Nor is there any dispute about the history of events leading up to his eventually going to the hospital in April once the genocide had started in his area.  The only areas of dispute concern events in the hospital. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm grateful for that indication.  If Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues are happy to proceed without it being entered in some way formally onto the record that the witness identifies his occupation, then I'll continue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That might mean that the document may be acknowledged in more general terms. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  My learned friend --
MR. PRESIDENT:
And then we could put it on the record.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, it may be that my learned friend could make an admission that the document contains correct information. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  Perhaps if that document might be entered into evidence under seal as, I think, Prosecution Exhibit 68. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal, P. 68. 
(Exhibit No. P. 68 admitted, under seal)
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Issa very helpfully invites me to invite the witness to sign the document.  It's already been admitted, but perhaps for completeness, it can be formally signed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you sign the document, please?  And can you date it today, the 30th of August, 19 -- I'm sorry, 2005? 

Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps my learned friend for the Defence can see that. 

Thank you, Mr. Issa. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us, please, in what year you remember starting your present occupation? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I suppose that's technically the correct answer to the question.  What is the year that you started your present occupation? 
A.	I began in **********. 
Q.	As part of your occupation, do you encounter students at the university of Butare? 
A.	I could meet them. 
Q.	As part of your occupation, do you encounter students who are at the medical faculty of the university of Butare? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know a man named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I do know him, even if it has been sometime since we have met. 
Q.	Was he a student at the university of Butare? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you remember what he was studying? 
A.	He attended the faculty of medicine. 
Q.	Can you remember in approximately what year he first attended the university to study medicine? 
A.	He attended the faculty of medicine from 1974 until he went to do his internship that concluded his studies. 
Q.	When Rwamakuba studied medicine, were you in your present occupation or not? 
A.	At the time he went to do his internship, I hadn't yet began to work and I was at the university, very near the hospital where he lived.  I could go there and **************************. 
Q.	How long was Rwamakuba a member of the university?  Can you help us with that, please? 
A.	He spent six years at the university because doctors studied for six years and then the seventh year is devoted to the internship. 
Q.	Can you remember which year was his final year as part of the internship? 
A.	I don't remember very well the year in question. 
Q.	Where was the internship taking place? 
A.	At the university hospital in the various departments -- gynaecology, internal medicine, et cetera, 
	et cetera. 
Q.	When he did his internship at the university hospital, were you in your present employment or not? 
A.	It's not the case because I'm not sure that -- when I began to work in *********, he was already doing his internship.  But I did often go to their residence at the university, and if you go there, you'll see. 
Q.	Why would you often go to the student residences before you began your present occupation? 
A.	We would go to the student residences and ***************************.  I wasn't the only one to undertake *********************, there were others. 
Q.	Did you ************* for Rwamakuba? 
A.	No, I did his colleagues' **************.  I remember there was one Canisius, who is in the same cohort -- the same class.  I remember also Gatarayiha and Karemera.  They had different rooms, but were all residing -- lodging at the same place. 
MR. HOOPER:
Could we have spellings please for those?  Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You've mentioned some names about people who were in lodging with Rwamakuba.
MR. MORLEY:
	Perhaps if the sadly absent Mr. Mjui might be able to help us with a piece of paper or someone -- I look to the helpful registrar.  Could a piece of paper be placed in front of the witness with a pencil?
THE WITNESS:
	Okey-doke --
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Well, okey-doke then.  

Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?  What we would like, please, is the spellings in capital letters of the colleagues you have mentioned who were in lodgings with Rwamakuba when he was a student.  Can you do that for us? 
A.	I have made a list of the people whose names I remember. 
Q.	Thank you.  Perhaps if I might see that.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps my learned friend defending and then Their Honours, please.

It appears the witness wants to add another name; is that right? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  There is a name, that is the name Gatarayiha.  I want to add the name Frodouald to that. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if you might do that, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
Once that's done, would it be possible to photocopy that and circulate it a little later and move on?   I'm not -- the names are not particularly relevant at this stage. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, we'll help with that. 

Yes, thank you.  If my learned friend may see the list and then Their Honours, please. 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if -- Mr. Morley, would it be possible for you to just read those names into the record in your best Kinyarwanda, of course. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, that's the problem. 
With Your Honours leave, I'll read the names on to the record without spelling them. 
The first name is Karemera, Alphonse.  The second name is Gater -- Gatarayiha, Frodouald.  The third name is Mungwakuzwe, Canisius.  And the name is, Nsengiyumva, Jean. 

Perhaps if this document might be looked after by the helpful usher for the moment.   
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	All right, now.  How often would you meet the young Rwamakuba when he was a student when you ************************************* for his colleagues? 
A.	I saw him more than 10 times. 
Q.	Over what period of time?  A month, a year, several years?  Help us with the time frame over which you met the student, Rwamakuba? 
A.	Between one and two years, I would say. 
Q.	Apart from when you would **************************************** for his colleagues, did you see him at the faculty of medicine? 
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me, Mr. Morley, I know, knows a leading question before he speaks it; that was a leading question. 
MR. MORLEY:
I understand my learned friend's sensitivities, Your Honour, but having established that he was a medical student who had been an intern at the faculty of medicine --
MR. HOOPER:
You needn't compound it with the witness listening, please. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps the witness might take off his headphones. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, (inaudible) to occupy us.  I'm saying it's too simplimatic (sic) to occupy us as an argument.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very well.
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you see Rwamakuba in any other place other than when you did some ***************************** with his colleagues? 
A.	I saw him at the university -- in the university buildings, that is where his main place of work was.  He was a student. 
Q.	When he was a student, did you have any conversations with him or did you simply see him? 
A.	I did not speak with him when he was a student, but I knew him physically.  I knew his name and I could see him around.  I never spoke with him. 
Q.	After he was a student and before the events of the genocide of 1994, did you at any stage see him between his being a student and the later events of 1994? 
A.	When he finished his studies, he did not work at the university hospital.  I never saw him again.  I only saw him again during the genocide when he was carrying out dastardly acts. 
Q.	Before the genocide and after he was a student, did you learn anything about Dr. Rwamakuba's politics? 
A.	Before the genocide, at one point there was unrest in which Tutsis were chased away from the university, and Rwamakuba took active part in that.  What is more, before the genocide, there were rallies in which he took part.  That was in 1993 and 1994, and during these rallies, Hutus were encouraged and urged to kill the Tutsis.  Interahamwe or, if the truth be told, Hutus -- it's all the same, that is how the (Inaudible) was understood at the time. 
Q.	Taking that in stages, please, can you remember when it was that there was the unrest at the university that you've just told us about, in what year? 
A.	It was before the taking of power by Habyarimana.  It was between '93 and '94.  I beg your pardon, 1973. 
Q.	All right.  Well, that's an event a long time ago.  Can I turn to the rallies you've told us about.  When were the rallies taking place? 
A.	I saw him when he was returning from -- from a rally that had been organised in Nyakizu.   When they returned, they went to have a drink at a place called Dancing.  He was with Kanyabashi and when I saw them, they were boasting about the fact that they were preparing training for MDR Power.  They were preparing to create MDR Power and that this new party would attack the Tutsis. 
Q.	We'll take that in stages.  When was it that you saw Rwamakuba at Dancing Bar, can you give us the year? 
A.	It was in 1993? 
Q.	Can you write down on the same piece of paper that the registrar is looking after, the name of the place where you think the rally took place?  You're going to get the piece of paper in a moment; Mr. Mjui is poised to move.  When you have finished writing down the name of the place where the rally was held, can you please write down the names of the people that you saw Rwamakuba with at Dancing Bar? 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, wouldn't it be quicker for the witness just to say what he has to say and then if there's a problem with the spelling, we can -- we can go back to it. 
MR. MORLEY:
I'm only anxious to satisfy my learned friend, Mr. Hooper's need for spellings. 
THE WITNESS:
I finished. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps my learned friend would want to see this. 

MR. HOOPER:
Well, again, could it be photocopied and we can come back to it -- I'll come back to it.  
MR. MORLEY:
You'll want to see this. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right. 

Well, I'm not that interested in it, actually.  Can it just be photocopied and provided to us? 
MR. MORLEY:
I might have the document back for a moment. 
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we move, though, from this, can Mr. Morley be good enough to indicate whether he was on any notice that this was going to be done or these names were going to be given or these details were going to be given, because we've had no notice of it. 
MR. MORLEY:
Neither have I -- of the names. 
MR. HOOPER:
Which -- which means that there's questions being asked to which there's no -- the answers are not known and of course which we have no notice. 
MR. MORLEY:
I was expecting a name, not six, and one of those names is of interest.  Now, I invite my learned friend to look at the list again. 
MR. HOOPER:
If you want to draw the point out, draw it out.  I don't need the list. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	One of the names you have written down as being at Dancing Bar with Rwamakuba in 1993, after a political rally, is Habimana, Athanase.  Do you recall writing that name? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Is that someone you knew or were able to recognise in 1993? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the document might be taken back by the registrar for the moment. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Did you see Rwamakuba at Dancing Bar -- you yourself with your own eyes or not? 
A.	Yes, I saw him with my own eyes. 
Q.	How did you know that person you saw with your own eyes was André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him and since I knew him before, I recognised him. 
Q.	You've told us you heard what they were speaking about, did you yourself speak to Rwamakuba? 
A.	I did not talk with him.  I was not a member of his -- of their party, but when I was moving around, I could see what they were about. 
Q.	Before the genocide took place, was there any other occasion on which you saw Rwamakuba? 
A.	I went to Huye stadium where a rally had been organised and I saw him there.  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, before we move from the -- from the Dancing Bar, could we have a date or an approximate date for that, please?  
MR. MORLEY:
We've got 1993, if you want more, I'll ask. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can you, please?
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you give us some idea of what time of the year you saw Rwamakuba at the Dancing Bar?  Was it early, mid or late 1993? 
A.	It was towards the end of 1993; however, I cannot remember the exact date. 
Q.	You mentioned a moment ago seeing Rwamakuba at a place called Huye; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When was this?  Can you give us the year, please? 
A.	It was January 1994, since rallies were still being organised at that time. 
Q.	What sort of rally was it? 
A.	It was a rally for -- at which participants were preparing the creation of the MDR Power wing. 
Q.	Were you at that rally yourself or is it something you simply heard about? 
A.	I was in town and since there were -- there was -- there were no specific controls or checks, people could go to places where rallies had been organised.  So I went to this rally. 
Q.	Was Rwamakuba there? 
A.	Yes, he was present.  Other people whose names I do not remember were also present. 
Q.	And what was the rally about? 
A.	During that rally, it was being said that they should unite their efforts to fight the enemy, that is, the Inyenzi. 
Q.	At that rally, how is it that you saw there, Rwamakuba? 
A.	He had taken up a position in a place that was reserved for distinguished persons, and from time to time, these persons would get up to address the people.  But I must say, that I did not stay till the end of the rally. 
Q.	Among the distinguished persons who got up to address the rally, was Rwamakuba one of them or not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how do you know that that person addressing the rally was Rwamakuba? 
A.	I recognised him.  You know, I knew him from when he was at university, so I knew his face.  I could recognise him on sight.  I could recognise him on another occasion if I had seen him.  I could see him, so on that occasion I recognised him. 
Q.	Do you think you would recognise him today? 
A.	I cannot be 100 per cent certain that I'm able to recognise him now given the time that has gone by.  However, I do remember that at the time he wore glasses. 
Q.	All right.  Now --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you reached your point -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I'm about to say, with Your Honour's leave --
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry to interrupt.  I am interrupting, I'm sorry.  But just -- just before -- it may be a housekeeping matter you're raising.  But can I again just invite Mr. Morley as to whether he had any notice -- anything was going to be said about a meeting in Huye, because it's the first that we've had any notice of it?  
MR. MORLEY:
No, I haven't had notice of a meeting in Huye.  I had anticipated a different answer. 

I propose next, Your Honour, to take matters to what's directly relevant to the Tribunal.  Perhaps this is a convenient moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I think I should just comment at this stage -- yes, thank you for the warning. 

Mr. Witness, well, in fact, I could excuse the witness at this stage. 

Mr. Witness, we are about to take our luncheon adjournment until 2 o'clock or five minutes past two.  During the adjournment -- during this adjournment as any other adjournment while you're still a witness, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand me? 
THE WITNESS:
Right, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may now leave for lunch and we will resume just after 2 o'clock this afternoon. 

THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the witness's microphone be put off, perhaps?

Issa, can you turn off the witness's microphone, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, it's -- I should not have to make the comment I'm going to make, but as this is not an isolated instance, I should remind you that the rules of the Tribunal envisage that notice is given of testimony that is intended to be led. 

Secondly, if the witness gives an answer which is different to a prior statement the witness has made, well, notice of that should also be disclosed. 

I'm not making any orders at this stage, but I think I should say this at this time because it's an issue which, as I mentioned, it's not the first time it has arisen. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, I'm fully aware of the concern that the Tribunal and my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, will have.  On the subject of the stadium, which was new, I had anticipated there might be an objection from my learned friend, Mr. Hooper.  There not being one, I proceeded to ask questions. If that was my mistake, I apologise for it.  One of the difficulties -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, there is another concern with your remark, that you anticipated a different answer. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, I did. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's also a concern which suggests that there had been a prior inconsistent statement. 
MR. MORLEY:
There is.  The difficulty is that, as Your Honour may readily appreciate, the evidence which is elicited before the Tribunal is what the witness says on the stand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We understand that. 
MR. MORLEY:
And it's, I hope, as it were, not my function to resolve what I can see are inconsistencies.  I anticipate Mr. Hooper will be doing a lot of that shortly. 

My function, as best I understand it, is to try and get the witness to tell his story subject to objection from Mr. Hooper and also conscious of the notice requirements.  Insofar as anything emerges during the course of a witness's testimony which concerns my learned friend, he is, of course, invited to raise an objection.  There not having been one and being alive to the reality of the nature of these witnesses who come before Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, who may not be particularly well versed in narrative storytelling, I anticipate there will be many occasions when Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues hear information from the witness, which nobody's heard before.  And it is a problem.  But the difficulty from my perspective, as I stand before Your Honour, is I'm simply trying to get the witness to tell us what he knows.  Insofar as it becomes a bit inconsistent, my learned friend will cross-examine on it, and insofar as there is insufficient notice, my learned friend is very welcome to object. 

If I blundered into eliciting information, which my learned friend is concerned about, I apologise.  I can only make the observation that I was waiting for Mr. Hooper's objection and didn't hear it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.
MR. HOOPER:
I don't think we have to -- it's not a battle.  If you feel an objection coming on it's probably quite a good moment to consider the position.   
MR. MORLEY:
We've both been on opposite sides of the fence here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not necessary to carry on anymore on this issue. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My only comment is that I -- people do blunder from time to time, that's normal.  But I expect counsel to respect the rules of practice and procedure and -- and to be on their honour when they're on their feet at the bar table.  

So I think we can take the adjournment now.  I don't think it's necessary for me to make any orders or make any comment or many, any --
MR. MORLEY:
(Microphones overlapping)
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- call for a judgement -- 
MR. MORLEY:
No.

MR. PRESIDENT: 
And I don't wish to do that. 
MR. MORLEY:
All -- all I would leave Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues with is the thought is -- this is a problem which is going to arise a lot. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the recess now.  

I think that we should have our 90 minutes, so we will come back at quarter past two. 
(Court recessed at 1244H)
(Pages 16 to 34 by Jean Baigent)



























(Court resumed at 1431H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can now resume the afternoon session.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave, Your Honour will recall before lunch Mr. Hooper asked for copies of the document which has been written upon.  I can help.  Perhaps with the help of Mr. Issa, I can invite the witness to have the document back and I can distribute copies for Your Honours and for my learned friend.  

I have the document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can I ask you to look at the document again, please.  You will see there you've written a name called -- 
MR. MORLEY:
And for Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues, it's the third name up from the bottom of the list.  It's a Dr. Munyemana, Sosthène.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Do you see that name that you've written?
A.	Yes, I've seen the name.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And may the interpreters be served with the list, please.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Apart from the occasions -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Apart from the occasion at the Dancing Bar, did you see Dr. Rwamakuba in the company of Dr. Munyemana, Sosthène, on any other occasions prior to the genocide? 
A.	Yes, there was another occasion. 
Q.	And where was that? 
A.	I saw them together at the Dancing Bar.
Q.	Where in relation to the university or the medical faculty is the Dancing Bar?  Is it near?  Is it far?  Give us some idea of where it is. 
A.	Between the Dancing Bar and the faculty of medicine, there is a distance that can be covered in 30 minutes.  
Q.	Is that in a car?  Is that on foot?  
A.	The 30 minutes will be used to cover the distance on foot.  
Q.	Did you see Dr. Rwamakuba with Dr. Munyemana on that other occasion or is that something you were told? 
A.	I witnessed their presence on two occasions.  
Q.	You've told us about an occasion at the Dancing Bar when there were a number of people, and you've told us that that was in late 1993.  When was this other occasion when you saw Dr. Rwamakuba at the Dancing Bar with Dr. Munyemana?  Can you give us the year? 
A.	I told you that that was at the end of 1993. 
Q.	I'm asking about the other occasion.  You've told us about an occasion towards the end of 1993 when Dr. Rwamakuba was at the Dancing Bar with six other people.  Now, I'm asking not about that occasion, I'm asking about the other occasion when you saw Dr. Rwamakuba at the Dancing Bar with Dr. Munyemana.  Do you understand what I'm asking about? 
A.	Yes, I have understood the question.  
Q.	Can you help us with when that other occasion was, in what year, for example? 
A.	That was in the month of January 1994. 
Q.	All right.  Now, can I turn, please, to the events of the genocide.  

During the genocide did you at any stage see Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	During the genocide I saw Rwamakuba for the first time when he came to attend a meeting of government members.  And he was amongst the members of government.  
Q.	During the genocide how many times did you see Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him twice.  
Q.	In what location did you see him the first time? 
A.	I saw him for the first time when he came to attend a meeting that was held in the faculty of medicine, and they had come to sensitise the people and to incite them to carry out the killings.  
Q.	The faculty of medicine of which university, please? 
A.	I'm referring to the faculty of medicine of the Butare university. 
Q.	On the other occasion when you saw Dr. Rwamakuba, what was the location where you saw him, please? 
A.	On the second occasion, I saw him when he came to the maternity.  He came with a vehicle that was transporting people that were going to be executed.  I, myself, was taken in that vehicle, but I was able to escape and take flight since I knew the premises.  
Q.	You described an occasion when Dr. Rwamakuba was seen by you at the maternity.  The maternity of what? 
A.	I'm referring to the maternity of the university hospital.  
Q.	When had you arrived at the hospital during the genocide?  Can you remember? 
A.	I got there between the 21st and the 22nd.  I got there on one of those dates -- those two dates. 
Q.	The 21st or 22nd of which month? 
A.	Either the 21st or the 22nd of April, 1994.  
Q.	Why did you go to the hospital on around the 21st or 22nd of April of 1994? 
A.	This was due to the killings that were taking place in Butare town, in particular, in my secteur of residence. 
Q.	Killings of who? 
A.	The Tutsis were those targeted by the killings.  
Q.	When you got to the hospital on the 21st and 22nd of April, were there any other people there? 
A.	I found some Tutsis who had sought refuge there.  There were also the staff members of the hospital.  
Q.	Can you help us with approximately how many Tutsis you saw after you arrived on around the 21st or 22nd of April, seeking refuge at the hospital? 
A.	As soon as I arrived there, I found about 30 persons, including children, women, and men.  
Q.	Without saying any names, can you remember the names of any women who were refugees at the hospital? 
A.	Yes, I can remember certain names.  
Q.	With the piece of paper which is still in front of you, if you'd turn it over so that you have a blank piece of paper again, can you write down, as best you remember it, any names of women refugees you recall being at the hospital.  
A.	Okay.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I see that the witness has put his hand in the air.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, you wish to attract my attention.  What do you want to say?  
THE WITNESS:
When we're talking about women, does this mean that we want to talk about all the female present?  Am I also going to mention the names of girls? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley could answer that. 
MR. MORLEY:
Mr. Morley won't answer it.  Perhaps he'll refine his question.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	The names of grown women, adult women, not little girls.  Adults, please.
A.	Well, I've been able to jot down three names. 
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if I might see those, please, then my learned friend defending, then Their Honours.  

Perhaps the witness might have the names back.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Do you have their first names?  
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	No, don't mention their first names.  But do you remember them?  If you don't, that's fine.  I'm simply asking if you remember any first names and, if you do, could you write them down.  
A.	I -- I can't remember their second names except that of ***********.  
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  
MR. MORLEY:
Perhaps if the document might be shown to my learned friend defending and then Your Honours. 

Perhaps if the witness might have the document back.  

His hand is in the air, Your Honour, I see again.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Yes, Mr. Witness?  Did you wish to address a question to me?  
THE WITNESS:
I remember the other ladies who had taken refuge there, and I believe that those women *************************.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you.  Do you want to please write down what you remember of those people's names on the same document in front of you.  
A.	I'm done.  
MR. MORLEY:
If I might see the document, then my learned friend, then Your Honours.  

Yes, thank you.  Perhaps if my learned friend might be shown the document.  

Perhaps if the witness might have the document back, please.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, with your assistance, it may be that the first three names we won't need to look at again.  But the others we may need to look at, the other four names you've written down.  

Do you understand what I've said? 
A.	Okay.  
Q.	You've told us you arrived at the hospital sometime between the 21st and the 22nd of April.  You've also told us there came a time when there was a pickup truck at the hospital.  What I'd like to ask you is how long was the time period between your arrival at the hospital on around the 21st, 22nd of April and the arrival of the pickup truck, how many days or weeks or whatever, please.  
A.	The pickup truck arrived two weeks after I got there.  
Q.	Who was it, can you remember, who came in the pickup truck? 
A.	You had Interahamwe in the car, including Rwamakuba and Athanase Habimana. 
Q.	Apart from Rwamakuba, Athanase, and Interahamwe, are you able to tell us if there were any others? 
A.	The driver of the pickup truck.  So the driver's name is Theogene, and he was Athanase's elder brother.  His full name is Theogene Halindintwali.  
MR. MORLEY:
Does my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, leap to his feet and ask for a spelling? 
MR. HOOPER:
I don't want to slow things up, but it's for the record. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
And it may be the -- the interpreter can provide it.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very happy to oblige.
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Can you write down the spelling of the driver who's the older brother of Athanase? 
MR. HOOPER:
Does he need to write it down, is my suggestion?  Can't he just utter it? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, my own experience is it's probably quicker to write it down.  I'm in Your Honour's hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, let him say it.  It will help the court reporters. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you spell the name of Athanase's older brother, please.  
A.	All right.  H-A-L-E-N-D-N-T-W-E-L-E -- correction, it is H-E-L-I, instead of "E," N-I -- N-D-I-N-T-W-A-L-E. 
MR. MORLEY:
As I was saying -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could somebody pronounce that again, please.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Halindintwali.  
MR. MORLEY:
First name?  
THE WITNESS:
Theogene is his name.  

"Theogene" is spelled T-H -- T-H-E-O-G-E-N-E, Theogene.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  We're all grateful for that. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Anybody else arrive with the driver, the Interahamwe, Dr. Rwamakuba, and Athanase? 
A.	Actually, there were very many of them.  As a refugee I didn't really pay much attention to these people.  I was able to see them on that occasion, and I know that they came to the hospital several times.  
Q.	When you saw this pickup truck arrive with very many people, some of whom were Interahamwe, what did you do? 
A.	What I did, as someone who had come to the hospital -- what could I do?  I had just come to the hospital to hide.  They came.  They searched the entire hospital.  They took a few people, including me.  They took us away, and they told us that they were taking us to a safer place.  But at one point I was able to escape.  This was a place ********************************************************************, so I was able to escape.  
Q.	When you were at first caught and before you escaped, how close to the pickup truck were you led? 
A.	I was a little above the maternity in the surgery ward, **************.  
Q.	Can you describe in terms of a distance, perhaps by reference to anything in this court or the size? 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  Could I interrupt?  

I'm sorry.  My friend's leading the witness and indicating what he anticipates the evidence is.  Well, I haven't had the benefit of hearing this evidence.  He should just ask the witness to describe what happened.  We don't need words like "led to" or "how close to."  The witness hasn't indicated anything like that.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Before you fled, where was the pickup truck in relation to you? 
A.	I was about 15 metres away.  
Q.	Who was in charge of making people get onto the pickup truck? 
A.	These were leaders of the Interahamwe, including Rwamakuba.  It is Sosthène Munyemana, who was also with the group as well, although I forgot to mention him earlier.  
Q.	Where had Sosthène Munyemana come from? 
A.	I saw him with the group, but he was a gynaecologist at the maternity of the hospital.  I do not know whether he was coming from the maternity.  However, I did see him standing next to the pickup with the group. 
Q.	Well -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Again, can my friend indicate that that was not somebody who's ever been mentioned in any context like this before?  
MR. MORLEY:
The name has certainly appeared before. 
MR. HOOPER:
That is not a direct reply.  Can my friend indicate it's never been suggested, this -- this name, participated at the hospital in the genocide itself or was present on this occasion before?  
MR. MORLEY:
The name hasn't appeared in relation to this occasion in the hospital, but the name has appeared before.  My learned friend knows that. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm -- I regret that my friend isn't able to bring himself to give an adequate reply.  In my submission I have a will-say statement dated last Friday in which this person's name appears for the first time, the will-say statement compiled by Mr. Morley, in which the one reference I've got is in relation to previous visits to the university during a period of multipartyism, he would meet Dr. Munyemana, Sosthène.  That's the one and only reference, nothing at all to that person, that doctor participating in any way during the genocide itself, no reference to his being party to the attempted abduction of this witness.  

And can my friend concede that that's the case, or is it something he anticipated this witness was going to say in evidence?  Because, if that's the case, I haven't had even the notice of the will-say about it.  
MR. MORLEY:
The name also appears in the document handwritten by the witness this morning.  And my learned friend is right.  I've had no notice about the participation of Munyemana, Sosthène, along with others, on that particular occasion at the hospital.  
MR. HOOPER:
And the document that was tendered this morning with the list had nothing to do with events at the hospital during the genocide.  Am I right in saying that?  And, if so, can I invite Mr. Morley just to say quite bluntly this is the first time this witness has ever said anything like that to anybody.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's the first time he's mentioned that doctor on that occasion at the hospital.  I hope that satisfies my learned friend.  

And if I might turn --
MR. HOOPER:
It's not a question of satisfying me, it's a question, in my respectful submission, of discharging responsibilities and being direct.  And your previous answers were not direct.  They were evasive. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Gentlemen, I think the record has already been straightened out sufficiently.  It's not necessarily for, you know, personal issues to be mentioned at this stage. 
MR. HOOPER:
Now, I apologise to the Court and to -- and to Mr. Morley if I sounded a little overvexed.  I'm sorry.  
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Were there any other doctors among the group that evening -- or, that day at the hospital? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must say that, Mr. Morley, in the end, in the end, I thank you for your frankness with the Court. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  With Your Honour's leave, may I ask the question to the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You've told us about a Dr. Munyemana being part of the group.  Were there any other doctors who were part of the group, apart from Drs. Rwamakuba and Munyemana, from what you saw? 
A.	Those were the only ones I was able to see on that occasion when they took people away, apart from Dr. Munyemana and Dr. Rwamakuba. 
Q.	How do you know Dr. Rwamakuba was one of those people who were part of the group? 
A.	I saw him with my own eyes.  He was part of the group.  
Q.	What was he doing when you saw him with your own eyes as part of the group? 
A.	He was making people get into the vehicle.  He was giving instructions to the Interahamwe to the effect that they were to make people climb into the van. 
Q.	When you gave your answer a moment ago, you were moving your hands in describing what Dr. Rwamakuba was doing.  Can you show Their Honours the hand movements you remember on the part of Dr. Rwamakuba.  
A.	He would lead them to the vehicle.  Since some were seriously wounded in the legs, so he would raise them and throw them into the van.  
Q.	At what distance did you see Dr. Rwamakuba doing this? 
A.	From where I was standing, there were 15 minutes (sic) --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter understands. 
THE WITNESS:
-- between where I was and where the vehicle was.  I could also -- or, go up and look through the windows of the building.  
MR. MORLEY:
Let's just -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, could you describe again the distance to which you just referred.  
THE WITNESS:
Actually, it was 20 steps from where I was to where the vehicle was.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Twenty steps," repeats the witness.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	By reference to anything you can see in the courtroom, can you indicate what the distance of 20 steps was, to your recollection?  Look around the room and help us by picking a point.  
A.	Yes, I could.  If I compare both distances, the distance was equal to the one between this concrete building and the external parking lot outside where vehicles are parked.  
Q.	Okay.  However, you were pointing.  What were you pointing at to reflect the distance?  We could all see it, but what we saw isn't written down.  Can you point and then say what you're pointing at.  
A.	I wanted to explain that I was referring to the distance outside.  Let us suppose that there is a corridor on the outside, so I was pointing my finger at or towards the outside of this building.  
Q.	If you look around the room, you can see to your left the room extends down to some booths at the back.  Do you see those? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, don't -- don't lead the witness.  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm not leading.  I'm trying to get the witness to have a look at the room. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but you're pointing at a specific location in the room. 
MR. MORLEY:
But I'm -- Your Honour is right.  I see the point.  Forgive me.  Yes.  Yes.  

BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Just take a moment to look around the room.  Do you understand what I've said?

Now -- 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	To give us some idea of what you mean by 20 steps, are you able to point to any person or item of furniture within the room from where you are sitting which represents the distance between you and where you saw Dr. Rwamakuba by the pickup truck? 
A.	I think the distance was equal to the one that is between the back of the room and the entrance door to the room, the two ends of the room, if you will.
Q.	That's helpful.  Thank you.  

Now, over what period of time did you observe Dr. Rwamakuba by the pickup truck? 
A.	If I take the 20th of April as a reference point, I would say I had spent two weeks there.  It was in the month of May.  We were no longer in the month of April of -- we were in the month of May at the time.  
Q.	It may be my fault, clumsy question perhaps.  

When you observed Dr. Rwamakuba over the distance you have described, for how long were you able to observe him? 
A.	I was afraid, so I could not monitor all of Rwamakuba's movement.  I think I saw him for five minutes.  
Q.	Was it daytime or night-time? 
A.	It was towards nightfall.  It was between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. 
Q.	Can you describe the quality of the lighting?  When you say it was between 5 and 6 p.m., can you help us with how much or how little daylight there was? 
A.	Dusk was approaching.  You know, towards the end of the day when nightfall is coming, you know what sort of light there is.  
Q.	How do you know the person at the pickup truck was Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him when we were led to the vehicle.  I saw him with my own eyes, especially as Athanase worked at the maternity as a cleaner.  I was a member of the group that was taken to the vehicle.  When I got near him, I realised that it was he, that it was Rwamakuba who was waiting for his partners -- or, his -- or, the killers, if I can put it that way.  
Q.	When you say "when I got near him," what do you mean?  
A.	This means that people were being made to get up into the vehicle.  We were all frightened.  
Q.	What is the nearest distance you came to the man you say was Dr. Rwamakuba? 
A.	Between Rwamakuba and me, there was a distance equivalent to where I am and that window I'm pointing at.  

MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will recall the witness was pointing at the window in the back of the court, to Your Honour's right.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Could you hear anything that Rwamakuba was saying? 
A.	He was giving people orders to make the people get in quickly.  That is what I heard Rwamakuba say.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I pause because I know that Your Honour has initiated some sort of enquiry.  Did 
Your Honour wish me to continue?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, it does not interfere with your examination at this stage.  I am aware that there exists a scale drawing of the courtroom, and I was asking the registrar if he had access to it. 
MR. MORLEY:
I thought Your Honour might be doing that.  Thank you.  
(Pages 35 to 45 by Ann Burum)























1530H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Can you remember anything of what Rwamakuba was wearing?  
A.	He was wearing normal civilian dress.  I know that he was also wearing a jacket. 
Q.	Where did you then hide after you fled? 
A.	Actually, at the hospital, I had three hiding places.  I went to a place behind the morgue.  There was also another person who was being hunted down who was with me.  On other occasions, I would go and hide in rooms in the surgery ward.  Actually, in the shower stalls.  It was not the first time, actually, that I had managed to escape from them. 
Q.	Apart from the occasion when you were being led to the pickup, on that afternoon, was there any other occasion when you saw Rwamakuba? 
A.	I did not see him. 
Q.	Did you see what happened inside the hospital? 
A.	As one who had spent 30 days there, I witnessed many things. 
Q.	I am asking about that afternoon when Rwamakuba and others arrived with the Interahamwe.   On that afternoon, did you see what happened inside the hospital? 
A.	Yes, I talked to you about that evening when you referred to the afternoon.  I wonder if you are talking about the 2 p.m. or 3 p.m.  Maybe it would be good for you to give me more ample information thereon. 
Q.	Well, all depends on how you define afternoon or evening.  At around the time that the people came to the hospital in the pickup, did you see what happened?  Whatever time it was, whether you call it the evening or afternoon, did you see what happened inside the hospital buildings? 
A.	Yes, people were asked to produce their identity cards, and when it was seen that some people had Tutsi identity cards, their identity cards were confiscated.    It was from a group comprised of civilians as well as soldiers.  They complemented each other when they carried out the operation. 
Q.	Did you see identity cards being asked for inside the hospital building with your own eyes? 
A.	Yes, I witnessed that with my own eyes.  Some were patients, others were patient attendants, while -- yet others who were refugees.  So, all those people were with me when they were asked to produce their identity cards.  I was there present. 
Q.  	Did you remain at the hospital overnight? 
A.	Yes, I remained at the hospital.  I didn't have anywhere else to go, so I stayed at the hospital.  Sometimes questions were put to me as to why I was staying there, but I didn't have any appropriate answer because times were hard. 
Q.	The next day, did you speak to any people about what had happened the day before?  
MR. HOOPER.
	I am sorry.  Surely my learned friend understands what a leading question is.  That was a leading question.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	No, it wasn't.  
MR. HOOPER:  
	I don't want to talk across the courtroom.  I am interested in the Bench.  In my submission, that was plainly a leading question that should not have been asked.  Well, "The next day, did you have a conversation with someone?"  If that's not a leading question, I'll stand here and eat my wig.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	The question was, "Did you have a conversation with any people?"  
MR. HOOPER:   
	"The next day"?  
MR. MORLEY:  
	But not, "Did you have a conversation with someone?"  I am in Your Honour's hand.  
MR. HOOPER:  
	I invite Your Honour to consider my diet.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Mr. Witness, where were you the next day? 
THE WITNESS: 
	The next day, for lack of anything better, I remained on the spot, but I was still afraid that these people could come and take me away, but I didn't have any choice.  So, I remained at the location.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Were you alone?  
THE WITNESS:  
	There were still some other people who were with me.  For instance, there were the ladies  I mentioned, but we did not hide ourselves at the same spot.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	But you didn't quite answer my question.  Were you alone?   
THE WITNESS: 
	Yes, I was alone.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I don't think I should go on any further.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	Your Honour sees the difficulty.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Well, I could continue, but I don't have instructions, so I think I ought to stop.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	Your Honour, yes.  If the witness might take off his earphones for a moment.  

Your Honour may sense the peculiarities emerging about questioning here.  The question, "Were you alone," can be construed as at the moment of hiding or all day.  And Your Honour won't know at the moment whether the witness answered it in the narrow sense or in the broad sense.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	That's why I stopped because, as it is, I have no instruction, and I thought it was prudent to stop at that stage.   
MR. MORLEY:  
	Perhaps if I might continue and will see if I make a mess of it.   Perhaps he might put his headphones back on. 
BY MR. MORLEY:   
Q.	Mr. Witness, the next day, you were still being at the hospital; did you remain alone throughout the day or not? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you ever talk to anyone again after the occasion of the arrival of the pickup truck and your escape? 
A.	Later, I was able to talk to one of the women who was very close to the surgery department, and the people were making comments on how I was able to escape the killers, and they said we should continue to pray, because that was the end and I had almost seen death.  I think that was what everyone was saying.  
Q.	When you used the expression "later," when is later? 
A.	That was the day following the incident. 
Q.	So the next day, is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, if you look at the list of names that you have written down of people who were refugees at the hospital, are you able to see the name of the person you spoke to the next day? 
A.	Yes, that person's name is there. 
Q.	Can you circle that name please, and then we'll see which name you circled?   
MR. MORLEY: 
	Perhaps if my learned friend might see that -- the name is marked in a rectangle -- and then Your Honours.  
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, please understand what I say next.  I do not want to know what that person said to you.  Do you understand me?  
A.	Yes, I am following you. 
Q.	Can you tell us what you said to that person? 
A. 	I told him that people had taken me along with other people, and we realised that we were going to be killed but that subsequently I asked and went to that building, for want of any other place where I could go. 
Q.	Did you say anything about who had been taking you from the hospital? 
A.	Yes, I even pointed out that I had seen one of the cleaners and that there were even doctors, especially the doctor that had undertaken his study at the university, and I also mentioned some people that I saw among the killers. 
Q.	Did you mention any names? 
A.	I told him or her that there were doctors, but I did not mention specific names, because we talked about it again later. 
Q.	I don't follow you.  What do you mean, "I talked about it again later"?  Do you mean you had a second conversation? 
A.	Yes, in the days that followed, those people were moving about when they were looking for food, and from time to time we met each other.  At least I met them at least twice. 
Q.	Who is "them"?  You've mentioned one person.  When you say "them," that seems to be more than one person.  
MR. HOOPER.  
	I thought the witness said or it was translated as, "I met him."  From time to time, "him" is, in fact, "her", of course. 
MR. MORLEY:  
	Is that right?  I heard the word "them," and it may be entirely my mistake.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I thought I heard "them" too, but perhaps the witness can be asked again.  
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	Did you talk to one person or more than one person about the events with the pickup truck?  
A.	The day following that incident, I met the person that I have indicated on that paper.  On the second occasion, I met other ladies.   I can even encircle the names of those ladies.  I also met them.  We were in the same situation and we met from time to time. 
Q.	Perhaps if you might circle the names of the other people on the second occasion of conversation.  Could you circle them rather than put them in a rectangle? 
MR. PRESIDENT.  
	Mr. Morley, my concern is the witness is giving evidence about what transpired.  Now evidence of subsequent statements which are consistent do not have any probative value.  
MR. MORLEY:   
	Your Honour is entirely right.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	If you ask him just what he said, what's the purpose of that?  
MR. MORLEY:  
	I haven't asked that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	That was your last question; that was what -- well, you can go on, but it just seems to me that if that's the purpose of your question, it has no probative value.  
MR. MORLEY: 
	It's not the purpose of the question, Your Honour, and I'm sorry if it looks that way.  What I am trying to establish is something different.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Okay.  
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Can you circle the other names of people you spoke to at the hospital? 
A.	Yes, it is the second person, and there are two persons altogether.  
MR. HOOPER:
	The danger of this list is, with respect, there may be other people who aren't on the list.  The witness has been provided with a list by the Prosecution, been told to circle those people.  There is a -- sort of some assumption, isn't there?  
MR. MORLEY:  
	With respect, my learned friend may have missed the answer the witness gave about four answers back, that he had a conversation with other people whose names were on the list.  That's why I'm asking him to circle the names on the list.  It's from the witness that the reference to the list came.  
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Have you done as asked? 
A.	Yes, I am through with it.  
MR. MORLEY: 
	Perhaps if my learned friend may see that, and Your Honours.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	I am certainly looking at the list -- how many names have been circled?  I understood the witness was going to circle a number of names.  Is that the position?  
MR. PRESIDENT.  
	Okay.  The notes I have of the evidence indicate that there were two persons all told.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	I respectfully agree.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Yes, Mr. Morley, we are going to stop at 4 o'clock.  It's five minutes to four. 
MR. MORLEY:  
	Your Honour, yes.  I'm trying to get to the end of this small section.  I'm hoping with three questions, I would have closed it.  

BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	In relation to the second conversation, you mentioned you spoke with two people.  Now, my question is, do the names of the two people you spoke with appear on that list? 
A.	Yes, the names feature on the sheet of paper. 
Q.  	In relation to the sheet of paper, it's clear that two names have got rectangles round them.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes, that's it. 
Q.	Are those the names of the two people you spoke to on the second occasion? 
A.	At first, there is the first person whom I met, and we talked on the first occasion; and the second or the other name is a person with whom I talked on the second occasion. 
Q.	To avoid misunderstanding on this particular point, and it is a very minor one, In relation to the second conversation, how many people did you speak to? 
A.	I talked with only one person on that occasion. 
Q.	Did you talk about what had happened with the pickup truck? 
A.	Yes, we talked about it, and they said they witnessed and then I started talking further on what had happened. 
Q.	When you talked further on what had happened -- 
A.	Concerning the first person, I talked to him or to her about my problem, and I did the same thing with the second person, because basically, we were facing the same difficulty of finding where to hide.  That is how we came to talk about things like that. 
Q.	When you talked to either of those two people, did you mention any names? 
A.	Concerning the first person, I told her that the people concerned were a doctor without any position.  As for the second, I talked about a doctor, I talked about Rwamakuba, about Sosthène Munyemana and about Athanase and the Interahamwe, who were in their company. 
Q.	When you said you talked to her about those people -- this may be obvious from your last answer, and I hope this is my last question before the break - did you mention to her Rwamakuba's name? 
A.	Yes, I talked to her as a person who knew him, because I knew the person in question, personally.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	That's what I was trying to get to.  I'm sorry it's taken so long, as this is a convenient moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:   
	We will have a short recess.  
	(Court recessed from 1600H to 1630H)
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, before my learned friend proceeds, can I just, for the record, raise a formal objection to the last  question that was put to this witness.  That's the answer -- that it mentioned Rwamakuba's name.  I think the question that was put was, "Did you use the name Rwamakuba?" Which, I submit, was a leading question on an important issue, and I need to object to it for obvious reasons.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	Mr. Hooper, I really thought the question was quite necessary, because in his previous answer he had made a reference.  
MR. HOOPER.  
	Yes, I take your point, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Sometime during the course of this afternoon, the registrar -- well, he had just distributed a drawing of the courtroom and a document identifying courtroom measurements.  Mr. Morley, just before you complete your examination-in-chief, perhaps you could just agree on the distance that was pointed out by the witness for the purpose of the record.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	I'm always happy to agree with the Court's measurements if Your Honour has the measurements to hand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
	I think it was delivered to us.  You don't have to respond immediately, but I think it should be done before you complete your examination-in-chief.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	Your Honour, yes.  If I turn to my learned friend - with Your Honour's leave --
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.	You mentioned earlier that during the genocide you saw Rwamakuba twice.  Did you remember saying that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	You told us about the incident with the pickup truck.  Can you remember the date upon which you saw Rwamakuba on the other occasion? 
A.	I saw him on the 15th. 
Q.	The 15th of what, please? 
A.	It was the 15th of May 1994. 
Q.	What was the circumstance of your seeing Rwamakuba on the 15th of May 1994, please? 
A.	He had come to take part in a meeting, and I saw him at the university hospital where I was. 
Q.	A meeting with who, please? 
A.	This was a meeting of members of government who had come to see whether the killings were being conducted satisfactorily in Butare. 
Q.	Can you name these other members of government that you saw on that occasion? 
A.	First, I saw Rwamakuba, whom I knew.  There was also Mathieu Ngirira.  There were other members of government, and I could see them; I was watching them through the window.  They went past in the company of doctors.  They were assessing the existing situation. 
Q.	Can you spell, please?  No, can you write down the name of Mathieu Ngirira? 
A.	All right. 
Q.	Not a fresh piece of paper, please the one that we've been working with. 
A.	 I have finished. 
MR. MORLEY:
	I might see the document, and my learned friend, and then Your Honours.  Thank you.  I might have the document back to help the stenographers spell the name Mathieu Ngirira, N-G-I-R-I-R-A.
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.  	Who else from the government did you see?  Names, please.  
A.  	There was Prime Minister Kambanda. 
Q.  	Anyone else? 
A.	I saw them as they went past.  Among them were Joseph Nzirorera, and they were escorted by gendarmes.  I could not follow them beyond ten metres.   
MR. MORLEY: 
	Your Honour, I am in the position to assist with the spelling of Nzirorera, unless Your Honour wants it from the witness.  It's not in dispute, I anticipate, unless my learned friend leaps to his feet.  It's N-Z-I-R-O-R-E-R-A. 
BY MR. MORLEY: 
Q.  	Apart from Prime Minister Kambanda, Joseph Nzirorera, any other names, please?  
A.  	There were many of them.  I estimate that there were roundabout 70 in number, but I wasn't looking at them as if I wanted to take their photograph.  Unless I were to tell you the people whom the members of government found at the university. 
Q.	Any other names, please? 
A.	I could, for example, tell you Dr. Geoffrey Gatera, who was going towards the surgery ward.  There was the dean of the faculty, Alphonse Karemera.  There was the vice-chancellor of the university Bekman Simumuyemi (phonetic).  There was the wife of Maurice Ntahobali, that is, Nyiramasuhuko.  They were in the group of people who were leading these officials. Those are all the people I remember.  
MR. MORLEY:
I tremble at the thought of the spellings.  I know for the record they ought to be on there.  I wonder if I might just look to the stenographers to see if they need the spellings or if they can make do.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	We couldn't interpret your sign.  Does it mean that you want the spellings or you can make do? 
THE ENGLISH COURT REPORTER:   
	We can make do, My Lord.  
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.  	Any other names of people in the government, please? 
A.  	I have mentioned Joseph Nzirorera, Mathieu Ngirira, Kambanda.  I was not able to find out the names of the other people, even though I knew them physically.  But I must always mention André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Did you know what, if any, role André Rwamakuba had in the government? 
A.	If my memory serves me well, then he was minister of education, but I am not completely sure about this. 
Q.	Over what distance did you observe Dr. Rwamakuba as part of this government party at the hospital? 
A.	I might estimate the distance.  In comparison, I would say that it is the distance separating me from the wall behind Mr. President. 
MR. MORLEY: 
	Your Honour can see that distance, and I would do my best to work out what that is from the plan which we've been given by the help of the registrar.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	I think the distance had already been measured.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	Your Honour, the helpful court measurement suggests that's a distance of 4.5 metres to where Your Honour sits.  So a good measure, if we add another metre, say, about six metres.  
MR. PRESIDENT.  
	Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:  
	Thank you. 
BY MR. MORLEY:   
Q.	And when you observed Rwamakuba, what were you actually doing at that point in time? 
A.	He was going round the hospital and there were wounded soldiers, and the government delegation was being told that they only treated soldiers.  They went down the corridor towards the faculty where the meeting was supposed to be held. 
Q.	What were you actually doing, you, yourself, when you observed Rwamakuba? 
A.	I was at the window, which was not far from that corridor.  I used to stand there as a matter of habit.  I wasn't doing anything in particular.  
Q.	Was the occasion in which you saw Rwamakuba during the day or during the night? 
A.	It was during the day. 
Q.	Over what period of time were you able to see him? 
A.	This happened during about five minutes, because they were walking past, they did not stop. 
Q.	Did you yourself hear anything of what was said by the government, or people within the government, at the hospital that day? 
A.	They made a statement at the meeting.  I, for my part, was not present, but some of my colleagues attended the said meeting. 
Q.	Did you learn from any of your colleagues what had happened at the meeting? 
A.	One of my colleagues, ********************************************, came back from the meeting and told me what had been said during the meeting. 
Q.	Can you write down the name of that person on the piece of paper you have? 
A.	Yes.  
MR. HOOPER:    
	It's two points.  I can't tell whether it's one name or two names, and the other thing is there is a point being reached with that list when it's quite difficult to tell which name relates to what piece of evidence.  My Lord will appreciate the transcript won't actually reveal, unless we speak the names.  There is no problem with that, as I understand.  
MR. MORLEY:  
Can I assist my learned friend.  It may be that in the best traditions of our Bar, he and I can agree once we've completed the examination-in-chief to mark the document in English with brackets for the names. 
MR. HOOPER:  
	This isn't a protected witness and why not just utter the name just to help the narrative?   
MR. MORLEY:  
	Well, that's a different point.  One remains sensitive, as I'm sure Your Honour appreciates, to identifying those who had given information about the declaration of the government from the genocide period, whether he is protected or not, formally, I anticipate Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues would be uneasy, unless it is absolutely necessary.  
MR. HOOPER:  
	As I understand it, my learned friend would know from the statement this man is an alleged Interahamwe in exile in the Congo, and so why on earth can't his name be uttered?  
MR. MORLEY:  
	As always, my learned friend, Mr. Hooper, is better informed than me.  I had no idea that that was the position with that name.  
MR. HOOPER:  
	Well, if the name I am reading is Sukisa, it appears regularly in this witness's previous statements and that's the status he gives him.  I'm sure, Mr. Morley, you know that.  
MR. MORLEY: 
	That's a nickname, and I still remain sensitive, and I am not sure what the need for reading out the name might be. 
MR. HOOPER:  
	This is a public hearing.  Is this name a protected witness? Is there any real reason for -- to have this time-consuming exercise of writing down names when there is no purpose served in it, and when I am going to cross-examine this witness, I'll name that name in any event.  

MR. MORLEY:  
	To assist my learned friend, I am happy to read out the nickname, and the nickname is Sukisa, S-U-K-I-S-A.  
MR. HOOPER: 
	Well, thank you, Mr. Morley, for that.  But the other matter is this one name or two names? 
MR. MORLEY:  
	Perhaps I should ask the witness. 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, have you written down one name or two names? 
A.	I wrote down two names, the first name and the family name, and I added the nickname.  I did say alias Sukisa.  I do not know whether that is clear. 
Q.	It is very precise.  You've given us two names, a first name and a family for one person, and you've also given us his nickname.  So, all those names relate to the same person.  Is that what you are saying or I'm wrong about that? 
A.	All three of the names refer to one and one person only.  
MR. MORLEY:  
	I hope that assists my learned friend. 
BY MR. MORLEY:  
Q.	Now, Sukisa told you something about what had happened.  What is it that Sukisa told you had been said by the government at the meeting? 
A.	He said to me, "Well, dear colleague, I am a member of the Power wing, but during the meeting they said that the Tutsis had to be exterminated, and they asked me why I had not yet killed you, but rest easy, I shall not kill you." 
MR. MORLEY:  
That is all I ask of this witness in this case.

1700H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you accede to participate in that exercise?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, certainly.  Most of my friend -- as Your Honour knows is to just type them out or we can agree to them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then the order is made accordingly.  

Would you leave the current document as it is with the registrar.  If you want to give it a current exhibit number.  I have it as P. 69, then it could be left to the registrar in its present state, and yourself and Mr. Hooper can make the -- or perhaps there could be a photocopy, but I don't know.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, what I was proposing to do was simply mark the existing document rather than create a new one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sure.
MR. MORLEY:
And my learned friend and I can put our heads together.  It will take five minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good. 

The order will be Exhibit P. 69 under seal, as marked by counsel.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Your Honour. 

I might hand the witness -- I'm sorry, Mr. Issa back the document and it will be marked at the close of business today.  

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the -- the -- a few other measurements.  The distance of the courtroom, the distance between the witness and the window to the right of the presiding Judge.  
MR. MORLEY:
If Your Honour could just give me a moment, please.  

The document records the distance from the witness to the middle of the wall of the audio-visual booth behind the Defence as being 13.2 metres. 

The document records the length of the courtroom from door curtain to door curtain as being 25 metres.  I hope that assists. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  (Microphone not activated) sorry.  The distance from the witness box to the window at the back of the court to which you pointed?  
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, that is the distance to the audio-visual booth -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes --
MR. MORLEY:
And that is a distance of 13.2 metres.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
MR. MORLEY:
So to summarise the position, Your Honour is dealing with a distance of 6 metres, a distance of 
13.2 metres, and a distance of 25 metres. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Agreed, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you have completed the questions that the Prosecutor has for you at this stage of the proceedings.  But under our rules of procedure, you will also have to answer questions put by the counsel for the Accused and he's going to question you now, and you will have to answer his questions.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you wish to ask me a question?  
THE WITNESS:
I'm beginning to have a headache.  Yesterday, I was throwing up, but I feel dizzy.  I do not know whether it would be possible to interrupt the examination and continue tomorrow, because I'm beginning to feel dizzy.  
MR. MORLEY:
May I offer a piece of information to the Tribunal.  It's right to say that yesterday morning the witness had to see the doctor, and yesterday afternoon we weren't sure whether he was ill to come to court, but as it happens, he did come to court.  We had him here for the late afternoon, if Your Honour remembers, poised in case we could start him then.  But it's right to say he was ill yesterday morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  
MR. HOOPER: 
It's also to right to say, Mr. President, that this -- this witness gave evidence in the Muvunyi case in May of this year and he was ill several times during cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it's already 5:00.  The session would not last very much longer.  We could rise for about five minutes, allow you to have a glass of water.  Would that assist you to revive so that you can continue your examination this afternoon?  
THE WITNESS:
No.  What the Defence lawyer has said to the effect that I kept falling ill, well, I don't know whether he's got any evidence or any measurement of the number of times that I fell ill, but what I am saying is that I did, in fact, feel ill, I do feel ill. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Witness, my question is not connected to the remark of Defence counsel.  We have a trial now and I'm trying to do my best to manage it as efficiently and effectively as possible.  

Now, if you have a feeling of being dizzy, it is a feeling which sometimes a short rest and some drinking water may assist to overcome.  So I'm merely suggesting that if we rose for a few minutes, and allowed you to have some water, it may revive you to a level where we can continue your testimony for approximately 45 minutes this afternoon before we break.  We're not going to be sitting very much longer, and it's unlikely that your session will last for longer than 45 minutes.  Do -- do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand you, Mr. President, but I would like to say something.  Yesterday, at -- at 3 a.m., I had to go to hospital.  Perhaps the Defence attorney feels that I'm afraid to appear before this Court.  I'm not in the least bit afraid.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But, Mr. Witness, I am not the Defence attorney and I'm -- I'm just suggesting to you that what I will propose is that we rise for a few minutes now, and I just wanted to find out from you exactly how you are feeling.  Maybe, if what you are feeling is just being dizzy then the course I propose may be sufficient to enable you to revive yourself.  And that's what I was trying to find out from you.  
What I will do now then is that we will rise for a few minutes and on our resumption, we will see whether we can proceed.  If we do proceed, we will close -- yeah, we will not be sitting longer than 45 minutes after our resumption, so I don't think there should be undue pressure on you.  We will take a short recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1705H to 1720H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Witness, I am glad to see that the short break has helped you to revive somewhat.  How do you feel now?  
THE WITNESS:
Well, I made an effort to come since that's what you wanted me to do.  You wanted me to be here, so I made some effort to be here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  As I said, we will not be here longer than 45 -- three-quarters of an hour.  

Now, Mr. Hooper will ask you some questions and you will have to answer him.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  First of all, I think it's right to say that you and I have never met before; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I think this is the first time that we're seeing each other. 
Q.	Now, we're talking about events that took place a long time ago now, 1994, but I suspect that many of the details are still there to haunt you all these years afterwards; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Because from the time that genocide really started on about the 20th or so of April in Butare, you, of course, being a Tutsi were -- were really a hunted -- a hunted man, were you not? 
A.	Yes, I was also a target. 
Q.	And I'd like to make one thing very clear because there's been several witnesses who have suggested that because I represent a man accused of genocide, that I am denying the genocide or that our team here who sit with me are denying the genocide.  I want to make it very, very clear to you that we recognise the fact of the terrible genocide that took place in your country when Tutsis, young and old, women and children, were slaughtered just because they were or were believed to be Tutsis.  And that was a terrible crime and that is wholly accepted by me and by those who work with me.  Do you understand that? 
A.	Yes, I understand. 
Q.	Now, one of the most terrible moments of your life must have been when you were caught in early May and led away -- led away with the intention of those who had caught you to put you on that pickup to drive you away and to murder you.  That must have been one of the worst moments in yours, or anyone's life, I suppose; is that right? 
A.	You are right. 
Q.	Taken away, leaving your wife and children also hiding in that hospital, perhaps never seeing them again, and all this being organised by this man that you knew, André Rwamakuba; is that right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, over the years that separate us from that terrible, terrible day for you, you've been called upon on 11 occasions that I know of to talk about what happened to you.  You gave evidence on the 14th of April of 1997 to those investigating the charges against Dr. Gatera, and you talked about events at the hospital and again in the Gatera case on the 11th of July 1997; you gave a statement to the ICTR, and I know you won't have all these dates in your mind, but I have them and the Prosecution have them and if there's anything wrong, they'll tell me, so I'm sure you can accept these dates from me.  On the 25th of November 1997, a long time ago now, eight years ago, you gave a statement to the International Criminal Tribunal here, in which you talked of a Rwamakuba, but not this one.  That's -- that's right, isn't it, you spoke about another Rwamakuba, can you confirm that? 
A.	I believe you are confusing me with your question.  Do you want to know if I gave a statement 14 times?  I do not quite understand your question. 
Q.	Well -- well, bear with me.  I'll -- I'll try and make it easier.  I'll come back to the statement -- 
A.	Are you talking specifically about the difference or the distinction between the two men?  
Q.	But I'll come back to that in detail tomorrow or the next day, whenever and we'll be able to discuss that before the Judges at some length, I'm sure, but you've given statements as I've said on -- two in 1997 and then to the ICTR in November '97 and all I'm asking you about the November '97 statement is -- and you can answer this yes or no, did you talk about a man called Rwamakuba, who was a different Rwamakuba to the one you're talking about today, yes or no? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers that question, please, and perhaps if he might take his headphones off. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, please remove your headphones.  
MR. MORLEY:
It's my respectful submission that my learned friend wants to ask about this, the witness ought to see the statement which was dated a long time ago, and there's every probability he has got very little recollection of.  My learned friend is inviting the witness to give an answer, leading from the witness the suggestion that there are two different Rwamakubas.  Now, I don't know what the answer is.  I anticipate I know the answer my learned friend would like.  But in fairness to the witness, if he's going to be reminded about what it is he said in the statement, then he, the witness, ought to be shown what it is that was said in the statement so that he can comment on who he's talking about.  At the moment, he's simply going on what my learned friend is telling him.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
I will allow the statement in its present form.  If the witness doesn't remember and he says so, then that's a different matter, but this is cross-examination. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And it goes to the root of the defence in this matter. 
MR. MORLEY:
Except that the witness is being reminded that he spoke of a Rwamakuba in this statement of the 25th of November of 1997.  He's not being shown what it is he said and he's being told that he's talking about a different Rwamakuba.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But he's been asked if it's the same person.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, he was told at first and now he's being asked. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He can say yes or no or he doesn't remember.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it's my respectful submission that the proper way to ask this question is to show the witness what he said and then to ask him or to tell him that that's a different Rwamakuba, but at the moment the witness is, in inverted commas, "entirely defenceless" because he's being referred to a document from a long time ago and being told what's in it, when he really ought to be allowed to see what's in it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There are many different ways in which this can be approached.  I don't think that this way is wrong.  If the witness doesn't remember, he can say so.  Very simple.  I permit the question.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So let me just start again.  Yes, sorry, Mr. Witness, you're back with us now.  Right.  Now, so you made two statements in the Gatera case in 1997 and in November 1997 you made a statement to the ICTR investigators, and in that statement, can you remember referring to a man called Rwamakuba?  And can I ask at this stage, merely to answer that question, yes or no or I'm not sure, whatever? 
A.	I acknowledge that in my statement that amongst the statements that I have given there's a statement that I made in respect of Rwamakuba. 
Q.	And that, I suggest, is clearly not the Rwamakuba you're talking about today; is that right? 
A.	We are talking about the same person, the same Rwamakuba. 
Q.	All right.  Well, that's even more interesting than I -- than I thought your answer was going to be.  Well, we'll come back to that and you will have the opportunity to go through that statement and what you say in great detail. 
Then you gave a statement, the fourth one, on the 6th of May 1999 about events in the hospital and your experiences.  And then you gave a statement on the 7th of December 2000 about events in the hospital and your experiences.  And then you gave a statement on the 22nd of February 2001 about events in the hospital.  And then you gave a seventh statement on the 19th of April 2001 about events in the hospital and your experiences there.  

You gave a statement on the 5th of June 2001 about a Father Kabilira, and events in the hospital.  On the 28th of June 2001, you saw the investigators and gave a statement about a man who had come to see you about Kanyabashi.  And we'll come back to that.  That was not quite on the hospital, but you saw the investigators.  

You gave another statement on the 5th of December 2001 about certain people and victims in the hospital.  That was your tenth statement.  And your 11th statement was in the course of the confirmation process that happens here when it's expected you may be giving evidence -- someone comes to see you and discusses your statement with them and you can make corrections.  So 11 -- 11 times over 11 years. 

So can you tell me this:  Why was it only on Friday last, the 26th of August, in your discussions with Mr. Morley, who prosecutes today, that you mentioned André Rwamakuba as someone who tried to abduct you and take you away from that hospital?  Why was it that you'd never mentioned that abduction, the attempt to put you on the pickup, Rwamakuba being part of it, ever, ever, ever before?  Can you help the Judges -- not me, can you help the Judges as to why that fact you're being dragged from the jaws of death, why did you only remember it on Friday?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Regarding the question that he has put to me, I would answer as follows:  I never mentioned Rwamakuba before.  Personally that is -- as far as I'm concerned, that is not the reason for exculpating him, since I saw him commit crimes.  I talked of other persons who were convicted, who were charged, because I saw them near where I lived, and to say that I did not talk about Rwamakuba is not good -- a good reason.  I could only think of him when it was the time of his trial.  He had a team.  He was working in a group who were abducting people and taking them away, unless he wants to start saying that those abductions never occurred. 
Q.	I want you to look at a list.  It's going to have nine names on it, and I'm going to invite you in due course to indicate on this list who you know and in what way.  Can this be passed up to you, please?  

In respect of your abduction, before I come back to the names, I'm wondering if you can just give me just a little bit more detail about it.  Now, you've told us this happened in -- about two weeks after you got to the hospital, so this is not April, you told us, it's in May.  You get to the hospital on the -- which date is it?  The 21st, is it, that you get to the hospital?  
A.	I told you that it was either the 20th or the 21st.  I think that is what I said when I answered that question. 
Q.	And you were at the hospital until the 6th of June and you leave following the abduction/murder of your sister; is that right? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, you're a Tutsi and your identification would have shown you to be a Tutsi? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Did you have any identification papers with you at the hospital? 
A.	I had an identity card which indicated that I was Tutsi insofar as my ethnicity is concerned. 
Q.	Did you have that with you at the hospital? 
A.	I do not have it with me at the hospital because on my way to the hospital I decided to throw it away because I knew that this was one of the things that could easily facilitate my being killed. 
Q.	So at the time that you were at the hospital, it follows that you were there without any identification papers, and that if anyone asked you for identification papers, you would have to give some excuse or story which would itself invite suspicion as to whether you were or were not a Tutsi; is that right? 
A.	That is true, all right, whether that is it or the producing of an identity card that would have made my being killed easy. 
Q.	Did you people where you had worked since ******** -- listen carefully how I put the question, please, because I don't want to reveal anything.  The institution where you worked, did the people there know that you were Tutsi? 
A.	Yeah, there were some who were aware, and there were others who weren't. 
Q.	So the position was -- well, let me ask you about the hospital.  While you were at the hospital, you didn't know who knew you were a Tutsi and who didn't; would that be right? 
A.	I have explained that certain people were aware of my ethnicity as a Tutsi, and there were others who weren't aware.  That is what I said in respect of that matter. 
Q.	But your terrible problem or quandary was that amongst those who knew -- who knew as a fact that you were a Tutsi, you weren't to know whether they were to join the killers or not.  You didn't know from moment to moment, day to day who might betray you, who might point the finger at you, identify you and lead to your death.  Would that be fair to put it like that? 
A.	You're right, Counsel.  Indeed, what explains that this is the case is that I didn't remain at that place, so you're -- you're right.  I had that as a concern. 
Q.	And during the time from the 20/21st of April until the 6th of June when you left, during that period of six or seven weeks, wandering about the hospital was a minute-to-minute risk, was it not, because you didn't know who you were going to meet, which Interahamwe you might bump into, which soldier you might bump into?  You were living from minute to minute and in fear.  Would that be fair to put it like that? 
A.	I can't -- I haven't refused or refuted anything from what you have said. 
Q.	So would it be fair to say that you spent 99 per cent of your time hiding rather than wandering around? 
A.	That's not correct, and I'll explain.  
Q.	Yes, please do.  
A.	The truth be told, I didn't remain inside the buildings.  I could go out, but I never went beyond the spot between the surgery department and the hospitalisation wards, because at certain times I needed to go look for food; I needed to go look for something to eat in the kitchen. 
Q.	And so you had your hiding place or places where you hid 24 hours a day, leaving them essentially, would it be fair to say, when you were desperate for food and desperate through thirst?  Would that be right? 
A.	I never went out because of hunger, as you say.  I would tell you that from time to time the nurses asked me to hold one article or the other which shows that from time to time I had to go out of my hiding place and be seen by people who were passing by in the vicinity. 
Q.	I'm sorry, I didn't quite -- you had to go out to hold an article.  Can you perhaps explain that to us in a little more detail, please?  I take it from what you're saying is you were helping -- helping the nurses out.  Is that the position?  
A.	Yes, I can give you examples.  ******************************, at least a majority of them, had gone to participate in looting.  Now, there were ****************** who remained at their duty places and advised me to go out from time to time and to help them.  I could therefore go out and -- and go away for some 10 metres from my hiding place. 
Q.	So you travelled about 10 -- moved about 10 metres from your hiding place? 
A.	Yes.  I didn't remain at my hiding places all the time every day.  At certain points I could leave and go outside, so far as I did not go beyond the limits of the hospital, and by this I mean the buildings of the hospital. 
Q.	But weren't the buildings themselves full of danger for you, full of people who were dangerous for you?  The danger wasn't just outside the hospital, was it?  Wasn't it inside the hospital?  
A.	Mr. President, he's talking to me about the danger and that I was facing risks, and I don't know how this will be of interest to the Tribunal if I said there were risks here and there, there was danger here and there inside and outside the hospital.  I don't see why he's overly emphasising that question. 
Q.	Well -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it's the job of the Judges here to evaluate the questions that counsel asks.  If in our view the questions that he asks do not conform with the law and the rules of practice, then we will stop him.  We don't think that he has broken the rules up till now, and you should answer the question he has asked.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, let me just -- just briefly, because I think we're going to conclude in about five minutes.  So let me just ask you this.  You've got that sheet of paper in front of you with names.  Can you just look at it, please.  May I ask you this:  Do you know if any of those names on that document are witnesses in this case, and if so, can you tell us which ones by number, reference by number only, which numbers they are? 
A.	I know these persons and what has become of them.  What I see on the list is that at one point or another I hid myself together with these persons, with some of these persons at the hospital. 
Q.	The question was, do you know if any of those are witnesses in this case? 
A.	I really do not know because I'm not responsible for contacting people who come to testify in one case or the other.  What I can tell the Chamber is that I know these persons. 
Q.	Let me ask you particularly about number 5.  Do you see number 5 there?  You may remember that you told us -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	You may remember that you told us that the day after Rwamakuba had abducted you but not put you in the pickup, you had run away when you were 15 metres from it, bolted and got away, but the day after, you spoke to that person, did you not, and they discussed those events with you? 
A.	As I said previously, yeah, that was the case. 
Q.	See, isn't it right that that person, in fact -- did you know that she had a brother at the hospital who was put on the pickup?  Did you -- do you know anything about that or talked about it since or anything like that? 
A.	At the time, everybody had his own grief, and I talked to him (sic) about what had happened to me and asked what had happened to her brother.  She is the one who can talk about it with full knowledge.  I talked to her about what had happened to me. 
Q.	See, my understanding is that that was on the 25th of April that her dead brother is put on a pickup and you're put on the pickup too with her dead brother.  Did you notice that, that you were actually put on the pickup, taken away?  You don't know anything about that, do you? 
A.	During that period I know there were incidents that occurred, but I don't have precise dates.  Furthermore, I did not set foot on the pickup.  If I had been put on board the pickup, I am certain that you wouldn't be seeing me here. 
Q.	And you say that the next day after you were almost put on the pickup but ran away, the next day you spoke to her about all that in the hospital; is that right?  
A.	I would like to remind you of this:  I talked to you about the incident as it occurred, but as to the manner in which this woman's brother was put on board the vehicle, I can't give you any explanations because the vehicle came -- or made several rounds.  I think number 5 must be aware of the circumstances under which her brother was put on board the vehicle, but we did not talk about the various events, bearing in mind that we were going to talk about these things.  So she's the one that can talk about the circumstances under which her brother was put into the car. 
Q.	Yes, but the main point is that you were on the pickup, and she left the hospital within -- well, straight away, ran down the hill towards the (inaudible) back home, back to her hill.  So she couldn't have spoken to you the next day, could she, if that was the case, if she left the same day as you were put on the pickup?  That wouldn't be right, would it? 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers that -- perhaps if the witness takes his headphones off.  There's always a difficulty here when counsel cross-examines on what previous witnesses have said, and there's usually a caution exercise, which at the very least requires that what's put to the witness is absolutely accurate.  I'm troubled by the way my learned friend has summarised the evidence of GIO and also by his last offering to the witness about the witness GIO having said that she ran away to her home hill and couldn't have been home -- at the hospital the next day.  It may be that my learned friend forgets the evidence of GIO, but under cross-examination she said that she had to go back to the hospital and was there the next day, so that when that is being put to the witness, unfortunately, it's a misremembering of the evidence of GIO.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, perhaps we can look at that over the evening, but I don't recall that as evidence at all. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 6:00 now. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yeah.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's time to take the adjournment. 

Mr. Witness, it's now 6:00.  We have had about three-quarters of an hour, as I had suggested we would, and I think it's time to take the adjournment for the evening.  

Now, as I had told you early today -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
He hasn't got his earphones on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
I had been trying to explain to you that it's now just gone 6:00, and we've had about 45 minutes, as I had suggested we would have.  So it's now time to take the adjournment for the day.  We'll resume tomorrow morning at the usual hour, quarter to nine.  

I had mentioned to you at lunchtime that during adjournments, including this adjournment, of the case while you are in the witness box, you remain a witness in the trial, so you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. MORLEY:
After the witness takes off his headphones, may I just assist with the way that my learned friend 
Mr. Hooper and I have been able to agree on the handwritten document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can excuse the witness now.  I don't think this concerns him. 

Mr. Witness, what we have to do does not concern you directly, so at this stage, I would like to excuse you from the court and permit you to leave until tomorrow morning.  You may go now. 

Yes, Mr. Morley.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, Mr. Hooper has the document and he can show it to Your Honour.  I've initialed it.  He's going to initial it.  And Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues can see how we've marked it. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Right.  Okay, well, I'll find that, and we can sort of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's related to Defence exhibits ALW.  What does that relate to?  
MR. MORLEY:
It's the handwritten document by the witness with all those names, and my learned friend was asking for categorisation and we've done that.  I'm just informing Your Honour that it's been done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, do you wish to put it in evidence now?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Yes, please, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  What would be the -- let's see.  
MR. HOOPER: 
It's not the clearest, I'm afraid.  It's a bit scribbled.  It may be -- but it can be reduced into, perhaps, type and it can be put as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sorry, what's the exhibit number, please, Mr. Registrar?  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, the next exhibit, it will be P. 69.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this required to be under seal or not?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, it does require to be under seal because some of the names on the second page are witnesses. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 69 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER: 
The ALW exhibits have been discussed and agreed, and they merely need, as I understand it, to be read in. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The record. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Who has the list?  
MR. HOOPER: 
The registry have the list.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar -- 
MR. HOOPER:
And the exhibits. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Mr. Registrar, could you just read them into the exhibits -- into the record, please.  Please read them into the record.  
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, we have received the following exhibits from Defence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Relating to Witness ALW?  
MR. HOOPER: 
ALW, yes.

MR. MJUI:
Yes, we have received the following exhibits related to the Witness ALW.  D. 104, D. 105 -- D. 104 is tick list for Witness ALW. 
(Exhibit No. D. 104 admitted, under seal) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 105 is sketch of Butare university marked to show where ALW's aunt was hospitalised.  
(Exhibit No. D. 105 admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 106 is sketch of Butare -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry to interrupt.  There's an addition.  That last exhibit also showed the positions -- I'm told there's two.  I'm sorry, I should have been quiet.  Can I sit down, please?  
MR. MJUI:
D. 106 is sketch of Butare university marked to show the location of ALW and of the two men when she witness AR killing them.  
(Exhibit No. D. 106 admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 107A and B, statement of Witness ALW as of November 13, 2003, English and French.  
(Exhibit No. D. 107A and D. 107B admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 108A and B, PV of Witness ALW given in Gatera case as of May 5th, 1998, French and English. 
(Exhibit No. D. 108A and D. 108B admitted, under seal) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 109A and B, extract from the public hearing of Witness ALW as of May 19, 1998, in Gatera case, Kynia, in brackets, Kynia.  Yes, I think it's the Kinyarwanda. 
(Exhibit No. D. 109A and D. 109B admitted, under seal) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 110 is a CD-ROM with photos taken at Butare university of July 25th, 2005. 
(Exhibit No. D. 110 admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 111, this one we have not received.  It's a photo showing the entrance to the ward where Witness ALW and her aunt were.  This we are still waiting from the Defence.  
(Exhibit No. D. 111 admitted) 
MR. MJUI:
D. 112, sketch of Butare university marked by Witness ALW to show where the vehicle was parked.  
(Exhibit No. D. 112 admitted) 

MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  I should just add that in relation to Exhibits 108 and 109, they are to be kept under seal.  That is correct, is it?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I've realised, by the way, where the missing photo is.  It's in the bundle.  We'll copy that out and let you have a copy.  Yes, there are some other exhibits, I'm told, that are under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The issue of what should or should not be under seal is also a matter which the Prosecutor has agreed to?  That was a question.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  I was looking to my learned leader.  It's her witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So that has been agreed.  That's been agreed.  Okay.  

Now we can take the adjournment until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1815H)
