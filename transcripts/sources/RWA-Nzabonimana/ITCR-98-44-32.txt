         5        Chamber this morning, please?

         6   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber II of 

         7        the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed 

         8        of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston 

         9        Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, 

        10        is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, 

        11        the 23rd of September 2002, for the continuation of the 

        12        Defence case when Prosecution counsel, Mr. Fleming will 

        13        continue the cross-examination of Witness SMR2 (DW5) in

        15        Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.

        17        Thank you, Mr. President. 

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  May 

        19        we have the appearance of the parties starting with the 

        20        Prosecution, please, if we may, for the record?

        21   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases.  I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        22        trial attorney.  I appear with Ms. Ojemeni, a trial 

        23        attorney and Ms. Marotine, case manager.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, learned counsel.  May we also have

         1        Chamber reminds her of the solemn declaration she made 

         2        last Thursday and that she should continue with her 

         3        evidence today on that same solemn declaration. Okay?

         4   THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  We were in closed session last time and we 

         6        will go back to closed session because the nature of the 

         7        evidence of this witness is such that it has got to be 

         8        heard in closed session.  Are we there?

         9        (At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Professor Hinds, your witness please?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Defence calls DMR3?

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Sorry?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: DMR3.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: DMR3.

         6   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, just for clarification from my 

         7        learned friend, is Nzirorera going to be the witness 

         8        after this witness.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, but we are planning to call 

        10        Mr. Nzirorera tomorrow, but he will be the witness after 

        11        this witness.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, suppose we finish witness -- we will come 

        13        to that.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: If we finish the witness before Nzirorera, 

        15        we will have no other witnesses.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, I see.  Okay, can we go with -- can we go 

        17        into open session after the evidence of SMR2, I think we 

        18        go into open session for as long as it will last.   We 

        19        shall see what happens.

        20   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, from what my learned friend said 

        21        before, there are other four witnesses who are here.  We 

        22        do not want to be delayed a half a day or whenever if 

        23        this witness finishes by lunch time 2:00 or 3:00 or 

        24        4:00 clock.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Mr. Nzirorera is scheduled to be our next 

        26        witness.  We met with Mr. Nzirorera and his lawyer for 

        27        the first time yesterday, we are not finished.  It's a 

        28        very complex issue that Mr. Nzirorera is testifying.  He 

        29        is not like other witnesses for all reasons the Court is 

        30        aware.  Mr. Nzirorera is scheduled for tomorrow.  We now

         1        have this witness DMR3 and that witness is here.  We 

         2        have been bringing two witnesses at a time.  We do not 

         3        have the other witness here.  We have not scheduled for 

         4        that witness to be here.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: We are just saying for example, if I don't 

         6        know exactly how long this witness will be, that is DMR3 

         7        for example in the event it turns out to be a short 

         8        witness why can't -- is it not possible to have another 

         9        witness in between before Nzirorera, so that we can move 

        10        forward.  We don't have to push Nzirorera to --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS:  I have no problems.  If the Prosecutor 

        12        would take somebody else out of turn, we can during the 

        13        lunch break, make arrangements to have another witness 

        14        here and we will take another witness in front of 

        15        Nzirorera.  We have no problems with that.  In fact, we 

        16        would prefer that.  But had scheduled Mr. Nzirorera next 

        17        but if the Prosecutor is prepared for us to move out of 

        18        turn, we will take the other witness because it will be 

        19        better for us to be quite frankly.

        20   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, we will take whatever witnesses 

        21        they take in the stand and in whatever order they choose 

        22        provided they give us reasonable notice of who is 

        23        coming.  And as if as often will happen in many, 

        24        systems, it's necessary to interpose Mr. Nzirorera, we 

        25        don't mind even breaking off the cross-examination.  And 

        26        bring back the other witnesses.  We have no objection to 

        27        that we are just anxious to keep it moving.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, we don't intend to present our 

        29        case in a disjointed way.  We will, of course, if the 

        30        Court so wishes and if the Prosecutor does not object,

         1        we would shuttle the witnesses.  We have no problem with 

         2        that.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: That's fine.  Let's see how things move.  Yes, 

         4        can the witness be brought in please?  Draw up the 

         5        curtains, he is a protected witness.  

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, could you swear the witness please.  

         7        (Declaration made in Kinyarwanda of Witness DMR3)

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness DMR3 you have just made a solemn 

         9        declaration, in case you are not familiar as to how  

        10        your evidence is going to be taken here, we will explain 

        11        a few essential elements.  You will be led in your 

        12        evidence-in-chief by the Defence who are seated, one of 

        13        them standing on this side of the courtroom.  

        14        Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        15        cross-examination by the Prosecution who are seated on 

        16        this side of the courtroom.  Also the Judges sitting in 

        17        front of you may put questions to you to clarify your 

        18        evidence, if they have such question to put to you.  If 

        19        a question put to you is not clear or you don't 

        20        understand it please say so and such a question shall be 

        21        repeated or explained.  And these are a few essentials 

        22        things that we wanted to bring to your notice before you 

        23        begin your evidence.  Professor Hinds, please.

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  Your Honour, we may 

        25        need ten or fifteen minutes to go into closed session 

        26        just to deal with some background information just to 

        27        see how far we will go because of the special 

        28        relationship between the witness and the Defendant but I 

        29        can handle it now just as what I am doing it now in open 

        30        session.

         2               first having been duly sworn, 

         3                   testified as follows:

         4                   EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6        Witness DRM3, I am going to show you a document and I 

         7        would like you to see whether you recognise the 

         8        signature at the bottom of the document attesting to the 

         9        accuracy of the document.  No, no, show it to 

        10        Ms. Ojemeni, please.

        11   THE WITNESS: The date on this document is correct and I 

        12        signed it.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we tender this document as 

        14        Defence Exhibit 21 and I ask that it be sealed.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objections?

        16   MS. OJEMENI: No objection, Your Honour.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, let the document containing the personal 

        18        particulars of the witness be admitted as Defence 

        19        Exhibit 21 and the same shall be kept under seal as it 

        20        contains the personal documents of this witness who is a 

        21        protected witness.

        22        (Exhibit No. 2 was admitted).

        23   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lords.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, Your Honour, I am going to ask a series 

        26        of questions and the answers to which I think would 

        27        reveal the identity of this witness.  I will need about 

        28        ten or fifteen minutes to deal with these series of 

        29        questions and I am requesting that we go into closed 

        30        session and then we will go into open session.

         1   MS. OJEMENI: No objection.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  We will go into closed session to enable 

         3        counsel to ask questions which have a bearing to the 

         4        witness and then we go to open session thereafter.  We 

         5        regret to members of the public, but it is necessary 

         6        that this procedure be adopted

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Registry, are we there?

         2   MR. KIYEYEU:  Yes, My Lord, we are there.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT:  Proceed.

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, I would like to recall the events surrounding 

         6        the death of your president and ask you, when did you 

         7        first learn of the death of the president?

         8   A.   I do recall quite clearly the death of the president of 

         9        the Republic of Rwanda and even the dates.

        10   Q.   Can you tell us the date and the time?

        11   A.   I learnt the death of the President of the Republic at 

        12        six in the morning, that was the 7th of April 1994.

        13   Q.   How did you learn of the death of the President?

        14   A.   I learnt about it through Radio Rwanda at news hour.

        15   Q.   Were there any details at that time given on Radio 

        16        Rwanda concerning the president's death?

        17   A.   There were no details apart from the fact that we were 

        18        informed that the accident happened whilst he was flying 

        19        in his plane.

        20   Q.   Were there any information provided to you concerning 

        21        whether there were other people who had died?

        22   A.   Yes, I learnt about it because at that time it was said 

        23        that all those who were with him in the same plane also 

        24        died.

        25   Q.   Were there any instructions or orders that were given by 

        26        the authorities to the citizens that you heard on the 

        27        radio that morning?

        28   A.   Yes, the authorities gave out instructions to citizens 

        29        and I knew about the instructions myself.

        30   Q.   What did you do after you learned about the President's

         1        death on the radio at six o'clock, if anything?

         2   A.   I woke up and started doing work here and there in my 

         3        residence.

         4   Q.   When you say you did work here and there, can you 

         5        describe to the Chamber what you were doing?

         6   A.   Yes, usually in our family each child had his or her own 

         7        chores.  We divided the chores, and on that day I woke 

         8        up and I talked to my parents about the accident that 

         9        had happened, and after a short discussion with my 

        10        parents I went to get some firewood in the compound.

        11   Q.   Did your parents give you any instructions concerning 

        12        the events that had just taken place?

        13   A.   Yes, after having learnt about the accident my parents 

        14        advised me as to what attitude to adopt on that day.

        15   Q.   What was that attitude?

        16   A.   Because we had just learnt that people should not go out 

        17        on that day, my parents asked me as well as my brothers 

        18        not to go out and to remain at home.

        19   Q.   Did there come a time when you, in fact, left your 

        20        parents' home that morning?

        21   A.   Yes, on that morning I left and went to another place.

        22   Q.   And where was that place that you went to?

        23   A.   I went to the house of my grandfather and to that of 

        24        Kajelijeli, sir.

        25   Q.   Without telling us the distances, they are the same 

        26        distances, you travelled the same distances as you had 

        27        testified to in closed session; is that correct?

        28   A.   Yes, that is correct.

        29   Q.   Now, when you got to your grandparent's home, did you 

        30        have any discussions with anyone at your grandparents'?

         1   A.   Yes, I had a conversation with certain people.

         2   Q.   Did you have any conversations with your grandparents?

         3   A.   Yes, I had a conversation with him.

         4   Q.   And, when you say "him", who did you have a conversation 

         5        with?  Is it your grandfather?

         6   A.   I had a conversation with my grandfather and my paternal 

         7        uncle, and a brother who is the son -- the grandson of 

         8        my father.

         9   Q.   And what did they tell you and what did you tell them 

        10        that morning?

        11   A.   Well, our conversation dwelt on the death of the 

        12        President of the Republic, as we heard about it that 

        13        morning.

        14   Q.   Why did you go over to their homes that morning?

        15   A.   My grandparents, well, I used to go there at any time -- 

        16        at any time when I wanted to, I went there and I do not 

        17        believe I am required to answer any questions about why  

        18        I went there because they considered me as their own 

        19        child.

        20   Q.   Now, that morning, were you able to hear any gunfire or 

        21        explosions around the time that you woke up or while you 

        22        were at your grandparents' home?

        23   A.   That morning when I was with my grandparents I did not 

        24        hear any explosions or gunfire in the area.  I didn't 

        25        hear any explosions or gunfire around the house, but we 

        26        heard explosions in the direction of Kinigi, Nkumbwa, 

        27        Butaro and Shingiro, that is, around Cyamuhuzi.

        28        

        29        Nkumbwa is spelt, N-K-U-M-B-W-A; Butaro is spelt 

        30        B-U-T-A-R-O, Butaro.  Cyamuhozi is spelt

         1        C-Y-A-M-U-H-O-Z-I, sir.

         2   Q.   You indicated, sir, that you also went that morning to 

         3        the house of Mr. Kajelijeli; is that correct?

         4   A.   Yes, I did go to his residence.

         5   Q.   And when you arrived at his residence did you see anyone 

         6        there?

         7   A.   Yes, they were there.

         8   Q.   Who did you see at the residence that morning, that is, 

         9        on April 7th?

        10   A.   I saw SMR 2, and the children, as well as the maid, the 

        11        house-help.

        12   THE INTERPRETER:  Can you hear me -- can you hear the 

        13        interpreter?

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, I can hear the interpreter; it is the 

        15        witness that I can't hear.  Your Honour, could we have 

        16        this particular answer in closed session at this point 

        17        in time so we can deal with the problem.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  There is a difficulty which could arise?  We 

        19        will therefore go into closed session and see how it can 

        20        be addressed.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay, we are now in open session.  Registry, 

         2        what is the position?

         3   MR. KIYEYEU:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We have Dr. Chamba 

         4        who is attending the Accused, Mr. Kajelijeli.  I went to 

         5        see him for his advice.  He informed me that the blood 

         6        pressure of the Accused is very high and the Accused 

         7        cannot continue with the session until maybe tomorrow 

         8        morning.  That is the position, My Lord.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.  Professor Hinds?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, Your Honour, I think that fairly well 

        11        summarises the version.  Apparently, Mr. Kajelijeli's 

        12        pressure is at the level that it is, and I don't want to 

        13        disclose it.  It is so high that the doctor feels that 

        14        immediately he has to take steps to bring that pressure 

        15        down because it may be catastrophic.  So, he wants 

        16        Mr. Kajelijeli to -- whatever he intends to do, he felt 

        17        that  he should not continue today.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Learned Counsel.

        19   MS. OJEMENI:  The Prosecution has no objection.  We are 

        20        entirely in your hands.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  I know.  Well, in the circumstances as the 

        22        Accused is not feeling well, and in the light of the 

        23        advice of the doctor who has seen him and is with the 

        24        Accused person presently, these proceedings will be 

        25        adjourned to tomorrow to enable the Accused to be 

        26        attended by the doctor.

        27        

        28        So, until tomorrow at 9:00 in the morning, these 

        29        proceedings, for the reason given, stand adjourned to 

        30        tomorrow morning.
