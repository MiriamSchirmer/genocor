JOSEPH NZIRORERA,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, we spoke about you having left on the 8th -- 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Good morning.  So when we left off, you had returned to Colonel Setako's home on the evening of the 8th of April 1994.  Can you tell us what you did on the morning of the 9th.
A.	Yes.  As I told you yesterday, after the meeting at the ESM, the higher military academy, in the evening of the 7th of April, we left.  And I went back, and it was scheduled that the following day in the morning at Hôtel des Diplomates there would be the swearing-in ceremony of members of the new government.  So the following day, that is, the 9th of April, like everybody else, I went to Hôtel des Diplomates in Kigali. 
Q.	And did you attend that swearing-in ceremony? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what did you do after that? 
A.	In fact, the ceremony which took place on the 9th of April, in the morning of the 9th of April, finished towards midday.  And a small reception, a small meeting, contact meeting, was organised there.  And after that, as far as we are concerned, that is, officials of political parties, we understood that our role had been played.  The leaders of political parties had nothing else to do since the members of the government were there.

So personally, I left Hôtel des Diplomates early in the afternoon to go back to where I was living, and I took a walk, and thereafter I rested. 
Q.	Now, while you were at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 9th, did you start to receive information about the prevailing situation in Kigali concerning killings?
A.	I told you we had received some information already the day before during the meeting.  So there were pieces of information going around already.  But officially, this was brought to our knowledge after the first meeting of the interim government.  It was during that meeting that we received virtually all the information on what was going on in Kigali.

At the site of the Hôtel des Diplomates, people were giving pieces of information because people came from different areas.  At that time Hôtel des Diplomates had become the common meeting place for people. 
Q.	Now, was there a meeting of the interim government immediately after they were sworn in? 
A.	Yes.  It would appear that there was a meeting.  We learned of it, but I did not attend the meeting.  But we know that the cabinet met on that 9th of April. 
Q.	And after that meeting did there come a time when Justin Mugenzi contacted members of the 
	MRND leadership? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, after that meeting, I think Justin Mugenzi contacted Mathieu Ngirumpatse with whom he was living at Hôtel des Diplomates.  I was not living at Hôtel des Diplomates.  I just went there and returned.  

So they had a meeting when it was getting late.  I cannot know what they discussed.  But Mugenzi did meet Mathieu, and it is to him that he gave information regarding the decision that had been taken by the cabinet after noticing that there were security problems in Kigali.  And it was decided that leaders of political parties should be contacted.  

I believe Mathieu will have the opportunity to confirm that.  It is Mathieu who received information from members of government through Mugenzi, and I received the information through Mathieu. 
Q.	And what did Mathieu tell you? 
A.	In fact, Mathieu told me that the government or the cabinet which had met the day before -- he did not tell me this on the 9th of April, but he told me in the morning of the 10th that the government, the cabinet which had met the day before, considered the overall security situation which was prevailing in Kigali and its surrounding areas.  

And members of the cabinet noticed that there were many killings, killings involving members of the population and also a number of soldiers as well as the youth wings of political parties.  And he said the government had asked political party officials to be alerted and had also requested them to make their contribution in an attempt to restore peace and security in the capital.

It was, therefore, requested that political parties should talk to their militants and to members of the youth wings who were involved in those killings.  In brief, that is what Mathieu told me.  But when he told me, he told me that it is Mugenzi who told him that that was the government's decision.  And that is how we came to an agreement on what we would do.   
Q.	Was Karemera present when you had that conversation with Mathieu? 
A.	No.  In fact, Karemera himself was living at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  And on that morning, on that morning of the 10th of April, he was not there.  When we took the decision to meet the leaders of the Interahamwe committee -- because we did not know -- in fact, I, for one -- I did not know where they were living.  Karemera was at Hôtel des Diplomates.  But when we met them, it was myself, Mathieu, and Mugenzi.  And Mugenzi himself was a member of government, but he was also the chairman of Parti libéral.  So at the time we were meeting the group, Karemera was not there. 
Q.	Now, on the morning of the 10th after you had the meeting with Mathieu and he explained to you what the government had requested, the MRND, what steps did you take to contact the Interahamwe?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  Before we move on, if Mr. Robinson could ask the witness where this conversation with Mathieu is taking place because it seems to be a bit jumbled in relation to him distinguishing Karemera's absence from the other two.   So if we could find out where the actual conversation with Ngirumpatse is occurring.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So when you spoke with Ngirumpatse on the morning of the 10th, where were you?  
A.	I did not say that Mathieu was absent.  I said that it was Karemera who was absent.  That makes the situation clearer.  In the morning of the 10th of April, Mathieu Ngirumpatse informed me of the decisions that had been reached by the government.  And he asked me if we could contact some of the members of the Interahamwe to bring the message to their knowledge.

So we tried to contact some Interahamwe so that they could mobilise the others.  And it is when some members of the Interahamwe committee arrived at Hôtel des Diplomates that we held a meeting on the terrace of Hôtel des Diplomates on the 10th of April during the day.  And the three of us were there -- Mathieu, Mugenzi, and myself -- in the presence of the leaders of the Interahamwe who had come to meet us there. 
Q.	Okay.  Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here.  We're speaking only of the meeting where you and Mathieu are together and Mathieu is informing you of what the interim government or what Mugenzi has asked him.

Now, thinking only of that meeting, where were you when you spoke with Mathieu?  That's all I want to know right now.
A.	At Hôtel des Diplomates in the morning. 
Q.	And was Édouard Karemera with you when you spoke to Mathieu? 
A.	He was not there.  I think they must have had a conversation because both of them were living at Hôtel des Diplomates.  I was the only person living outside Hôtel des Diplomates.  So when Mathieu Ngirumpatse gave me that piece of information, I had the understanding that he had talked to Karemera.  But at that point in time, Karemera was not with us. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, my next question is, how was the Interahamwe contacted?
A.	What happened is that, after giving me that message, we said that we would need to find some Interahamwe who would assist us in contacting the others.  And as I told you, Hôtel des Diplomates was the common meeting place.  Everybody met there.  And around that same time, a member of the Interahamwe committee who was there was passing.  And I gave him the message.  I asked him to go and look for members of the Interahamwe committee so that those members should come and meet the MRND steering committee.  That is what happened.

We sent the message through a member of the Interahamwe committee who was passing through the Hôtel des Diplomates, and coincidentally, we met him.  And it was Bernard Manyiragaba.  He is the one who went and looked for the others. 
Q.	Now, after you had passed the message to Bernard Manyiragaba, approximately what time did you actually meet some members of the Interahamwe?  
A.	In fact, we met them late in the morning.  We were at Hôtel des Diplomates towards the end or in the late morning that was approaching noon.  And we told them that they should contact those they could contact because they certainly knew the whereabouts of the rest of them.  And it was towards noon.  I would say, in any case, between noon and 2 p.m. 
Q.	So who were the members of the Interahamwe committee that you met on the 10th?
A.	To the best of my recollection, Ephrem Nkezabera, Bernard Manyiragaba.  Manyiragaba -- I can spell that.  Nkezabera is spelled N-K-E-Z-A-B-E-R-A.  First name, Ephrem.  And Bernard Manyiragaba. Manyiragaba is spelled M-A-N-Y-I-R-A-G-A-B-A, first name Bernard.  There was Joseph Serugendo.  Serugendo is spelled S-E-R-U-G-E-N-D-O.  There was a fourth person.  I think it's Sebanetsi, Jean-Pierre.  Sebanetsi is spelled S-E-B-A-N-E-T-S-I, first name Jean-Pierre.
And I believe, if my memory serves me correctly, it must have been on the 10th, or maybe the 
10th or the 11th, there was also Eugène Mbarushimana who stopped at Hôtel des Diplomates, and we saw him there.  We wanted to associate him, but apparently he had found -- sought and found refuge at the embassy of France.  I think he was looking for some people, but at one point he associated himself with us.  I do not clearly remember whether it was on the 10th or 11th, but I know that 
Eugène Mbarushimana -- Mbarushimana is spelled M-B-A-R-U-S-H-I-M-A-N-A.  

So he was passing through Hôtel des Diplomates, and we tried to involve him in the activities we that we intended to carry out, but he did not participate as such because I believe he returned to the embassy of France and was evacuated.  But I am sure of the other four, and I know that I caught sight of Eugène Mbarushimana. 
Q.	Was Dieudonné Niyitegeka also present. 
A.	Yes.  Thank you for reminding.  Dieudonné Niyitegeka was also present. 
Q.	So you've told us that there was yourself, Mathieu, and Mugenzi.  And now you've told us the names of the people who were there for the Interahamwe.  So can you tell us, at the beginning of this meeting, what was said and by whom. 
A.	In fact, as I told you, first of all, when I myself saw Bernard Manyiragaba, I tried to tell him why they were looking for these people.  I told him that this was a decision that had been reached by the government and that we should meet and discuss a number of things.

So I briefed him so that he could deliver a message to those that he could find.  And when we met, it is naturally Mathieu who first spoke to the group. 
Q.	And what did Mathieu say? 
A.	In a word he just repeated the message that the government had sent.  Mugenzi was there, and he was present when that decision was taken.  He told them -- and I have repeated -- that in the opinion of the government, young people seemed to be involved in the killings that were being committed in Kigali and its environ.  And we told him that that was giving our political party a bad reputation.  

We told him that the government would like to put an end to that situation, and that also was our point of view.  And then we entrusted them with the mission of going to the various neighbourhoods to see if crimes were being committed and if, indeed, they were being committed by youth wings in general and, in particular, the youth wing of the MRND, that they should put an end to these killings.

I repeated that after Mathieu said that, and I said it to Bernard Manyiragaba so that he should come to Hôtel des Diplomates knowing the score.  We decided that whatever the case, anybody who refused to comply with those instructions would be held responsible for the acts that were being committed.

And we asked them to go around, and if it turned out that they had any security problems, they should come back and report to us so that we should know whether it was necessary for us to assist them; that in any case, they are to do everything possible to put an end to those killings.  

We also told them that such a situation was damaging the reputation of our government and our country and that, in any case, during that period of unrest, our government and our country would not be well conceded by the international community.  

So we asked them to go and ask the young people involved in those killings to immediately stop.  Mathieu said that too.  Mathieu said that.  I repeated that myself.  Mugenzi was there.  I think he was there as a member of government.  And he went back and reported to the cabinet to ensure them that the message that he had brought we had communicated to the leaders of the Interahamwe organisation. 
Q.	What was the response of the Interahamwe?  
A.	First of all, the group that was there hailed our initiative, and they said that indeed the situation as it was could not be allowed to continue.  They told us that they suggested that they should first go and patrol the neighbourhoods and that they would return to us to give us an account of the problems they were encountering.  That is what was decided on the day of the 10th of April. 
Q.	Now, the president of the Interahamwe, Robert Kajuga, was not present.  Was there any discussion about what happened to him or why he was not present?  
A.	As a matter of fact, when the members of the group arrived, they told us that there were some people that they were not able to locate because, according to them, they were in the area under the control of the RPF.  We were also told that that was the case of Kajuga.  There was another vice-president or two vice-presidents.

In any case, we were told that they were not able to contact everyone; that they did contact those they could contact and that they do not know where those that they could contact were found. 
Q.	Were you aware that Kajuga's family had been killed by them? 
A.	I think that at some point in time, as we were discussing with Mathieu -- I believe Mathieu told me that there were acts of killings being perpetrated and that Kajuga may have even lost members of his family.  I believe I received that information when I was at Hôtel des Diplomates.  But since Kajuga's family -- I didn't know exactly where Kajuga was living.  But we were told that he had moved to the 
	Uruwiro village; that he had a residence in Kicukiro, but he himself lived in the Uruwiro village.  On the said 10th of April, I learned that Kajuga's family had been decimated. 
Q.	And who was believed to be responsible for the killing of Kajuga's family?  Was the it the RPF, or was it people who were opposing the RPF?
A.	I am not able to tell you who. 
Q.	Now, what made you think that leaders of the Interahamwe could actually convince the members of the population who were killing to stop?
A.	When the government said that it was confronted by a very difficult security situation and it was requesting each and everyone to make their contribution, we thought that we could also make our contribution, the contribution of our party.  We were not saying that we had control over that population.  No.  We could have some control over -- no.  We are not saying that we had members of the MRND wherever they were.  Certainly not.

But all we said was that perhaps through our messages -- through our message, young people who are used to coming together could convince some of their colleagues once they are -- once they accept the government's policy and the policy of the MRND party.  It is in that context that we thought that we could speak to the militants of that organisation, especially as the government had said.  The Interahamwe was understood to be the youth wing of the MRND.  

So we thought that we should contact the leaders of the Interahamwe.  That was only normal.  We had to contact them for them to tell us exactly what was happening.  
Q.	Now, were you sincere in your effort to stop the killing, or was this some kind of show?
A.	Mr. Robinson, if we had not been sincere, we would not have done it.  We thought that if everyone is asked to make their contribution to put an end to the situation that prevailed at the time -- I believe any normal human being who desires peace, who seeks to maintain human dignity had to act at that moment.  On that day we acted.  Yet we are accused.  If we had not done anything, we would be asked, "What did you do?" 

We would be told, "Well, you did not even want to act."  We tried.  Perhaps would it not succeed.  That is what we must observe.  But we were sincere when we conveyed the government's message.  I believe Mugenzi must have conveyed that message to the government which mandated him. 
Q.	On the 10th of April, did the political parties also issue a communication? 
A.	Yes.  The five political parties published a communiqué appealing to the population to maintain peace, the communiqué of the 10th of April.  I should also tell you that, while we were meeting with the representatives of the Interahamwe, Mathieu and myself, Karemera was busy with the other members of the other parties in drafting that communiqué.

That communiqué was published on the same day, namely, the 10th of April.  On that very day, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on behalf of the MRND party and myself -- we made a communiqué which we broadcast over Radio Rwanda calling the population to maintain peace and, in particular, appealing to the young people not to kill one another, not to carry out looting, not to carry out rape, and so on.

So this is what the parties did.  There was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's communiqué.  And that very evening President Sindikubwabo also addressed the nation.  So this is to tell you that there was a concerted effort. 
Q.	Now, we've heard evidence from Witness HH that on the 9th and 10th of April at the Diplomat Hotel weapons were distributed to members of the Interahamwe.  Is that true? 
A.	No.  That's wrong.  Why did we have to distribute weapons at the Diplomat Hotel?  The military camp is nearby.  You know Kigali.  The Kigali camp is next to the Hôtel des Diplomates.  The Hôtel des Diplomates was full of civilians, refugees. 
Q.	Witness HH says that at the Diplomat Hotel the army brought weapons there and Kajuga and Georges Rutaganda were handing them out to the Interahamwe.
A.	Those are lies.
Q.	And you didn't see Georges Rutaganda or Robert Kajuga at the Hôtel des Diplomates on the 
	9th or 10th, did you?
A.	Throughout the period of April to July, I never saw Georges Rutaganda. 
Q.	Now, with respect to your own situation, during the day you told us on the 10th you were at the Diplomat Hotel for a good part of that day.  What did you do that evening? 
A.	What happened is that when the group of first Interahamwes told us they wanted to go round to carry out patrol in order to be able to inform us of any difficulties, in fact, they wanted to carry out some sort of reconnaissance mission.  So we took a new appointment at the Diplomat Hotel in the evening at about 5 p.m.  We asked them to come and to give us an account, give us a report.

And it was at that moment that we had to decide what was going to be done.  They left with their own means, and they told us they visited some neighbourhoods.  And in the evening when we met them between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., they told us first that indeed there were problems but that, in order for them to carry out the mission entrusted to them, it was necessary for them to have a military escort if we wanted them to be efficient.  

So this was a major problem.  They told us, "No.  We cannot just go like that because our security is not ensured and we need a military escort."  So that is one of the problems they raised.  They said that they were ready to carry out the mission but that they needed a military escort.  So that is what they told us on the evening of the 10th of April 1994.   
Q.	And what did you do in response to that request? 
A.	Following that request, well, matters were easy because Mathieu was there.  In the meantime, the minister of defence had returned from mission.  I believe he returned either on the 9th or the 10th, and it was to him that the problem was presented.  
Q.	Now, when you met the Interahamwe for the second time on the 10th of April in the afternoon, who was present besides the Interahamwe?  There was you.  Who else was there from the MRND leadership?  
A.	There was Mathieu, there was myself, and there was also Mugenzi. 
Q.	What did Mathieu do to arrange escort with the ministry of defence? 
A.	As I told you, the minister of defence returned.  We were informed of that situation on that evening of the 10th, and the minister of defence provided an escort.  It was that escort that the group of Interahamwes, the four or five, used on the 11th of April to go to all the neighbourhoods and deliver the government's message. 
Q.	And what did you do after meeting with the Interahamwe on the 10th in the late afternoon? 
A.	Well, the communiqué that was given was that the escort was going to be available the following day from 8 o'clock, and that group was asked to report the following day in the morning at 8 o'clock.  And indeed, the group was there in the morning of the 11th, and they were given the escort.  

During that night of the 10th, I returned to my residence, and I came back in the morning to see whether they had an escort.  And when they received the escort, we told them, "Well, you are going to carry out patrols.  You will return to give us a report of the situation on the evening of the 11th."  And we broke up.  They left.  We also left.  I returned to where I was staying. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, on the 10th of April, you've told us of your activities on that day.  But we've heard testimony from a witness named AJY who claimed that on that day he was at your residence serving as some kind of guard or driver and that you were at a residence across from the German embassy dispatching Interahamwe to Kabeza to kill Tutsis and then meeting with Colonel Bagosora and Mugenzi and Casimir Bizimungu that afternoon at the residence near the German embassy.  What do you have to say to that? 
A.	All I will say is that those are lies.  First of all, I never had a house near the German embassy.  The houses I had in Kigali are known.  They were surveyed.  They are known.  I, therefore, do not know where that witness obtained that information.  Perhaps he's in the habit of making up testimonies.  But the fact is that I had no house next to the German embassy.   

You know how that witness hesitated.  First of all, he said I lived opposite the presidency.  Then next to the ministry of finance.  In fact, in the final analysis he did not even know where I was living.  And yet he appeared before the Court and said that he knows Nzirorera; that he was my driver.  So all I can say is that these are the lies that we are used to.   
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if we could ask the interpreters to turn off their cell phone and their microphones after they interpret so that we can proceed in a smooth fashion.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
We are sorry about that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, how does it feel to sit here and listen to somebody -- Mr. Nzirorera, how does it feel to sit here and listen to somebody who you've never met come in here into this courtroom, raise their right hand, and take an oath and tell a story about -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm sorry.  I object to this question, even before it's finished, because I haven't heard this witness say that he has ever met AJY.  So perhaps that should be established first.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Have you ever met AJY?  Have you ever met AJY before, even in this courtroom?
A.	I don't know him.  I saw him for the first time here.  
Q.	So how does it feel to have somebody come into this courtroom, raise their right hand, and tell a story that they're your driver, that they were with you and your family; that you sent Interahamwe to kill people on the 10th of April?  What does that feel like to have someone come before you and make those kind of accusations?   
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would object to the question as being completely irrelevant.  How Mr. Nzirorera feels while he's sitting in the courtroom in 2009 and 2010 have nothing to do with the evidence he's confronting in his own trial.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, it's part of his credibility.  His credibility is being assessed as of today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'll permit the question.
THE WITNESS:
What I can feel is only disappointment.  When a witness appears before the Honourable Judges sitting here and he takes an oath and testifies that he was my driver; that he knows me; that he knows my wife, then all I can say is that he lied.  You also heard what he said regarding the -- well, when he said that he transported my wife.

All I can say to that is that I'm disappointed.  All I can say is that the Judges who hear witnesses like that unfortunately do not have the possibility of knowing that those people are just telling huge lies.  So I am disappointed.  

I know that the Prosecutor -- in the documents they seized, they have the list of my houses and the neighbourhoods in which those houses are found.  I do not know why the Prosecution cannot realise that I did not have a house in the old neighbourhood of Kiyovu.  Kiyovu is an old neighbourhood.

So, Mr. Robinson, that is what I will say in brief.  I do not want to go farther than that.  My feeling is that of disappointment and frustration. 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, we've heard evidence that on the 7th of April in Mukingo commune a large number of Tutsis were killed and buried on the 8th.  As of the evening of the 10th of April, did you have any information about that?
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Weren't you worried about your family in Mukingo, and didn't you want to have communication to find out what was happening with them?
A.	First of all, I should tell you that I was more worried than they were.  Because, as I told you, where I was in Kigali -- in any case, until the morning of the 7th, I was more worried than the members of my family who were in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	What was the situation of the war?  We've talked about the politics.  But what about the war in Kigali as of the end of the 10th of April?  Were you hearing bombs or explosions?  Were there reports of fighting between the RPF and the government?  What was the situation then?
A.	The war was raging in Kigali.  Personally, I did not receive any report on the war.  But one could follow the explosions of weapons.  

From the 7th of April in the afternoon, the RPF contacted the Presidential Guard or was in contact with the Presidential Guard.  There was an exchange of mortar fire.  The situation was very unpleasant.  So on the 10th of April, the war was an all-out war.  I must tell you that on the 8th of April I met General Dallaire at the ministry of defence.

I begged him.  I pleaded with him to take me in his armoured vehicle to my house in order to look for clothes.  I was in a suit which I had worn since Saturday, the 8th.  That suit -- in particular, the shirt had lost its colour.

General Dallaire himself told me that my area was in the red zone or area and that, if there was no ceasefire, he would not be able to go there.  That is to show you that the situation was delicate.  It was serious.  So I was left in that situation.

So I received no report on the war, but the explosion of firearms could be heard.  We could see shells, bombs.  The situation was, therefore, very serious. 
Q.	Now, you've told us that on the morning of the 11th you went back and -- went back to the Diplomat Hotel; correct?
A.	Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	And you saw the members of the Interahamwe committee leave with the escort; is that true? 
A.	Yes.  We went there.  First of all, I wanted to see Mathieu and then to ensure that an escort had been found and also to be sure that the mission we were requesting would be accomplished.  And that was what had happened.  The escort was there at 8 a.m. in the morning of the 11th of April, and they took the military escort and left. 
Q.	And what did you do? 
A.	I went back to where I was residing.  I had nothing else to do.  I was not a member of government, and I didn't have anything else to do. 
Q.	Did you make some arrangements on the 11th for some of your children to leave Colonel Setako's? 
A.	Yes.  That is what I did.  When I learnt that the convoy which had to leave Kigali comprising, amongst others, Mr. Alphonse Higaniro -- Higaniro is spelt H-I-G-A-N-I-R-O.  I learned that that convoy was leaving Kigali.  

And since Higaniro -- Higaniro is the son-in-law of Dr. Akingenyi, A-K-I-N-G-E-N-Y-I - 
	Akingenyi, Manuel -- who was the private physician of the president.  He had also died in the president's plane.  So his son-in-law, Higaniro, was living in Butare and had come to Kigali in the same convoy which brought Colonel Gatsinzi and Dr. Sindikubwabo.  

And he came to see his father-in-law who was no longer there.  And it just turned out that the house of the father-in-law was opposite Colonel Setako's house.  I knew Higaniro.  First of all, we were both members of government at the same time.  He was the godfather of my son, and I am the godfather of his son.   

And he informed me that he was going to leave to Gisenyi along with his family and that 
Colonel Bagosora had organised a big convoy for his family which had to leave Kigali along with the family of his brother, Pasture, Musabe.  And taking into account the situation in which we were living in Colonel Setako's residence, I thought it would be prudent to reduce the number of people by sending members of my family away.

And I gave him four children, the four of my oldest -- the four oldest children.  And he took them to his residences in Gisenyi.  That is how my children left Kigali in the morning of the 11th of April.

When I left Hôtel des Diplomates, I learned of that information, and I immediately organised the departure of my children who took advantage of the departure of that convoy.  That is all I can tell you about that 11th of April. 
Q.	We've heard evidence that on the 11th of April there was a meeting between the government and the préfet.  Did you attend that meeting?  
A.	No, Mr. Robinson.  You know, the type of things that are said here -- how?  I was not a member of government, and I was not invited to that meeting.  The members of political parties who were members of that government were those who held ministerial portfolios.  Neither Karemera, Mathieu, or myself took part in that meeting of the 11th of April.  What was said here was pure concoction. 
Q.	In fact, no witness has said that here.  It's only in the indictment.  But not a single witness has come before this Chamber and said that you were in attendance.  It is simply the Prosecution.   
A.	I know that no witness said that.  Fidèle Uwizeye who came here did not say that, and that is in a paragraph of the incitement.  And I imagine that when the Prosecutor wrote that he had evidence to support that. 
Q.	Now, did you have any other contact on the 11th with those members of the Interahamwe who had gone out on their mission in the morning? 
A.	As agreed, in the evening they came with a report late, towards 6:30, 7 p.m.  The group came back, met Mathieu and myself, and gave us a report.  And the report was very positive.  And I believe even Prosecution witnesses who testified here said that -- in any case, people were receptive to this message.  They had also heard the various messages that had been given out by the five political parties, the communiqués that had been published on the 10th, the communiqué from Mathieu, the message from President Sindikubwabo.   

And they said that -- in any case, the message was well received and that in the neighbourhoods where they had been there might have been two or three secteurs where the conseillers were still resistant, but that the message was well received and that people actually intended to do the best they could do to stop what was going on.

Secondly, they told us that people were complaining about the fact that they did not have any weapons that they could use to defend themselves and that they were aware that the Rwandan army was fighting against the RPF but that the army could not on its own carry out that war which had got to the entire capital.

And they asked us -- they told us that they had gone around to most of the neighbourhoods except for three which were under government control and that only Remera and the surrounding areas were under the control of the RPF, and they could not get there.

They told us, therefore, that since they had not completed the work on that 11th of April, they thought that they would have to continue in order to reach all the neighbourhoods and be able to provide an exhaustive report once they had finished with all the neighbourhoods in Kigali which were under government control.  So the report was fairly positive as far as that first pacification tour of the 
11th of April was concerned. 
Q.	And was there anyone else besides you and Mathieu representing either the MRND or the government at that meeting when they made their report on the evening of the 11th?
A.	No.  I was with Mathieu, and I believe that that evening Mugenzi was informed so that he could in turn provide a report to the government. 
Q.	But was Mugenzi present when you met with the Interahamwe on the 11th in the afternoon? 
A.	He was not there, but he was living at Hôtel des Diplomates. 
Q.	You heard the testimony -- I believe it was Witness G who said something about Mugenzi was asking about the Tutsis who were in the Mille Collines and was somehow satisfied that Tutsis were being killed but not really the big Tutsis.  Is any of that true? 
A.	Yes.  I know that a witness said that, but Mugenzi never said those words. 
Q.	Now, the people who were coming back to make -- who made that report to you on the evening of the 11th -- were they the same five people who you had met with on the 10th?
A.	Yes.  It was the same group of five persons whose names I provided.  There were six names that I provided, but without Mbarushimana, they are five.  And that is the group that worked on the 
	10th and the 11th. 
Q.	And when they mentioned the problem about weapons and the population was requesting weapons, what was the response from you or Mathieu?
A.	Yes.  They raised the problem, and I believe that -- given the situation at the time, I believe that people were worried for their security.  And they thought that people could defend themselves in their own way.  But we could not promise anything because we knew that even the government had problems with weapons to fight against the RPF.  They had problems with weapons and problems with ammunition.

And what could we promise them.  All we had to do was to inform the government of the problems the way the problems had been reported to us.  But we knew that those problems would continue to exist.

1015H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	After that meeting on the 11th, what did you do that evening? 
A.	Before I answer that question, Mr. Robinson, you yourself heard the testimony of certain witnesses here, witnesses who claim that weapons had been distributed as early as 1993.  You see, it is paradoxical that the same Prosecution witnesses should come here and say that weapons were being requested.  

So what had happened to the weapons which had been distributed, distributed in 1993?  They could have answered those questions themselves because it was said that we had trained battalions, we had distributed weapons, that we had arms industry.  And immediately war breaks out, people are requesting weapons.  That is what I wanted to underscore in passing.  

So now to answer your question -- to answer your question:  On the 11th -- perhaps you might want to repeat the question. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What did you do on the 11th after receiving the report from the Interahamwe in the evening? 
A.	On the 11th we finished around 8 p.m., and I went back to where I was residing.  Mathieu remained at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  That is where he was putting up.  And then we agreed that we were going to meet with those young people the following day, on the 12th of April at 11 o'clock at 
	Hôtel des Diplomates.  

We agreed that they had to go around the remaining neighbourhoods under the control of the government and that they had to do so very early in the morning and then meet us to give us another report on the 12th at 11 o'clock after going through all the neighbourhoods, so that we should know the type of proposals we should make to the government.  That is what we agreed with the group and then each person went his way.  I went back to where I was putting up. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, during the time that you had been in Kigali from the -- let's say the 7th until now, the evening of the 11th, were you aware of any broadcast being made on RTLM inciting people to kill? 
A.	I personally did not follow any.  I didn't hear any programmes talking about people being killed.  In fact, the Prosecutor gave us recordings of RTLM programmes.  If the Prosecutor has any of those recordings, that is, that people have to be killed on the 10th or the 11th, in fact I'm unaware of any. 
Q.	Did anybody discuss with you, while you were at the Diplomat Hotel or meeting with people, that there was a problem with RTLM when you were in Kigali between the 7th and the 11th? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Did you have anything to do with RTLM broadcasts in 1994? 
A.	No. 
Q.	We heard from Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, and we saw also some entry in her diary that -- I believe on the meeting of the 10th of the government there was some suggestion to tone down RTLM.  Was that ever discussed with you or brought to your attention? 
A.	No.  What I know, that the interim chief of staff, Mr. Marcel Gatsinzi, at the time he was a colonel, he had said while he was talking that it was necessary to find a way of reducing or bringing down anything that could worsen the situation.  He was talking in particular at the time when there were ceasefire negotiations going on and was suggesting to UNAMIR and the RPF that all radio stations, RTLM, 
	Radio Rwanda, Radio Muhabura, that all those radio stations had to be radio stations which were calling for peace and national concord.  That is what he was saying, that the radio stations should be instruments of peace and reunification.  We heard -- and you know we have that speech in among the documents which were disclosed to us. 
Q.	Did you yourself own shares in RTLM? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you have any ability to dictate to RTLM what they should do? 
A.	Not at all.  In April 1993 when RTLM was formed, those who started it said that that was a commercial firm and that they wanted shareholders.  You cannot stop somebody who wants to do business.  A business firm is a business firm.  And I brought shares in RTLM, but that does not mean that I had the capacity to decide what RTLM had to do.  So I am telling you that the answer is no.  I didn't have any capacity.  RTLM had its manager.  It had its board of directors.  It had its management board.  It had its journalists, as a radio station.  

And, further, when we bought the shares, the RTLM Limited was not limited to the activities of a radio.  There was a branch for radio and television and so on, everything that had to do with propagating information, but this was of a commercial nature. 
Q.	And in your capacity as secretary general of the MRND, did you have the ability to shut down RTLM or to control what -- the content of their broadcasts? 
A.	I did not have that capacity. 
Q.	Now, in your capacity as secretary general of the MRND, we could see that you were taking efforts to persuade the Interahamwe or those members of MRND who were committing bad acts to stop.  But what could you really do?  What punishment did you have the right to impose upon a member of the MRND who was doing something wrong? 
A.	You know, I know that there was an official of the MRND party, but I do not know if a political party can be considered as a firm which has workers.  Members of a political party, MRND members, are not employees under me.  They're not employees under Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  Neither are they employees under Karemera.  They were free to be members of MRND, just as they are free to be members of any other party.  

So we did not have any cohesive measure in case anybody was not to comply with our instructions.  If I asked a party member, a militant, not to do something, notwithstanding what I tell him the person continues, all I can do is to note that with regret.  I do not have a contract with him that I can put an end to.  I am not a military officer who can lock him up.  I have no authority over his salary which I can decide to cut down.  All I can do is talk to him.  

And those of us, as members of our political parties, the weapon we had was messages that we could give, and I think we accomplished that duty honourably.  We sent out messages to our militants:  Make militants of the MRND party.  Our statutes are clear.  

What we could do in case somebody did not comply was insignificant.  You could threaten a party member.  And all you would say is that I am the one voting for you and I can change and become a member of a different party.  The same is true for members of Interahamwe za MRND -- MRND, who were also members of the party.  So it would be up to those who are trying us to see what this means where, which were at our disposal, which we could have used and which we did not use.  

We thought that we had exhausted all our ammunition to convince people that what they were doing was not correct, in fact at least those of our militants who could listen to us, and that is all we could do.  And, in my opinion, that is what we did, and we could not have done anything else.  

In fact I do not see why I should be held responsible for those acts.  How can I be held responsible for the acts of all the members of the party, people I do not even know, people who are called Interahamwe in court and it is said that Nzirorera is responsible for an act that was committed by a member of the MRND? 

Very briefly, that is what I would like to say.  I think I would have gone further but I would like to stop at that. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'm about to go into the events of the 12th of April.  Perhaps this would be a good time to take our morning recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we take our morning recess now.
(Court recessed from 1029H to 1105H) 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, you may continue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, can you tell us -- you told us you had an appointment with the members of the Interahamwe committee at 11 o'clock in the morning on the 12th April.  So did you go to the 
	Diplomat Hotel at that time? 
A.	Yes, I went to Hôtel des Diplomates at 11 a.m. on the 12th of April. 
Q.	And what did you find when you got there? 
A.	When I arrived there, I was very surprised about the calm and silence that was reigning there because the parking lot which was full of vehicles was now empty.  Not a single vehicle was there.  And I found that I was virtually alone at the Hôtel des Diplomates. 
Q.	And what did you do? 
A.	I went to the reception and asked the receptionist what had happened, where the people who were there had gone to. 
Q.	And what information did you receive? 
A.	He told me that he did not understand how I was still there that very early in the morning, and in any case around 9 a.m., everybody had parked out and that they had left for an unknown destination.  I was very surprised. 
Q.	What did you do? 
A.	First, I was disturbed when I arrived and then I was surprised because I had no information and then I left the reception to see what I could do. 
Q.	And where did you go from there? 
A.	In fact, that reminded me of the situation I lived through in the night of the 6th to the 7th of April.  And at that point I had no information regarding what had happened that had forced the entire government.  Everybody who was at the Hôtel des Diplomates had left for an unknown destination and I was a little worried.  So I said that I had to find a solution for myself to see how I could save my own self because I could not get any information from anybody.  So I had parked my car in the lot, and it was when I came out that I met that group of Interahamwe who had an appointment.  

They too had not been informed and I think amongst them there must have been three or four - three, including Nkezabera.  And I met them just at the point when I was going to get into my car and they were all surprised to see that nobody was there.  And they asked me what they could do.  And I said:  "But what can we do?  There was no mission report.  There was nothing.  So we're all in disarray."   So I told them that I'm going to arrange to leave Kigali. 
Q.	Was there any discussion about weapons? 
A.	In fact, Mr. Nkezabera, who I think was with Jean-Pierre Sebanetsi, said:  "But what do we do?"  And I said:  "If everybody has left, there must be a problem."  And nobody had any precise information on what had happened.  We got to know what had happened subsequently.  But at that point in time we did not know anything.  We just heard how arms -- the firearms being shot, shelling here and there.  And we understood that the war was becoming more serious, so we understood that something had happened.  

So we said that now that there is a war it is a business of the ministry of defence which is in charge of the security and integrity of the national territory.  There was nothing we could do.  But in any case I told him straightforward that that was something that concerned the government.  We did not see anybody and we did not know what we can do, so the only way is to find a way of saving one's own life. 
Q.	Did you undertake yourself to contact Colonel Bagosora to assist the Interahamwe to obtain weapons on the 12th? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, I think you first have to look at the situation in which I found myself upon my arrival at the Hôtel des Diplomates and found that there was nobody there.  I found no member of government, no political party leader, no soldier.  

And you would understand that I was quite ill at ease.  And what I was concerned with in the foremost was my life and the survival of my family that I had left somewhere also.  And that reminded me of the night of the 6th to the 7th of April.  So I could not even think that I was going to remain in Kigali to wage war, so I did not contact Colonel Bagosora.  I do not know where this whole thing came from.  I only said that if there is war going on, then it means that the ministry of defence is involved because that is the ministry that is responsible for war.  It is not the MRND that is responsible for war.  There is a ministry which is responsible for the security and integrity of the national territory.  

Now, as to the rest, I do not know how this idea of the 12th of April came about to say that I took people and put them in contact with Bagosora, that I wanted them to be given weapons.  There was even no soldier there.  In fact, I do not know where that idea comes from.  I don't know how.  In any case, on the 12th of April I was never in contact with Colonel Bagosora.  In fact, I did not even know where he was. 
Q.	How long did your contact with these members of the Interahamwe committee last on the 12th of April in the parking lot of the Diplomat Hotel? 
A.	Not even five minutes.  We discussed.  We realised that everybody had left, and then we exchanged those few words and I got into my car and left. 
Q.	Where did you go? 
A.	I went where I was residing, at Lieutenant Colonel Setako's, where my family was.  And I told them to quickly get ready for us to leave Kigali because there was nobody remaining in Kigali.  Everybody had left.  We were the only ones remaining. 
Q.	And did in fact you assemble a group of vehicles to leave Kigali on the 12th? 
A.	I had my two cars, my jeep, my Mercedes, and I had my car.  And when Setako arrived and decided that we should take his family, he made his pickup available to take his family and some 
	personal effects from his house.  He is the one who told me.  In fact I told him that I was going to leave and he told me that if he left he had to go to Kinshasa on mission.  And he told me that since he did not know when he would be returning and he did not know what would happen in Kigali, he proposed that I should take his entire family along with me.  

We raised the problem of number of seats available and he said that he would provide his pickup to take his family members and the personal effects of the family.  I did not have any personal effects, I did not have any luggage, so we -- my entire family had left the house like that.  

So we had the three vehicles, my two vehicles and the pickup for the Setako family.  And we asked him to make the necessary arrangements for military escort because we wanted to leave Kigali town.  There were bombs being shelled.  We could hear gunshots.  So I asked him to see how he could arrange with the military services and find us an escort.  They found a military jeep for us and it is that jeep that was used.  So that we used as our escort out of Kigali, and it was driven by an officer.  I think it's either a second lieutenant or a lieutenant. 
Q.	Now, did anyone else join your group in leaving Kigali from Colonel Setako's house? 
A.	So in addition to the members of my family, we had members of Setako's family.  And as I told you, as concerns my family, I was now remaining only with the younger children.  Then we had Setako's family, Mr. David Biramahire --  Biramahire is spelt B-I-R-A-M-A-H-I-R-E, first name David -- and his brother, whose name I do not know.  And then there was the family of ***************************** --  **************** is spelt **************************, first name ********** -- who was the ******************** and who was residing on the other side of the road that passed in front of Setako's house.  

He also asked that we should include him in our convoy.  I knew **********.  He was director of ************, but he had also been a *************** in the ministry of agriculture and stock breeding.  Generally, those people had vehicles at their disposal.  But since the night before the driver had taken the vehicle home and had not returned, he did not have a vehicle.  So he was there with his wife and his children, who were very young, and he asked if we could take him along.  And we had to find a way of leaving Kigali town.  And since we had the -- the pickup at our disposal, we organised the convoy, which had four vehicles, the military jeep, which was the escort, and then my two vehicles and then the pickup.

In the pickup at the back to guard the people who were inside and Setako's personal effects, we put a soldier or one of those with whom I had left in my Gishushu residence.  And the convoy left 
Setako's house.  He told us that he was leaving for Kinshasa on that same day. 
Q.	About what time did the convoy leave? 
A.	We left Kigali around 1 p.m. 
Q.	Did you stop -- or were you at the residence of Colonel Sagatwa at any time on the 12th of April? 
A.	No, Mr. Robinson.  First, you have to understand how their houses were placed.  If you left 
	Setako's house, you got straight into the road, the Boulevard de la Jeunesse that leads to the Boulevard de l'Armée.  

We could not go to Segatwa's house.  For what?  As it was explained, Segatwa had died and his wife had died one or two years earlier, so there was nobody in Colonel Segatwa's house.  I do not even see why we would have had to go there.  So I think the people who are telling those stories are just attempting to fabricate stories to see if they could stand, but it's not true.  

We left Setako's house and then we got onto Boulevard de la Jeunesse and then got into 
Boulevard de l'Armée, and from there we went down to the road leading to Gitarama. 
Q.	Once you had left Colonel Setako's house, did you have any means of telephoning anyone or receiving any telephone calls that day? 
A.	First of all, nobody telephoned me.  Secondly, I did not have a mobile telephone.  And, thirdly, I did not have any other sophisticated telephone equipment.  I was quite simply in a hurry to leave the town. 
Q.	You have heard the testimony of Witness T that you were supposed to contact Colonel Bagosora, and then later on there had been some -- a telephone call made to you around 4 o'clock in the afternoon in which you told them to go to the ministry of defence; is that true? 
A.	I was very surprised by this testimony from Witness T because, first of all, in one of his statements he said he called me around 4 p.m.  I believe that around 4 p.m. I had gone very far on the Gitarama-Mukamira road.  That is the first thing.  Secondly, I did not have a mobile telephone.  Thirdly, I had not seen Colonel Bagosora since the last occasion on the 8th of April at the ESM.  In any case, I had not seen him in the interim.  

So I do not know how Witness T managed to come up with this scenario.  I do not know if somebody else told him.  Setako said that he locked up his house when he left.  So how did he contact me?  He's the only one who knows that. 
Q.	What about Witness BDX, was he in your convoy? 
A.	I did not even know him.  I saw him for the first time here in the Tribunal.  When he gave the name of his father, I knew his father.  But he himself I did not know.  I had never seen him.  Therefore, he is a 
	big liar.  I was very surprised when he said that he joined the convoy and he was following my vehicle.  This is not true.  It's a lie.  If he was in Kigali, it was not in my convoy that he went in any case. 
Q.	Can you tell us the route that your convoy took to the place where you left Kigali? 
A.	Yes, I left the house, the house of Colonel Setako, and I immediately took the Avenue de la Jeunesse.  From the Avenue de la Jeunesse I took the Boulevard de l'Armée, and from the 
	Boulevard de l'Armée -- or rather that boulevard directly leads to the Kigali major roundabout, which you know, which is at the entrance into Kigali opposite what is called Établissement Rwandais.  It is a roundabout where many roads meet.  And from that roundabout I went down towards Nyabugogo.  And from Nyabugogo I continued on my way to Gitarama. 
Q.	Did you encounter any roadblocks on that journey? 
A.	Yes, there were roadblocks, as I told you, beginning with the starting point near the 
	president's residence, around the ministry of defence, near Rwandatel, near the Kigali roundabout, a little bit lower at Muhima -- at Muhima, and then at Nyabugogo junction.  

So the town, as you see, was full of roadblocks and war was raging.  You could see bullets flying and shells.  So we were worried.  There were so many problems at that time. 
Q.	Did you ever address any people at any of those roadblocks? 
A.	Not at all.  First of all, on the roadblocks we would walk.  The military jeep would go ahead of us to indicate to those who were manning the roadblocks who was coming behind.  In fact, on those roadblocks you could see people armed with machetes, clubs, knives, and what have you, people who seemed to be drunk.  So when you say -- when you ask whether we were talking with people, sometimes you had to take a risk.  But what we had to do was to keep the glasses up to avoid being stabbed with a knife in your face.  

So the people who tell you that they could hold rallies at that time or speak easily to people are 
not -- are exaggerating because you couldn't know what would happen to you.  You could not foresee what would happen to you at any moment.  Everybody was afraid.  

And those people at some point in time said:  "Well, you are running away from the capital."  And they would add:  "When you leave, you will never return."  They didn't hesitate to say that.  

Therefore, personally, I'm not aware of any speech I may have made.  I do not know who invented that story.  But talking to people who appeared to be drunk, armed with machetes, clubs, armed to the teeth with all these weapons, as soon as the military jeep cleared the roadblock we continued on our way. 
Q.	From the time you left Colonel Setako's house until the time you left Kigali, had you opened the door of your vehicle again?  After you got in your vehicle, you closed the door.  Did you open it again while you were still in Kigali? 
A.	First of all, as I told you, bombs were flying all over.  Sometimes even with the vehicles, as bombs 
	flew -- as mortars flew over the vehicles, the vehicles would shake.  And the protection, well, you 
	would -- you would think that if a glass got broken it could wound you.  In fact we didn't know what would happen at any time.  I never went into that type of game.  It was too risky.  Somebody could throw a knife at me.  So why take that risk of bringing down or opening my door?   

And those who testify to that or say so or give their testimony, because they did not go through that situation, we went through that situation.  We know how to assess the fear we felt at that time.  And it is only we who can assess that fear.  Somebody who did not go through that experience can tell any story he wants.  He can even say that we held rallies. 
Q.	Why did you go to Gitarama? 
A.	It was the only way of out of Kigali.  It was the only way to go out of Kigali.  We could not go to Kanombe.  When you are at the Kigali roundabout -- I believe you know Kigali -- there is a road that leads to the airport.  The best way for us to get out was not to go towards Kanombe.  Otherwise if that had been possible, I would have been in my house, since I had a residence, a private residence at Masaka.  But the RPF were in that area.  

Therefore, I did not take that road.  I could not go towards Kibungo.  The RPF was coming from that direction.  We could not go towards Ruhengeri.  The Kigali-Ruhengeri road - as you know, Ruhengeri was always converted by the RPF, and that road was always taken.  Whenever there was an attack, that road was the first to be occupied.  

So the only possibility left for us was to Gitarama.  I could not go to Byumba because Mulindi was the headquarters -- the headquarters of the RPF was in Mulindi.  So you would understand why the government took the road to the south.  And certainly they were in a hurry to leave early, very early.  

When they had information to the effect that the RPF had resumed hostilities, that the RPF has doubled its efforts in the war, they hurried.  They hurried.  The members of government hurried so that the RPF should not also close that road, because if that road had been closed the members of government would be blocked.  And everyone feared that that road would be blocked and that was the only passage left for us to take. 
Q.	After you left Kigali, what happened to your military escort? 
A.	In fact the escort accompanied us up to the bridge on Nyabarongo river -- Nyabarongo spelt as follows: N-Y-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O -- so the bridge over River Nyabarongo.  It is in fact that river that separates the Kigali préfecture from the Gitarama préfecture.  There is a big bridge over that river and that bridge was guarded by soldiers so that it should not be destroyed.  The escort accompanied us, and once we crossed that bridge the jeep that escorted us returned to Kigali.  The lieutenant made a roundabout turn or went back to Kigali. 
Q.	And as you proceeded from that point to Gitarama, did you encounter any other roadblocks? 
A.	Yes, as I told you, there were roadblocks, small roadblocks, manned by members of the population.  On that road there were so many people who were leaving Kigali town.  There were people who were walking.  Others were in vehicles.  And roadblocks were pieces of wood that were put across the road and the roadblocks were manned by members of the local population in the various communes.  But I could go past the roadblocks easily after having been stopped and checked, as I have already -- since I already -- since I had two soldiers.  One of them was with me in the front and the other one was in the rear part of the pickup, so I was able to go past the roadblocks without much difficulty. 
Q.	On your journey from Colonel Setako's house out of Kigali, did you see any dead bodies? 
A.	As a matter of fact, personally, from the time I remained in Kigali, from the 7th to the 12th, I did not see any corpse or dead body on the road.  On the contrary -- or however, those -- well, I remained in the central plateau -- on the central plateau.  And on that road I did not see any dead bodies.  These who were able to travel right up to the business area told us they found corpses on the streets of the commercial area, but I personally did not see any corpses or dead bodies. 
Q.	Approximately what time did you arrive in Gitarama on the 12th? 
A.	I arrived in Gitarama around 2:30 p.m.  I say so because the -- we walked slowly because of traffic.  So at about 2:30 I was practically in Gitarama.  

First of all, I did not know where the others were because I did not see anyone.  I remained for a while in Gitarama looking for a place where I could rest and give some food to the children.  We had left Kigali in a hurry.  Unfortunately, all restaurants were closed.  We even looked for a place where to stay and we were not able to find one.  

And that is how at about 3:30 p.m. we decided that it was necessary to continue the ride up to our native village.  But we had concerns, we had worries regarding fuel because we could not even have fuel in Gitarama.  Not having any other possibility, I did not even know where the others were, so I thought I should go to my village.  And that is how I decided to leave Gitarama with all risks of running out of fuel.  That's it. 
Q.	Did you know that the government had located at Murambi while you were in Gitarama? 
A.	No, I was not aware of that.  I became aware of that later on when I was told that people went there.  I tried to have information.  I was told that they were in Murambi. 
Q.	So where did you go from Gitarama? 
A.	I took the Gitarama road towards Mukamira to go to my village in Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Is that a tarmac road? 
A.	The first stretch of the road from Gitarama to the Nyabarongo bridge -- there is another bridge on the Nyabarongo.  Nyabarongo is a river that practically surrounds Kigali.  There is -- at a place called Cyomo.  Cyomo spelt as follows:  C-Y-O-M-E -- M-O, rather.  So the first part of the road that was tarmac went right up to that point, Cyomo.  There was always people on that stretch of the road looking for places where they could settle, where they could stay.  

So from that point on the bridge right up to Mukamira, a distance of about 80 kilometres, the road was not tarmacked.  It was in a very poor state.  It was during the rainy season in a mountainous region.  It was therefore necessary to drive slowly depending on the state of the road.  

On our way the pickup which accompanied us, which carried the family's luggage, ran out of fuel.  We were compelled to abandon it, leaving the driver and the soldiers there as well as a few children.  All the passengers who were in that vehicle were also left there and we went to Kabaya centre.  

It is there at Kabaya centre that we had a stopover.  During that stopover we were able to buy some fuel on the black market.  I was also able to buy some -- some non-alcoholic beverages for the children because they had suffered practically for the whole day.  

From there I sent back the jeep so as to provide fuel to the pickup.  Then the jeep came back to us and we continued to Mukingo.

1145H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Approximately what time did you arrive at your residence in Mukingo? 
A.	We arrived there early in the evening, slightly after 7 p.m. 
Q.	What did you do when you arrived? 
A.	As you know, when we -- we had not visited that house for a long time, so it was necessary to get into the house.  We were many.  I had a big house there with an adjoining building.  We opened the house.  We were able to settle in.  To begin with, everyone was tired.  And it was necessary to find out how to settle in and thereafter see what could be done.  

There was someone who was guarding my house.  I asked him if he could find something to cook, potatoes or whatever, something that we could eat.  In fact, everyone -- after eating, we were all tired.  We went to bed.  We were very tired. 
Q.	Now, the next day, on the 13th, did you remain in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, I remained in my house during all the time.  First of all, we took some time to get organised.  With all the people we had, we had to find a way of living there, how we were going to stay there, what we were going to eat, and so on.  There was a series of problems that had to be solved.  When you come to a house that you have not visited for a long time and when you have a large family, you have to organise yourself.  And we started organising ourselves on the 13th and the 14th, practically. 
Q.	Did you go to visit your mother during those days, the 13th and the 14th? 
A.	Considering the situation we went through in Kigali, when we arrived in the area we did not know exactly what was happening, so we had to take all necessary precautions.  Whenever I travelled, I could have groups or gatherings of people who were subtly coming to see Nzirorera.  So the first precaution I took was not to move about, because if I moved about I didn't know who was in the area.  The war was going on.  To expose myself to the population amounted to taking risks because I did not know who was there.  You could even have Inkotanyi among the local population.  

Therefore, I decided first not to go out, to stay home in my house.  I did not go to see my mother.  On the contrary, when my mother learnt that I was there, she came to my house, my father came to my house, Kazungu's mother came to my house.  Everyone came to my house.  But I, I did not go out.  I did not arrive at Byangabo.  

Throughout that period, I arrived in my mother's house for the first time on the 22nd of June when I went to the installation ceremony of Kajelijeli.  So up to the moment I left, I never went to Byangabo.  I never went to my mother's house, but my mother visited me in my house. 
Q.	And when you were back in Mukingo on the 13th and 14th of April, did you learn anything about what had occurred there on the 7th? 
A.	In fact, first of all, I had learnt that the bourgmestre of the commune had died.  An announcement was made on the radio.  I asked what happened regarding that bourgmestre.  Since there was no authority, I received information from members of my family.  So contrary to what people believed, whilst I was there -- even Kajelijeli, who's been talked about, I never saw him.  I had information.  I was told how the bourgmestre died, the circumstances in which he died.  I was also given information regarding how people killed one another.  

But, in any case, on the 7th and the 8th people were killed.  People died.  But when we arrived there, the situation seemed to be very calm.  So what needs to be noted in the Mukingo commune, contrary to what is alleged, there in that commune all the bloody events took place on the 7th and the 8th of April.  There were no other events after those two days.  When I arrived there I had information to that effect.  And we understood that the events which occurred in Kigali, the confrontations which had taken place, did not only hit or affect Kigali but had affected even the rest of the country.  So that is how I became aware of that situation. 
Q.	Did it cross your mind at all that you should punish those who had killed in Mukingo? 
A.	I believe that is what the local authorities thought, and that is why I asked what happened to the bourgmestre.  The bourgmestre had services under him.  He had a prosecutor's office in the commune which could carry out investigations.  In any case, I expected the local authorities to carry out their duties.  I do not think that you wanted me, as Nzirorera, a member of the MRND, to carry out investigations.  The commune was governed. 
Q.	Did you feel that it was your place or your responsibility to punish people in Mukingo who had committed crimes? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, I told you a while ago, where did my responsibility start, and up to what point did it go?  To begin with, what was my responsibility?  In what capacity would I have punished anyone?  I'm not an -- I was not an administrator.  Therefore, all I could suggest was that -- well, was to say that if there is a crime, no crime should go unpunished.  To say that I had responsibility, no, I did not have any responsibility.  

In what capacity would I have punished anyone?  I was not a bourgmestre, I was not a préfet, I was not a conseiller, I was not a minister of the local administration.  I had no role to play in the administration of the local communities, or I had no role in the administration of the country.  I am always told that I never acted or that I failed to act, but in what capacity would I have acted?  

I believe that you jurists should enlighten us.  Tell us what we should have done, what we should have done as political party leaders.  I was a leader of a political party.  I was one of the leaders of the 
five parties that formed the government.  As a political leader or a leader of a political party, what could I do in such circumstances?  
If a party member commits crimes -- or whenever a party member commits a crime, would the leaders of that party be put in prison?  You did law.  I'm a layman.  Apply the law and I will follow you.  Or tell me what you as a lawyer or a jurist could have done in my place, in the place of Ngirumpatse or Karemera.  All that we could do was to provide advice.  I asked what happened to the bourgmestre, the circumstances in which he died, why he died, and people gave me explanations.  So I was informed of those events when I arrived in that locality.  I became aware of that after the events had occurred.  

Now, to say that I could have punished the perpetrators, I had no powers, no -- to punish who?  
First of all, investigations should have been carried out.  I'm not a criminal investigation officer.  I had no administrative power to exercise in the Rwandan administrative set-up.  I thank you. 
Q.	We've had evidence that on the 14th of April the court of appeal was attacked in Ruhengeri.  Tutsis were killed.  And among the assailants were members of the so-called Interahamwe of Mukingo commune.  

First of all, did you know about that event on the 14th of April, as of that day? 
A.	To begin with, I was not informed of that event.  I became aware of it on the radio on the 15th of April.  Therefore, I was never aware that the court of appeal had been attacked on that day.  I learnt of it on the radio on the 15th of April when a journalist was reporting.  It was a journalist speaking.  So it was information that I was never aware of.  I never heard of that incident.  I heard about it for the first time on the radio on the 15th of April. 
Q.	We've heard that the broadcast that was put on Radio Rwanda attributed that attack to the RPF.  Was that the information you received? 
A.	Yes.  I believe it is the journalist who said that.  It is the journalist who said that the court of appeal had been attacked and that it was attacked by RPF mortars.  It was a journalist of Radio Rwanda.  That radio station -- or that journalist was based in Ruhengeri.  Perhaps he sent information to Kigali.  In any case, I don't know how they went about it, but whatever be the case, that information was broadcast on Radio Rwanda on the 15th of April. 
Q.	Now, on the 16th of April did you leave your house? 
A.	In fact, I had information to the effect that people, the government and political party leaders -- as I tried to follow what was happening, I had information that people did not go to Gitarama.  I was told that 
they -- or did not go away from Gitarama.  I was told they stayed in Gitarama.  So on the 16th of April I decided to leave my house very early, and I went to Gitarama.  And when I arrived in Gitarama, I was told that people were in Murambi.  I then went to Murambi.  I saw the people who were there.  When I met everyone -- or many people -- well, I met many people there.  

I was then able to have some information why people left Kigali, because I didn't know how 
people -- why people had left Kigali.  I was without information.  I was lost.  I went there to gather information to know the circumstances and the reasons why people left Kigali.  I did so especially as I was not informed.  I went to the Diplomat Hotel, and there at the Hôtel des Diplomates I was alone.  So I went there on the 16th.  And since the Murambi centre was full, I couldn't even have a room.  

Towards the end of the day, in fact early in the afternoon at about 4 p.m., I returned home to my village.  It was my intention to stay there, but there was no room, so I had to return home to my village. 
Q.	Did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse or Édouard Karemera on the 16th of April in Murambi? 
A.	Yes.  I think they were there. 
Q.	Did you hold any meetings among the three of you that day? 
A.	Not a meeting.  On what?  I was just seeking information on what had happened. 
Q.	Were any decisions taken by the party leadership on that day, 16th of April? 
A.	No.  I am unaware of any decision that was taken by the MRND party.  All I know is that on that day the government designated the army chief of staff.  And the following day I learnt on the radio that préfets were appointed for the -- in the Ruhengeri préfecture the préfet had been assassinated on the 
7th of April.  He was in Kigali.  So those préfets were replaced.  But we held no meeting, those of us of the MRND party, to discuss anything concerning the MRND party. 
Q.	Did you have any role in the personnel changes that were made concerning the chief of staff of the army or the préfets? 
A.	In what capacity?  This was something that was done by the government.  It is the government that decided who the army chief of staff was and not the MRND party. 
Q.	Well, the MRND had ministers in that government.  Did you provide any advice to the ministers about that? 
A.	In any case, I did not meet them. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, we know that General Bizimungu became the chief of staff replacing General Gatsinzi.  Was there any discord or dissatisfaction with General Gatsinzi that you became aware of because he was a moderate officer, or any such thing? 
A.	Gatsinzi had been appointed interim chief of staff, so that did not mean that he was the chief of staff.  He was acting.  Because at the same time he maintained his position as the military commander of the ESM -- sorry, the non-commissioned officers school.  So I do not know how he could be said to be left out.  He was acting.  And when one is acting it does not necessarily mean that one would be confirmed.  

And, secondly, when you talk about moderate, I do not know what you use to measure the degree of moderation.  I do not know who invented the word "moderate", the word "extremist".  I do not know.  So it is said that Bizimungu and this other person were moderates.  I don't know anything about it.  But having played no role either in the appointment of Gatsinzi or the appointment of General Bizimungu, I believe I am the person who is least in a position to give any explanation. 
Q.	Was there any discussion among you and Mathieu and Karemera about putting hardliners in these posts?  That's the thesis of some people, that you wanted hardliners to be chief of staff and to be préfets.  Is that true? 
A.	First of all, I had no meeting with Mathieu or Karemera on that subject.  That for one.  Secondly, I do not know who describes who and who says that I am a hardliner and that this other person is not a hardliner.  It's not because one expresses one's point of view that one becomes a hardliner.  It would appear that the people who are described as moderate are the people who cannot even say what they think or what they think depending on the circumstances.  

So I do not know.  I do not agree with that approach.  I imagine that the proponents of that theory will tell us how they came up with it. 
Q.	Did you meet President Sindikubwabo on the 16th? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, were you in Butare on the 19th of April when he made his speech? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you have any input into what he would say on that day? 
A.	No, not at all. 
Q.	And have you -- did you hear his speech on the radio? 
A.	Later, after it had been made.  But when it was being done I did not follow it.  I listened to it subsequently. 
Q.	And when you listened to it, what was your understanding as to what his message was to the people of Butare? 
A.	Listen.  I understood that President Sindikubwabo was addressing the people of his native préfecture and giving them a message of national concord, contrary to what is said here, that he said that people should begin killing one another.  I do not share that point of view.  

I do not agree with the point of view of the people who say that President Sindikubwabo himself asked that people of his préfecture should kill one another.  And it's a pity that specialists or people who purport to be specialists say that in his speech he was asking people when they had to go out to work that they should go and kill Tutsis.  That is false, and that is a misrepresentation that I do not accept. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have a time frame for the rebroadcast, please.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you give us approximately when it was that you first heard that speech. 
A.	Sindikubwabo's speech was delivered on the 19th of April, and I believe that it was rebroadcast the following day on Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	It's said that the killings in Butare didn't start until after President Sindikubwabo gave that speech.  Is that true? 
A.	No.  I do not know how people come up with such constructions.  When you read contemporary documents at our disposal, documents which were disclosed to us by the Prosecutor, on the 
16th of April 1994, the préfet of Gikongoro, Mr. Laurent Bucyibaruta -- B-U-C-Y-I-B-A-R-U-T-A, Bucyibaruta, Laurent first name -- that was the préfet of Gikongoro, the préfet of Butare, 
Mr. Jean Habyarimana -- the name Habyarimana is known, Jean-Baptiste -- these two préfets held a joint security meeting for the two préfectures.  

And in the conclusions of that meeting they pointed out that the Gikongoro communes, which already had ethnic problems -- this was already on the 16th of April.  And in that same meeting they talked of the communes of Butare that were facing ethnic problems.  

So when somebody comes here and says that it was Sindikubwabo's speech that sparked off killings in Butare, I say that is wrong.  All you have to do is look at the minutes of the meeting of the 
16th of April 1994, which was signed jointly by the préfet of Butare and the préfet of Gikongoro.  In the absence of credible witnesses, the documents can speak.  That's all I can say.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, that document is number 40 in my package of exhibits.  It's minutes of the 
	security meeting of the 16th of April 1994 signed by the two préfets.  It's been previously admitted in two trials and has -- bears the exhibit stamps for those two trials, I believe the Butare case and the 
Bizimungu trial.  And I would ask that that document now be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ802.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ802A and D. NZ802B admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, you told us you only spent one day, the 16th of April, in Murambi and returned that evening to your residence.  Did you ever hold any meetings at Murambi with Witness HH? 
A.	Not at all. 
Q.	Did you ever see him in Murambi? 
A.	Never. 
Q.	Now, what did you do on the 17th, 18th and 19th of April? 
A.	I remained at home.  But I was also preoccupied with the prevailing situation in Ruhengeri, and in the course of those days I tried to get in contact with my tenants in Gisenyi.  I was in Mukingo commune in an area where I could not contact anybody.  There was no telephone.  It was at the foot of the volcans, and I was worried about what could happen to us, particularly attacks from the volcans area, since that is where our area was located.  
So I decided to carry out an exercise of seeing how I could contact the tenant of my house, which was in Gisenyi, to be able to terminate the contract between him and myself so that he could liberate my house.  Those are the steps I took.  And before I returned to Gitarama, I believe on the 20th of April -- if I remember correctly, I returned to Gitarama around the 20th of April.  But at that time I was trying to take steps to see how I could terminate the contract of the tenant in my house in Gisenyi.  
Q.	Did you yourself move to -- travel to Gisenyi during that period, 17, 18 or 19 April? 
A.	I was not forced to go there every day.  The first time I sent him a message, and the second time he said he would like to see me to consider the practical modalities.  And I think that during that period I went to Gisenyi on only one occasion.  I went and returned on the same day to see the person who was occupying my house.  It must have been on the 18th.  In fact, I do not recall the exact date, but I know that between the 17th and the 19th I took a trip to Gisenyi to see my tenant, and then I returned.  And around the 20th I went back to Gitarama where I spent a number of days. 
Q.	We've had evidence in this case of the filing of a report indicating that Édouard Karemera and the minister of defence, Bizimana, had made a mission to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi préfectures on the 
18th and 19th of April.  Did you see them at all during those days? 
A.	No.  I was not even informed of that mission.  I only saw the document when I was here. 
Q.	In that document it says that the youth are already being trained.  Did you know anything about that? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, when you went on the 20th to Gitarama, how long did you stay there? 
A.	In fact, I believe I got to Gitarama around the 20th.  In any case, the 20th or the 21st, if I remember correctly.  On the 20th.  And I stayed there in Gitarama from the 20th, I believe, right through to the 28th.  I was there for more -- for a week.  

And in the meantime I was able to sign the communiqué with Karemera, the communiqué we sent to the Interahamwe in the month of April 1994.  It must have been on the 22nd or 23rd Karemera and myself got together.  We analysed the situation, and we issued a communiqué which we addressed to the Interahamwe.  And we also issued the communiqué -- or after the -- our concerns regarding the negative role which the youth wings of political parties were -- had purportedly been involved in.  So it appeared necessary for Karemera and myself to issue a communiqué, and that is the communiqué that we both signed.  

And on the 28th I went back home in Mukingo, because I had agreed with my tenant in Gisenyi that he would liberate my house or vacate my house on the 30th of April and that he was going to give me the keys of the house, and I would take measures to get into the house at the beginning of May. 
Q.	Where did you stay while you were in Gitarama? 
A.	In fact, when I got to Gitarama I was given the room of a minister who had left.  I believe he had gone on mission and had overstayed.  And when I got there I was given that room on a provisional basis, and I was told that it was Ruhumuliza's room.  Gaspard Ruhumuliza was the minister of tourism.  I believe Ruhumuliza is a name that is known here.  And that is the room that I occupied at the time.  I was told that he could arrive at any time, and I was therefore in a hurry to leave. 
Q.	Did you see Mathieu Ngirumpatse during your stay in Gitarama between the 20th and 28th of April? 
A.	No.  I did not see him.  Had he been there, he too would have signed the communiqué. 
Q.	Now, that communiqué is in evidence as D. NZ33 dated the 23rd of April.  Can you tell us what led to the issuance of that communiqué.  Did the government make any requests of you?  Did you do that on your own?  What was the initiative that led to the issuance of that communiqué? 
A.	I should point out that that was our own initiative, but the government also was concerned about the prevailing situation in the Gitarama region, and we also thought that we had to make our contribution.  And when we sat down with Karemera we thought that it was necessary for us to do something.  So it is not the government that asked us to do that.  We were not under the authority of the government.  We didn't have any orders to receive from them. 
Q.	Now, in that communiqué the leadership of the MRND requested the members to support the government in its efforts to bring back security to the country, and it thanked the Interahamwe and the members of the national committee of the Interahamwe for assisting the population in providing their support to the army and in stopping the enemy from killing all Rwandans.  

And then it went on to say that the RPF's evil acts should not discourage the youth in their commitment to maintain security and ensure peace, and it was necessary to search and denounce the enemy, wherever he may be, but this should not be used as a way to attack innocent people who had nothing to do with the war.  

And you asked the national committee of the Interahamwe to investigate acts of some Interahamwe who had gone against the mission of maintaining security among all Rwandans, and you called on all MRND members, especially Interahamwe, to abide by the MRND creed of peace and unity.  And you said that those engaged in criminal acts who called themselves Interahamwe were enemies of peace and people who wanted to tarnish the image of the Interahamwe, and you denounced those people.  And you denounced those who attacked innocent people because of their ethnicity.  

Now, first of all, why was it necessary to thank the Interahamwe before calling upon them to stop killing? 
A.	In fact, when we met the leaders of the Interahamwe committee on the 11th of April, in the report that they gave us on the 11th of April I told you that there was a first report where they were saying that people were receptive and that their message bore fruit and that some people were saying that when these pacification tours took place in the various secteurs of the préfecture and that the RPF got to know that the killings might indeed be stopped, it is in that same night that the fighting was intensified.  
I think that a witness said what happened in the night of the 11th of April 1994.  In a way, the Interahamwe committee and the people they contacted had understood the message of the government and the MRND.  And this is probably what irritated the RPF.  It realised that its objective may be undermined if the killings were stopped.  So the RPF was fishing in troubled waters, and it is these killings that made it easy for the RPF.  

So we never had the opportunity to say that those people actually understood the message and relayed it to the people conveniently.  So whatever happened was not their fault, and that is why we decided to send this message so that they should understand that we appreciated what they did, something that we could not do ourselves, because they were not able to go right through to the end of their mission on the 12th of April.  That is the first thing.  

Secondly, we saw the situation as it was, and we could see that the youth referred to as Interahamwe was targeted, and it was necessary to make a distinction between who was Interahamwe za MRND and who was not.  And we asked them to identify those people who were bearing the name Interahamwe if they were not Interahamwe.  Why am I saying so?  

When we got to Interahamwe -- let me dwell on this for a minute.  Gitarama was the stronghold of the MDR.  And when we got there, we were very surprised and astonished to see that on all the barriers in Gitarama préfecture, everybody was wearing the distinctive sign of MDR (sic), were wearing something with the effigy of President Habyarimana.  And we were very surprised to see how it was the 
MDR -- MRND, rather, that had become the majority party in Gitarama.  So we realised that there was something wrong somewhere, and it was necessary to draw the attention of our people, the militants of our party, to that phenomenon.  That was an abnormal phenomenon.  

You heard the testimonies of Préfet Uwizeye here.  He said that the Interahamwe came from Kigali, that they came and invaded Gitarama préfecture.  Just imagine that situation:  A majority MDR area invaded by a few people who came from Kigali.  Is it possible for an entire préfecture of over 800,000 people should be invaded by a tiny group of people not exceeding 1,000 people?  If they had come together to defend their préfecture, would they have actually had a problem with the Interahamwe?  

So we understood that there was a real problem, and that is why we sent a message requesting them to identify those who were bearing the name Interahamwe, whereas they were indeed not Interahamwe.  These were people who were committing crimes and who wanted 
Interahamwe za MRND to be responsible for those crimes.  We told them that they also had to know that any criminal should bear the responsibility of his or her crimes and that the crimes should be individual.  They should be responsible personally and not anybody else.  
So, briefly, that was the spirit of the communiqué, and I think that it was necessary for us to issue it.  In any case, we were not calling on people to kill.  We are said to have said a number of things.  But in that message we did not see any -- I don't see anywhere where we were inciting the Interahamwe to kill people.  

Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I was a little too long, but I thought it was necessary.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.

Mr. President, would you like to take our luncheon recess at this time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take our luncheon recess now.

(Court resumed at 1404H) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Good afternoon, everyone.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Nzirorera.  
A.	Good afternoon, Mr. Robinson.  
Q.	We've had evidence that on the 18th of April 1994, at Murambi, there was a meeting held between the prime minister and some bourgmestres and the préfet of Gitarama.  Did you attend that meeting? 
A.	No.  I did not attend that meeting on the 18th of April 1994.  
Q.	We've also had evidence that -- we've also had evidence that on the 22nd of April 1994 -- or thereabouts, General Ndindiliyimana arrived in Murambi.  Did you see him there or learn of his visit? 
A.	There must have been a mistake in the interpretation.  I heard 2 October 1994.  Is that an interpretation problem?  
Q.	Yes, it is.  Let's do that over again.  On the 22nd of April -- or approximately thereabouts -- did you learn of a visit of General Ndindiliyimana to Murambi? 
A.	Yes.  As I told you, around the 20th of April, I went to Gitarama.  I also told you that it was on the 
22nd -- or, rather, 20th -- 20th -- no.  Rather, the communiqué of the 23rd of April 1994 which Karemera and I signed, that is, the communiqué which we talked about a short while ago, which was meant for the Interahamwe.  This communiqué, we released it following a visit by General Augustin Ndindiliyimana and Colonel Rusatira, I believe, a visit which they made to the Gitarama préfecture during which they met Prime Minister Jean Kambanda.  

During that meeting by the two officers with Prime Minister Jean Kambanda, the minister of defence was also present in their discussions, that is, Augustin Bizimana.  They discussed problems of security and the atrocities that were purportedly committed by members of the population and some 
youth wings.  

It was after that discussion that the minister of defence informed us, Karemera and myself, about the remarks that had been made during that discussion between the prime minister and the officers in the presence of the minister of defence.  It is, therefore, following that meeting that we were informed of that situation.  

Then Karemera and myself took the initiative to draft and sign the communiqué of 23 April 1994 as our contribution to appeasing the ever degrading situation.  That was the context in which I became aware of the visit of those two military officers.  Since I was already in Gitarama -- and we also must understand our communiqué of the 23rd of April 1994 to the Interahamwe -- or to the militants of our party and, in particular, to the Interahamwe in -- Interahamwe za MRND in that context.  I thank you.  
Q.	Now, in the communiqué it refers to the MRND leadership -- denounced those engaged in criminal acts and calling themselves Interahamwe.  And it went on to ask the Interahamwe to investigate those people and to denounce them.  "These people are the enemy of peace who want to tarnish the image of the Interahamwe." 

Now, what was this phenomenon of all of a sudden, after the 6th of April, people who were not members of the MRND or members of its youth wing began calling themselves Interahamwe? 
A.	I believe that the explanation for the situation can be found in the chaos that arose from the resumption of the war by the RPF.  As I told you a short while ago, from the 6th of April, people were wondering what had happened to all the other youth wings of the other political parties.  Only the Interahamwe were being talked about here and there.  And the expression itself -- or the term itself became so fluid that it was difficult to -- to have a handle on it.  

The MRND had its youth wing, the Interahamwe za MRND, which the opposition referred to as people who were not represented across the country but who were present only in certain areas.  But suddenly after the 6th of April, what happened?  All those who were engaged in the killings became known as the Interahamwe.  That is a phenomenon that surprised us.  

I told you a short while ago that when we arrived in Gitarama, the bastion of the MDR -- well, everybody was wearing the medals bearing the image of the president and all the effigies of MRND, medals 
with -- brand new medals.  And we were very, very surprised because these were probably not just members of internal political parties, but also some recruits -- or some persons from within the RPF.  

Clearly, it would appear that members of the RPF took advantage of the situation to put on the -- should I say, the distinctive gear of the MRND.  And it is for this reason that we say that the question must be asked:  Who is the Interahamwe, and who is not the Interahamwe?  Is one an Interahamwe simply because they're a killer and a criminal?  Or who is the Interahamwe?  

So as far as I am concerned, that trend was a result of the chaos that arose from the resumption of the war on the 7th of April 1994.  
Q.	Now, if there were people from the MDR party, or PSD, or PL who were now wearing the MRND clothing and wearing the photo of President Habyarimana, how do you explain that?  Was it some kind of solidarity for the late president?  Was it some kind of reaction to the war?  How do you explain why a member of another party would all of a sudden, after the 6th of April, start wearing the MRND clothing and become Interahamwe? 
A.	I do not believe that it was a matter of solidarity with the deceased president.  These were indeed people who were actually troublemakers, so to speak.  Because I'm not only thinking about the youth wings from within the country, because there must have also been infiltrators of the RPF who had infiltrated the entire country and were also bearing those insignia of the party.  And they took advantage of that chaos to commit crimes which, in the end, were ascribed to the Interahamwe -- well, including the Interahamwe za MRND.  And even today, those crimes have been ascribed to the MRND itself.  
Q.	Now, in this communiqué you say that the MRND leadership asks others to denounce whoever might dare to kill his neighbour.  You request strongly people to stop causing more harm to themselves 
or by destroying their own or their neighbours' houses.  And you say that, "The enemy who attacks Rwanda is known.  We should face that one."  You denounce people who have attacked innocent people because of their ethnicity.  

Now, were you using some kind of double language, or were you insincere, or did you really mean that?  Because that's very strong language asking people to stop killing, and you're sitting here charged with encouraging the killing.  
A.	Not at all.  When we say this -- when we spoke, it was in very sincere terms -- sincere language, mindful of the situation which was one that was quite preoccupying.  We had been down on the ground.  We saw how people were dying.  And that was our concern, even though it has been misinterpreted today -- misinterpreted to meet certain objectives that those who interpreted it that way intend to achieve.  

As for us, it was our belief at that time that all we could do was to call on members of the population to abstain from killing each other.  That was all we could do.  The only strength or power we had was to issue these messages which came from the depths of our hearts.  So how can we talk about doublespeak?  We didn't have any coded languages.  

Now, if you look at the communiqué, who would those codes -- or that coded language have been designed for, given that the communiqué was broadcast over the radio?  Those who accuse us of doublespeak are giving us intentions that we never had because we were truly sincere in our intent.  
And this is because the killings, the massacres and the destruction of human life was something that needed to be denounced and checked.  This is what we did.  

Clearly -- to the best of our ability but also mindful of the powers that were bestowed in us, if we still had them at all -- that was all we could do at the time.  
Q.	Did you have any other means of communicating with the MRND membership at this time other than through the radio? 
A.	No.  That was the only medium through which we could communicate with the public, that is, through these radio announcements.  That was the only medium.  
Q.	Were the MRND structures working after the 6th of April?  Or préfectoral committees, committees at the commune level, secteur, cellule, were they functioning at that time? 
A.	Not at all.  We were dispersed here and there.  We had abandoned our offices in Kigali.  We did not have any staff.  We had nothing.  So in the same manner as the central administration, the organs of the MRND were not functional.  We did what we could with the limited resources that were available to us.  
Q.	While you were in Murambi during this period of the 20th to the 27th or 28th of April, did you have any meetings with anybody from the national committee of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  I did not as much as see any member of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  I did not meet anybody.  
Q.	We have in evidence Exhibit D. NZ34, which is a communiqué issued by the members of the 
national committee of the Interahamwe on the 25th of April, in which they're calling for the respect of human rights.  Do you know how that communiqué came to be issued? 
A.	That communiqué was released -- I -- I don't know where it was drafted, but I know that it existed.  The authors or the signatories to the -- to that communiqué are the Interahamwe -- were referring to a meeting that they had held with the chief of staff, I believe, and the préfet of Kigali.  Now, when I talk about the Interahamwe here, I am referring to the national committee of the Interahamwe.  They issued that communiqué along the same lines as the plea for security and respect for human rights in the -- in the main.  

They also referred to the manner in which people were treated at the roadblocks and requested that those who were stopped at the roadblocks should not be expeditiously tried but, rather, be handed over to the administrative authorities.  They insisted on the need for the checking or controls at roadblocks to be done transparently so that people will not hasten to settle scores or suspect innocent persons of this and that.  

They also requested that humanitarian organisations, such as the International Red Cross or any others who could afford assistance to refugees or displaced persons, that such organisations should be allowed to work or that their tasks should be facilitated.  

Well, I heard the announcement over the radio.  And my understanding is that they wanted to 
facilitate -- or implement the recommendations that came out of the meeting with the officials of the PVK and the leadership of the army.  So in a nutshell, I believe that that communiqué was in the same thrust as efforts to restore peace and security, which we ourselves had also engaged in on the 23rd of April 1994.  That is what I can say regarding that communiqué.  
Q.	Now, on the 27th of April, a communiqué was issued by the MRND leadership, signed by Mr. Karemera.  It's in evidence as D. NZ35.  Can you tell us how that communiqué came to be issued and what was its contents.  
A.	Yes.  That communiqué must also be understood within the context of our own communiqué of the 23rd of April 1994 and also in the context of the instruction from the prime minister of the 27th of April 1994 for the restoration of security -- that is, the instruction of the prime minister for the restoration and re-establishment of peace and security.  That is the context within which that communiqué must be understood.  

It was signed by Édouard Karemera.  And, yes, I had a discussion with him on that communiqué, and he signed the communiqué.  We had talked about it while we were in Gitarama.  And I think I left Gitarama leaving it for Karemera to finalise and sign the communiqué, that is, on the 
26th or the 27th of May.  That is when I left.  But he's the one who signed it, and he signed it after I had left Gitarama.  
Q.	And what was the message that was communicated to the MRND members on the 27th of April in that communiqué? 
A.	The message was similar to previous messages calling for peace and security and calm -- and a return to calm.  It also called on the cellule officials to take charge of the security of its inhabitants.  And this must also be understood within the context of the instruction of the prime minister of the 
27th of April 1994.  So I think that you would find some complementarity in the content of that particular communiqué and the content of the instruction of the 27th of April 1994 from the prime minister.  

This communiqué does not, in any way and manner, encourage people or members of the MRND to commit anything.  It actually calls for sanctions against those who would engage in any such criminal actions.  
Q.	Now, when you left Murambi on the 27th or 28th of April, did you take anybody with you? 
A.	Yes.  As I have already told you, I arrived in Gitarama around the 20th, and I spent a week there.  And I had to return to my native area and also go to Gisenyi, because I had agreed with one of -- with the tenant of my house that, at the end of the month of April, he had to leave my house.  It is in that context that I left Gitarama.  I wanted to go back to make sure that my house would have been vacated so that I can move in.  

So when I left Gitarama, I was able to go with members of Laurent Semanza's family -- 
Semanza, Laurent; namely, his wife who was in Gitarama and his children.  He handed over some of his children to me so that I could take them along with me.  So I took them to my house in my native village, and they stayed at my house when we arrived in Mukingo.  
Q.	Now, we've had evidence from Witness BTH when he first came and testified that there was a meeting on approximately the 21st of April 1994, in Mukingo commune in which the new préfet, Basile, was introduced to the population.  Did you attend that meeting? 
A.	No.  I am not aware of that meeting.  If any such meeting did take place -- well, in any event I was not in Mukingo on the 21st.  
Q.	Did you ever hear of any such meeting having taken place before you arrived here in Arusha and started reading the Prosecution's disclosure? 
A.	No.  I never heard mention of that meeting.  
Q.	Now, it's contained in your indictment that there was a fundraising meeting held on the 25th of April 1994 in Gisenyi led by Félicien Kabuga in order to raise money for the army.  Did you participate in that meeting? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you know anything about that meeting? 
A.	No.  I did not hear anything about it.  I only found out about it in the documents later on when I arrived here.  
Q.	Now, when you returned to Mukingo at the end of April, how long did you stay there? 
A.	When I arrived there -- well, once I -- the -- I had settled the Semanza family, then I made arrangements to travel to Gisenyi and find -- and meet my tenant.  The tenant handed over the keys of my house to me at the end of the month of April as agreed.  He moved out of the house on the 30th of April.  And on 1 May, I started to move my family from my native village to Gisenyi -- to my villa in Gisenyi.  So everybody who was there was moved, and we left a few guards.  And in early May, I was for all intents and purposes settled in Gisenyi.  
Q.	And what's the distance between Mukingo and Gisenyi? 
A.	It's about 40 kilometres.  The road is tarmacked.  The 40 kilometres -- 40-42 kilometres are tarmacked.  
Q.	Now, what about this man *********************?  What happened to him? 
A.	************** was in my house.  At some point in time, he told me that he wanted to move out.  ************** hails from Gisenyi, but far away the sous-préfecture known as Ngororero -- Ngororero, N-G-O-R-E -- N-G-O-R-O-R-E-R-O -- the sub-préfecture Ngororero in Gisenyi préfecture.  It is the sub-préfecture that shares a border with Gitarama préfecture.  

He told me that he could not go to his place, but that he could go to communes that share a border with Gisenyi in order to be able to follow up some activities -- the activities of the office of which he was in charge.  So when he left my house, he told me he was going to Gisenyi préfecture.  I believe that he stayed sometimes in Gisenyi and at other times he stayed in neighbouring communes.  But he personally went to Gisenyi prefecture, but I do not know exactly where he went to live.  So he left.  And when I moved house, I took with me the family of Colonel Setako as well as the family of Semanza.  

So these are the people I took with me to Gisenyi in my house.  And later on -- a few days later on, Semanza's family also found a house elsewhere in Gisenyi town.  They stayed practically in my house, that is, the members of the Setako's family stayed in my house together with my own family.  
Q.	And the four children that you had sent with Higaniro on the 11th of April, when did they rejoin your family? 
A.	Higaniro lived in Gisenyi, but not exactly in town.  He lived in a -- or, rather, he had a house on the -- or near Lake Kivu in the direction of BRALIRWA.  BRALIRWA is the brewery for beer.  That is where he lived.  

When they learnt that I had arrived in Gisenyi -- because sometimes Higaniro would come to Gisenyi town, and that is where I asked him whether he could bring me the children.  In the month of May, he handed to me the children that he had taken with him.  He did that.  It was very important because during his stay there he was also getting ready to travel to Europe.  
Q.	So effectively, by the very beginning of May, you were no longer in Mukingo commune; correct? 
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	While you were in Mukingo, had you heard of anyone being raped? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever meet any of these so-called Interahamwe while you were in Mukingo from the 
12th to the 30th of April? 
A.	Not at all.  
Q.	Now, there's also evidence that, on or about the 30th of April 1994, you led a meeting at the préfecture office in Kigali of conseillers and Interahamwe.  Is that true? 
A.	On the 13th of April?  Can you please kindly repeat the question.  
Q.	Yes.  I think we had another translation error.  On the 30th -- on or about the 30th of April, there's been evidence that you led a meeting at the préfecture office in Kigali of conseillers and of Interahamwe.  
Is that true? 
A.	That's not true.  I had no capacity to convene conseillers to a meeting.  That is absolutely untrue.  
Q.	Were you in Kigali at the end of April 1994? 
A.	No.  Since I have just told you that I was moving house, I believe those who fabricated that scenario are wrong.  They did not know exactly where I was at that moment.  
Q.	Now, with respect to the replacement of the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune, there's been evidence of some meetings held in April 1994, in the Mukingo commune office to elect the new bourgmestre.  Did you participate in any of those meetings? 
A.	I did not participate in any of those meetings.  
Q.	Did you ever ask anyone to support Juvénal Kajelijeli as the replacement bourgmestre? 
A.	Never.  I never did that.  
Q.	Now, the Prosecution has charged that you participated in a meeting on the 6th of May 1994, in the city of Ruhengeri, in which Prime Minister Kambanda also addressed those assembled.  Did you attend that meeting? 
A.	No.  I was never in Ruhengeri from April to July 1994.  I do not know how the Prosecutor came about imagining such things.  I believe, as you saw, he referred to Nyiramasuhuko's diary where my name was written.  If someone has -- writes my name somewhere, I do not believe that it was I who was there.  In any case, from April to July I never set foot in Ruhengeri.  

And I believe the Prosecution never brought any witness to testify that they saw me or met me in Ruhengeri on the 6th of May.  Therefore, that allegation is unfounded.  
Q.	Now, when you settled in Gisenyi at the very beginning of May, did there come a time when you once again returned to Gitarama? 
A.	Yes.  I returned to Gitarama from Gisenyi on the 8th.  Around the 8th -- the 8th of May I went to Gitarama.  And I took advantage of that trip to go to Kigali as well.  That travel also enabled me to participate in the meeting of the MRND political bureau, which meeting was held on the 
12th and 13th of May 1994.  Therefore, around the 8th of May, I left Gisenyi.  I went to Gitarama.  Thereafter, I went to Kigali.  

I went to Kigali for strictly personal reasons.  In fact, I can expose or present the reasons to the Court.  
When I left my residence in Gishushu in Kigali, I left with nothing.  I had nothing on me.  When I left Kigali, I still had nothing.  When I arrived in my home village, it happened that, considering the fact that since 1993 I was not visiting that residence -- the residence in my home village because of the humidity in that area, because it is a volcanic area where it is cold and humid and the clothes I left there deteriorated.  I took the clothes down -- I took the clothes to Kigali.  

When I realised how intense the fighting was, I thought that I had to return to Kigali to see whether I could recuperate some property which I still had in Kigali in areas which, perhaps, were not yet under the control of the RPF.  I was thinking in particular of vehicles.  I had a pool of vehicles, but I was unable to find a driver when I arrived there.  

My wife also had told me that I could find the accountant of our company to find out whether he had some money left in the safe so that we should be able to collect the money.  

So that was the purpose -- that was the reason why I went to Kigali on that date because I realised -- I realised that as -- or the longer the war lasted, we were forced to leave our residence, go to Kigali, and from Kigali to the commune, and then Gis -- to my commune and then to Gisenyi.  So we thought that, in the final analysis, we would perhaps even be forced to leave Gisenyi.  

So, in brief, I thought I should bring this to the attention of the Court so that people should not think that I moved from Gisenyi in order to go and lead or chair an Interahamwe meeting in Kigali.

1445H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Coming back to being in Gisenyi on the 8th of May 1994, how did you get fuel for the vehicle to go to Gitarama? 
A.	During the period referred to, the army had requisitioned all préfecture petrol stations.  And in order to have access to fuel, it was necessary to ask for authorisation from the army, in other words, the area -- from the area commander.  It was the area commander who could authorise a petrol station to serve or provide fuel to anyone who wanted to travel. 
Q.	And who did you see when you went to get fuel to try to authorise you to get that fuel? 
A.	The area commander of Gisenyi was Anatole Nsengiyumva.  I believe he told you that when he appeared before this Court.  He told you that I contacted him and that -- he told me the petrol station to which I could go in order to have fuel. 
Q.	Now, you've heard the testimony of Witness ZF that he saw you in the officers' mess of the 
	Gisenyi camp on two occasions, once with Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza, once with Félicien Kabuga and Colonel Bagosora; is that true? 
A.	I was never in the military camp of Gisenyi, at least not in the officers' mess.  I do not know that 
	officers' mess.  I've never set foot therein.  

I went to that camp.  I phoned Anatole.  He said the office was near the entrance to the camp.  That is where I met him.  And I asked him whether he could give me fuel, and he directed me to a petrol station in town.  

In any case, I do not know what ZF is talking about.  In fact, it's purely a -- his -- the figment of his own imagination.  I never set foot in Gisenyi military camp.  I was never there with Bagosora.  I was never in the officers' mess in that camp.  I do not even know the location of that officers' mess. 
Q.	And what about the ceremony in which the recruits for the 42nd battalion were graduating in Gisenyi?  Witness ZF said you attended and participated in that ceremony and distributed weapons.  Did you ever attend such a ceremony? 
A.	Mr. Robinson, I am not a sole -- I am not a soldier.  I do not even know -- I am not even aware of that battalion.  That's all I can say in answer to your question.  I don't know anything about it.  It was mentioned.  It was -- it was said here before this Court.  But I am not aware of it.  

I don't know anything about a training of soldiers.  What did I have to do with the training of soldiers, giving out diplomas to soldiers?  I do not know.  

But in any case, our Court -- this Court heard the Prosecution evidence, and it will assess the -- that evidence.  I am not aware of that battalion.  I heard about that battalion for the first time when I was here. 
Q.	Now, you went to -- from Gisenyi to Gitarama on the 8th of May.  And then what date was it that you went to Kigali? 
A.	I went to Kigali in the company of Laurent Semanza, whom I met in Gisenyi -- or, rather, in Gitarama.  Because when I took his family along, he remained in Gitarama.  So when I arrived in Gitarama, I went with him to Kigali.  I left on the 9th, and I returned on the 10th.  I returned to Gitarama on the 10th.  I stayed the night in Kigali.  
Q.	Did you have any soldiers with you? 
A.	I had the -- two.  I had told you that I had two soldiers with me.  But also between Kigali and Gitarama, soldiers were going to and fro from Kigali because the government was in Gitarama.  So there was always an opportunity to find a way of travelling to Kigali.  
Q.	Now, when you got to Kigali, what steps did you take to try to recover the money that you thought you could possibly recover there? 
A.	In fact, we had a company, a family company.  We had a woman who was the accountant of the company.  She was a Tutsi woman.  My wife had given me her address, the address of the place where she lived in Muhima.  Muhima is M-U-H-I-M-A.

She was the one who operated the safe.  One of the safes was at the petrol station.  And when I went to look for that woman, when we arrived at the Nyamirambo station -- or petrol station, first of all, we met that -- we realised that the petrol station had been requisitioned by the army and that the safe had been taken away.  We do not know who took it away.  So the matter was closed. 
Q.	And were you able to get any clothing in Kigali? 
A.	No.  I could not get to my residence in Gishushu.  I did not have clothes.  Perhaps my friends near you are aware of that.  I was the most impoverished person because I did not have any clothes.  I could not get to my residence.  It was occupied by the RPF.  
Q.	Did you see Colonel Setako during that trip to Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  In the month of May, he was in Kigali.  And I would like to point out to the Chamber that it was in his house that I spent the night.  I spent the night there together with Semanza. 
Q.	Now, did you go to the préfecture office in Kigali at all during that visit? 
A.	Yes.  At the time I was trying to go to Nyamirambo in the company of Semanza, we went through PVK.  And there we met Préfet Renzaho.  We greeted him and continued our journey.  
Q.	And while you were near the préfecture office, did you hear or see the results of the war? 
A.	Yes.  As I told you, there was bombing going on in Kigali.  We could see shells falling.  People were hiding.  

At the préfecture office there were many people.  People lived in or stayed in the corridor of the préfecture office and also in the basement.  Everyone was afraid.  
Moreover, I should also tell you that on the night -- on the night of the 9th to the 10th, there was so much bombing in Kigali that I wondered why I had taken the risk of returning to this area from which I had miraculously escaped.  We asked ourselves what we came to do in Kigali because we indeed felt the danger of being in Kigali.  In Kigali there was practically no civilian.  You had mainly soldiers. 

So it was an unsuccessful trip that I made there.  I obtained nothing from the trip. 
Q.	Now, we have evidence that on the 10th of May 1994 an invitation to the members of the 
	MRND political bureau was issued by Mr. Karemera inviting them to attend a meeting on the 
	12th of May 1994.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Yes.  When I arrived in Gitarama, I was informed of that invitation.  And as I told you, I stayed in Gitarama and participated in the meeting of the 12th to the 13th.  I left Gitarama after the meeting on the 13th. 
Q.	And can you tell us if Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended the meeting of the 12th and 13th.  
A.	No.  Mathieu Ngirumpatse was not in Rwanda.  The meeting had been summoned by Karemera.  And when I arrived in Gitarama, I was also there.  I attended the meeting.  But Mathieu was not present.  Had he been there, he would have chaired the meeting.  So the meeting was chaired by Édouard Karemera in his capacity as vice-chairman or vice-president of the MRND. 
Q.	And who else attended that meeting besides you and Karemera? 
A.	Those who attended the meeting -- well, in fact, the invitation to the meeting was addressed to the members of the political bureau of the MRND and also to ministers of the MRND party.  To be more specific, the politburo of the MRND was made up of the 11th pres -- 11 chairmen of the MRND at préfectoral level plus four members of the steering committee of the MRND plus the four presidents of the MRND commissions.  In theory, therefore, those are the persons who were ordinarily convened to that meeting as members -- or in their capacity as members of the political bureau.  

Mindful of the prevailing situation, and in order to be able to gather some information, the request was made that ministers of the MRND party be invited to the meeting.  But you would see that there was an overlapping of functions to the extent that some of the ministers were at the same time chairman of the MRND party at préfectoral level.  So that was the list of participants or those who attended the meeting.  

But not all who were convened attended.  Only those who were available were able to attend.  And for the bureau of the MRND, only myself and Karemera were present at the meeting. 
Q.	Now, what about Ferdinand Kabagema?  Did you ever see him after the 6th of April? 
A.	No, I did not. 
Q.	And what became of him? 
A.	When we left the country, it would appear that Kabagema was in Bukavu in southern Ngoma close to Cyangugu.  And that is where he died. 
Q.	Now, are you able to recall the approximate number of people who attended this meeting? 
A.	I would put it at approximately -- at about ten -- ten persons.  Not all persons attended. 
Q.	And what was the purpose of calling this meeting in 12th, 13th May?
A.	The issue was not that there were not any items for the agenda.  The situation in itself raised a number of problems.  First of all, the ministers were invited so that they could brief us on the situation and on the management of the war situation because we were not part of the government apparatus or the administration.  So we needed some information as to what was -- and what was expected to happen.  That is why ministers were invited, in order to brief us and provide us with information, given that we did not have all the information.  

Secondly, there were concerns about some constitutional matters.  We had the additional protocol to the protocol agreement of the 7th of April 1992, establishing the interim government of the 8th of April.  President Sindikubwabo, Théodore should have been the interim president for 80 days -- or 90 days, rather.  And the question then was what would happen after those 90 days because, apparently, the elections would not take place although they were expected to take place.  

However, there was another problem.  One of the tasks or duties of the interim government was to seek to negotiate with the RPF and to take steps in that direction with a view to concluding such negotiations within six weeks.  So from the 12th of April -- or, rather, from the 8th of April to the 12th, 13th of May, that was one month already lost.  So we needed to know what was expected to happen thereafter.  So we were faced with these problems, and we needed to engage in discussions with other political parties.  

Another point, which was not the least significant, was that MRND staff within the administration and the director of cabinet, namely, Mr. Enoch Ruhigira -- Ruhigira, R-U-H-I-G-E-R-A (sic) -- Enoch was the director of cabinet of President Habyarimana.  And upon the formation of the government on the 8th of April 1994, the decision was taken to maintain Enoch Ruhigira in the position of director of cabinet of the president of the republic.  But up to that date, namely, the 12th of May, he had not yet returned to that position. 

Similarly, the minister of internal affairs, who was of the MRND party, namely, 
Mr. Faustin Munyaneza (sic), M-U-N-Y-E-Z-E-S-A (sic).  Munyaneza (sic), who was the 
minister of the interior at the time, had travelled with the president of the republic to Dar es Salaam on the 6th of April.  And he was also maintained in that position.  But up till that date, he had not yet returned to the country to take up his duties at the ministry of the interior, which, by the way, was a ministry that was very busy during that period.  

It is within the context of those difficulties that these issues were scrutinised during the meeting of the 12th and 13th of April (sic) within the polit -- political bureau meeting of the MRND.  So in -- in very broad strokes, those are the -- that -- that is the purpose of that meeting. 
Q.	And was it decided at that meeting who the MRND would nominate to replace the minister of interior? 
A.	No.  We needed, first of all, to adopt and agree on a number of principles, that is, establish the existence of a number of problems, and then decide who would replace whom. 
Q.	Just so that there's no confusion about the date.  We're speaking of the month of May and not April; correct?  I think maybe there's some -- it came out different in the translation.  But this is the 12th and 13th of May; correct? 
A.	Yes.  I said 12th and 13th of May 1994. 
Q.	Okay.  At the end of this meeting of the political bureau, was a communiqué issued? 
A.	Yes.  We signed a communiqué. 
MR. ROBINSON:
That's in evidence as part of Exhibit P. 247.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you tell us what were the points of the communiqué.  
A.	Yes.  I believe that we revisited the points that have been mentioned in that release.  And I think that a short while ago, while talking about the purpose of the meeting, I virtually enumerated all those points.  

So what I am saying is that we asked for information from the MRND ministers who were part of government.  We asked about the security situation and defence of the national territory.  And I think that these are the points that needed some clarification.  

And at the end of the meeting, our recommendation was for government to consider the organisation of a civil defence system for the country.  As for the other points, they related to the eventual vacancy which I have already talked about and which were contained on -- in the release of 13th April -- rather, 13th of May 1994. 
Q.	Now, in the communiqué it indicates that the -- the MRND thanks the population for its positive reception of the message of pacification and says that acts of vandalism and human rights violation have practically ceased in the country, and the MRND called upon the authorities to continue to neutralise all those criminals.  Was that, in fact, your understanding, that acts of vandalism and human rights violations had practically ceased in the country as of the middle of May?
A.	The government, as a matter of fact, was making a number of efforts, including the pacification campaign undertaken from the 29th of May -- no -- rather, 29th of April in various préfectures.  You are aware of the peace or pacification messages through the speech of the prime minister, the speech of President Sindikubwabo across the country and speeches by various ministers, including the minister of information.  
So the government was making a number of efforts to try to check and stop the forces of evil.  And we ought to commend ourselves for that because even the ministers of the MRND informed us that we were in a war situation, that the war was advancing, and that it was also sustaining the chaos and acts of violence within the country.  However, it can be said that the government did its level best and that, compared to what had obtained in the month of April in respect of the intensity of the killings, government tried to slow things down.  But on the other hand, the RPF was intensifying its fighting.

1515H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Did the government offer to stop the fighting for ceasefires at various times since the 7th of April?
A.	There were several offers for ceasefire, even beginning on the 15th of April.  There was the UNAMIR mediation between the belligerent parties, which was rejected by the RPF when a ceasefire offer was made.  After the 15th of April -- on the 23rd of April, there was another offer of a ceasefire unilaterally signed by the Rwandan government in Gbadolite on the 23rd of April 1994.  

	The Rwandan delegation signed -- Minister Ntagerura at the time is the one who signed.  But the RPF did not show up and did not sign.  From Gbadolite -- that is in Zaire -- the Rwandan delegation came here to Arusha to meet the facilitator, and the RPF was invited to that meeting.  A document had been prepared for a ceasefire and for termination of hostilities.  On the 6th of May, I think Mr. Booh-Booh told you that he met the delegation in Nairobi upon his return from Arusha.  Once again, Minister Ntagerura, who was in charge of those negotiations on behalf of the government, signed, but the RPF refused to sign.  

We have that document with us.  So there was nothing else we could do.  The RPF had opted -- opted for full or total war.  And that is what happened. 
Q.	I would like to direct your attention to item number 42 in our packet of exhibits, which is an interview with you on the radio.  We have this in English and French also as part of that packet.  First of all, do you recall giving this interview? 
A.	I'm there now.  I have found the document.  And I have seen it as part of the transcripts of various broadcasts over RTLM.  These were disclosed to us by the Office of the Prosecutor, and I, therefore, was not -- well, I was not able to -- to see the date of the interview.  But this, I believe, is an interview which I granted, given that it was recorded, and this was probably given in April or May somewhere in Gitarama, but I don't quite remember the date, and I don't see any date on this document either.  

However, given that this is a recording -- a transcript of a recording, there is no reason why I should question that it was my interview. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
And, Mr. President, I would ask that this document be admitted as D. NZ803. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ803 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Nzirorera, in this interview, you are speaking about how the RPF would not recognise the interim government.  And I want to direct your attention to the paragraph -- and I'm reading from the English -- it's -- begins with the word:  "Another thing is that you are wondering how negotiations can take place; whereas, the RPF does not recognise the government."  

And then it goes on to say -- and I'm now reading in the English on about line 5:  "In my view, the majority of Rwandans living in the country are Hutus.  They have been attacked by a small group of Tutsis, descendants of UNAR party members, Inyenzi, a small group of people who came from" -- and then it's inaudible -- "who came from the forest and are trying to overthrow the government in place, a government that is the product of the 1959 revolution.  This power gave the majority people the prerogative to govern the country.  Now, those people, the small group of Tutsis, claim that they are capable of taking us back to pre-1959 era using weapons and other ploys."  

And it goes on to say that:  "In my view, if the RPF is not willing to negotiate, it should declare that they are responsible for this war.  The Inyenzi, Inkotanyi were prepared for war, I think.  Rather than negotiate with the Inkotanyi, we should demonstrate our strength in order for them to realise that they, the Rwandan Hutus living in this country, represent 90 per cent of the population.  I know that we are numerous and that we cannot be defected by 10 per cent of the population, by a small group comprising 10 per cent of the Tutsi rebels."  

Now, can you tell us what you meant by that.  In what context did you make this statement? 
A.	Well, I have just told you all the steps that were taken by the Rwandan government when it offered ceasefire to the RPF, which the RPF turned down.  That was the context in which I was interviewed by the journalist of the RTLM.  This was in Gitarama, but I don't recall the date.  And, at that time, he was talking about the fact that the RPF had not recognised the interim government and was, therefore, not ready to negotiate with that government.  That was the categorical and intransigent position of the RPF. 

Apparently, because it was sure that it will score a military victory, that was the context in which I made those statements.  Not designed to target any Tutsis, but simply because I was talking about the RPF.  And for those with evil intentions, they would say that I was talking about Tutsis, and there are some who don't want anybody to talk about Tutsis.  And that is their problem.  I am talking about the 
Tutsi rebels.  The majority of the rebels were Tutsi.  So maybe some people do not want to be identified as rebels.  But, unfortunately, the situation is very clear, members of the RPF in their majority were Tutsis.  They were rebels, and they wanted to impose things on us.  They did not recognise the government and, therefore, had nothing to do with the government.  That is the context in which I said that these people appear to be determined to seize power by war, and so government had to bear that in mind and to be aware that they will not receive any gifts from those people.  

That is all what this is meant to say.
Now, as for the percentages, well, 10 per cent, maybe 10 per cent in terms of Tutsis within the country, but we have statistics which indicate that the rebels themselves said that they represented a certain percentage of the Rwandan population.  And that in 1991 the HCR mentioned a figure of about 500,000, and the Tutsis themselves said they might be up to a million or 2 million refugees.  And that is the context in which I tried to refer to these percentages.  

In the essence, all what I was saying reflects the truth, and faced with the intransigency of the RPF, as well as the small group of Tutsi rebels, this is exactly what I was talking about, and that is the context in which these statements should be understood. 
Q.	Now, with respect to the political bureau meeting, you also told us that the topic of civil defence was covered.  What was the project of civil defence as it was understood in the middle of May 1994? 
A.	The country was in danger.  The country was in danger.  The RPF was conquering territory from
	day to day and all what the MRND party could do was to recommend to government that some system be set up for the defence of the territory.  We made that recommendation.  It is our right to make such recommendations to the government.  

And we were not the only ones making recommendations to the government.  We observed that the country was under threat, and we called on the government to take measures to protect the territorial integrity of the country and to defend the national territory.  That was the recommendation of the MRND to the government for consideration.  The MRND recommendation was not a decision.  Let me recall that civil defence, or the defence of the national territory, is within the purview of government and not within the jurisdiction of political parties such as the MRND.  The MRND did not have the resources to conduct civil defence or to organise the system.  So it is a matter for government and not for 
political parties.  That is why we made a recommendation to that effect accordingly. 
Q.	Did the civil defence -- the recommendation for civil defence contemplated training members of the population, and, if so, training to do what?  To protect their own communities or to join the army? 
A.	Well, I -- our understanding was that it was necessary to protect the integrity of the national territory.  We proposed a recommendation to the government, and it was up to government then to organise the civil defence system.  It was not for us to spell out the setting up of the civil defence.  We simply made a recommendation to government, and it was for government to organise the civil defence system as it saw fit. 

However, our understanding was that the civil defence movement had, as a purpose, to protect the country and its citizens. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our afternoon recess at this time?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  We will take our recess now until tomorrow morning.
