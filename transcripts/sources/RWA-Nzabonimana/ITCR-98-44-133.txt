MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, would you commence the proceedings.
MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Good morning.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 27th of June 2005, for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, 
Case Number ICTR-98-44-(C)-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Fry. 

The appearances are the same.

Prosecutor?  Yes. 

Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Yes, they remain the same.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I hope you don't find me a bit boring on this Monday, I again make an enquiry about the Accused?
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we were -- and thank you, Mr. President, for your help last week, the -- the door swung open and we were able to gain entrance on Friday and saw him.  He -- he was, may I say, distressed and upset and -- as a result of hearing some of the evidence, I think, that had happened last week, particularly the allegations concerning his father, which is a particularly sensitive issue with him.  And I made it quite plain to him and told him that you had said on the Monday, quite clearly that -- that this door was open to him and that his presence at this Court would be viewed sympathetically. 

But I haven't moved him to a position where he'd attend, but he certainly knows and -- and had conveyed to him, Your Honours, and this Bench's indication that -- that he's welcome here at any time. He knows that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

If necessary, I would be grateful if it could be -- the information could be renewed during the course of this week. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 

I'm not hearing you on this. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I merely expressed the sentiment that that --
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I'm getting an unworkable -- I'm on 4.  It should be channel 4.  Oh, sorry, okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, are you hearing me now? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I am clearly.  Thank you very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I merely expressed the -- the wish that you would renew the invitation to the Accused to attend court because we do think it's important that the Accused is present, that he could hear the testimony himself and participate to the extent of giving you additional instructions where -- where it might be useful. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, it would. 

Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, are you ready to start the next witness? 
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  

I just wished to indicate that it is our colleague, Ms. Cummings-John who is going to examine this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Mr. Registrar, could you swear the witness, please. 

MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour, just one moment. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Hooper, would you please turn off your microphone. 
(Declaration made by Witness AVC in Kinyarwanda)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.  
WITNESS AVC,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Witness AVC.  How are you today? 
A.	I'm very well, but I have a problem with my eyes. 
Q.	Sorry to hear that.  I'm -- I hope that won't impede you continuing today.
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... Yes.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm sorry, interpreters.

With leave from Your Honours, I would like to submit the witness protection information sheet and ask the witness to verify the information and sign it. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, please confirm the following information is correct.  Your last name?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Your first name?
A.	(No interpretation) 
Q.	Your date of birth? 
A.	Yes, it's correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, the interpreter in the French booth is indicating that the Prosecutor should give a gap between the answers and the questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor --
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, Your Honour, I heard that. 

Thank you. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Your nationality?  
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	What about your ethnicity? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	Your current occupation?  
A.	Yes, ***********, that's correct. 
Q.	Okay.  And what about in April 1994?  Was your -- is your occupation -- was your occupation *********** then? 
A.	Yes, ***********. 
Q.	Now, with regards your address -- your address at your time of birth, is this correct? 
A.	That is correct, yes. 
Q.	What about your current address? 
A.	This address is also correct. 
Q.	And, finally, in April 1994 was this your address? 
A.	This address is also correct. 
Q.	Now, with the assistance of the registry, can you sign and date this document?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honours, at this stage I would like to ask that this document be admitted as a Prosecution exhibit and be kept under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as a Prosecution exhibit -- exhibit under seal.  

Mr. Fry, the exhibit number, please?
MR. FRY:
Number P. 42, Your Honour. 
(Exhibit No. P. 42 admitted, under seal)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, have you ever testified before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What about before a national jurisdiction? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever testified before the Gacaca courts? 
A.	In our area we are still collecting information. 
Q.	So have you provided information? 
A.	I have only provided information to the investigators of this Tribunal, who came to my home to put questions to me. 
Q.	Witness, can you please tell the Court what your level of education is? 
A.	I did three years of primary school.  I don't know how to read very well. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Now, Your Honours, due to the protected nature of this witness, the Prosecutor wishes to submit a list of names of people and places which will assist the -- the witness in providing information, as the witness is fearful for his safety. 

These are not new names or -- of either the people or the places.  They are all contained in his statement and it's simply to assist with referring to them without having to refer to the names in open session.  This will prevent -- prevent us from having to go into closed session. 

So with leave from Your Honours, I would like to give a copy of the list to the witness, and two copies to the Defence, and three for the Judges. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I'm, I'm -- if I may raise a matter.  I'm concerned that a witness is provided a list, which is basically, perhaps, both a nature of a leading document.  It doesn't come from him in the witness box.  It's been provided to him.  It can serve as a prompt and a route map for his evidence.  I'm -- I'm just concerned, and I appreciate the difficulties that we're faced with witnesses and names, but in my submission, this isn't the appropriate way to go about the problem.  He's looking at the list now.  And he has a -- he has his evidence map. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, Your Honours.  It's -- it is a difficult situation and I certainly appreciate where Defence counsel is coming from.  I understand the policy is to have as much of the witness's testimony in open session as possible, and this was simply to facilitate that.  These are names that have been mentioned in the witness's statement, the will-say statement. There is nothing new in this list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but the suggestion is that it's leading.  So he would not normally have the opportunity to refer to his statement in testimony.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm open to your suggestion.  We can go into closed session when the witness is referring to names.  However, it -- it -- it will occur throughout and for -- even for some of the most basic information, because this witness is fearful that even mentioning the area where he lived will reveal his identity.  So it was -- it's with that thought that the Prosecution decided to take this precaution.  But, of course, I'm open to suggestion, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, I can see the witness is still looking with keen interest at his list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cumming-Johns, we think we should remove the list from the witness. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Very well, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you. 

You will have to try to see what you can do without going into -- without going into closed session.  If it's necessary -- if it's necessary, we will -- we will do it.  But I'd like you to try first without going into closed session. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay.  I will do my best, Your Honour. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, I'd like to start by asking you where you lived in April 1994?  You needn't name the exact location, the cellule will suffice.  
A.	But I might also reveal my identity if I give you the name of the cellule. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you had indicated that you had three years of primary education, is that correct? 
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can you write the name of the place where you live?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Yes, that's correct", says Witness.
THE WITNESS:
I can try, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Ms. Cummings-John, maybe -- maybe that is a way we can get around the problem.

MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Indeed, it's possible, but having had inquired as to whether the witness could write or not, and I have been told that he couldn't write, so that was the -- 

	Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness AVC, have you ever heard of a man named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes, I've heard of him. 
Q.	Do you know what André Rwamakuba's job was in April 1994? 
A.	I heard that he was a minister. 
Q.	Witness, can you recall where you were when President Habyarimana's plane was shot down? 
A.	Yes, I remember.  I was at the same address as the one that I have indicated to you. 
Q.	And tell us, how did you hear the news? 
A.	Since there were people living in the centre when Habyarimana's plane was shot down, these people came out of their homes and said out loud, "Now the Tutsis' fate is sealed."  That is how -- how I heard of it. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us who these people were? 
A.	They were Hutus who were member (sic) of the MRND, CDR and other parties. 
Q.	Did you know any of these people? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Perhaps you can tell us how you knew them.  
A.	Some of them were traders.  Others were members of the MRND party and they frightened us.  They used to frighten us. 
Q.	Were you ever threatened? 
A.	At that time, we didn't go to the centre because they used to threaten to kill us and -- and they used to tell us, "The time will come when we will kill you." 
Q.	I wonder, Witness, would it be possible for you to write down some of the names of these people for us? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Please, go ahead.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"I can" says the witness.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Thank you.  Would you be so kind as to put a number next to each of the names, so we have some sort of sequence?
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just indicate that we have a difficulty with numbers two and four in terms of who that is, comparing it to the list.  But one -- one, three and five are names we know. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honours, I note what Defence counsel has just stated, and for us the situation is the same.  It's the first time that we're learning of these two names on the list.  We were not told about them before. Therefore, we haven't disclosed them.  

May I continue? 
MR. HOOPER:
For our side, we don't see an identity problem with this and it could be spelt.  We don't see that it compromises this witness's identity, any -- any of these names. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honours, I do not think that it is for us to speculate as to whether it compromises the -- the witness's identity or not.  The witness has expressed a clear opinion that revealing these names, because of who he is because these people know him, will reveal his identity.  I do not think that it is for us to make a judgement as to whether it will or won't, because we're not in the position of the witness and this is a very protected witness, Your Honours.  I think that the -- the current situation of writing the names down does assist all parties.  I see no reason why they need to be spelt out.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The real question to my way of thinking is:  is the spelling written by the witness accurate? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
To be quite blunt, Your Honour, your guess is as good as mine.  I have no idea.  This is a witness whose level of education is primary three.  He has expressed to me that he does not know how to write.  So it is difficult, especially when new names are involved, because we are not aware of these -- these names.  So I defer to you as to how we can deal with this situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it may be necessary to leave it as it is and see how this witness develops -- see how his testimony develops.  If maybe -- if you are not able to address it, it may have to be dealt with in cross-examination. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Understood, Your Honour. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, can we go back to the names that you have just provided to us.  Were you ever threatened by these people? 
A.	Yes, one of these people frightened me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John.  

MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Be careful about leading. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Certainly, Your Honour. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Did these people do anything else other than threaten Tutsis? 
A.	At some point, they got a number of persons beaten up who were subsequently taken to hospital.  They also searched the homes of Tutsis accusing them of being accomplices.  That is why I cannot forget these people. 
Q.	Who were the Tutsis whose homes were searched? 
A.	I believe I can write down their names on a piece of paper, with your leave.  These were neighbours whose homes were searched. 
Q.	I don't -- Your Honours -- I don't actually need you to write the names down, Mr. Witness.  It is sufficient to simply state who they were as in -- in the area where you lived.  
A.	There was Maniragaba and Rucikoma.  These two persons' homes were searched.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	Rucikoma is spelt R-U-C-I-K-O-M-A.  (Unintelligible) Maniragaba is spelt -- or Maniragaba is spelt M-A-N-I-R-A-G-A-B-A. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Thank you.  Witness, was any property taken away from these people during the searches? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor -- 
THE WITNESS:
(Microphones overlapping)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That answer could have been answered yes or no.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes.  Leading, indeed, Your Honour, thank you.  Noted. 

May the witness continue or shall I move on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think you should ask the question again. 

MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, aside from searching the homes of these people, was anything else done to them? 
A.	At some point they were taken away to a military camp and they were beaten up by the soldiers. 
Q.	Following the searches, did anything else happen in your area, Witness? 
A.	After the houses were searched, then the President Habyarimana's plane was brought down, and other things happened as well.  For example, people held meetings.  We were threatened; we had to flee subsequently.  People were attacked in hospitals, and those are some of the things that happened in my area. 
Q.	Witness, I'd like to take this in stages, if I may.

	Now, you have just said that after the searches the president's plane was shot down.  But previously you told us that it was after the president's plane had shot down -- was shot down that the searches took place.  Can you correct which is which? 
A.	Let me explain.  First of all, the searches were conducted.  Then the president's plane -- President Habyarimana's plane was brought down and, subsequently, there were organised searches. So there were two stages at which those searches were conducted. 
Q.	Thank you.  Can we go back to the people that you said were beaten after the searches.  Can you tell me who those people were?  If you feel that naming the names would compromise your identity, then, please, do not do so.  You can write them down if you wish. 
A.	I believe that disclosing these names in open session may reveal my identity --   
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
	Sorry to interrupt you, but I wonder if it will be possible, with Your Honours' leave, to just simply add the names to the existing list so that we don't end up with too many lists. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Again, please number them.  Against these names, you can make a note "victims" and put it in brackets next to the names.
	Thank you. 

Witness, did you remember to put the word "victims" next to these two names? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Witness, do you know the date when these two people were beaten?  Or the period? 
A.	I can put the date at between the 10th and the 12th, and it's an estimate. 
Q.	Now, earlier you mentioned meetings that took place.  Can you recall the people who participated in these meetings?  You needn't say the names out loud if they're already on the list, then, perhaps you can refer to the list or add to them. 
If possible, if they are already on there, you can simply add "participant" next to the name.  I don't know if you would be able to write that.  "Participant" next to the name.  
A.	Yes, all the names already mentioned are names of persons who already par- -- who participated in these -- in these meetings.  But there are other names, which I haven't written down yet. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may speak. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I forgot to write down one name and it's an important name.  It is a name of someone who always provided me information on what was happening.  Information that was very useful to me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You'll be given an opportunity to write that name down. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	I think you were about to do it but I was going to say, please, make a note of the person who informed you about these meetings.  And please include an "I" next to the names so that we can identify it, "I" in brackets. 

Witness, what did you do following these meetings? 
A.	Well, we were on -- on a colline on a hill, and we were in a good position to observe and to see what was going on. 
Q.	May I simply clarify, are you saying that you fled from your homes? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That question could have been answered yes or no. 

Mr. Witness, you requested to say something? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I was going to say that we didn't go any further away from our homes.  We were in the neighbourhood, in the surroundings, and we had not yet been chased away.  Our homes had not yet been destroyed, so we remained within the neighbourhood of our homes. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us where these meetings took place?  If you feel that you will need to refer to some of the names, then perhaps you can be shown the list again. 
A.	The -- the meetings held in the home of the person whose name is number 1. 
Q.	Following the meetings, did anything else take place in your area? 
A.	Yes.  A number of other things took place. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Apologies, interpreters.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Can you please tell us one of the events which took place following these meetings? 
A.	A vehicle came to the home of number 1.  I was at some distance, but by the time I saw the vehicle, it had already driven into the home of this person.  I saw people surround that vehicle.  It was white in colour and I did gather information as to what had transpired at that place.  I went by that centre, close to it and I went home.  And then I explained to members of the family that the situation was getting more and more complicated.  Shortly thereafter, the vehicle left and returned to where it had come from.  But, we did obtain information to the effect that the vehicle had brought some materials -- (Microphones overlapping)
MR. HOOPER:
Could he slow down? 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Witness --
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I didn't get your comment, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm unable to keep up with the witness.  My last note is "things were getting more complicated." 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
	Certainly.
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness AVC, I would like to ask you -- I know it may be difficult for you to speak in this way, but could you possibly recount the events slowly and by stages, and just in response to my questions.  
A.	Would you like me to start all over, from the beginning?  
Q.	Let me take you back to the vehicle.  Can you recall how many days after -- can you recall on how many days after the president's death you saw this vehicle?  An approximate figure will do. 
A.	I saw that vehicle between the 10th and the 13th.  I do remember that after those persons had been beaten up, it was thereafter that we saw the vehicle arrive, after the persons had been beaten up. 
Q.	But, Witness, why did you notice this vehicle on that particular day? 
A.	The vehicle had come to this place and it was a place where people usually gathered, where meetings were held usually.  So we were careful and we avoided going towards that place.  On that day, I was going on another road and then I went back home, and I informed the members of my family that things were getting more and more complicated.  I also found out that on that day he was in the company of one Ephrem.  That night, they got together and killed people in Kayanga and Rutunga.  The next day, the attackers came back --
MR. HOOPER:
Please, I'd invite you to -- to just keep the witness in reasonable stages --
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm trying -- 
MR. HOOPER:
For -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm trying -- 
MR. HOOPER:
For -- my hand to keep up.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
(Microphones overlapping)... I understand --
MR. HOOPER:  
I thank you.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I understand, Defence.  I -- I'm trying.  I have just asked the witness one simple question and I got a whole account of what took place the same day and the day after.  Apologies.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, let me take you back.  We are talking about the vehicle.  You have said that you saw the vehicle arrive.  I asked you how many days after the president's death you saw the vehicle.  Now, can you recall the make or the colour of the vehicle? 
A.	I can remember the colour of the vehicle; it was white. 
Q.	Now, you said that you fled to your home and told your family that things were getting more complicated.  What did you mean by "complicated"? 
A.	I said so because people had been beaten up and now meetings were being held, and there was a likelihood of attacks being launched against us. 
Q.	Now, was the vehicle visible from the house you fled to? 
A.	No.  I could see the top or -- or the roof of the house -- of ********'s house.  Otherwise, from my position, I could not see a vehicle. 
Q.	Witness, do you know who was in this vehicle? 
A.	I did not know that person.  But someone did provide me information about that person and also as to why that person was present at that place. 
Q.	Who did you learn was in the vehicle? 
A.	I was told that it was Rwamakuba and Ephrem who had come in that vehicle. 
Q.	Witness, who told you? 
A.	The person's name is on the list, on that piece of paper, and I believe it is number 8, if I'm not mistaken -- number 8, yes, person number 8. 
Q.	Witness, what exactly did number 8 tell you? 
A.	He told me that Rwamakuba had brought supplies or materials and that he had left some instructions and orders that were to be followed by the persons who had gathered.  This person who told me was a good friend of mine, and he advised me to get away from that place. 
Q.	Would you mind giving us more specific information?  What -- what information did he leave and what did he bring?  What equipment, I believe you said, did he bring?  Or materials? 
A.	Before he left, the man had requested that the inhabitants of that area start the killings. 
Q.	He said that people should start the killings.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, he asked the people to start to work, and when I asked for further explanations, he told me that it meant to begin killing.  The person who was my informant then advised me to flee that area because there was a risk of being attacked. 
Q.	When you say "to start the killings", who were to be killed? 
A.	At that time it was the Tutsis who had to be killed. 
Q.	Now, how did your friend, number 8, know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	He told me that he had just met that gentleman, but that before that date, he didn't quite know Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Can you tell me where number 8 is today? 
A.	He's no longer alive.  He was killed during the war. 
Q.	Witness, you also mentioned a certain Ephrem who was in the company of André Rwamakuba.  Can you tell us who he is? 
A.	Ephrem was the junior brother of the accountant of the commune.  He was an Interahamwe and a trader.  He's currently in exile and we do not know where he lives today.

1000H
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Did anyone other than number 8 give you this information about this particular visit of André Rwamakuba? 
A.	One other person spoke to me about it at that time. 
Q.	Had you already written this name down for us, Witness? 
A.	I don't remember.  Perhaps I can look at the list again to check whether the name is there.  It is person number 7, name number 7. 
Q.	Now, Witness, did you see this vehicle when it left? 
A.	Yes, I saw the vehicle depart towards Rutunga because from where I was, I could clearly see the road to Rutunga.  So I saw the vehicle depart. 
Q.	But, Witness, let me just clarify a matter.  Did you actually see the vehicle or did you hear it leaving? 
A.	I heard the engine roar -- the engine noise, and then I saw the vehicle departing on the road that I could see from where I was. 
Q.	Did any other event happen on this day after you saw the vehicle? 
A.	That same day, there was a meeting, a large number of people, and that is when number 7 in the evening came to tell me that they were going to work in Rutunga.  And he said, "You've had it.  Your number's up; you are finished."  May I continue?  I don't know whether I can continue. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	As to what happened the next day. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Excuse me.  Can you just let him pause for a moment and then continue, and then we can catch up.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, just -- I know you want to recount all the events that took place, but if you can just respond to the questions and pause after you've given an answer, okay?  Now, back to the informat -- sorry.  Now, you say that this person came and told you that you were finished, what did you do after being told this?
A.	Well, we were already used to spending the nights in the sorghum fields.  And that night we did the same thing, we went to spend the night in the sorghum fields. 
Q.	And this meeting -- let me just take you back to the large meeting that you've just mentioned.  Do you know when it took place? 
A.	The meeting of a large number of people took place after the departure of the person I mentioned in the evening when Rwamakuba had left that place. 
Q.	Where was this meeting held? 
A.	The meeting was held at number 1's house. 
Q.	So, you went and slept in sorghum plantations that night; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	What about the following day, did anything happen in your area? 
A.	Yes, something did occur. 
Q.	Can you tell us what? 
A.	Number 8 came to tell me that the attackers have killed people in Rutunga.  He gave me the names of the people who had just been killed, and on their return, they began to destroy the houses.  I immediately fled.  And the houses that were destroyed was at the trading centre.  I fled. 
Q.	The houses that were destroyed in -- were in your area where you lived; is that correct?  Do you know -- 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	-- I'm sorry.  Do you know the names of the people who were killed, from Rutunga I believe you said? 
A.	Yes, I know their names. 
Q.	Would you be so kind as to write down some of the names for us? 
A.	I can do so. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, I have no specific objection to this business of writing down names, I just note that it's a bit of a waste of time.  We could be a bit more discriminating.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings, do you have a particular point with regard to these names?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
No, Your Honour, but if the witness's intervention is names of victims that were killed, and it is our submission that this is linked to the visit of Rwamakuba, then I think that the Prosecutor is within his right to ask for these names to be written down.  As we -- we have tried to avoid the situation of this time-consuming writing of names by providing a list; however, this was objective, so I think this is our best way forward.  The witness I think is finished and I don't think that there will be many more names to be written down in the course of the examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, I'd like to go back to the homes in your area that you said were attacked.  Can you tell us a bit more about this, how were they attacked? 
A.	You want me to speak of the houses that were destroyed or the first houses that were searched?  
Q.	The houses that were destroyed, Witness.  
A.	The assailants began with the house -- with the (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under seal)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Your Honour, I would like to move for the name mentioned by the witness as the first house destroyed to be struck from the record.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
So, ordered.  So ordered, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, the assailants who destroyed these houses, were they armed?  
A.	Yes, the assailants bore various weapons. 
Q.	Where did they get these weapons from, Mr. Witness? 
A.	They had received those weapons from the house of number 1.  That was the person who was distributing the arms to the assailants. 
Q.	But when were these arms distributed to the assailants? 
A.	Those weapons were distributed on the day we fled, but some weapons had been distributed in the night preceding our flight. 
Q.	So, is it your testimony that you fled on the day after you saw the vehicle come to number 1's house? 
A.	No, I fled the next day. 
Q.	Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings, please do not lead the witness.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
I am simply recapping.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, you didn't recap it properly because he had to correct you.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Okay.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, I'm going to try and recap accurately.  Witness, is it your testimony, therefore, that the day after André Rwamakuba and Ephrem came to number 1's house, weapons were distributed and houses were attacked? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Can you correct?  Would you mind correcting me, Mr. Witness?  At what point were the houses attacked? 
A.	After the vehicle, Rwamakuba's vehicle departed, that same night, the assailants attacked Rutunga.  The next day, the houses were attacked and that's when the houses were destroyed.  So they were not destroyed on the day when the vehicle arrived but, rather, on the morrow, the day after. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you fled at this point; is that correct?  Was this the day that you fled? 
A.	Yes, I fled the day they started destroying the houses. 
Q.	And when did you return to your area of residence? 
A.	We returned towards the end of June. 
Q.	Witness, where did you flee to? 
A.	The other side of Lake Muhozi there was security, and most people went to seek refuge there. 
Q.	Were you with anyone when you fled? 
A.	There were many of us who left.  There were Hutus who had not participated in the massacres who fled with us.  In brief, most of the people who lived in the vicinity of our house who did not participate in the massacres, left at the same time as I did. 
Q.	And when you got to your place of refuge, who did you find there?  I don't need names, Witness, simply a description of the people.  
A.	When we arrived there, it was all -- the place was already occupied by the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Can you please tell the Court what you observed when you came back to your area of residence? 
A.	On our return, we observed that all the houses had been destroyed.  At the trading centre we found human skeletal remains; we were told that some of the victims had come from Nkunsunzu, had come to seek refuge at our place.  Others came from Rutungo, but we did not know exactly who was who. 
Q.	Witness, was your house destroyed? 
A.	Yes, my house and that of my parents' were destroyed, and some houses had been set ablaze.  After houses had been destroyed, the rest were burnt down. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court whether any of your family members lived in the same area as you in April 1994? 
A.	Yes.  And some of those people are dead. 
Q.	Who are those people who are dead? 
A.	I gave you some of the names.  There were also people who were watching over them at the hospital who were also killed.  Many people were killed. 
Q.	How were these people killed related to you, the ones that you mentioned at the hospital, who were they to you? 
A.	I am a bit afraid for myself if I mention those people.  I don't think it is appropriate to name those people.  That would compromise my safety.  I'm still afraid to speak of them. 
Q.	I don't need the name, Witness, I simply want to know what their relation was to you.  
A.	***************. 
Q.	Now, I know this must be painful for you, but how did ********************* die at the hospital that you mentioned? 
A.	On our return from where we had sought refuge, we learnt that other people had sought refuge at the hospital.  The doctor had, first of all, locked them up in the hospital, and the assailants began killing the inhabitants from Kayanga and then the patients were taken out of the hospital and killed with machetes or knives. 
Q.	Which hospital are you referring to, Witness? 
A.	Kayanga hospital. 
Q.	Now, is Kayanga hospital known by any other name? 
A.	Kayanga health centre, but the secteur where that hospital is, is also named Kayanga. 
Q.	Do you know when this happened? 
A.	The people who gave me that information told me that those events occurred some time between May and June. 
Q.	Are you aware of the ethnicity of the people who were killed at the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	The majority -- in the majority of cases, only Tutsis were killed.  Whether it was the patients at the health centre, or people living around the health centre, those who were killed were all in the main, Tutsi. 
Q.	Witness, do you know any survivors of this attack at the Kayanga health centre? 
A.	I don't know of any except those who had sought refuge a bit earlier who had left the health centre a bit earlier.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Now, I wonder, if we can go back to the list.  If Mr. Registrar can show the witness the list.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, are you aware of the present whereabouts of the person number 1 -- indicated at number 1? 
A.	He is in prison. 
Q.	Do you know what crimes he is accused of having committed? 
A.	He is accused of massacring Tutsi and of distributing the material I mentioned.  And his name has been cited before the Gacaca jurisdiction -- the Gacaca court. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
I have no further questions, Your Honours.  I simply wish to ask that this document, the list of names, together with the first one, be admitted as Prosecution exhibit under seal.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So admitted under seal.  Mr. Registrar, the numbers?  
MR. FRY:
Exhibit P. 43, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
They will be exhibited together, okay?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Both documents exhibited as Exhibit P. 43.  Are there two separate sheets of paper or will they be connected together?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I would prefer Exhibit P. 43(A) and (B).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
A and B, okay.
(Exhibit No. P. 43(A) and 43(B) admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have four minutes.  Do you wish to start now or do we take the break now, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I'd rather take the break now.  I'm not going to get very far, I think, in a few -- I'll steal a few minutes from you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, then we will take the morning break now.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
(Court recessed from 1026H to 1050H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your evidence is going -- your evidence is going to continue now.  But on this occasion, your questions will be coming from the lawyer for the Accused.  So you will have to answer his questions.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS: 
All right, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  My name is David Hooper.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	My name is David Hooper, and I'm a lawyer from England, and I represent André Rwamakuba in this case.  And I'm going to ask you questions about your evidence.  

Now, I want to start, if I may, with what you touched on last, which was that you had lost close family at the attack on the Kayanga health centre.  Is that right, you lost close family there, I think you said **********; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	I'm very sorry for that, but can you I ask you please to write down on a piece of paper the names of  ************** who were killed?  Can you do that?  I'm sorry to take you to that, but could you do that for me, please? 
A.	Yes, if you wish. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
A.	I've finished. 
Q.	Now, over the last year or so, you've first of all, provided a statement, then you saw the investigators again and then you spoke with the Prosecutor here, and each you've given details of your forthcoming evidence.  But I think it's right to say that you've never told anyone until today that you lost *********************.  Is that right? 
A.	No, this is not the first time I am talking about it.  I think I have even mentioned this before. 
Q.	Well, it's on no document that I have ever heard, as far as I know.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
Your Honours, I would like to correct Defence counsel.  If we can turn to page AVC 4 of the witness's statement -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Excuse me.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN: 
-- the penultimate paragraph.  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I'm sorry.  I am corrected.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In fact, it's in your first statement, and I forgot about that.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you for the correction.  It was very timely.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But I hadn't appreciated that they were, in fact, *************************************************************** as yourself? 
A.	Yes, they were ***********. 
Q.	And that's -- the two first names were the ones who were beaten up and taken there, is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And then the two other names are not names I think we've had on any list before, but, are they the people who were looking after them, who went with them to look after them who were then killed themselves? 
A.	Yes, they were those who went to look after them. 
Q.	And so you lost ***************; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And I fully accept that, that you suffered a great deal.  Do you understand?  I do accept, and I hope to some extent, understand that.  
A.	Yes, I did suffer quite a lot, indeed. 
Q.	I'm sorry for that.  And, obviously, you were very concerned, as anyone would be, to try and find out what happened to them.  That would be right, wouldn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you learnt, you told us, that, in fact, in May or June that they had been killed there.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And you got back to your area in June.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And so your understanding was that they had been killed not very long, perhaps before you came back but fortunately, unhappily, you were far too late to help them in any way.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And in making your obvious enquiries about them, who told you about what happened? 
A.	Some people had gone to sought refuge there, and it is those people who told me what had happened.  Others also went by the dispensary as they fled, and they came to the place where we were located, and that is how I found out how ************** had died in the month of June when I was returning from my place of refuge. 
Q.	Now, I'm sorry, could I ask that you to given yet another piece of paper, and could you write on it the names of the people who were able to help you with these -- with these sad enquiries about **************.  If you could keep your letters when you are -- your writing is fine, all right?  Obviously, you learnt quite a lot while you were at school.  You writing is fine, but can you just keep the letters separate a bit more so that it's easier for us to read, because we all have different handwriting and it's sometimes difficult.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I think we are going to need some help with that; not a criticism of your handwriting, it's just sometimes difficult to read other people's handwriting.  Right -- 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, I'm going to provide you with a list.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thanks.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Well, was that the only person who gave you information about what had happened or can you remember any other names? 
A.	Yes, several persons talked about the death of those who were at the dispensary, and these people came from far away. 
Q.	And the name that you have written down, is that person still living in Gikomero commune? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would that be at Kayanga or somewhere else? 
A.	He lives close to our home and he is our neighbour. 
Q.	Very well, that would be sufficient, I think.  Now, I'm going to pass you up a sheet of paper with some typed names on it.  And what I'd like you to do is to go through it, and if you can read the names clearly, indicate on the piece of paper, with a cross or mark, who you know.  

MR. HOOPER:
And I hope the interpreters still have their list, the tick list.  Okay.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So looking at that, if you look at number 1 -- and we are going to refer to them by numbers.  All right?  If you look at number 1, if you know number 1, just put a cross or a tick in the box on the right, in one of those boxes that you know that number -- that person.  And if you don't know them, no tick, leave it blank.  And --

You have made a mark against number 3 and number 5.  Just give me a moment.  And how do you know number 3 on the list?  Do you have the list in front of you still?  You don't.  How do you know the person at number 3? 
A.	I know number 3.  He lived in **************, and he still lives there.  He is my age mate. 
Q.	So, is he a good friend of yours? 
A.	No, he is just a neighbour.  We don't have any special type -- ties of friendship between ourselves. 
Q.	And number 5, how do you know that person? 
A.	I know number 5 under similar circumstances because ************* number 3. 
Q.	And they are both your neighbours; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Do you know if either one of them is going to give evidence, or has given evidence in this case? 
A.	I do not know. 
Q.	You've no idea? 
A.	I'm not sure. 
Q.	And what does "not sure" mean? 
A.	I said that I'm not sure because I have never had any discussion with those people which would lead me to know whether or not they will be coming to testify. 
(Pages 15 to 23 by Gifty C. Harding)












1115H 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have you ever discussed this case with them in any way? 
A.	No, never. 
Q.	Have you ever discussed the event at ******** with them in any way? 
A.	Yes, of course, because their houses were destroyed, just like mine.  So we talked with issues that concerned our neighbours and what had happened. 
Q.	Can I ask you about the name that appears at number 4 on that list, do you know that person? 
A.	No, I do not know that person. 
Q.	What about the person at number 8 on that list, do you know that person? 
A.	No, I do not know that person either. 
Q.	You see, they are going to come and tell us about **************************************************, a short way from where you live.  Are you saying that you have never met those people? 
A.	I really do not know these people. 
Q.	Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
There is a slight interception.  

Registrar, the witness made reference to the name of a place that he previously said could reveal his identity, could that be deleted from the record. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and I'm reminded that there are one or two other references made to the name by counsel in reference to the witness's residence. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Are you or have you ever been associated with a group of survivors known as Ibuka? 
A.	No, I have never belonged to that association known as Ibuka. 
Q.	Were you or have you ever been a member of the Parti Libéral? 
A.	No, I have never belonged to any political party. 
Q.	Would it be fair to say that you have little interest in politics and political parties? 
A.	Yes, that is correct; you are right. 
Q.	Now the first time you provided any information to anyone about any case at all was in this case when you made a statement on the 6th of November and the 8th of November over two days of 2003, so November 2003; is that right? 
A.	Yes, if that is the information in your hands, then that is correct, but I didn't have any recollection of that personally. 
Q.	Now, I understand that, but I'm sure, as you say, you can accept that from me, if I was wrong about that, I would be corrected.  Now, do you know what it was that caused the United Nations' investigators to come and see you at your home? 
A.	Yes, I can give you the reasons.  They didn't come to my home immediately, they went to number 1's place first, and when I got there I found them talking to his wife.  And they availed themselves of the opportunity to ask me whether I was a native of that area.  And I said, yes, indeed, I was a native of that area.  Then they asked me if I had any knowledge of the events that took place in 1994.  And then they asked me to come with them in their vehicle and we went to another location.  And we had our discussions and we chatted on the things that happened; otherwise, I didn't have any prior knowledge of these people. 
Q.	And when you say they were at number 1, which list are we talking about? 
A.	I'm referring to the first list that I provided in respect of the area where the meetings were taking place and where the vehicle had stopped. 
Q.	But in your statement you make no mention, for example, of the Kayanga health centre, so was their interest, in fact, focused on André Rwamakuba.  Was that what they wanted to hear something about? 
A.	Yes, we did talk about the events that took place at that small centre. 
Q.	And -- 
A.	We also went on to talk about Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Were you aware that any of your neighbours were giving a statement on the same day? 
A.	No, I was not. 
Q.	Or that when it came to what is known as a confirmation exercise that that was on, again, the same day, as a neighbour; were you aware of that? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, we can see from your details what your age was, I'm not going to refer to that, we have got it printed in front of us.  In 1994, and I'm unclear whether the place where you were living is something which is sensitive -- that you are sensitive to, are you in a position to name just the general place where you were living; is that something you can do in open court or would you rather not, the trade centre, do you have any problem with us naming a trade centre? 
A.	It was the Ndatemwa trade centre. 
Q.	All right, thank you.  Now, Gacaca you spoke about and that is something that is started, and, as I understand it, it is a process in which you have provided some information or evidence; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, the Gacaca process is now involved, gathering information, but the hearings, as such, have not yet begun.  Information is being gathered from inhabitants of the cellule, and they will soon be moving up to the level of the secteur.  But I don't belong to all of that process because I am not in my home now, I am here. 
Q.	Well, you have been here for a few days, is that right?  I mean, how long have you been in Arusha? 
A.	I have just spent two weeks in Arusha.  This, in fact, is the second week I am spending in Arusha, this week. 
Q.	And have you met anyone from Gikomero commune here since you have been here? 
A.	No one. 
Q.	Now -- thank you.  Now, can I go back to Gacaca?  Gacaca is going to be an open court, is it not, where everybody participates in public with allegations and cross allegations; isn't that right? 
A.	Yes, that is the way it is. 
Q.	And so for you to participate in that process involved you proclaiming, in front of all of your neighbours, what you witnessed so that everyone can hear you in open justice; isn't that right? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So why all of this secrecy today, what is your problem with that? 
A.	Yes, at that time I will speak in public as, indeed, all inhabitants of the area, we will be together.  And it is undertaken in such a way that everyone must speak in public. 
Q.	But anyone that you accuse you will have to name in public, won't you?  Everyone will know who you are, where you live, will know you as a neighbour, will continue to live with you; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, that is clear, because Gacaca is a joint exercise, everyone is safe.  There are people there to ensure security.  Everyone does everything to ensure each other`s safety. 
Q.	Now, you are not in a position to give a description of the man you say came and named as           André Rwamakuba, you can't give us a description, can you?  Of course not.  
A.	I did not see him.  I saw the vehicle and I knew that he had come to that place, but as to his description, I have told you that I did not see him. 
Q.	And the person whose -- who told you about who had come that day, he is dead; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is the case. 
Q.	So, obviously, we can't go and ask him what happened, but you say he died in '94 and he was a Hutu.  Do you know how he died? 
A.	I do not know the circumstances of his death.  He was fleeing at the time.  He was -- he fled, just as I did.  But I do not know the exact circumstances of his death. 
Q.	But was he Interahamwe? 
A.	He took part in the meetings, those meetings, but we lived as friends for a long time and he was in the habit of informing me, he usually informed me of what went on in the meetings in which he took part. 
Q.	And what was the date when you fled, when you left Ndatemwa? 
A.	At that time, our heart was not into noting dates, but when I try to determine the dates, it was the day after the vehicle had come.  I can say when I left in relation to when the vehicle came there. 
Q.	Let me put it like this, we have heard from one witness of these events at Ndatemwa, that according to him the attack in Ndatemwa on the houses was on the 13th of April; does that seem about right to you? Is that the date that you would be happy to accept? 
A.	I'm not in the position to confirm that, but it is quite possible that it was on that date judging by the timeframe I give to the events.  It is quite possible that it was on that date, but I'm not in a position to confirm that. 
Q.	And it would follow, with the reservations that you have expressed, that the man who you learned or believed to be André Rwamakuba came on the 12th.  That would be right, wouldn't it? 
A.	That is possible. 
Q.	And it would follow, again, with your reservations, that the day upon -- the day on which *************** were beaten up was the night of the 11th, that would be correct in those circumstances, wouldn't it, that would be the sequence? 
A.	Yes, that is quite possible, because the events followed each other. 
Q.	Now, before we come to those events, I want to ask you a little bit about the general area where you were living.  And we know that Ndatemwa is a small trading centre between Gasabo and Rutunga, now just pause there.  When you say you lived on a hill, do you mean a hill or do you merely mean the flat area, as it were, or flattish area that is at the top of the hill that rises from Lac Mahazi, because that area is rather flat, it is not, a series of hills?  It is a flat area once you get up there, elongated but pretty flat, would that be right? 
A.	You go up from Lac Mahazi and before you get to the trading centre in question, when you speak of a flattish place I don't agree with you because the ground rises from Lac Mahazi to the trading centre, and I lived not far from the trading centre. 
Q.	Now, I'm going to give you a sketch of the area.  I wonder if you can indicate where your home is on it.  And the sketch is being provided by the Prosecution, page 11, sketch A in the investigator's bundle.  Now, if you have any difficulty looking at this sketch and making out what it is, because a lot of it is written in English, let us know, because not everyone can deal with sketches and plans, but if you can recognise what it shows, you have got it in front of you, if you look to the top right it has got the word "Catholic" do you see that, and that is the church there.  And the top of the plan, if you carried on up the road you would go to Gikomero secteur.  And if you went down the road at the bottom of the plan, you would get to the tarmac road, down near Kajevuba, K-A-J-E-V-U-B-A.  Now looking at the sketch plan, sir, are you at ease with it, and if so, could you -- does it indicate --  
A.	I don't think that I quite understand.  What I see are Ndatemwa and Rutunga.  I also see Gikomero.  You leave Rutunga in that direction, and in that case, my house would be here. 
Q.	Okay, can you mark that with a cross? 
A.	I don't -- I think I am lost here.  I see a road going from Rutunga, going on up.  I do not see where is the road from Kajevuba.  I can't see where it is.  I see a road going from Rutunga, but when you get to Ndatemwa I do not see where --   
Q.	You can't see the road going to --  
A.	-- where the road would go on. 
Q.	All right.  See I'm standing up, can you see at the bottom here, the bottom of the plan goes down to Kajevuba -- 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
May I, Your Honours. I think this exercise --
THE WITNESS:
I don't see Kajevuba. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I think this is difficult for the witness, bearing in mind the level of education and also when looking at the exhibit that the Defence has opened to show to the witness.  I think he has already expressed confusion and lack of certainy, so I'm not sure that this is an area that Defence should pursue bearing in mind the witness`s response so far.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  I would appreciate the difficulty.  Can I see if we can just help him a bit more. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you look at the plan in front of you and perhaps with the help of the registrar, the Court assistant as well.  Thank you, very much.  

There are all of the little squares on it are houses, represent houses.  Now H1, we will point out H1.  Have you found H1?  Right -- listen to me for a moment, H1 represents the big house, the bigger of the two houses that belongs to the person you name as number 1, whose name begins with an M.  And if you look at H2, that represents the same persons -- the smaller house on the opposite side of the road? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, the road between those two houses, you can see that indicated, can't you? 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	And if you go along the road towards the top, the top of the drawing, then you are going north -- I'm sorry you are going south, towards Rutunga and Kayanga and Gikomero secteur, that is going towards the top of the picture.  But if you turn around, as it were, and go down towards the bottom of the picture, well, Kajevuba is not shown there because it is several kilometres away, but if you carried on down the road you would get to the tarmac, several kilometres away at Kajevuba, so that is the general scheme of the plan, you see? 
A.	I see what you are referring to, but I'm a bit lost. 
Q.	All right.  Then I think that I might have one last stab at it.  If you can be shown where the words "Ndatemwa centre" are, that general area there, that is the big open area -- well, I say big, it is a fairly big open area in Ndatemwa's centre that lies in front of number 1`s house; do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  Well, you help us then in this way, in respect to that or in relation to that open centre, where is your home that you refer to? 
A.	My house is a bit above those houses in Gikomero direction.  It is a bit further, because my house is not right in the centre, it is a bit above them. 
Q.	Okay.  When you say, a bit above, is it in the direction of Gikomero centre, that -- not as far, but is it that side of the centre? 
A.	No, it is rather in Kigabiro direction.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I`m sorry, Your Honours, it is very difficult to interpret because the interpreters don't have a copy of the map. 
THE WITNESS:
I see Rutunga, I see other roads.  I don't understand very well this sketch, in fact. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	All right, let us pause there.  We can see, at least, on our plans, those of us with them --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the interpreter requested -- do you have an extra copy of the plan for the interpreter?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I need three, I can't favour one or I get into trouble.  There are three copies. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I wondered if after you have assisted the witness he could actually use a cross system again. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Too detailed a description -- we are in open session.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Too detailed a description may reveal a detail that should be kept secret. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, of course, right.  But we can see, looking at our sketches, the general direction of Kigabiro that is indicated, in terms of a school.  And without you being specific, sir, would it be right to say that you are up that sort of way, and living up that direction? 
A.	In that vicinity, in the vicinity of that place. 
Q.	Well, if this isn't an objectionable question, and don't answer it until Mr. President has agreed that you can, approximately how many metres would that be from number 1's house, number 1's bigger house there in the centre?  How far would it be, if you could help us, if you are not good at distances, you can't help us in metres, say so.  I just want to get an approximate idea how far from there you live? 
A.	I cannot guess at the distance or make an assessment of the distance. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you have given a general -- some general information as to where your house is in relation to the sketch plan.  If the location where your house was is not actually on the map, could you point to its general direction with the assistance of the registrar and put an X there.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can do so, Mr. President.  

I see there is a road going up towards -- I don't know, unless I show the spot, unless I made my own sketch, I can't really situate things here. 
MR. MWANJA:
Mr. President, if the counsel may repeat the question for the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Mr. Hooper, the registrar has suggested that it might be helpful if you repeated the question for the witness. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Right, I think it was your question, Mr. President.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But it was -- can you mark on the plan, the general direction, if you are leaving Ndatemwa centre to walk home, which route, which way do you go?  Just put an X.  I think you have done that for us.  Thank you, very much.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, perhaps you can see it first. 
 
Has everyone seen that, has the Prosecution seen it?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm going to show you a photograph now --  
MR. HOOPER:
Could you just show the Prosecution quickly, they have seen it before, just to remind them, because it is the only one I have got.  And could you show the Judges please, what I am going to show the witness? 


MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I merely wish to draw the attention to the fact that it is not a photo, but an assembly of two photographs, so it would be useful to know under what circumstances and who these photos were taken by.  In any case, it is a montage of two photos and I wish to draw the Court's attention to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Prosecutor, I think it is fair to allow the witness to make a comment on it because he can acknowledge or reject the accuracy of the photographs.  So, I think the witness can be shown. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, is that the place that you recognise, sir? 
A.	Yes, I know that place. 
Q.	Those are *************, I hope, in the photograph, are they? 
A.	No, they are not *********. 
Q.	But it shows on -- it shows the house of number 1, the big -- or the bigger house of number 1, and it shows the houses on one side of the open square area at the trade centre.  And then behind those houses we can see bananas, banana plantations extending -- plantain, or whatever, extending back.  Now, is where you live behind there some where? 
A.	The place where I live is not visible on the photograph. 
Q.	Is it off to the left of the photograph, is it off from the left side as you look at the photograph? 
A.	It is to the left. 
Q.	Have you ever played football? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Really, that is --  
A.	No, I do not play football. 
Q.	That rather makes me stuck on distances then.  I won't ask about cricket.  Distances, how long would it take you to walk, at a moderate pace, from where (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) lives to your home? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you strike that name from the record, please.  
THE WITNESS:
I would say it would take me five to ten minutes on foot. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	So you are not close to the trading centre, would that be fair?  
A.	The centre is near to my house. 
Q.	Now, before we come to the events of the day, is it right that the Rwandese army, the FAR, had a military position near Ndatemwa? 
A.	The military position was not close to the centre. 
Q.	Well, was it at Gasabo? 
A.	They were in Kigabiro. 
Q.	And is that in the direction of Gasabo, or in the direction of Rutunga? 
A.	Kigabiro is in the direction of Gasabo. 
Q.	Between Ndatemwa and Gasabo, is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Sorry, can you help me a bit better then? 
A.	To explain in a few words, I am saying that the houses that you see are in Karwunga (phonetic), a little to the south, towards Kajevuba there is Karekare (phonetic) and then if you go to Kigabiro you have -- then you have Kamusengo and Nyakabande, so you have to understand that the centre is not in Gabiro. 
Q.	Well, how far was this military position from the trade centre? 
A.	If you are walking towards this place you would cover the distance in say 40 minutes. 
Q.	Before you fled, on what have been the 13th, did you hear any shooting? 
A.	Before I fled, no. 
Q.	And by shooting, I mean, first of all, did you hear any rifles or single shots or machine guns, did you hear any sounds like that before you fled? 
A.	We heard that in the distance but not around where we were. 
Q.	And when had you first noticed the sound of firing in the distance before you fled? 
A.	Just after the president's plane was shot down we heard gunshots in the distance, but more precisely before -- after the plane was shot down we heard gunshots coming from the direction of Kigali. 
Q.	Just so that is an accurate translation, it was after the plane was shot down you heard gunshots coming from Kigali; is that right, sir? 
A.	Yes, we heard gunshots in Kigali, but the gunshots were not fired at the place where we were. 
Q.	And by gunshots, do you distinguish between rifle and machine gunfire or by gunshots, do you also mean artillery, heavy guns, mortars, the heavier weapons that the army might have, which did you mean? 
A.	I heard artillery, they were not gunshots from small guns or rifles, this was heavy weaponry. 
Q.	And is it right that this -- and is it right that this artillery that you heard continued over many days? 
A.	Many days, yes, until I fled I could hear this firing, but it was not very intense. 
Q.	And can you help me -- and can you help me as to this, did you also notice firing coming from the north from Butare or Mugambazi, M-U-G-A-M-B-A-Z-I, Rutongo, R-U-T-O-N-G-O, did you hear shooting or firing coming from any of those directions? 
Q.	I get the feeling that you are trying to tire me, you are dragging me into military matters.  I heard shots, I do not know where they came from.  We realised that there was firing all over the country, without knowing where it was coming from or who was shooting.  I think, Counsel, that you are just trying to tire me out? 
Q.	Well, let me just ask you this, can you help me.  Do you know if the FAR army position, just down the road towards Gasabo, whether that was attacked before you left Ndatemwa, do you know? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Before you left, did you hear shooting coming from Gicaca where the parish is in your commune? 
A.	The day I fled, there were gunshots almost everywhere.  It was the Interahamwe who were shooting, not the soldiers.  We heard gunshot in Gishaka, Nkuhuhu (phonetic), Gasabo and they were fired by the Interahamwe who had attacked these various places. 
Q.	After the president's plane was brought down, and his death was announced on the radio the next morning, can you confirm that a general curfew was ordered to be enforced and that everyone was told to stay at home; can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, it was said, but it didn't prevent the Interahamwe to go about killing people.  We, for our part, could move around the bushes to hide. 
Q.	Was this curfew that was meant to be enforced, was it ever lifted by the authorities, to your knowledge, and if so, when? 
A.	Counsel, you are beginning to tire me.  You are telling me about authorities and all of that.  You are talking about the curfew.  I do not know what exactly that is all about. 
Q.	Well, you have agreed that you were all told to stay indoors after the president's plane was shot down.  Did a time come when the authorities said, you do not have to stay indoors anymore, and if so, when was that? 
A.	No, it was said that the curfew was in force, but nobody complied with it.  It is from that curfew that the officer and chief of the secteur started going around homes searching them with the Interahamwe.  Counsel, please do not drag me into political matters. 
Q.	I'm just to understand whether you understood that you were meant to stay at home, indoors, or not.  What was your understanding? 
A.	On this matter I can tell you that I understand very well what is going on.  If you don't understand, it is because you weren't in Rwanda.  A group of people were prevented from leaving their homes so another group would find them at home and kill them. 
Q.	So do you agree, or are you saying, rather, that throughout this period before you left you understood that the official position was that you should have stayed at home, whether you did or you didn't? 
A.	I don't agree with you about this, because I know that the government that was in power at the time was lying to us so that we would stay at home and so the assailants would find us there.  And I would like to tell you that you must ask -- put this question to the person whom you are representing here because it is this person who planned everything that happened.  I was just *********; I did not have the opportunity to talk or -- or come to that decision with the person whom you are representing here. 
Q.	Yes.  Now look, I'm asking you a pretty straight-forward question.  Was it your understanding after the death of the president that you were meant to stay at home, indoors, yes or no? 
A.	People said that, I didn't actually hear it myself. 
Q.	I want to come back, just briefly, to **************************************************.  Was that something you witnessed or was that something you heard about from others?
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I have something to say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may say so, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I get the feeling that Defence counsel is trying to raise the dead, I have explained this to him.  This is not something that was told to me.  I saw it with my own very eyes.  And I'm going to ask counsel to be nice to me and not ask me too many questions about this.  He himself will, I'm sure, understand and he knows that this happened before we fled.  The way counsel is doing it, I get the impression that he is trying to identify me to the general public. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	No, I'm not trying to do that.  And may I say, sir, that I fully accept ********************************************************************, all right, I'm not disputing that, do you understand? 
A.	I follow you, but it is clear that the person who caused this to be done is with you more often than not, so you must put these questions to him so he can give you further explanations. 
Q.	But what happened to ************* is no reason to do other than tell the truth, do you understand? 
A.	I have explained in detail what happened. 
Q.	And my information is, if I can put it like that, **********************************on the evening of the 11th of April.  And I think earlier you had accepted, with your reservations, with difficulties with dates, that that may very well be the day, the 11th may very well be the day that that happened to them, that is correct, isn't it?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I should intervene here.  Mr. Witness, when you come into a court here at the Tribunal, there is a system by which witnesses are interviewed.  Counsel is entitled to ask the questions he is asking.  It is my job, or the job of the Tribunal to make certain that the questions fall within the rules that are permitted by law.  And if he steps outside of those boundaries, I will prevent him from doing so.  But up to now his questions have not fallen outside of the permitted rules.  If it does, I can assure you that we will prevent him from doing so.  

I think that the questions he asked are questions which you can answer, if you can not answer them and you say so, then you have the assistance of the Tribunal.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand you very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, what I am suggesting is that it was the 11th, indeed, **************************************************************************.  And I think for your part, sir, you are willing to accept that it very well was the 11th, the evening of the 11th that that happened; is that correct? 
A.	It is possible.  I think it is correct. 
Q.	And my understanding is that all they were doing, because they were God-fearing men, was going to church as Pentecostalist, going to pray when they were assaulted and beaten up; that is right, isn't it? 
A.	No, it is not.  They were returning from church.  It was in the morning between 9 a.m. and noon, so it was in the morning.  These people were returning from church and the person indicated as number 1 on the list, accompanied by another person, saw soldiers, they stopped them.  They asked them to show their identification papers.  They were allowed to go, they went home, and afterwards the soldiers asked them to come back.  But we learned that the person indicated as number 1 went to tell the soldiers these people -- these people are accomplices.  They did not spend the night in the church praying, they spent the night learning to use weapons.  He lied to the soldiers which caused the arrest *****************************.  That is why I said the person indicated as number 1 is the cause of their arrest because they had first been arrested and then released before they were rearrested again to be beaten up.  
Q.	And you are sure that wasn't in the evening, and not in the morning? 
A.	I confirm. 
Q.	And the next day you tell us you learnt of -- you see a car come to your centre and -- that is right, isn't it? 
A.	That the vehicle came to our centre, yes, I did see it, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you help us, what time of day that was, approximately? 
A.	It was in the afternoon between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.  It was in the afternoon. 
Q.	You say in your statement it was probably the Tuesday, the Tuesday would be the 12th; is that right? 
A.	It is possible, it was around that date. 
Q.	And what were you doing in the centre at that time? 
A.	I was not in the centre as such.  I was somewhat away from the centre at the place where we used to stand to observe what was going on in the centre, with the intention that if something dangerous happened we would run away. 
Q.	See, in your statement it reads, "I was in the centre" so how far were you away from the centre do you say? 
A.	You see, the houses that you showed us, there are others that you didn't show me.  If you leave Kajevuba, you can see the place where the buildings begin, near a wood, and I was near the house which was -- which is on the other side towards the north.  That is how that appears on the sketch that you gave me. 
Q.	No, let me just ask you to look at photographs on page 14, which I think, may indicate the houses on the other side.  And can you have my copy, if I can have it back? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we are at about 12:30. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  Can I invite, if there are copies, the witness to be shown the photographs over the luncheon adjournment, so he can familiarise himself with the photographs and, I hope, will lead him to tell us where he was.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'm afraid, Your Honour, we don't have these photos, they are attached, they are part of the P. 2, Prosecution exhibits.  And this, of course, contain other information.  I don't know if that assist counsel.  
MR. HOOPER:
I have no objection to his being given the bundle, as long as he realises what we are concerned with, and, therefore, all he should look at are pages 14, 15 and 16, a sequence of six photographs showing Ndatemwa.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
If counsel is willing to put his trust in the Prosecution, we have no objection to showing him the entire bundle. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Registrar (inaudible).  We will take the luncheon adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I should just remind you that during the adjournment, while you are a sworn witness in this case, that you are not to discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 24 to 36 by Donna M. Lewis)









(Court resumed at 1410H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon everybody.

Mr. Witness, you will resume giving your evidence this afternoon on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began giving your evidence today.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
I do understand, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  And I want to come to your evidence concerning the arrival of this car and the events that you witnessed in your evidence.  And over the break, did you have a chance to look at the photographs, and do they help you to indicate where you were when you saw or say you saw the car coming?  
A.	Yes, I did look at the pictures, but this is the photograph I have before me that would be useful.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Perhaps the registrar can assist in telling the Court where to the witness.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we attempted to give the photographs in question over the break, but it wasn't possible, so he has to look at them now.  Sorry for that, rather.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Well, it's better late than never.
BY MR. HOOPER:
So if you look at the photographs at pages 14, 15, 16.  You are going to see a sequence of six photographs taken of Ndatemwa centre, that were taken, I believe, in 2003, indeed, about the time you made your statement.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would simply want to draw the Trial Chamber's attention to the fact that this is a personal document.  I would like to say that it would not be possible to make any annotations on this document, that is why we had requested for photocopies to be made.  This is my personal document which does not have to be written upon.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for informing me of that, Madam Prosecutor.
MR. HOOPER:
And thank you for providing it too.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sir, if you look at page 14, the first page, and over the page at page 15, on the bottom right-hand corner and over the page again to 16, and you will see the sequence there of those six photographs.  

Now, without marking those in any way with your pen or pencil that you have, first of all, do you recognise what those photographs are of?  
A.	These are photographs of the Ndatemwa centre, and on them I can see the road from Rutunga.  
Q.	Now, can you look at the first page of those photographs, which is page 14, and perhaps you could be helped with that so that we know that you are looking at the same photograph, as we all are, which is photograph number 2, with the cluster of little boys in the foreground of the photograph.  
A.	Yes, I do remember that the vehicle came from that direction and it went through there and stopped there.  
Q.	All right.  Now, let's just be clear about that.  Imagine for a moment that you are the photographer taking that picture, yes?  So you are standing in his position with that view in front of you.  Now, when you saw the car, so that we are clear, does the car come from behind the position of the photographer or towards the photographer in photograph number 2?  
A.	The vehicle came from the direction that is in front of the cows.  You see there is a road which goes by that house on the picture. 
Q.	So the car, as I understand it, is being driven towards -- is being driven from where the cows are towards where the boys are; is that right?  
A.	When the vehicle arrived, it was facing the boys.  *********** house is found somewhat to the right.  So the vehicle came from Rutunga. 
Q.	Just so that we are clear -- in the photograph, which direction did the car come from?  Did it come, as you said a moment ago, from where the cows are, or did it come in any other direction?  
A.	The vehicle did not come as far as where the cows are found.  It did turn to the right before it could get to the position of the cows on the picture.  
Q.	Very well.  Thank you for that.  Now, looking again at that photograph, does it show the place where you were standing when the car arrived?  
A.	No, I cannot see where I was standing because I was behind that house; you see the big house on the picture is a house which belongs to Gasana, the former minister.  And after Gasana's house there are about three or four other houses, and after those three houses there is a little wood of eucalyptus trees.  And when I was in front of Gasana's -- in fact, those small houses which you see in the yard were not built at the time.  So I went towards the eucalyptus wood and after that small wood of eucalyptus trees you would find a few trees **************.  
Q.	When you say ***************?  
A.	**************. 
Q.	I am afraid you rather lost me.  In photograph 2, in the distance past the cows what looks like a bigger house, gray, on the left of those cluster of houses, is that the house you say belonged to Gasana?  
A.	Counsel, which side of the picture are you referring to?  Are you looking to your right?  Well, on the second picture Gasana's house cannot be seen; we can only see ********************on that second picture.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, if he is going to be identifying the location of his home, should we go into closed session where he does that?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, that might be better and easier. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, about how much time do you think that could take us?
MR. HOOPER:
Just a few minutes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think we should go into closed session now.  It would not be a long closed session, probably lasting not longer than 15 minutes.  

Mr. Witness, do you understand what is happening?  We think that the evidence that you are going to give now will probably identify the location of your home at the time, and in order to protect your identity, we are now going into closed session so that this information will be confidential and you can speak freely at this stage.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 40 to 52] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 37 to 39 by Sithembiso Moyo)














MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper we have started in open session.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If it is necessary to move into closed session, please, just alert the Court and we will make the necessary adjustment. 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you. 

And I hope not to keep you in the witness box for very much longer, Mr. Witness. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, you see the car and you decide, if I can use a neutral word, to go home.  And then you told us that you collected your wife.  Did -- did she live in a different place to you or -- or what was it? 
A.	You have said I saw the vehicle and I asked my wife to leave.  No, that's not what happened.  We didn't leave immediately.  When the vehicle came, we left the next day. So before you confuse any issues, let us make sure that we distinguish between the days. 
Q.	Well, I'm not sure where all that came from.  Let me put my question again. You see the vehicle, you decide to go home.  You told us that on the way, you picked up your wife -- collected your wife.  I think you told us that just before we broke.  Is that right?  You collected your wife on the way? 
A.	No, that is not correct. I said that I went home and I told my wife what was going on.  Then, I went on to my parents to tell them what had happened.  I didn't say that I left immediately.  It is the next day that we left after becoming aware of what had happened. 
Q.	I haven't said anything about leaving, sir, so don't worry about that.  I haven't said anything about when you left.

	Let's just go back to the sequence.  You see the car, you go home and on to your parents.  And when you get to your mother's place, you tell her whatever you tell her.  We dealt with that.  I'm not going to go through that again. All right, so how long did all that take you?  From seeing the car, going -- you now tell us -- to your home and then on to your parents, how long did that take you? 
A.	I have already told you that because I was afraid and because of my situation, it must have taken between 10 minutes or so.  But I told you that.  I must have covered that distance in about five minutes, but I said also that it might have been 10 minutes because I needed to explain a few things to my wife and to my mother. 
Q.	All right, thank you for that.  And then you saw the car leaving; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  I heard the sound of the engines of the vehicle and when I looked towards the hill opposite, I saw the vehicle disappearing into a curve in that direction. 
Q.	And how long had you been at your mum's when that happened, when you saw or heard the vehicle? 
A.	Immediately after I provided her the information, I turned around and I heard the sound of the vehicle, and I saw it.  And then I said, well, our fate was sealed.  So it -- it wasn't a long time thereafter.  These events happened almost simultaneously. 
Q.	So it follows that approximately the car left about 10 or 15 minutes after you first saw it?  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, between 10 or 15 minutes or a little more than 15 minutes. 
Q.	See, in your statement you said it had been there for an hour.  But that wouldn't be right, would it? 
A.	No.  I don't think I said anything about how long the vehicle had been in that location.  I saw it there.  It didn't remain there for a long time.  You understand the various things that I did, and I don't believe that the vehicle was in that location for up to an hour. 
Q.	Just in your statement, just so that we're -- we can leave this, it reads, "It was there in the centre for around 1 hour."  But now you don't think that that's right as we've heard, and you don't remember saying that.  So that might be another misunderstanding.  Would that be fair? 
A.	I have demonstrated to you that I did not have the facility or the possibility to calculate each minute.  So I don't know whether under those circumstances I could have paid close attention to all those details. 
Q.	And how long before darkness fell do you think it was that the car left? 
A.	Maybe -- maybe one hour, but not too long. 
Q.	Now, we know you hadn't seen the person or anyone in the car, but later you told us that that person whose name begins with "G", I'll say no more than that, had a conversation with you and it was that person who told you that the person in the car was someone called André Rwamakuba and that he was together with someone called Ephrem.  That's your evidence.  That's correct, isn't it?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And is it right that he described André Rwamakuba to you in this way; that he was a strong Interahamwe leader.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, he told me that one Rwamakuba had come, that he was a minister and that he had come with an important Interahamwe.  And the Interahamwe he was referring was Ephrem.  But he didn't tell me that the minister was an important Interahamwe.  He simply said that the minister had brought some equipment or some materials.  I believe this has been my testimony so far. 
Q.	Well, can I suggest that it hasn't been your testimony so far at all.  So let me take you to your statement.  First of all, until today, in giving evidence, you've never ever mentioned that you understood or was told that André Rwamakuba was a minister; is that correct? 
A.	What you have just said is not correct.  You are adding to my statement.  What I said today is what I have said before. 
Q.	So in the statement that you gave in 2003, I can assure you, there's no mention that 
	André Rwamakuba was a minister.  Do you accept that? 
A.	Once again, let me tell you that not all what I said is contained in this statement, and there have been some additions as well.  So I would like you to please rely on what my current testimony is,  what I'm telling you here. 
Q.	So are you saying that you did, in fact, tell the investigators in 2003 that you knew 
	André Rwamakuba to be a minister, but that has somehow been left out of your statement.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	This is what I can say.  I found out that he was a minister; I -- I learnt that he was a minister.  I didn't know, but I found out things about him.  Things were being said about him. 
Q.	Well, I suggest you may have found that out by talking to other people who were witnesses in this case.  You've  been discussing your evidence, haven't you?  Adding -- adding details that you didn't know before.  That's the truth of it, isn't it?  
A.	That is not correct, Counsel.  Well, before now, I have told you that I have not had any discussions with other witnesses about our testimonies.  I have made statements, which I'm repeating here throughout the events.  And during the war, we were not aware of the fact that this Tribunal would be set up.  As survivors, we did talk about matters that affected our lives.  But we did not talk about our testimonies before this Tribunal or even before the courts in Rwanda.  I haven't had any such discussions. 
Q.	And not only is the detail that André Rwamakuba was a minister, an important detail omitted from your statement, it doesn't appear in your statement.  But you never corrected that statement to include that detail, neither at the time you made it or signed it in 2003.  Nor when your evidence was confirmed by investigators, together with the Prosecutor of this case at a later opportunity in March of this year; nor when you met and discussed your evidence with the Prosecutor in this case today.  You've never mentioned that detail, have you, until today.  And the question I ask, sir, is, why not? 
A.	As far as I'm concerned, I think I did say so.  I talked about it.  Now, do you want me to withdraw this statement? I have sworn here to tell the truth and the whole truth before the -- the Judges.  So this is my testimony and I do not intend to withdraw my -- my statement.

1615H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And I remind you what you said at the time you made the statement about what your friend, who is now dead, told you that evening: "He informed me that André Rwamakuba, who was a strong Interahamwe leader, came in the vehicle and dropped machetes in ************************.  He also informed me that he came with Ephrem, an Interahamwe leader, commune level.  He was from Gikomero commune centre where he had a restaurant."  Do you remember saying all that, and describing 
	André Rwamakuba in a statement you read or had read to you and signed and agreed, as a strong Interahamwe leader; do you remember saying that? 
A.	Let me say this:  I cannot replace his title as a minister with the fact that he was an Interahamwe leader.  All I know is that he came in the company of a significant -- an important Interahamwe leader.  I knew, and I did find out, that he was a minister and that he had brought some materials, particularly machetes.  So, please, let it not be construed that I didn't have information as to his functions.  And I would rather that the mistake not be shifted to me, whereas it must have been made by those who interviewed me in the drafting of the statement. 
Q.	Where did your friend tell you this?  Where were you when he told you this? 
A.	Do you want me to tell you where we were?  Well, I was at home and he met me at home when we talked about all of those things. 
Q.	You told us that -- in your evidence that he told you that he had brought you supplies and materials -- or brought supplies and materials.  You didn't mention machetes, did you, in your evidence? 
A.	Well, you can take it that way, Counsel, and it wouldn't change anything in the meaning of what I said. 
Q.	And you told us that your friend had said that he'd left some instructions.  The instructions were "to start work."  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed, that's correct. 
Q.	But you didn't understand what "work" meant and you had to ask him and he explained to you it meant to kill Tutsis; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And so the phrase "to work" was not something that meant to kill, in your mind, until Ephrem explained it to you; is that correct? 
A.	No, I didn't talk to Ephrem. 
Q.	I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, that's me and my mistake.  You picked me up on that.  Your friend, forget 
	Ephrem -- your friend who told you these things had to explain to you what it meant because you didn't understand that the meaning "work" meant to kill, you told us.  That's correct, is it? 
A.	What I can say is that I did somewhat understand the meaning.  And while these people were being beaten up, I did, at least, see what was going on.  So that was not an expression that was beyond my understanding.  I put the question to him, but I had an idea, I had an inkling of what that meant already. 
Q.	Now, looking at your statement, you have a rather slightly different account, where the instructions were to this effect, that Rwamakuba had asked to start work at Kayanga where more Tutsis had gathered; is that correct? 
A.	I would rather that you rely on what I am saying here.  You have been arguing that there are many things that are not worth consideration in my statement, so I would appeal to you to take note of what I am telling you here and now. 
Q.	Well, were you told that Rwamakuba had left instructions to start work or were you told that he had directed that the work should start at Kayanga where more Tutsis had gathered?  Which was it?  Which of the two was it? 
A.	He said to start work.  But as far as the point at which to begin work is concerned, I think it was for them to determine.  I had no idea of the point at which to start work or the place at which to start work. 
Q.	And so why in your statement do you say, "Rwamakuba had asked to start work at Kayanga where more Tutsis have gathered"?  Have you said that? 
A.	I do not quite understand how this sentence got into the statement.  I did say that at some point people had been killed at Kayanga and Rutunga and that the next day people had come to that location -- the next day he had come to that location.  I do not quite understand the manner in which this sentence is cast.  By the way, I do not believe that I am the author of that sentence you have just read. 
Q.	Can you describe Ephrem to us, please? 
A.	At the time, he was a young man, tall, quite solid, and that's how I can describe him the way he was in 1994.  I cannot tell you what this man physically looks liked to, but he must have come along in age, I believe. 
Q.	Well, of course he'd be 11 years older today and I'm not asking what he's like right now, but you remember him well, do you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Was he about your age, your age then, in 1994? 
A.	No, he was older.  He was obviously older than I was.  Approximately speaking, he might have been 30 or 40 at the time. 
Q.	And then you learnt that that evening there was a large meeting that evening.  Where was that held, do you know? 
A.	It was still in the house of person number 1.  That is where such things were done. 
Q.	And that night I understand that you learnt that there was an attack on Kayanga and Rutunga; is that correct? 
A.	You are referring to the evening?  
Q.	Yes.  
A.	The meeting took place in the evening.  It is not possible that the attacks took place that evening.  It -- actually it's not the evening, it was at night.  They killed the people at night actually. 
Q.	Because that night you told us you slept in the sorghum plantation and the following day, the man with name number 8 on your list, came and told you that they had gone to kill people in Rutunga -- sorry, I said Kayanga earlier, -- Rutunga.  That's correct, isn't it, that's your evidence? 
A.	In the sorghum farm where I spent the night, the friend in question was aware that I was -- I got the information about the killings in Rutunga on the following day.  And so when he told us that people were being killed, that is when I witnessed the destruction of houses.  He told me about the attacks in Rutunga the next day.  I think you are mixing up things.  That happened at a different time. 
Q.	No, I don't think so.  The next day after you spent the night then in the sorghum field, you are told by your friend of the killings that had taken place in Rutunga, and he even provided you with the names which you've provided to us of four people who he told you had been killed at Rutunga; is that correct? 
A.	No.  I thought I had explained this to you.  I observed that you are still going back.  That evening, they had a meeting.  I do not know at what time of night they went to that place to kill people.  What I am saying is that the next day he said, "Last night we were in Rutunga".  As to the names of people who went to Rutunga, we found out these names when we were already in our place of refuge.  And other names were brought to our knowledge when we returned from our place of refuge also. 
Q.	And can you remember what time he came and told you this -- these things, approximately? 
A.	What?  Are you referring the destruction of the house and to the fact that the assailants would come and attack the houses in our area?  I don't quite understand, Counsel, what you are referring to. 
Q.	Yes, well, help me with that.  What time was that that you saw that, the attack on the houses? 
A.	It was in the morning; day had already broken.  I might say between 8:00 and 11 o'clock in the morning.  That was when the assailants began to destroy houses in the area. 
Q.	And I take it at that point you, your wife and your mother, your grandmother, did you all flee to the place of safety? 
A.	I fled with my wife.  When we got to where her parents lived, she went and joined her parents and I went off again alone.  It is only afterwards when I got to my place of refuge that I met my mother and grandmother.  So we fled individually, not as a couple, as you might think. 
Q.	And when you came back in June, you say you found all the houses destroyed in the centre; is that correct? 
A.	Not all the houses, houses belonged -- belonging to Tutsis only were destroyed. 
Q.	And in the centre, how many houses were destroyed? 
A.	There were about four houses that were destroyed; some partially, while others were razed to the ground. 
Q.	And when you came back to the centre, did you meet with -- I'm going to write down the name, the easiest way, I think.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Give me one moment.  

I'm going to write down the name of number 5 on my tick list and number 3 on my tick list.  And can the witness see this.  It's the easiest way to do this, rather than go into closed session.  Number 3 and number 5 on my tick list.  
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	And when you came back in June, did you see those two people? 
A.	No.  I only saw one of them. 
Q.	And which one was that, that you saw in June?  Well, don't give the name, the top one or the bottom one?  
A.	The first, because the second person -- I said that the second person wasn't there. 
Q.	All right, can I have that list back just so I'm doubly sure.  So it's the first person who you saw, okay, the first-named person on this list, which is number 5 -- number 5 on the tick list.  So you saw that person in June.  Did he have his family with him or what? 
A.	Are you talking about when I saw him?  Well, when I saw him he was alone, but the survivors in his family were people whom I knew.  
Q.	All right.  
A.	And the person who is second on the list was also a member of his family, but he was not there.
MR. HOOPER:
So I have headed this document, "Person I saw when I returned to Ndatemwa in June" because we've got a lot of lists here.  And those are all my questions -- oh, just one -- no, one more.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Have you ever heard of a place called Makagote?  And that's spelt M-A-K-A-G-O-T-E, Makagote.  
A.	This is a place in Rutunga.  There is a banana plantation there.  I think everyone knows this place, the place referred to as Makagote. 
Q.	Yes, I dare say -- 
A.	And I know that many people go to fetch water there because there is a spring there. 
Q.	Can you confirm or not that it was a place where, in May, a lot of people were killed; can you confirm that?
A.	People killed?  No, I don't know. 
Q.	Well, thank you, Mr. Witness, for answering my questions this afternoon.  Thank you.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are there any exhibits you would like to tender out of this witness's testimony or you will just wait until the re-examination?
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, yes, I can do it now.  It may be better and clearer at this stage.  

I would like to exhibit the witness's testimony of 2003; his confirmation record of March 2005; and his will-say statement -- or the will-say statement of the 22nd of June of this year.  Those three documents.  I then have a number of pieces of --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, before you come to these papers -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, what exhibit numbers would those be?  They are admitted in evidence.  

Oh, sorry, before we do that, Mr. Hooper, I suppose this might be a suitable time to deal with a housekeeping matter.  I think that an exhibit number, Defence exhibit number, was missed out on the last time.  Number 16 was missed out, and we wanted to sort of correct that.  So the registrar has, in fact, prepared a corrigendum which he would like to read into the record and pass the documents to you and prosecuting counsel, so your records could be updated.  And so maybe that might be appropriate so we can come up-to-date now, in essence.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
(Pages 56 to 60 by Gifty C. Harding)




















1645H 
MR. FRY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  The new exhibit list is Exhibit D. 16, which was formerly D. 17, list of names identified by GIT, to be kept under seal.  The new Exhibit D 17 is the will-say statement of Witness GLM to ICTR inspectors, dated 13 June 2005.  Exhibit D. 18, interview report, ICTR investigator's note for Witness GLM, dated 14 February, to be kept under seal.  And Exhibits D. 19A and B, prior statement of Witness GLM to ICTR investigators dated 11th February 1998, in English and in French; also if I may ask if we can take the next Defence exhibits one by one.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, did you prepare a written note for the Prosecutor and the Defence counsel? 
MR. FRY:
I have prepared this document, which I will hand over to them at the end of the day, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
MR. HOOPER: 
And Ms. Pouplard reminds me, in fact, there was a statement or the statements of GIT which were admitted and were to be assigned a number on Monday morning.  We understood that number was to be 20.  And I see that that is confirmed by the registrar. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, the number now will be D. 20. 
(Exhibit No. D. 20 admitted)
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  
MR. FRY:
And the date of that document?  
MR. HOOPER: 
I didn't catch your last request. 
MR. FRY:
Do you have the date of the document.  We don't have a copy of it. 
MR. HOOPER: 
It is a single document in English and French.  And it is dated 6 November '97.

Now, dealing with today's exhibits, first of all, I don't have in hand clean copies of --  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I'm sorry to interrupt.  We don't have a copy of D. 20A and B. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can we correct that by tomorrow morning?  We will provide you with those tomorrow morning.  And perhaps I can then say if we can nominally exhibit, or provide an exhibit number for the moment for this witness's statements, which are the ones I have just referred to, the statement of 2003, which I have in English, which I can pass up, and we should have it in French.  We will provide the French copy tomorrow.  I think it has been marked anyway.  Together with the will-say statement, and the confirmation report, we will provide clean statements of that tomorrow, but if they could all be within the Exhibit D. 21, would that be correct, A, B and C? 
MR. FRY:
Is the will-say statement the same as the witness statement?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, there are three separate documents, witness statement, confirmation and will-say, so three separate statements -- or documents, I should say. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, then we could probably have three separate Defence exhibit numbers. 
MR. HOOPER: 
All right, and the first is in two languages.  So we are going to have separate numbers -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, would you just formally assign the numbers for me please.  The statement would be --  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, if you would prefer to assign the numbers before we collect the documents, in that case --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see, is there a problem with the actual document?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, there is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this an activity that we should do tomorrow morning then? 
MR. HOOPER: 
We can nominate them now, if that is possible, and we will certainly assure that the Chamber is provided with them tomorrow.  They are documents we are all familiar with; it just needs running off a clean copy for the record.  So, if it is possible to deal with it in that way, we will retain the logic of exhibit numbers that in terms of the sequence with this witness.  And I think they would then be Exhibit 21A and B, that is the English and French of the statement.  22 is a separate exhibit number, would be the confirmation record of March 2005.  And the will-say statement, or will-say record, will be 23, is that right?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suppose Mr. Fry better confirm that your calculation is correct. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I think I have got it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry.
MR. FRY: 
Your Honour, thank you.  Those numbers would be the logical order for Defence exhibits.  But as matter of standard practice, we would prefer to assign an exhibit when we get it in our hands.  And we prefer, if Your Honour pleases, to wait to assign the official exhibit number when we receive the document.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What you suggest, Mr. Hooper, is that the bits of paper that you have with the witness here, we give the numbers for identification so that the registry can keep them.  And then we can formally assign exhibit numbers tomorrow morning. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  Now, I'm not sure that I have all of the exhibits -- well, I don't have them all.  The first list has already gone in as P -- whatever, 41, was it?  Anyway that has gone in.  In terms of the other list of names, the first one which will now be -- Mr. Registrar, is this going to be number D. 21 or is it going to be D. 24?  You want it in as D. 21, very well, is a list of ***************** who were killed.  So can that go in please, as D -- D. 21. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And this will go in under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. 21 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I think this is under seal.  Yes, four names relating to *********.

The next document is D. 22 which is a piece of paper with one name written on it.  And this name was the name of the person who provided the witness with information about ****************************************.  And this is the name of the person who provided him with this information, which was unclear on the document but which was, in fact, spelled out in the course of the evidence.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, should D. 22 be under seal as well, or is that unnecessary?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That document should be under seal too. 
(Exhibit No. D. 22 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I think generally with this witness, it is his wish, certainly.  

The next document is a photocopy of page 11 of the Prosecution bundle Exhibit P. 2, which is sketch A of the Ndatemwa centre in which appears two crosses, the top one the direction of the witness's home.  And I think the lower mark -- cross is where the car was, as I understand it, and that would be      Exhibit D. 23.  

And then finally, to save you a journey, D. 24 is a photocopy of page 14 of Prosecution Exhibit P. 2, the bundle of photographs and plans, showing two photographs, with the lower photograph, photo 2, of the Ndatemwa centre with two crosses on it.  The one in the photograph being ******************, and the one outside the direction in which this witness stood in the eucalyptus trees with his view from there of the centre when the car came.  That was D. 24.  So that leaves us with D. 25, which is the tick list.  I don't think I have -- I think that may be with you, Mr. Registrar, the tick list.  I hope it hasn't come back to me.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Commings-John, I don't know if I should apologise to you.  I didn't know that this exercise would have taken so long.  I hope I haven't thrown you off. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Not at all, Your Honour.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm passing a document up to the witness and inviting the witness to confirm that is where he placed his two crosses because I'm not sure where the original document is, but I remarked number 3 and number 5 as where he previously --  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So looking at that, could you confirm that those are the two people that you indicated that you knew and had marked on -- 
MR. MWANJA:
Sir, can you repeat because the witness didn't have his earphones on. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm asking, Mr. Witness, because I mislaid your original document you marked, your documents now, can you look at that and confirm that those two crosses are set against the names of the two people on that document that you know, number 3 and number 5 and where you had previously placed a cross yourself? 
A.	That is correct. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, very much.  I'm sorry for that having to do that again as it were.  With that, then being adopted, could become Defence Exhibit 25.  Thank you. 
THE WITNESS:
I would like to say something. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may say something, Mr. Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I have seen someone here who looks like somebody I know back home.  This person causes me concern.  This is the person I see on the other side of the Defence bench, who is dark.  He looks like someone who lives in Kayanga secteur.  That is the person up against the wall in the back there; forgive me, because people might just resemble each other.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you referring to someone dressed in a security uniform?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the person.  He looks like someone from Kayanga.  If he is working for the Court then I don't have any problems. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just one minute.  Excuse me, Mr. Security -- would the security guard in the back stand up please?  The security guard behind the Defence team.  

Is that the person to whom you refer?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is the person I am referring to, he looks like somebody I know. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, it is a common mistake with identification, but this man is Mr. Kasanda, an obvious 
United Nations' employee, and he is Tanzanian.  And I hope that puts the witness at ease. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could he just say that himself?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a microphone available to the security guard?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Security Guard, would you mind just stating, for the record -- yes, would you please state for the record your name, your employment, what is your work and where are you from.
MR. KASANDA:
Okay.  My name is Peter Kasanda.  My occupation is security officer at ICTR, Arusha duty station.  I was born in 1974 in Mwanza region, Tanzania, and I'm a Tanzanian.  My previous occupation, I was a police officer at Arusha central police. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  Does anybody wish to ask him any questions?  
Thank you, very much.  
MR. KASANDA:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Let me ask you.  Have you ever lived in Kayanga in Rwanda?  
MR. KASANDA:
Never, I haven't even approached there. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  I just saw that he looked like someone in Kayanga which is why I was worried for my personal safety.  Please forgive me. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much for that clarification. 
THE WITNESS:
You are welcome. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, all of your exhibits are now in except for the three statements?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Now, Mr. Witness, the rules of our proceedings is that the Prosecuting attorney.  

Ms. Cummings-John, I again apologise for the interruption of the exhibits.   
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Not at all, thank you, Your Honour.  I will try to be brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  It has just been pointed out to me that the witness did not have his headphones on when I spoke to him.  

I wanted to explain to you, Mr. Witness -- can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The rules of our procedure are that the prosecuting attorney will now have an opportunity to ask you a few other questions, and you must now answer them.  Do you understand that?   

THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Hello again, Mr. Witness. 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	Mr. Witness, how many attacks at the Kayanga health centre are you aware of? 
A.	If I were to say that there were more than one attack that I was aware of, that would be untrue.  I was aware of one attack at the Kayanga centre. 
Q.	You mentioned some of the people who told you about the attacks where ************* were killed, you also noted one of their names.  Now the question I wish to ask you is, did these people witness the attacks themselves? 
A.	There is one person whom I referred to who was a witness of an attack.  He came by, and the attackers took these persons away.  I do not have any further details as to the circumstances under which any other attacks may have taken place. 
Q.	Now, you indicated to the Defence that you knew two of the people listed on what the Defence refers to as their tick list, numbers 3 and 5 notably.  Are you aware of any other people who witnessed the same events as you in your area? 
A.	Most of those people were killed, but we didn't often talk about that.  There are other people who may be informed, I believe, but I never asked them about it.  What is certain, however, is that there must be other people who are aware and can corroborate what I have said. 
Q.	Now, I would like to take you back to the account of the arrival of the vehicle in which you learnt    André Rwamakuba came to number 1's house.  Were there other people who knew about this visit of André Rwamakuba? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the Kinyarwanda booth, could the Prosecutor please repeat the question which was (unintelligible) by the interpreters?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Apologies to the interpreter. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, I would like to take you to the account of the vehicle that came to number 1's house which you claim -- or when you claim that André Rwamakuba came with another man named Ephraim, I would like to know, Witness, did anybody else witness this visit?  
A.	As far as I know, there must be somebody.  It is possible that there could be somebody.  Let me again say, I have not discussed this with anybody else except the person who informed me thereof.  Maybe you can conduct further investigations and find out that there are other people who are aware about something regarding the visit of those people. 
Q.	Other than number 8 who informed you, did anybody else inform you, Witness? 
A.	The other person who informed me about it is still in exile, and I do not know whether that person is alive or dead because they have not returned from exile. 
Q.	Witness, do you know when (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted and filed under seal) were attacked, when they were beaten up, do you know what date they were beaten up? 
A.	I can never forget that date.  I remember that date very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I wanted to remove from the record the references to the fact that ******** (By order of the Court, this portion has been extracted and filed under seal) were beaten up and killed, because that is identifying information.  

Mr. Fry, I don't know if that is a sufficient order at this stage.  So, if you can phrase your question in a manner that will take that into account please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honours, I note that. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, are you aware of when **************** were beaten?  
A.	Yes, I do remember that day, it was a Monday.  And after they had been beaten up we took them to the hospital. 
Q.	Now, can you be certain of this day? 
A.	Yes, I am certain.  I may forget many other things, but not that day. 
Q.	Witness, where were you when you saw the vehicle arriving? 
A.	I believe that I have already indicated the place, it was at the entrance of those homes, in a wood, or a clump of trees.  It is a location from which you can see the front part of ************* residence. 
Q.	And where were you when you saw the vehicle leave? 
A.	I was already at home when I heard the sound of the engine of the vehicle, and then I could see it disappear on the hill opposite at a place which was visible from my own home. 
Q.	Can you tell us what level your home was in relation to number 1's house? 
A.	Our house was above the house of number 1. 
Q.	Now, in the cross-examination you stated that your home was close to number 1's house; is that correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  From the place where the vehicle was parked and where meetings were held, you can see opposite a number of houses.  If you go by those houses, you can get to my home.  But there is another route which can be used which goes around.  And, again, my house was not located at the centre, so it is not at the centre. 
Q.	Could you hear what took place at the centre? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, this is re-examination.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, Your Honour, I am aware of that.  Is that to say that the witness should not respond to this question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, do you think it is a proper question for re-examination?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
On my part, yes, Your Honour, but, of course, I stand to be corrected.  I will move on. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Witness, can you recall how long you met with the ICTR investigators for in 2003? 
A.	I was with the investigators for a relatively short time. 
Q.	Can you give me an idea of how short a time or how long a time in perhaps hours? 
A.	Our discussions lasted some 20 minutes or so. 
Q.	Were you asked by the investigators if you knew what André Rwamakuba's occupation was? 
A.	I believe that the investigators must have asked me that question, and I believe that I also answered in a manner that is consistent with what I -- what is contained in my statement, and -- in my testimony rather.  I believe that I had mentioned that Mr. Rwamakuba had been a minister, but that I wasn't aware of that, that I only found that out from someone else. 
Q.	Was your statement read over to you? 
A.	It would seem to me that, this is my impression, that they were in a hurry.  And they told me they would return to see me again, and they asked me if I had told them the truth, and I said, yes.  And they left promising to come back. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, you are beginning to sound as though you are cross-examining the witness.  This is a re-examination. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I just point out if (unintelligible) in fairness, that perhaps she should point out that the investigators did return on the 8th, there were two visits?  Perhaps the witness' attention, if we are dealing with this, should be drawn to that. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
May I take instructions from Defence counsel, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Instruction?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Well, the Defence has just advised me how to proceed with the question, I don't, however, want to be accused of cross-examining the witness, so I defer to your judgement on that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can draw the witness's attention to that, if you wish. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Now, Witness, earlier this year -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You see the subject matter that you are dealing with is appropriate for re-examination because it was addressed during the cross-examination.  But your method of approach was challenging the witness's truthfulness, which is what I don't think should be committed. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay, that was not my intention.  I take that back. 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Earlier this year you met with the ICTR investigators again, why did you not tell them at this point what the occupation of André Rwamakuba was? 
A.	Whatever the case may be, my understanding is that these people did ask a question in that connection, and I answered that I had learnt about that.  These are people who came to ask me about what I had seen, and I believed that I narrated the facts to them depending on what I saw.  Now, I cannot guarantee the content of the statement with respect to anything else that may have been written down in the statement. 
Q.	Thank you.  In the cross-examination, the Defence asked you why when giving your examination-in-chief you referred to instruments, I believe, having been delivered by André Rwamakuba, and yet in your witness statement you had said something else; you had said machetes.  What I wish to know is what did you mean by instruments, Witness? 
A.	When I referred to materials, I was referring to machetes and other arms and weapons that were used during the war.  I hope that the materials were not construed to mean farming instruments.  I was referring to materials that were used during and for the war. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.  I have no further questions, Your Honour.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

THE WITNESS:
Thank you also. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You do not object to the admission of the statement, the confirmation and will-say statments?  So, they can be admitted tomorrow morning in the absence of the witness?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes, yes, they can -- I believe the Defence has agreed to provide them. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  Yes, well, you have come to the end of your testimony.  I wanted to thank you for coming to give your evidence now.  And to let you know you are now excused.  You don't have to return to give evidence in this trial.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You may go now.  
MR. HOOPER: 
The witness can go, there is no need to detain him.  The will-say statement, we have only had in hard copies, and we have no clean copies from the Prosecution, so it would be a necessary convenience if they could provide the will-say statement for us.  Thank you. 
MS. FALL: 
Once again, the Prosecutor will assist the Defence by providing a copy of the will-say. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are adding up brownie points, Ms. Fall.
MS. FALL: 
Yes, Mr. President, still within the framework of plan B. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I just ask a point of clarification in terms of Defence exhibits that are going in.  Various documents, some of them fairly transient (sic) in nature than the rest of it, and I'm wondering whether it is possible, or whether the practice is to photocopy these exhibits, so that we can build up a bundle because none of them are in electronic format at present. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
In fact, I will give you an answer on that tomorrow morning.  I think that it is normally expected that the person tendering the exhibits put in the additional copies, but I wanted to find out whether exhibits that have been generated in court, the extent to which we can provide assistance in making photocopies.  But I will address that tomorrow morning; I will make some inquiries and let you know. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, very much.  And I found the original tick, would that be a better document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it is now 5:30 and we have to take -- I can't make you truthful, Mr. Hooper, in the sense that we can't call the witness this afternoon. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. O'Shea is challenging me to go through him in those two minutes, because I said I would today.  There we are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We start tomorrow morning at 8:45.  We take the adjournment now. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Could I just mention one matter before we rise, which I hope is not going to cause a complication; the witness after next, GIN, *************************** in the case of Kamuhanda in this court on the *********************.  And we have put in an application two weeks ago for transcripts, and we received transcripts.  But what we didn't receive was the in closed session of transcripts.  And I would formally like to say we have asked the Prosecution to help us; I understand they are trying to help us, but there is that pending difficulty in respect to that witness.  I don't think it would necessarily take very long once we have got the transcripts to assure ourselves that our available knowledge is complete, but that is the position. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will also make inquiries to see what can be done.  Thank you very much.
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now  
(Court adjourned at 1729H)
