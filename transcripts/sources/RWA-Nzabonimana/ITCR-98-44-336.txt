P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please? 
MR. DIALLO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Denis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 8th of July 2008, in open session for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Could we have appearances, please, starting with the Prosecution?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I hesitated, Your Honour, because -- as Peter Robinson is not here today.  But I realise that he usually complains when you start with the Prosecution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you think I should start with Mr. Karemera's Defence team?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Well, since the Chamber has decided conclusively that we are in the Defence phase, maybe that would be appropriate.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. SOW:
I thank you, Mr. President.  Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning, Counsel for the Prosecution.  Good morning, officials of the registry and the interpretation teams. 
My name is Mr. Sow (unintelligible), co-counsel for Mr. Édouard Karemera.  Our team is composed, inter alia, of Mr. -- Dior Diagne-Mbaye, lead counsel, who is currently in the country in which the 
video link is being arranged.  We also have Ms. Fatou Ndour, our legal assistant.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  Good morning to you all. 

My name is Chantal Hounkpatin, lead counsel for Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  My co-counsel, Frédéric Weyl, is absent.  He will join us next week.  However, today, apart from myself, apart from my usual legal assistant, Ms. Yetongnon, we also salute the presence of the daughter of Ngirumpatse who is on holiday and has joined our team this morning.  I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, I don't know if there was an error in the translation, but what is the status of the daughter of Ngirumpatse?  Is she a legal -- 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
She is an intern.  I am sorry, I used the word "legal assistant".  But she is an intern, to be more accurate.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I think maybe there was a mistranslation, Your Honours.  If I could assist the Chamber.  I seem to recognise the daughter of Maître Weyl sitting on the other side of the courtroom.  Perhaps it was an error from the interpretation booth.  I'm not sure.  But isn't that Maître Weyl's daughter, who was here in a previous trial session, sitting with Defence?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's what I thought.  I probably phrased the question in an indirect manner.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
She was with us.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Ms. Hounkpatin, in the English translation, it came out that you were being assisted by the daughter of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
No.  That is not the case.  That is a mix-up.  It is a mix-up on the part the interpreter.  I, indeed, pointed out that it was the daughter of Frédéric Weyl.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. NIMY:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Good morning to everyone.  Mr. President, I am really delighted to be part of this session, and I am also delighted that we are in very good shape.  

I am Patrick Nimy Ngimbi, co-counsel for Joseph Nzirorera, who is sitting next to me.  I am assisted today by our investigator, Daniel Ntawumenumunsi.  I would also like to inform you -- I also have the honour to inform you, Mr. President, that we have two new interns who have joined our team.  
Ms. Gorice Garaman (phonetic) from New Zealand, and Mr. André Leyland from Canada who, like the predecessors in our team, will enrich our work.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Nimy, and we welcome the new members of the team to our trial.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning to the Trial Chamber and to the parties and the registry.  The Prosecution is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Alayne Frankson-Wallace, Iain Morley, Saidou N'dow, 
Gerda Visser, Takeh Sendze.  And we also have a full complement of interns with us today.  We have 
Anthony Diala, who was with us for the past six months and will be leaving this week.  And we'd like to express our appreciation for his fine contribution.  And we have two new interns that will be taking up the slack.  They are Aiden, Leonard and Zacharie, Paul.  So we thank you, and we look forward to the session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  We welcome new members of your team, and say good-bye to the one who is departing.  

Now before we embark on the main business of today's session, which is taking the video link testimony, there are a few things that I need to do.  And, in particular, deal with some of the issues that were raised yesterday when the Court was in the process of adjournment for today.  

The first issue that we should address is the issue of the update on the availability of witnesses for our trial session.  And they have a representative from the WVSS who will provide such an update for us.  

I would be grateful, Mr. Essombe, if you would first identify yourself for the record, and then provide an appropriate update.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, my name is Joseph Essombe-Edimo, head of the witness and victims support section, which is generally known by its English acronym, WVSS.  

Mr. President, regarding the update, I will give it very quickly.  When we parted company yesterday, we had good news and, unfortunately, some bad news as well.  Let me start with the good news.  

And the good news is that we now know for sure that Witnesses UKL and DXL will arrive here tomorrow.  

The bad news has to do with Witnesses WAU and XCU -- WDU and XCU, I beg your pardon.  
Witness XCU has stated that he or she may only be available as of the 17th.  And Witness WDU says that he will only be available between the 18th and the 19th of July.  And in light of Chamber's schedule, that poses some kind of problem.  We have informed the Defence team.  We informed the Defence team as soon as we received the news yesterday in the afternoon.  And we hope that the Defence team will give us a schedule that would enable us to slot that witness into the current session.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Essombe, before I ask anyone else if they have any questions of you, there is one thing I'd like you to clarify for the purpose of providing adequate notice to all concerned.  What is the basic principle of notice that your section requires in order to discharge the obligation to assist in having witnesses here to testify on prescribed dates? 
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Mr. President, for practical reasons, we request all parties to the proceedings to give us their list of witnesses, as well as the order of appearance of the said witnesses, at least two months before the beginning of the proceedings before the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Essombe.  

Does anyone have any questions to ask?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, Your Honour.  It would be helpful to know when WVSS was notified about the intention of the Defence to call these nine witnesses.  So if Mr. Essombe could help us with that information.  And if he could also indicate for us when the other five witnesses are expected to be available.  
I've gone through the list that was provided to me, and we have no news concerning WKL, RQU, RWU, CTV and ETB.  So if there is any information he could assist us by informing us; and if there is no information, he can say as much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we would not like the witness to respond to your first question concerning the date upon which information was provided to WVSS.  But he can respond to the question relating to the witnesses about which he has not made any mention up to now.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Thank you, Mr. President.  If I did not mention those witnesses, it is because I do not have any fresh information in their regard.  But it goes without saying that if, in the course of this day, we have more accurate information, we will disclose it immediately.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I appreciate the helpfulness of WVSS, but I'm concerned by the words "fresh information," because we have no information at all.  And it would be helpful to us if we had some information.  So whatever information WVSS has, even if it is old information, it would be new to us.  So if he could tell us anything he knows about the availability of those witnesses and their willingness to testify in this session, it would be helpful.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:  
The precise information I would like to give, Counsel for the Prosecution, is that as regards that particular -- those witnesses, we do not have specific information.  In principle, we cannot provide information we are not sure of.  But let me repeat:  As soon as we will know with certainty what the situation is and what the position of the witnesses is, we will disclose it to the Chamber.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would like to talk about the case of XCU who told you that she could be available on about the 17th.  But let me inform the Chamber that at the time when she was preparing to come and testify, she was summoned to appear before the Gacaca courts; a strange coincidence.  This is a problem we have to live with.  And I think we will inform you of any subsequent developments.  Because although she says that she will come on the 17th, I am no longer that sure.  However, for the time being, I prefer to stop here pending the receipt of further information.  

I thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Sow.  

Well, I think that concludes the first item on our agenda, and I will now move on to the second item, which is the issue of the Prosecution motion for residual measures filed on the 27th of June 2008, 
with the first addendum filed on the 30th of June 2008, and the second addendum filed on the 
1st of July 2008.

We now give our decision on that motion.  

We do not think that the suggestions posed yesterday for further action -- for further argument are required, because we do agree with the Prosecutor that the matter is simple and straightforward.  We consider that the motion is premature.  Whether there is a need to grant relief of time, or any other relief to effect the cross-examination of any witness, or even whether there will be need for any cross-examination at all, is a matter which should be evaluated after examination-in-chief on a case-by-case basis.  We dismiss these applications in their entirety.  
Item number three on our agenda.  Reference was made to the issue of attendance by some parties at the site where the video link testimony is being -- from which it is being received.  Now, the Chamber considers -- or the Chamber recalls that its decision granting leave for the testimony to be taken by video link on the application of Karemera's team was first made -- or first decision -- or first of several decisions on the subject was made on the 2nd of April 2008.  

It is our view that all parties have had ample time and facilities to make appropriate arrangements.  The enquiries made by the Chamber recently was simply intended to assist the parties; however, we consider that the interests of justice will be well served without each party being present at the site where the witness is located, and that they will have ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness, if that is required, from their position in this courtroom.  

Issue number four -- item number four on our agenda is Nzirorera's third motion for inspection of Defence witness information, filed on the 30th of June 2008.  The Chamber has observed that on the day following the filing of this motion, the requested relief for access to the information was provided.  We also recall that both the applicant and the respondent did not have notice before, to facilitate any earlier compliance.  We consider that this application is now moot, and we dismiss it in its entirety.  

Issue number five deals with the requirement for the Karemera Defence cause -- for the Karemera Defence team to show cause.  The Chamber considers that it is possible that there is a serious omission from the submissions provided, because the continued absence of information on the order of witness appearance raises the question of willful disobedience to court orders, which may bring Rule 77 into play.  

The Chamber considers that it would be in the interests of justice to grant the Karemera Defence team leave to file supplementary submissions which should include the order of all its intended 
witnesses -- order of appearance of all its intended witnesses and related information by Friday, the 11th of June (sic).  

Thank you, Mr. Issa.  It has just been drawn to my attention that I said Friday, the 11th of June.  That was obviously an error, which I correct immediately.  And the date by which a supplementary submission should be filed is Friday, the 11th of July, that is, this week Friday.  

Now that concludes the items on our agenda, and we think it's now time to enquire whether there is video link connection.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, may I interrupt?  Are we going directly into the testimony of the witness now, or would there be a break between -- I am not sure if we are going directly into the testimony.  If so, there is a matter I would like to address before we actually connect with the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We intended to go directly to the testimony of the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
My concern is for the protective order that is currently in place.  My understanding is that this witness, LOL, benefits from a pseudonym and from -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, just permit me to allow Mr. Essombe to leave -- to depart. 

We thank you very much for your assistance.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe I am a bit presumptuous.  I'm -- my understanding is that the witness we'll hear is LOL.  If that's the case, I am concerned about the protective measures that are currently in place.  When the witness is called I will renew this application, but to bring it now preemptively because this Chamber had requested the Defence teams to indicate before witnesses are called if they had communicated with the witness about the protective order and if the witness had already chosen to dispense with the protective order.  And with this particular witness, it seems like he is among the category that would be expected to dispense with the protection.  So I would like to make an enquiry if Mr. Sow is -- has he enquired with the witness, and if the witness still wants protective measures.  And if he does, then I will have an application to make at the Court's discretion, either in the presence of the witness, or before the witness actually appears on the screen.  
MR. SOW:
Your Honours, as I stated a while ago, Counsel Dior Diagne is found at the place where the video link is going from.  When the witness is ready, the question will be put to him.  For now I would maintain the protective measures. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, we think that the trial with proceed quicker and more efficiently and fairly if these enquiries were made in advance.  So we hope that we will be guided in the future.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Given Maître Sow's response, I am wondering who from the Karemera team is actually going to conduct the examination of this witness.  I would presume, from the way he responded, that he intends Maître Dior Diagne to do so.  And if that is the case, it presents a problem for us because the communication we had from the Chamber and from the registry is that all questioning will take place from the courtroom here in Arusha.  So Mr. Sow could clarify that for us, please.  
MR. SOW:
Your Honour, I confirm that I am going to examine the witness myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
Mr. Registrar, what is the position? 

Yes.  I have been advised by the registrar that we are already connected with the destination from which the witness is going to testify.  

Good morning.  Do I address the judge, Judge Verstreken?
MR. TCHIDIMBO:  
Here is Brussels.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I am on my feet.  I am sorry.  The witness currently benefits from the protection order.  We are in open session.  The screen is in open session and is observable by the public.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Mr. Registrar, could you make the -- issue the instructions to have that corrected?
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
Good morning.  Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  I would simply like to state that the witness intends to maintain the protective measures regarding -- in his regard. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could we just stop for a minute?  We are not yet in closed session.  We are in open session, so the public may hear what is being said.  They are not permitted to see the video screen.  So they can't see the witness, but they can hear what is being said.  

Ms. Diagne, you may continue, please.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, I was about to state that the witness intends to have the protective measures taken by the Chamber for him, and then to make his testimony under the pseudonym that was attributed to him.  

I would also like to let you know that the current situation here is that the judge is caught up in traffic jam, and that he is the one we are awaiting to begin witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  In view of the information just communicated, we think that it would be improper for us to proceed with the examination in the absence of the relevant authorities, so we are going to rise and ask the registrar to arrange for resumption of our session when the situation has been rectified.  

There are two preliminary -- other preliminary comments which I think are required.  And one is that the issue with regard to the witness protection.  We would expect to hear from the witness himself, and the Chamber will ask the witness to respond to its questions on that issue.  And we have to remind counsel that now the witness is a witness, communication between himself and counsel is prohibited.  

We rise.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Your Honours --
