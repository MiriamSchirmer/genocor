MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding; Judge Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 2nd of February 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-00-98-44-T.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

The appearances are the same.

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony yesterday.

And Mr. Robinson will continue.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President, and good morning.  First I would like to thank the Trial Chamber for its prompt action on our request to bring Witness 13-A from Rwanda.  I appreciate that you acted so swiftly, and it will facilitate to keep the flow of witnesses coming during this session.  
  JUVÉNAL KAJELIJELI, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Mr. Kajelijeli, good morning.  How are you feeling this morning?
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am not feeling well, but I will continue to testify.  And in a short while, I will be asking for permission to consult a doctor, maybe at the break.  Thank you. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And thank you for persevering with us during this testimony.  So can you tell us how long you've known Joseph Nzirorera.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, for giving me the floor this morning.  I have known Nzirorera from the time we were still very young.  That is a long time ago when we were still children. 
Q.	And during your adult life, what kind of relationship have you had with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	When we became adults, we had ordinary or normal relations as I had with other persons in society, normal relations. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us, what was your occupation after you finished school? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Upon completion of my studies, I worked with some clergy, and then I entered politics.  I then went to study finance and became an accountant.  And I worked as an assistant to the financial inspectors in Ruhengeri.  I also worked in Nkuli commune.  And I was appointed by the minister of the public service to work in Nkuli.  Then I went to work in Mukingo commune where I served until the time I became bourgmestre.

When I was bourgmestre, I travelled to Kenya on a study tour and also to the Camrose Islands.  Upon returning home, I continued to work, but I must say that these study tours were conducted during the period of the war, that is -- in fact, it was in 1993 that I started working on my own or in my own personal business.  So those in broad strokes -- that in broad strokes is the outline of my life. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Can you tell us what year you were appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.
A.	I thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I was appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1988. 
Q.	Now, did you also have an affiliation with a parents' association in Busogo? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  That region was underdeveloped, and I asked for the creation of an association for the development of education in Busogo.  I am one of the founding members of that association.  We undertook major projects within that association.  
Q.	And was Mr. Nzirorera also involved in that association? 
A.	Yes.  He's a native of that area.  We asked him to be our representative wherever this association had some interests.  He too was one of the founding members of the association. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the registrar can show the witness the document that I previously distributed, which is from the official gazette in Rwanda, pertaining to the establishment of this association.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, do you recognise the document that's been placed in front of you? 
A.	Yes.  It is the document which granted legal status to that association.  It is a ministerial order creating the association and thereby enabling it to function with official recognition. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I'd ask that this document be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ729. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ729 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Mr. Kajelijeli, turning to the last page of the document, where it lists the signatories of the statutes and the founding members, do you see your name and that of Mr. Nzirorera there?
A.	Yes.  Nzirorera is the first name, and I am at number 14. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us during the period -- this document is dated 1987.  From the period of 1987 through October of 1990 when the war broke out, how often would you see Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	The constitution of our association provided that we meet three times a year.  And whenever he was available, we saw him on three occasions per year.  And this facilitated the working of the 
	executive committee of the association.  So whenever he was not unable to attend, we would see him.  So it was possible for us to see him, and every now and then the meetings of our committee may have been shifted to another day in order to be able to see him.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	And besides your work together on this committee, would you see him on other occasions in Mukingo commune during 1987 through 1990?
A.	It was possible to see him on other occasions.  In fact, before the war broke out, we had a number of projects that were inaugurated, for example, in Mukingo commune.  And on such occasions we will invite the supervisory ministry and some authorities or figures of authority from Mukingo to the ceremony.  That project, for example, that is initiated by a particular ministry will see the minister in charge invited as well as certain natives of the area.  And in so doing, those authorities could be our spokespersons to the government as they expose our problems to government.  

	So if he could not come on the three occasions provided for within the constitution, we also had opportunity to see him on other occasions including the ones I have mentioned.  I thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	And during 1987 through 1990, what ministry was Mr. Nzirorera affiliated with? 
A.	As far as I recall, he worked in two ministries, first the ministry of public works in 1987; and therefore, he went to work at the ministry of industry and trade if I am not mistaken.  I believe that he worked in those two ministries, but I may be mistaken, and you may want to cross-check.  But in any event, he moved from one ministry to work in another, but you can cross-check the dates and times at which he worked in those ministries, but that is what I know.  
Q.	Was Mr. Nzirorera also a member of parliament from Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Anyone who opted to run for an office in the country had to be a member of parliament.  So Nzirorera was a member of parliament, and I do recall that when he was appointed minister, he was no longer a member of parliament.  He has never held the two positions simultaneously, that is, member of parliament and minister.

All I recall is that he was a member of parliament and then later became a minister.  But again, all of this should be cross-checked. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, can you tell us, what would be the reaction of the population when Joseph Nzirorera -- did you want to add anything to that last answer?
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Initially, it was possible for a member of parliament to be a minister.  That was the practice at some point, but then later on one could be appointed to the position of a minister without being a member of parliament.  And once again, all of this needs to be cross-checked because these ideas are not very clear to my mind.  So I just wanted to make that correction to my previous testimony.  Thank you. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Now, can you tell us what would be the reaction of the population when Joseph Nzirorera arrived in Mukingo.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry.  I think that's an appropriate question, but we've only gotten up to the year 1990.  So is Mr. Robinson only referring to the period 1987 to 1990, or are we going beyond that now?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  I can clarify my question.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	From the period when Mr. Nzirorera became minister until the death of President Habyarimana, during that whole period, can you tell us what the reaction of the population would be typically when Mr. Nzirorera arrived in Mukingo.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry, but we haven't established on how many occasions Mr. Nzirorera came to Mukingo between 1990 and 1994.  Could we do that before we get to that question.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, Mr. President, I'm happy to try to accommodate Mr. Webster.  So I can come to that question later.  I think it's no problem.  I can just rearrange my examination and can come to that question later.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Mr. Kajelijeli, let's stay with the period now -- let's say 1990.  Was there an attack on Rwanda by the RPF in October of 1990? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  I think we can proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  The witness can continue his answer.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Now, Your Honours, the RPF attacked Rwanda on the 1st of October 1990.  And that attack hit the Byumba préfecture.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, was there also another attack on the 23rd of January 1991? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Well, the attack of the 23rd January 1991 indeed took place, and it was that attack which destroyed the Ruhengeri préfecture.  And during that attack 30 gendarmes and their commander were killed by the RPF forces.  They also killed the population in Kinigi commune.  They destroyed the prison.  They destroyed the banks.  They took hostage more than 30 persons.  

And at a certain point in time, the Kinigi and Kigombe communes were evacuated.  The population was told to leave.  And in fact, this war sowed a lot of misunderstanding among these people.  Many displaced persons were left, and the Ruhengeri commune went through a very difficult time, a period which lasted until we went on exile. 
Q.	Now, what was the reaction of the population to the killings by the RPF in January of 1991? 
A.	Members of the population and myself were taken unawares by that war.  It was the first time we were witnessing a war.  We had heard talk about war over the radio, and members of the population really took that attack very, very badly.  

We had heard about the Biafra war.  We had heard about the Vietnamese war.  We had never seen war.  And so members of the population began losing trust in each other, and the entire region was in a bad situation.  All went topsy-turvey, if I can put it that way. 
Q.	Was there an influx of refugees to Mukingo commune after the attack of January 1991? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours, for giving me the floor.  The question put by Defence counsel is a very logical one.  Now, the people of the Kinigi commune as well as those of the Kigombe commune went and found refuge in the Mukingo commune.  Those from Kigombe went through Nyakinama on their way to Mukingo.  And the sous-préfet personally had been surrounded, and people went to look for him because they felt that he had been killed by the Inkotanyi.  

And the gendarmes who were protecting the Tutsi -- their commander, Karemera, had been killed.  And there was an influx of refugees who went to Nyakinama and Mukingo.  In short, there were many refugees there in the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Were there any attacks against Tutsis after the RPF action in January 1991 in Mukingo commune?   
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, we are here to get the truth known.  And so the Rwandans, Hutus and Tutsis -- we want to tell the truth so that these persons can get reconciled.  It is true that Tutsis of the commune, the Mukingo commune, were attacked, and some had their houses burnt down.  And in particular, their kitchens, which were built in straw, were burnt down.  

And when the préfet came back from his refuge, he helped me to sensitise the people to go about rebuilding the houses of the Tutsis, and the Tutsis took up again their harmonious relationships with the Hutus.  And in fact, those who had burnt down their houses were arrested.  I got arrested many persons and put them into trucks, and we took these persons that we arrested and threw them into cells in Ruhengeri since the prison had been destroyed.   And by so doing, we set the right example by punishing all those who wanted to sow this disorder in the Mukingo commune.  

And so to answer your question, yes, Tutsis were attacked, and we did the best we could to repair the wrong that had been meted out on the Tutsis.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, 
Your Honours. 
Q.	Did you ever order the arrest of Michel Niyigaba in 1991 or 1992? 
A.	Michel Niyigaba was not among the attacks at that time.  Michel Niyigaba was not among those who burnt down the houses of the Tutsis.   
Q.	Was there an occasion when Michel Niyigaba had been arrested before 1994?   
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I got Michel Niyigaba arrested on one occasion, and that was when he carried out an aggression which had nothing to do with the issues of the Tutsis.  I got him detained, and he was fined.  Just to let you know that I did not tolerate any illegal activities.  He was detained, and he was slammed a fine because he had committed a slight offence, a minor offence. 
Q.	After the 1991 attack, did the military take any action in Mukingo commune against people who were suspected of having assisted the RPF? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not know exactly whether we are going beyond our limits, but I think that the RPE, the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, stipulate the statutes of this Tribunal and have to do with crimes committed from the 1st of January 1994 to July 1994 and are within the powers of this Tribunal.  

Now, I believe the counsel is going beyond the RPE or the statutes.  I do not know whether the statutes have been ratified to permit me to answer that question.  And that also would enable me to return to the camp of the adversary who attacked the country so that we can work together.

Counsel, your question goes beyond -- or violates the statutes and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  Thank you very much, Mr. Counsel.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Kajelijeli, but we've previously had rulings from this Chamber that events that took place before 1994 are relevant to the trial of Nzirorera and the others.  So with that explanation, can you tell us in general whether the military took action in 1991 after the attack to try to arrest or take action against people they suspected as being -- assisting those of the RPF.   
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Well, if the statutes have been amended, I will answer your question.  So just confirm with me that these amendments have taken place, and then you can take your question over, Mr. Counsel.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I can assure you that counsel is learned in the Rules of Evidence and Procedure.  And in any event, it is the function of the Judges to prevent him from breaking the rules.  So it is really our duty to decide whether his questions are out of order.  We consider that his question is a proper question and that you are to answer.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, and with all respect due your person, I will answer.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So can you tell us if the military took any action in Mukingo commune after the 1991 attack against people suspected of assisting the RPF in that attack.
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  During that period, members of the population were not together.  They were disbursed, and you also had refugees who had joined the 
	local population.  Some Tutsis were victims of aggression since they were considered as accomplices, but that is a problem which was very well handled by the security element.  

Of course, some Tutsis were arrested, and some were hurt.  Yes, Counsel, that took place.  That is how I can answer your question.  And so to summarise my answer again, some things were done. 
Q.	Now, was there another attack by the RPF in February 1992? 
A.	Yes.  The RPF launched another attack in 1992, but I was not within the commune at the time.  I was in Kenya and in the Camrose Islands, and it was during the attack of 1992 that the RPF took over the Butaro, Cyero, and Nymugali communes.  And members of the population were forced to leave the said communes which had fallen into the hands of the RPF.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, 
	Your Honours. 
Q.	Was there any effect of that 1992 attack upon Mukingo commune? 
A.	Even though I was not present in the Mukingo commune right from the attacks of 1990/1991, there were always consequences following these attacks.  Members of the population which left the communes which I just mentioned came to join and add to those of Mukingo, and these members of the population who were refugees had nothing with them when they fled.  And so this situation created a lot of insecurity within the Mukingo commune and particularly given that the RPF continued multiplying attacks.  

I told you that many from the Kinigi commune had left their commune because the RPF had set up quarters there.  And so with this state of affairs, many things were overturned and destabilised within the region. 
Q.	Now, also in Rwanda, the multiparty system had come to be in existence.  Did you yourself choose to be a member of one of the political parties once the multiparty system came in?
A.	Each one had the right to join the party of his choice.  Personally, I did not join any political party.  But that did not hinder me from sympathising with one particular party or the other.  But it was said that bourgmestres were supposed to be neutral, and I had to be neutral.  

But, nevertheless, there was a party which I found good enough, but I did not reveal my political leanings.  And it was, therefore, not necessary for me to officially join any political party.  I chose to be neutral, and I think I already made that clear in a statement earlier on, and before the multiparty system everybody belongs to a party.  And so I -- at the right time I was going to decide which political party to join, but at that time I remained neutral. 
Q.	Did you ever hold any office in the MRND party after the multiparty system? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Let me tell you if anybody tells you that he is neutral and that he's sitting on the fence, that is not fair.  I would like all members of parties to feel at ease with me.  After the advent of multipartyism, I did not join any particular party whatsoever.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Now, in Mukingo commune after the advent of multipartyism, was there ever an Interahamwe organisation there? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  You are talking about an Interahamwe organisation.  Well, that is something which is supposed to be known within the commune, and while I served as bourgmestre of that commune, I never heard about the organisation of any Interahamwe nor any Interahamwe within the Mukingo commune.  Thank you. 
Q.	Now, did you know of an association that was headed by Michel Niyigaba in Mukingo? 
A.	Well, there were not associations and even cooperative unions, and I know that Niyigaba was a member of a small negligible association, a gathering of people who were involved in agriculture and were trying to sell their harvests from their work for a livelihood.  And at a certain time, we finally gave them an oven to enable them to construct bricks.  Yes, an association like that one existed.  It was an association of young people involved in farming and to better manage the harvests from their farming work. 
Q.	Did those people ever claim to be Interahamwe? 
A.	Well, this was something that I learnt right here at the ICTR.  While I was there in Mukingo, I never heard any talk of any such thing.  I never heard about this association.  I heard it called or referred to as the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Did you ever distribute MRND kitenge to members of that association? 
A.	No.  I never received any such mission.  I was never confronted with any such problem while I was bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune.  And I even told you earlier on that politically I was neutral or apolitical and I was never involved in any such activities.  And the hierarchy, particularly the ministry of interior, home affairs, had instructed us to stay neutral.  And there were representatives of the MRND there.  

It is they who were supposed to handle that, but I don't know whether that existed at all, but I was supposed to know exactly all that was going on within my commune, and what the counsel for Defence just said never took place within my commune. 
Q.	Did you ever hear of Joseph Nzirorera distributing kitenge to members of Michel Niyigaba's association? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  You see, there are a few questions which rather bother me or astonish me.  I know that in the hierarchy of Nzirorera it was not easy to meet him.  Even for myself, I did not see how Michel and these people could have had access to him or to see him.  I don't see Nzirorera going so low to go talking with members of this association while there were organs of the party at communal level that could do that.  If anyone made any such allegations, it is a lie.  We respect people.  We respect the hierarchy put in place.  Nzirorera held a lofty, highly placed office, and he never did what you just said.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Did you have any information about membership cards in Interahamwe being issued in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I did not see whosoever go about distributing cards to Interahamwes.  And by the way, nobody was distributing MRND cards, and I just answered a question of yours related to uniforms of the MRND party.  

In every shop you could buy kitenge cloth, uniforms for the Interahamwe.  Nobody had to be an Interahamwe to be able to sell this cloth or fabric, which was being sold in every shop or store.  Every Tom, Dick, and Harry could go up there, buy one, and sew it the way he wanted.  It was the same one for the cards you just referred to.  I never saw them, and even if they had been distributed, I would have known.  And by the way, there are investigators who have carried out investigations, and nobody found out that party cards of the Interahamwe were given to whosoever within the commune.  And if, per chance, that had been done, I would have known. 
Q.	Now, in February of 1993, was there another attack launched by the RPF?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, when I recall that attack, my heartbeat rises.  It was from that attack that I began having high blood pressure.  The RPF announced an attack in Byumba, and they killed 
	46,000 persons.  And 23,000 were from the Ruhengeri préfecture.  And if my memory serves me right, that can be verified.  4,000 of these victims were from Mukingo.  

This war was called the February 1993 war, and this war left many lives lost in my commune -- judges, traders, many -- the prosecutor -- were killed.  Mr. President, Your Honours, it was bad.  Whoever did not die in that attack had participation.  And during that attack part of the commune, which is neighbouring to Kinigi, was taken over by the RPF, for example, the Shingiro secteur and the 
Muhingo secteur.  If you consult -- if you look up the maps, the maps which, meanwhile, brought up -- it clearly delineates the encroachment of the RPF.
Mr. President, Your Honours, let me tell you that during that attack on our region, the 
Ruhengeri préfecture, suffered unforgettable difficulties and problems in the -- in its history. 
Q.	And after that attack, were there retaliation against Tutsis by members of the population? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I think that was the reason why I was taken to court.  In fact, I was prosecuted because I survived to tell the story.  If I am going back to the attacks of 1991 and 1992, it was necessary that I, Kajelijeli, should spend myself, without any reserve, to protect Tutsis who were facing difficulties.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, and all those persons here, please listen to me carefully.  I did the best I could to bring together all the Tutsis.  I set them up in the ESIA (sic) institute.  To be able to do that, I sought the help of the gendarmerie initially, and they helped me.  We provided safety measures for these Tutsis, and no Tutsi was attacked or assailed.  

But at a certain point in time -- in fact, what I want to say is I had good relationships with the Tutsis.  My relatives were Tutsis, my godfather was a Tutsi, and I sent communal policemen to go to his home to stay there and to ensure his security.  And so, Mr. President, Your Honours, all this is documented evidence.  

The headquarters of the gendarmerie sent staff to ensure the security of these Tutsis, and right until the 22nd to 23rd, I continued working with them until the day I left my office as bourgmestre, and during that period, the security of these persons was ensured until the moment when we surrendered 
ISEA institute to its owners.  

The Tutsis went back to their homes.  We continued protecting them so that they be able to carry on their farming and do the harvest.  Some went and set up in Busogo, and we went and helped them right out there.  In fact, the commune spent a lot of its wealth to protect these members of the population.  

For example, we needed to transport firewood to help these persons.  And I personally -- from my own very pockets, I gave money to women to enable them to buy cosmetic products.  I helped children.  I helped kids to buy -- I bought clothes for these children.  And by the way, at a certain point in time, I even resorted to the Red Cross for them to lend me a hand.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I wish to congratulate myself for all that I did at the time.

But I was also afflicted and hurt because political parties hindered me from continuing the work I was doing in protecting these persons.  And things went out of hand.  I believe you certainly heard what happened, the MRND party in collaboration with the RPF -- to send back all those persons who were not working alongside the opposition.  
I'm sorry I have been rather verbose.  And so coming back to the question, that took place -- that attack took place.  And I tell you the truth.  I did the best I could to protect Tutsis, and there were no victims except those who were killed at the time when I did not have any resources to protect them.  

If you take into consideration the attack that took place on the 8th and all the others preceding the 8th, I did my level best to protect the Tutsis.  People have rebuked me or chided me about this, but I must tell you that there are some Tutsis who survived these attacks.  

There are members of the population who saw me while I did all I could to protect these Tutsis.  And by the way, I know that the Prosecutor has interviewed some of these persons.  I know that, Mr. President.  I did the best I could.  I bent over backwards.  I thank you very much, Mr. President.  I thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Did there come a time when night patrols were instituted in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Before leaving Mukingo commune, we had thought about that project.  In fact, the RPF had captured part of Mukingo commune and had taken over Kinigi as well as Butaro.  Cyero, Kidaho were all captured by the RPF.  And before they captured those communes, they started by infiltrating the area.  

They sent infiltrators to fire gunshots in those communes and frighten people away.  And the project for night patrols was in place, but it was not implemented while I was bourgmestre.  It was when I left the commune that it was implemented. 
Q.	Now, the persons who were selected to do the night patrols -- who selected those people? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I have just told you that at the time I left the office of bourgmestre that project was not being implemented, and it  is those who took over from me who implemented the project while I went on to work on my own.  

And so I did not closely monitor what was happening at the commune level.  I think those who took charge of that project after I left the commune are in a better position to provide information on it.  
Q.	To your knowledge, was there ever any military training of the population in Mukingo commune before the death of President Habyarimana?   
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  After the RPF attacked and before the president died, many areas of the country were captured by the RPF.  Recruitments had been conducted within the population, and the recruits were trained in various camps.  

In the areas that were under RPF control, it was impossible for the army to conduct any training there.  So there was an effort to recruit at the national level in order to strengthen the army for the war.  So commanders from regions informed us that there would be a selection of persons for the army, and we informed the young people accordingly.  

And the conseiller would sift through the candidates in order to avoid recruiting any bandits and hoodlums.  So those who were selected were retained at the communal level and tested, and then those who were selected were informed accordingly and taken to Mukamira camp.  So the selection was done at the communal level, and that is how things happened.  Some people told lies or have come here to tell lies that training took place at the communal level.  That is not true.  There was a selection exercise that was conducted for young men and women who would then join the army.

This was done by the Rwandan army in order to make up for the significant losses that it had suffered because it was necessary for those soldiers who had died at the battlefront to be replaced.  So, Counsel, that is what I know in relation to what others have referred to as military training at the communal level.  What happened was a recruitment exercise and not military training. 
Q.	And when those recruitment exercises took place at the commune office in order for the army to select those people who would become members of the army, could you tell us approximately how often those exercises took place.
A.	I do recall that it happened three times in my commune.  If there were any other such activities after I left office, I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Now, were people -- were Michel Niyigaba and members of his association such as Gato and Gakuru and Rukundo -- were those people trained? 
A.	They were not selected.  You see, you just mentioned Rukundo.  He could not have been selected because he was a student.  I never saw him come to apply to be recruited.  And by the way, when he went into exile, he was still a student.  

As for Michel Niyigaba, I never saw him.  What must be said was that there were selection criteria in place, and I must say that Gakuru was a well-known bandit.  And Gato, especially, was also a well-known bandit who spent the night in the gutters, and those people were not 18 years old.  And it was impossible for them to be selected if they were not up to 18 years old.  And the selection criteria included age, discipline, and the individual's relationship with the administration and what have you.

So those people did not meet the selection criteria and, therefore, could not have been selected.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Prior to the death of President Habyarimana, were there any distributions of weapons to members of the population in Mukingo commune?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  When I was bourgmestre, there was never any distribution of arms in Mukingo commune.  By the way, the communal police of Mukingo commune did not even have enough weapons.  That is why I had to request that firearms be provided for my 
	eight policemen during the war, and those eight policemen were provided with weapons.  Now, when the ministry of the interior gave us weapons, I had to give back those weapons which I had borrowed to give to our eight communal policemen.   So if we were not even able to provide weapons for our police communal -- our communal policemen -- how would we have done so for the population at large?  

In any event, while I was bourgmestre, there was no distribution of weapons, and if it did happen after I left office, then you need to seek that information elsewhere.  
Q.	Do you know a building called Isimbi in Mukingo? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  There was a building known as 
	 Isimbi rya Busogo, and I know that building.  Yes, I do.
Q.	Who was the owner of that building?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  That building was owned by 
	Hagumineza, Vincent.  He had bought the building from one Arab, whose name was Aziz, who used to live in Ruhengeri.  
Q.	And was Vincent related to Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, he was his brother-in-law. 
Q.	Did Mr. Nzirorera's brother-in-law or Mr. Nzirorera himself ever give that building to Michel Niyigaba and members of his association? 
A.	As far as I know, Nzirorera had nothing to do with that building.  Many activities were conducted at that building, including the Prodevi project, which was involved in water supply to the volcano regions, and they occupied a major part of that building when we went into exile.  That project continued to function, and it used sand and steel rods which belonged to that project, and the material was still at that building.  

	So this issue raised a number of problems, and a lot of discussion ensued around that building.  Many people have raised several issues pertaining to that building.  There was also a small area of 2 square metres around that building where some young people sold some drinks, non-alcoholic drinks.  But others have testified that there was some kind of training that took place in that building, and that is entirely untrue.  It is not true.  
Q.	Did the MRND flag fly in front of that building?
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  As I have already mentioned at the beginning when issues were put to me about the MRND, I told you that I was neutral, and that is true.  I have always been opposed to the flying of any political party flags close to the communal office.  So I wanted people to perceive me as being a neutral authority whom they could come to without any hesitation.  I therefore would not have been in favour of any political party flying its flag at that building.  

	However, there came a time when the MRND requested that its flag be flown in front of that building, and I said yes to it.  It was the same request that was made for Kagasiza (sic) and Samuura (sic), and the PSD also asked to do same and the request was granted.  The truth of the matter is that we did not want any flags flying close to the communal office.  Yet if any political party wanted to fly its flag at any other location far away from the communal office, we were inclined to say yes.  
Q.	Did the MRND have an office in the Isimbi building? 
A.	I was not familiar with all the details.  However, the MRND representative in Mukingo -- at some point he was an inspector, but I never saw him working from that building.  I believe that he either worked out of his home or at another location.  I never saw him going to work in the Isimbi rya Busogo building.  I never saw that.  
Q.	Did you ever hear of any occasion in which the youth of Mukingo had torn down the flags of other political parties either in Mukingo commune or in neighbouring communes? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, let me explain this problem clearly so that people may know the lies that have been told so far and reject them.  I never heard that any flag was brought down.  You say that the 
	MDR flag was brought down.  Well, I was present in Mukingo when the MDR held some of its meetings. Muhabo and other leaders came from a number of areas, came with their brass band, and I granted them a hall in which they were able to conduct their business.  So if such a matter or such a problem had arisen, we would have talked about it at that meeting and we would have discussed it.  So this never happened.  

	There is an area in Gakubangutiya in Kubezi (sic) secteur where an MDR -- an -- an MRND -- where an MDR flag was flying, just like the MRND flag in Isimbi.  The PSD also had its flag in another area which was represented by a well-known figure in Mukingo commune.  And, further still, we used to meet during development meetings.  So if any such problem had occurred, it must have been outside Mukingo commune.  And if that were the case, it would have been a punishable offence.  

	I therefore do not think that this was an issue that should have been brought to the 
	International Criminal Tribunal.  Bandits like Gakuru stole, and we were able to arrest them and throw them into jail.  But I was never told that anyone had committed the offence of bringing down or pulling down the flag of any other political party.  If I had been aware of any such incident, we would have arrested and punished that person.  
Q.	Now, have you ever attended any meetings at a place called Butotori camp in Gisenyi? 
A.	This is the first time that I hear that there was a meeting at Butotori camp.  I do not know Butotori camp, and I never attended any meeting outside of Ruhengeri.  I went on study tours, but I never went to Butotori camp.  By the way, I do not know that camp.  Thank you.  
Q.	Were you ever a member of a group known as The Friends of the Alliance or The Dragons that had as its objective the extermination of Tutsi?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Please, Counsel, would you kindly repeat your question for the benefit of the Kinyarwanda booth?
THE WITNESS: 
	Please, I have told you since yesterday to refrain from referring to the massacre of the Tutsis.  I have never desired in my heart to kill anyone.  Now, you talk about an alliance.  Who was the members -- who were the members of this alliance?  When was it created?  I have just heard from you that such an alliance existed.  Can an alliance be created with the purpose of killing people?  I think that whoever provided you with that information must be a very wicked person who has fabricated this idea and has involved me in a so-called "alliance" which never existed.  In fact, I have never been a member to any such alliance. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Now, can you tell us approximately how often you would see -- or you saw Joseph Nzirorera between the time of the RPF attack in October of 1990 and the death of the president in April 1994.
A.	You asked me that question yesterday.  I used to see Joseph Nzirorera under exceptional circumstances.  For example, he would come for a death ceremony whenever he was available.  I can take the case of his two brothers who died.  When Munyampeta the businessman died and when his sister-in-law died he came, and we met him on such occasions.  However, when he came, he didn't stay for a long time because there was fighting in the area at a distance not too far away from 
	Mukingo commune.  So on such occasions he was simply passing by and we would get to meet him.  

Now, when the RPF killed Bourgmestre Gasana and other business persons, including those whom I have talked about, we decided to spend the night outside of our commune because we knew that we were in danger, given that the RPF wanted to murder figures of authority.  

So Nzirorera rarely came to the commune.  He only came on very special occasions, and we only met him between two to four times on such visits when he came to attend special occasions.  And on such instances he would not spend much time and would leave rather quickly.  
Q.	And what was the reaction of the population when Joseph Nzirorera arrived in Mukingo commune during this period, October 1990 to April 1994? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  That period cannot be compared to the period before the war.  You see, the population was somewhat traumatised, and whenever he came, it was usually for unfortunate and sad circumstances.  So he would meet members of the population at a death ceremony or that type of event, and the war was raging in the area.  So there was no time for him to have any meaningful discussions with members of the population.  
Q.	Did members of the population seek Mr. Nzirorera -- seek Mr. Nzirorera's help with their personal problems when he arrived in Mukingo commune? 
A.	That is a question which must be dealt with according to the circumstances prevailing.  During peace times when things were calm, members of the population wanted to meet Nzirorera.  We even wanted to meet him and ask him for assistance, for example, in relation to various projects within the commune.  So it was not easy to meet him, and whoever met him was extremely lucky.  It is true that people may have wanted to meet him for various reasons, and anyone who met him may have been able to get assistance from him.  
Q.	Were there any meetings of authorities held in the home of Joseph Nzirorera's mother during the period 1990 to April 1994?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I heard during a number of trials in this court that such was being said.  However, this never happened.  It is the services of the OTP which have fabricated this story.  It is even claimed that I participated at that meeting.  Those who fabricated those lies did not do a proper job because this is a lie.  I do not see why reference is made to 
	Nzirorera's mother, whereas his father was a well-known intellectual.  
	
	So this is a lie that has been concocted from scratch because there could not have been any meetings at his mother's house, whereas the meetings could have taken place either at the communal office or elsewhere.  As far as I'm concerned, those meetings never took place because I never heard mention of such meetings.  What would have been the purpose of the meetings at Nzirorera's mother's house, if any?  So there was never any such meeting.  
Q.	Thank you Mr. Kajelijeli.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
How much longer do you think you are going to be? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I think about 30 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sticking to your promise of yesterday afternoon.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Pretty close, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We will take the mid-morning recess now.  
	(Court recessed from 1035H to 1100H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, I had asked you about meetings of authorities at Mr. Nzirorera's mother's house.  Now I want to ask you were there any meetings of authorities held at Mr. Nzirorera's own house in 
	Mukingo commune during the period 1990 through to the death of the president in 1994?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours, and everybody here.  There were no meetings, no meetings held at Nzirorera's house before and during the war.  By the way, that would not have been possible because there were official buildings for such activities, the communal office, for example.  So as far as I know, there was never any meeting at Nzirorera's house.  If anybody said any such thing, it must be somebody who is lying through such accusations with the intent of tarnishing Nzirorera's image.  
Q.	Do you know a person by the name of Gatabazi from Mukingo commune? 
A.	I am sorry.  I know Gatabazi, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
Q.	Now can you tell us how -- what occupation this Gatabazi had and what contact you had with him in Mukingo. 
A.	Thank you.  If we are talking about the same Gatabazi, because you may want to know that these things happened a very long time ago, initially Gatabazi was a postman, that is, somebody who would shift mail around or take mail around within the ministry of justice.  Then he asked to be transferred to the Mukingo court in order to continue to move mail around.  But he was a crook who asked for back -- kickbacks or bribes from other people, suggesting that he was going to ask for favours from the judges on their behalf.  So some people who lost their farms in those exercises came to complain, and then he was transferred to Nyamutera commune, which was some 50 kilometres away from Mukingo.  

When he got to Nyamutera at the beginning of the war, he was a member of the MDR party, and he began to publish tracts against me.  Some of those tracts got to the ministry of justice, which decided to investigate the matter with the ministry of internal affairs.  It is after I left the commune that I saw some of those tracts which had some not-so-good things to say about me in relation to Tutsis.  So I brought a case against him at the Ruhengeri prosecutor's office.  And, of course, there was no mention of any name on the tracts, and I was asked who could have been behind the tracts, and I said it was Gatabazi.  

He was tracked down and interviewed, and the Tutsis whom he referred to in the tracts were also interviewed.  Then he was remanded in custody.  Then the ensuing conflict between himself and I portrayed the fact that I had good relations with Tutsis.  Some of them were my relatives; some of my family members married to Tutsis and what have you. 
So Gatabazi beat up some lady who was a native of Kibungo, accusing her of being Tutsi.  That young lady left the commune and went to settle in Kigali.  Gatabazi was then accused and tried in the court of first instance and at the appeal court, and he was fined 20,000 francs.  The bailiff of the appeals court issued a warrant for his arrest, and I arrested him and presented him before the appropriate jurisdiction.  And the members of his family paid the fine that Gatabazi was supposed to pay upon the orders of the appeal court.  Then he was held in detention at the Ruhengeri brigade for some time.  

And Gatabazi was a crook.  He was involved in various acts of crookery during the war.  He wanted to tarnish my image, and he also wanted to attack all those persons whom I knew by saying that they were involved in the killings that took place in our area.  Gatabazi, however, tries to portray himself as one who was a witness of all the events in our area. 

I will not belabour this point, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Let me simply say to all those present in the courtroom that Gatabazi was somebody who attacked Tutsis.  He even beat up his own sister-in-law, who was Tutsi, and at some point the in-laws of that Tutsi woman asked us to provide protection for them, and so we asked those who employed Gatabazi to do something.  That is how he ended up being transferred, so that his sister-in-law may have some breathing space.  

Now, when Tutsi women went to visit his sister-in-law, Gatabazi would look for people to stone those people who belonged to the family of his senior brother who was married to a Tutsi.  And even I was stoned by some young people who had been recruited by Gatabazi for that purpose.  So Gatabazi beat up this Tutsi woman who was bound then to flee from the commune.  

You may also want to recall that at the beginning of the proceedings of this Tribunal, the investigators tried to identify all those people whom we had punished prior to the war, but these people had been trained to come and provide false testimony before this Trial Chamber.  It is under these circumstances that various allegations were fabricated, including those which Gatabazi himself made here.  I have read his statements, and I saw how the documents or statements were replete with such fabrications.  

So Gatabazi was selected to provide false testimony here by testifying about events to which he was not an eyewitness, simply because there was hatred between himself and I arising from the crimes which he had committed and for which I had punished him, namely, that he hated Tutsis and demonstrated this by beating up his sister-in-law who was a native of Kibungo.  

I thank you, Mr. President.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
Q.	Now, Gatabazi claims that you were present when Joseph Nzirorera ordered Michel Niyigaba and his group to go and take down the flags of other political parties using a vehicle of Mr. Nzirorera's 
	brother-in-law, ****************************; is that true? 
A.	Gatabazi can tell all manner of lies in order to soil my name.  That story never happened.  It is a big, fat lie.  You see, somebody must have drafted a document for him so that he could come and tell that story here.  It is under similar circumstances that a document was prepared for him to come here and provide false testimony.  So I am telling you that this thing never happened.  There were flags belonging to political parties in Mukingo commune, and at the time I left the commune, the flags were still flying.  So if anyone committed a crime personally, he should be personally liable.  All I can say is that I never saw anyone pull down the flags of any political party, and I must say that I never neglected any complaints that came to me relating to any such behaviour.  
Q.	Gatabazi has also claimed that you are responsible for the killing of an MDR party member by the name of Amiel Bigirishaka; is that true? 
A.	That is another lie.  If such a crime had been committed, we wouldn't have needed to wait for the ICTR to be set up.  Why was I not prosecuted?  Why did members of Mukingo commune not know of the existence of any such thing?  I would like to tell the presiding Judge and all the Judges in this Trial Chamber, as well as the persons in the courtroom, that this thing never happened.  Even the inhabitants of Mukingo commune can confirm to you the conditions in which that person died.  That person took ill and died of natural causes. 

What I can say is that the person was involved in the election to the position of bourgmestre.  And while I was briefly in the office of the bourgmestre, I believe that I told you that I took office on the 22nd of June, and for the 15 days or so during which I was bourgmestre, I could not have beaten up somebody and the entire population would not be aware of it.  And I think that all of us who are reasonable persons here present can understand what I am saying.   I spent very little time in office, and no crime was committed during the fifteen days when I was in power in Mukingo.  

So what Gatabazi has said is a lie that can be cross-checked and that can even be understood by all those who are present here, because during the 15 days in which I was in power, I could not have beaten up anybody and I was not even in a position to know everything that transpired across the commune.  

So if you were to think properly and if one were to rely on one's conscience, then one would understand that I am innocent.  I did not commit any crime.  There was no problem between myself and that individual who was a member of the MDR party.  

Thank you, Mr. President.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth, Mr. President, an appeal for the witness to kindly slow down because the interpreters are having a very hard time keeping up with him.  Thank you, sir.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you are being asked to speak more slowly by the interpreters.  So please try to speak a little bit more slowly.  Now, did you know a person in Mukingo commune named Makoni?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Yes, I knew one Makoni.  
Q.	How did he die? 
A.	A soldier, who was a lieutenant, killed him at his home.  Those are the circumstances in which he died.  
Q.	Did you or Mr. Nzirorera ever instruct anybody to go and attack Makoni? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I have told you consistently that there has been an attempt to put all possible blame on me for all possible and impossible things.  The blame has been shifted either to me or to Nzirorera.  So if anybody has told you that we gave instructions for that person to be attacked, that is not true.  When Makoni was killed, we joined their -- his family in their sorrow.  We visited them and buried him.  

This question reminds me of what you said yesterday.  You see, there is some information that we only found out about here.  If you go to Mukingo itself, nobody will tell you a story along those similar lines.  So please help me to get the world to understand that this Tribunal has intelligent people who can conduct investigations.  

Nzirorera had nothing to do with Makoni.  Makoni was somebody who had a bar which was his home at the same time.  So if we are to agree that such a person should be respected, then Nzirorera, mindful of his position, also ought to be respected because, given his rank, he could not have had any such dealings with Makoni.  I know that Makoni was assailed by a soldier of the Rwandan army who had no connection with Nzirorera nor with myself.  Furthermore, I do not know anything about any such thing that would involve Nzirorera.  All I know is that he did not do it.  And I thank you.  
Q.	Did you ever hold any meetings at the commune office in which people were encouraged to exterminate the Tutsi? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Now, for all of us here present, if such a meeting had taken place, how would I have gone on to protect Tutsis?  I protected them because I loved them and I can -- I continue to confirm it.  You see, the -- the war costs the loss of human life, of people whom I knew, people who were my friends.  I therefore want to inform the President and the Judges that such a meeting did not take place.  If any such meeting would have taken place, I think that the members of the population themselves would have taken revenge on the Tutsis, given that the RPF had attacked on the 22nd and the 23rd.  Four thousand Tutsis were killed in Mukingo commune, and generally speaking, some 23,000 in Ruhingu -- in Ruhing -- in -- in the prefecture.  So if I had asked for Tutsis to be killed, no Tutsi would have survived.  But I and others loved Tutsis, and we protected them in the ISAE building.  And I have evidence that I will provide when my case will be reviewed.  So I worked with a number of people who helped me to assist those Tutsis, and I have evidence in support thereof.  
Q.	Just to correct what I think may have been an error in interpretation or maybe mis -- you misspoke, but the 4,000 people that were killed in 19- -- after the 1993 attack -- what was their ethnicity?
MR. WEBSTER: 
	Before the witness answers, could -- could the witness tell us which attack he is referring to, because he mentioned the date 22nd and 23rd.  So I think we should find out if he is talking about 1991, 1992 or 1993 before he goes on.  
THE WITNESS: 
	I thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, for assisting me so that I can clarify this matter.  I am referring here to the RPF attack of the 8th of February 1993, 8th February 1993. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what was the ethnicity of the 4,000?  
A.	Forty-six thousand Tutsis were killed -- Hutu, rather -- were killed in Byumba, and should I say 4,000 --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
	Mr. President, please kindly ask the witness to repeat his answer.  The interpreters have lost him completely.  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yeah.  Mr. Kajelijeli, the interpreters are completely lost here for a minute.  So we have to start all over again because there seems to be a problem of interpretation and your speed of speaking.  So just answer my question very shortly and very directly.  In the 1993 attack, the 4,000 people who were 
	killed -- what were their ethnicity?  Hutu or Tutsi?  
A.	They were Hutu.  
Q.	Okay.  Now, let me go on to something else, and that is, did Mr. Nzirorera ever attend any meetings at the Mukingo commune office between October 1990 and the death of the president in April 1994? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I did not see him attend any meeting at the Mukingo communal office  from October 1990 with the outbreak of the war, and I am referring here to Nzirorera.  I did not see Nzirorera attend any meeting at the Mukingo communal office.  
Q.	To your knowledge, were lists of Tutsis ever compiled in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  That is an accusation which I became aware of here at the ICTR.  Lists of Tutsis were never drawn up, particularly given that Hutus and Tutsis lived together and knew each other.  So there was no need for any lists to be drawn up because we were all brothers.  That issue of lists -- I only became aware of it here at the ICTR.  I believe it is a fabrication by the Prosecutor designed to make its case against us.  
Q.	Prior to the death of President Habyarimana, did you know of any plan or project to kill Tutsis? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  Up until the time I left the commune, I never heard mention of such a project.  The events that unfolded did not include any project to kill Tutsis.  We tried our level best to stop people from pitting themselves against each other.  We gave instructions to people telling them not to take advantage of the war to take over people's property.  Nobody was involved in any planning to kill Tutsis in our commune.  
Q.	We know that many Tutsis were killed on the 7th of April 1994 in Mukingo commune.  Did you have any role in those killings? 
A.	I do recall that you put a similar question to me yesterday and I answered it, but I am going to repeat the answer that I gave you yesterday.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I did not play any role.  I never had it in my mind to hate Tutsis at that time.  I told you also that given instructions that had been announced by the government, I remained at my home, and then I went out briefly to meet the minister who was coming from Nkuli, and I chatted with him briefly at a distance of some 100 metres from my home.  Thank you.
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera have any role in the killings in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I thank all those present in the courtroom.  You are the one who has told me, Counsel, and you are aware that people have accused him of involvement.  However, as regards the killing of innocent people in our commune, no one brought any charges against Nzirorera.  These charges were all fabricated here by the Prosecutor with the assistance of those in power in Rwanda.  Nzirorera was not in our commune during the period that we are reviewing in our discussions.  So this never -- this never happened.  
MR. ROBINSON:
	Thank you, Mr. President, I have no further questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Thank you, Mr. Robinson.  

	Do any of the other Defence teams wish to ask this witness any questions?
MR. SOW:
	No questions, Mr. President.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
	No questions for this witness, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
	Now, Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor who now has an opportunity to cross-examine you.
MR. HOMETOWU:
	Your Honours, the entire examination-in-chief lasted four hours, sixteen minutes.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you, Mr. Registrar.
MR. WEBSTER:  
	Thank you, Your Honours.  If I could begin by asking for some assistance from the registry.  I have a binder of the relevant documents that we may use, and if you could help us to distribute them to the parties and the Chamber.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	So good morning, Mr. Witness -- or Mr. Kajelijeli, I should say. 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	I don't have to introduce myself to you because both of us are well acquainted, wouldn't you agree?  I was the attorney that was present at your initial appearance back in April of 1999, I believe. 
A.	Yes, you are right.  I know the Prosecutor.  We know each other but he has kept away from me since then.  
Q.	Well, quoting one of the Accused here, I can say "nous sommes ensemble", we are together; right? 
A.	You're welcome.  
Q.	Okay, thank you.  When Mr. Robinson was questioning you at the very beginning of his 
	direct examination, he took you through a series of questions about the judicially noticed adjudicated facts in our trial.  Do you understand that those are findings of fact by the Trial Chamber in your own trial which have survived attack on appeal; in other words, the Trial Chamber found those facts; they were challenged on appeal; they survived the challenge on appeal; and now those facts are incorporated in our trial record in this case.  So I just want to make sure through your response that you understand the significance of those adjudicated facts. 
A.	Now, Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not know whether there is an article of the rules which provides that there are facts about which no further discussion can take place.  I have told you that there are lies that have been fabricated by the OTP and that the OTP has asked those witnesses to come and tell the same lies here before the Trial Chamber.  Some of the witnesses have retracted, and there is even additional evidence which sufficiently proves that what witnesses have narrated to the Trial Chamber relating to a number of facts can be revisited, because the Trial Chamber should not rely on lies to convict someone.  Those who have told lies I am saying have lied.  And even in other trials, in other cases, it has also been proven that the facts that may have been dealt with in other Trial Chambers were dealt with on the basis of lies.  

	So, Mr. Prosecutor, I do not agree with you, and I believe that your position cannot be tenable and cannot be sustained because it has been established that some issues were based on lies and that the truth cannot emerge from a premise of lies.  
Q.	So, Mr. Kajelijeli -- Mr. Kajelijeli, I don't want to give you the impression that those findings of fact cannot be challenged.  In fact, your testimony here today is one way that the Nzirorera Defence team is trying to challenge those findings of fact.  So I just wanted to make sure that you understood the significance of the adjudicated facts, but I am not suggesting to you that you cannot challenge them.  In fact, you have challenged the facts that Mr. Robinson read to you, the facts 41 to 46.  
	But I'd like to ask you now about some of the other factual findings that have been judicially noticed, fact 33, for example, which states that, "On the 7th of April 1994, many Tutsi men, women and children were attacked and massacred at a place of shelter within Mukingo commune, in this case the place known as Munyemvano's compound in Rwankeli cellule."  You agree with that fact, don't you?
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I think that you have already provided the answer to your question.  The courts in Rwanda have provided you with documents that proved that no one was killed at Munyemvano's house.  The same documents indicate that the members of that family were killed in the convent in Busogo.  So I do not agree with you, particularly given that I have already demonstrated that I was not involved in those killings.  I was simply narrating the facts as the facts have also been narrated to you.  

	But what your office did was to look for witnesses to come and testify along the lines of what you have said.  But according to the investigations conducted in Rwanda, it has been established that no one was killed in Munyemvano's family, at least not according to the conditions that you have outlined, and that Kajelijeli was not involved in those killings.  
	
	You want to involve me in those killings.  Is that your case?  And is that the basis of your case?  If that is it, then your case is baseless because we have evidence to the contrary.  And the evidence has been upheld to the extent that the request for a review of my case has been granted.  So even in cases in Rwanda, these facts are no longer being talked about.  You are the only ones who are talking about these facts.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Kajelijeli, in your own trial wasn't there testimony from GBG, who is a young man who survived the attacks at Munyemvano's compound, and ACM, a woman, Tutsi, both of them 
	Tutsi survivors of the attacks at that very location?  Are you suggesting that those persons who survived the attacks came in to lie about it? 
A.	Mr. President, I am not here to repeat that which was said during my trial.  But among the evidence submitted to the Appeals Chamber, there is proof that GBG was not in Rwanda.  And concerning 
	GCM -- ACM, he saw nobody who was killed when he left to go to the parish.  We have facts to prove -- contradict what she said.  This witness was not present.  This witness was not in the region.  It was rather one of the persons whom I had enabled to flee in 1993 and who at the time was in Kabgayi.  

	And so of the new facts in which I am in possession, you will realise that this person lied.  I even have written evidence, very important facts, in the reports, in your -- in the verbatim reports in your records that prove that it is you and your office who told this witness to testify as he did.  In fact, you fabricated testimony.  You dictated things to this witness for this witness to come and repeat them before this 
	Trial Chamber.  

What about the case -- I have proof that nobody was killed at Munyemvano's residence and proof that I myself, Kajelijeli, was not involved in any massacre.  
Q.	Okay, Mr. Kajelijeli.  Just for the clarity of the record, GBG was a young man and ACM was a young woman.  Can we agree on that much?  Just so that we are clear in how we read the -- go back to the record later on when you are not around to explain it for us.  
A.	I think these witnesses said all they had to say during my trial.  But what about the case during that period these persons were not in Mukingo?  
Q.	My question to you is very simple.  So let's use this as an example for how we are going to proceed.  When I ask you a very simple question, just listen to the question and be responsive to the question.  I am not going back into the facts of what happened in Munyemvano's compound.  I am simply trying to clarify through you that GBG was a young man -- he may have been around 15 or 16 years old 
	at the time -- and ACM was a young woman.  Limit yourself to that issue.  That's true, isn't it?  
A.	I acknowledge that ACM was a Tutsi lady, but I know nothing.  I have no facts regarding their ages.  What about the case -- in Rwanda these ethnic group names are no more in use?  
Q.	Very good.  You said that you had launched -- you were granted a review procedure.  Let's clarify that.  We'll come back to that later.  But just so that we don't -- we deal with things as they arise.  That's not true, is it?  You were assigned an attorney to assist you in the preparation of an application for a review proceeding.  Isn't that the more accurate way of saying that? 
A.	This was not done out of the blue.  This was done on the basis of documents and from the needs of truth, clarity, and justice so that the process for a review be done by a duly appointed counsel and which I hope, Mr. President, Mr. Judge, is what is going to happen.  And so that does not hinder me since after my response I put a question to you you did not answer.  And so please allow the file to follow its course until the organ in charge, namely, the Trial Chamber -- Appeals Chamber, would answer yes or no to my motion.  Well, I think that we should allow the work to be done by 
	the Appeals Chamber.  And so, please, you don't -- don't mix things up here.  Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
Q.	Lets go back to the question.  It is not accurate to state that you have been granted a review of your prior judgments.  You have been assigned counsel to assist you in putting together an application for review; isn't that the case? 
A.	I just told you that this decision was taken on the basis of solid proof and evidence, which I forwarded to the Appeals Chamber my file, which is in the hands of the Appeals Chamber.  And so please ask me questions concerning Nzirorera's trial and in the light of the questions which Counsel Robinson put to me.  
Q.	Your response on the record will suffice, Mr. Kajelijeli.  We are not in agreement on that point, but it's not very important.
THE WITNESS:
	You can go ahead.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let's look at fact number 49, and I'll read it.  "Augustin Habiyambere and Sendugu Shadrack led an attack on the morning of the 7th of April following the delivery of  weapons from Mukamira camp in which approximately 100 young militants, including youth from Nkuli commune, recruits from Mukingo led by the CDR president Iyakaremye, a group from the Rukomo mountains, forces from  Mukamira", and then it goes on to list other participants in the attack and ends up by stating that these people attacked and killed approximately 12 families of Tutsis, numbering approximately 80 people, residing in the Kinyababa cellule in Nkuli commune.

	Do you contest that fact which Trial Chamber II found in your trial? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, all the parties in this trial, concerning the Nkuli commune, I also said yesterday that all these are lies invented by the Prosecutor as well as the Rwandan justice system.  Habiyambere confessed personally, and he wrote what he said, he and his colleagues.  There is no relationship between him and myself, and he does not quote me in his trial in Rwanda concerning the Kinyababa sites.  You are saying that is an established fact.  It is a lie.  It's a lie so far as I'm concerned.  But that does not mean that the other persons were not involved in this massacre.  Whatever the case, so far as I am concerned, this trial -- this Tribunal one day will have to state that there was an erroneous and a false decision concerning me.  I have proof to that effect.  Thank you very much.  
Q.	Are you also suggesting that 12 Tutsi families numbering approximately 80 people who were residing in Kinyababa cellule in Nkuli commune -- are you suggesting that those people were not killed on
	 7th of April, 1994?  A simple yes or no will do. 
A.	But I already submitted an answer to that question.  I said that that massacre took place, but I don't know the circumstances of that massacre, and the persons involved in that massacre have been penalised.  But nobody mentioned my name, not even during the Gacaca court sessions.  The criminals concerned confessed their crimes and have been penalised.  I do not know why you want to involve me in this massacre while the people concerned did not mention my name.

1145H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Lets's go on to fact number 57.  The Interahamwe attackers involved in the attack at 
Munyemvano's compound used traditional weapons, guns and grenades to slaughter their 
Tutsi victims.  Do you dispute that fact as well? 
A.	I told you that I do not know those facts and I was not involved.  You have the file from the Rwandan justice system.  Look wherever you want to, you'll never find my name.  It is you and your office and the colleagues of the Prosecutor in Rwanda who have invented these stories and lies.  I cannot tell why you continue persistently to involve me in these events while the Rwandan justice system did not involve me.  
Q.	Let's look at fact 58.  There was a killing of a large number of Tutsis at the convent at Busogo parish on the morning of the 7th of April 1994.  The number of bodies buried the following day is an indicator that approximately 300 people died in the attack.  Are you disputing that fact? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  How did you get about counting these corpses?  G -- GAO stated during my trial that 300 corpses were buried.  But it's a lie, since the survivors came right here and stated that it was 130 corpses that were buried -- or, rather, 138.  Now -- the difference between 300 and 138, so the number of persons that are remaining -- or, if you get the difference between 138 and 300, the others were killed by the RPF.  And this witness who told you that they buried 300 people -- 300 persons did not tell the truth.  

This Witness GAO said that these corpses were buried on the 8th, but you -- you are saying that the same GAO on the 8th was involved in an attack in some other venue.  He could not have been in an attack on the 8th after having been at a burial on that same date.  From the proof that I have, he, on that date, participated at -- in three attacks.  So do not try to mislead the Judges.  I have written facts to back and buttress that which I'm saying.  
Q.	What about fact number 61:  At the Ruhengeri court of appeal, Interahamwe, who were all Hutus, killed about 300 Tutsis.  Do you dispute that fact? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, as the Prosecutor is asking these questions trying to involve me in this trial, it is GAO who is at the origin of all this.  But in three trials concerning him, GAO admitted the facts.  He confessed to having participated in these crimes, and co-perpetrators also stated that he was involved in these massacres.  So, at the end of the day, the truth will prevail.  
Q.	Well, let's look at some of the facts where GAO did not offer any evidence -- or, where there was substantial evidence of the survivors of the attack.  How about fact number 17:  Members of the Interahamwe, including Interahamwe from Mukingo commune and neighbouring areas, committed rapes and sexual assaults in the Ruhengeri préfecture from between 7 and 10 April 1994.  Where your Trial Chamber heard evidence from ACM, GDO, GDT and GDF, all of whom were Tutsi women who testified about the injuries and the sexual assaults that they -- they sustained.  Are you disputing that evidence? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, you are experienced Judges.  I am also very experienced on this trial 
and -- this trial case.  You have talked about these witnesses during my trial.  The charges regarding rape, which came up during my trial, was discounted because it was proven that I was not involved in this crime, and the Trial Chamber ruled that I was not guilty of that crime.  

Now, concerning ACM -- ECM -- ACM -- she said that I, personally, was not involved in the rapes.  
In -- in -- one of the cases, ACM said that in Rwanda she was raped by people in a family where she spent the night.  But you want to present another picture to the Judges, but these are very wise Judges.  

You're also talking about JF -- GF (sic).  GF re -- denounced her testimony.  She said that this other witness lied, because she contradicted herself by saying that she was raped in a sorghum farm.  
But, later on, she said she was raped in -- in a -- in a cabbage farm.  That's not possible.  And she said that these crimes were committed in a specific location, but this was a location or locality that was occupied by the RPF.  

And in her testimony, she made it clear that she was in Kinigi and that I -- on that day I, myself, I attacked -- led an attack in Kinigi.  But the Trial Chamber rejected all these allegations.  I don't need to repeat these charges which were rejected by the Trial Chamber.  And so I plead with you, Honourable Judges, do not lay any credence to what the Prosecutor is saying. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, I'll mention four other facts.  I'm not going to go through each one of them individually.  I'll simply state to you they are separate accounts of rapes committed by Interahamwe on the 7th of April or the 10th of April, one involving a Tutsi woman in Busogo parish -- referring to the church -- who was raped by members of the Interahamwe; another, the handicapped daughter of a Tutsi woman who was raped by Interahamwe in Rukoma cellule; another, a Tutsi woman raped and sexually mutilated by the Interahamwe in Susa secteur, Kinigi commune, on the 7th of April; and the last, a Tutsi woman raped by members of the Interahamwe in Susa secteur on the 10th of April.  Those are adjudicated facts, 21 through to 24.  Do you deny -- or, do you dispute those factual findings? 
A.	That is not true.  And, in my trial, it was proven that I was not responsible or guilty of those crimes.  We have not come to revisit my trial.  You filed an appeal and that appeal was rejected.  I don't know why you're coming back to this.  Did Nzirorera tell you that when these crimes were committed, I was aware?  Did he tell you that? 

The Trial Chamber ruled that I was not guilty of those charges, and so those rape cases did not take place.  Does a Tutsi lady -- the lady who said that she had a child who was raped, but the people who took care of her child came right here and testified and stated that that was not true.  But these facts do not concern me.  I'm not guilty of these facts or these crimes.  
Why are you asking me these questions concerning these crimes in the Nzirorera trial?  Your office filed an appeal and the appeal was turned down.  You want the trial -- the Appeals Chamber to come back on the cases of charges of rape?  But your appeal was rejected, so I do not know why you are revisiting these facts in the trial of Nzirorera.  
Q.	Well, just for your information, Mr. Witness, these facts have not been discounted.  These facts were accepted by Trial Chamber II.  They survived the appeal that you filed, so they remained facts the Trial Chamber II has found in your case, and they are facts which are in evidence in this trial.  So just because you were not convicted of rape does not mean that these facts were discounted.  So I just want you to understand the significance of the exercise we're engaged in now.  

So is it your testimony -- or what -- what is your position?  Are you suggesting that there was no genocide of the Tutsi in Mukingo and that Tutsi women were not raped systematically as part of the attacks that took place on the 7th and 8th and 9th in April? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Hutus and Tutsis were brothers.  Nahimana wrote a book describing the crime of genocide.  You'll find someone who prepared the war and carried out the massacres, and there's someone who bears a responsibility for that.  And, here, I am stating that Tutsis were killed, but also Hutus were killed.  These -- were also victims during this war.  

And from the enquiries -- investigations that you carried out prove that those who were -- who were responsible -- were guilty of all these massacres were those who started off the war.  And you are neglecting the persons who started off the war and you are attacking the persons who carried on the war.  I thank you very much, Mr. President, I thank you, Your Honours.
Q.	So we're in agreement on, at least, one thing:  That there was genocide of the Tutsi in Mukingo.  Massive killings and massive rapes perpetrated against the Tutsi population in Mukingo in April of 1994.  We agree?  You can answer that simply by a yes or no, Mr. Witness.  
A.	No, I do not agree with you.  
Q.	There was no genocide of the Tutsi in Mukingo?  
A.	I have referred you to a book that you need to read in order to understand how to coin the concept that you're dealing with and to determine who was at the very beginning of -- of this whole thing.  
Q.	My question to you is very simple, and I'm asking for your answer, not a reference to a book.  In Mukingo commune in April of 1994, there were around 800 Tutsi in the whole commune.  And by the time you became bourgmestre in June, only a handful was left.  Are you suggesting that that was not genocide of the Tutsi in Mukingo in April, May and June of 1994? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Prosecutor Don Webster is fabricating allegations.  It is true that people died.  Hutus died.  I have talked to you about 4,000 people who were killed in 1993.  Those who died when the RPF was attempting to take power, the number of those who died have been counted and it is 2,772 Hutus who were killed.  
Now, you say there were 800 Tutsis at the time and that when I took power only a few were still alive.  Well, the power in the -- the -- those in power have prosecuted those who committed these crimes, and I agree that people were killed.  But I don't agree with the terminology that you're using to qualify these killings -- but, allow me to add one thing.  I -- I won my case on the count of genocide which was withdrawn from one of the charges against me.  
Q.	You won your case?  What did you win?  
A.	(Microphones overlapping)
Q.	You were convicted of genocide; you were convicted of extermination; you were convicted of direct and public incitement to genocide by a Trial Chamber judgement in December of 2003; isn't that so? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I said that the -- my case is going to be reviewed.  All what the Prosecutor has said is in line with the attempt to get my conviction.  He infiltrated and intoxicated the mind of the Judges.  

Now, it was said that I had a role in the killings.  But, currently, from -- I'm relying on documents that you yourself disclosed to us.  I will challenge, and I will continue to challenge all those allegations because I have exculpatory evidence with me.  And it is not going to be here that I will say that the conviction is final, but, you see, the truth will emerge and prevail.  So, please, do not force me to say that I have been convicted.  I was convicted because you fabricated lies and you cannot sustain that.  You see, you manipulated the people.  You know what you did.  Everything is clear and we now have evidence -- I want to thank you, Mr. Prosecutor, thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  
Q.	Well, let's just stick with Mukingo commune, Mr. Kajelijeli.  And here I'd like to refer you to a document in my bundle.  It's in tab 2, the second tab towards the end.  The documents are not numbered.  It really doesn't need to be referenced; I'm just going to refer to some of the information contained in it.  But this is a census of Mukingo commune that dates back to October of 1992 when you were the bourgmestre.  And according to this census, there were approximately 700 Tutsi in Mukingo commune back in 1992.  

And the information that we have is that by 1994, there were 800 Tutsi of approximately 40,000 or 50,000 of the total population in Mukingo of tens of thousands.  And of those 800 that may have survived into April of 1994, only around 30 remained after the killings of April, May, June and July.  

In fact, so many Tutsi were killed in Mukingo that witnesses, both from the Defence and the Prosecution, have testified that by the time you got around to June of 1994, there were no more killings because there were no more Tutsi left to kill.  Isn't that the case?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the Prosecutor is narrating a -- a story that we -- we need to look at closely.  If you look at the story, we went into exile.  And by the way, it was the Tutsi who went into exile the -- first, and when the RPF took power, they came back.  

So we can talk about 400.  That is good.  But, if you return to our commune, you will see that there was an increase in the number of figures.  The Tutsis are in power, and they are living in harmony with other people.  They can tell you themselves that they left the country, and so you cannot claim that this -- these -- this data is correct, and you cannot force me to believe what you're saying.  

In 1994 I was not in power, and I explained to you that I was not aware of some events.  You cannot force me to accept the figures that you are putting forward.  So it is either that you are mistaken or you are lying to this Trial Chamber for there are many Tutsis who are still alive.  And you are relying on a lie to mislead the Trial Chamber.  

So it was not only Tutsis who were killed; Hutus were killed as well, and you have conducted investigations and you know the role that each party played in this matter.  
Q.	Well, to satisfy you, Mr. Witness, let me pass up a document to you.  The signatory of the document is none other than yourself, Juvénal Kajelijeli, bourgmestre of Mukingo.  It's a report that you submitted to the préfet in Ruhengeri back on the 28th of October 1992, and you list out the population in the whole of Mukingo commune.  You identify them by sex, by ethnicity, by new births and new deaths.  So my suggestion to you is that you had a very clear idea of who the population was in Mukingo back in 1992 when you were bourgmestre.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So if Mr. Issa could actually just show this to the Judges and to the -- to the witness.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you have suggested that we should not redo your trial here in this courtroom; right?  That my questions to you should not address the issues -- the factual issues in your own trial; is that what you're suggesting? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, and all those present in the courtroom, I have said that there are -- there were many lies and a lot of fabrication in my case, and so I told you that today, I have evidence pointing to the fact that you, Mr. Prosecutor, are part of those people who have fabricated the accusations with the assistance of the Rwandan authorities.  So you cannot raise here, in this court, matters that were canvassed during my trial.  So you cannot use Nzirorera's case to revisit my own trial.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, isn't that what you are doing?  Using Nzirorera's case to revisit your own trial?  Isn't that the whole point of your testimony here today?  To assist you in your application for review of 
two judgements of this Tribunal, your trial judgement, which was issued on the -- let me get the date for you.  

I believe it was the 1st of December 2003 and your appeal judgement of the 23rd of May 2005.  Isn't that the very purpose of your testimony, because you seek to dispute the very facts in Nzirorera's case that could assist you in overturning those two judgements? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, and all those present in the courtroom, please listen attentively to what the Prosecutor is saying.  He is wasting the Trial Chamber's time.  I have very little time, but let me be brief.  

I did not come here to seek a review of my trial.  The procedure is still ongoing.  I simply came here to testify and to state that charges that have been made against Nzirorera are such that through my testimony, I am attempting to prove his innocence.  I have not come here to apply for a review of my trial.  So the Prosecutor cannot insist on dealing with my case here.  

Now, what I can say is that it was on the 10th of June 2001 that a decision was taken for a disjoinder leading to Kajelijeli -- a severance, rather, leading to Kajelijeli's case being tried singularly.  So what you have referred to is irrelevant because my case was tried, it is ongoing, and I have simply come here to defend Nzirorera in respect of the lies and allegations that you make against him.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	It was never explained to you, Mr. Kajelijeli, how your evidence could assist Mr. Nzirorera in his defence? 
A.	Let me repeat, Mr. President, Your Honours, who would have explained that to me?  So if you had that written somewhere, please, show me the document on which such was written.  So I don't know where you're coming from.  
Q.	You didn't discuss the substance of your evidence today with Mr. Robinson before starting your testimony? 
A.	Throughout the examination-in-chief, you saw him ask questions to me, and I answered.  So now it is your turn.  So I don't know what you're talking about.  
Q.	Did you not -- 
A.	Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry to the interpreters.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Did you not meet with Mr. Robinson and go over the evidence that you were going to give today before you started your testimony? 
A.	That should not be a problem; whenever you have called witnesses, you -- you know them.  So Mr. Robinson came to see me asking me to testify here.  So that should not be a problem.  I met him.  I know something about the allegations against Nzirorera, and that is why I have come to testify, and that is what I am doing.  So I don't understand the basis for your question.  I don't see the basis for your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, don't assume that there's a problem with any of the questions I'm asking you.  If you listen to the question and answer it, we'll go through this material much more quickly.  I'm not suggesting there's a problem with meeting with Mr. Robinson.  All you have to do is say, "Yes, I met with him."  

But my question to you now is, did he not tell you how your evidence could be of assistance to Nzirorera's defence? 
A.	If my testimony were not to be useful for Nzirorera, I would not have come here.  So he called me because he felt that my testimony can be useful to Nzirorera.  
Q.	And certainly you realise that Mr. Nzirorera is alleged to be criminally responsible for your acts and your crimes.  So any crime that is attributed to you can also be attributed to Mr. Nzirorera.  You realise that too, don't you? 
A.	The answer is already in your question.  Nzirorera cannot be punished for offences that I allegedly committed.  So for those offences that you fabricated against me, I have found counter-evidence.  
So whether it be Nzirorera or myself, no one can be punished on the basis of those false declarations.  

I trust the Judges.  I know that they cannot take sides.  And I have evidence, and I know that the persons who committed the crimes for which I was prosecuted have already confessed to those crimes and have been punished.  So I cannot be punished for facts or offences that were committed by other persons.  
Q.	Did you trust the Judges of Trial Chamber II back in 2001 and 2002 when you were on trial before them? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, and all those present in the courtroom, I never had trust in those Judges, and the proof is that the Prosecutor has the motion which we filed for the Judges to be recused.  And I think that this was filed with the Trial Chamber and that motion was in my trial right up to the end.  And it was on the basis of my motion that the Judges took revenge on me, because I moved that they be recused from that case.  

That is why the judgement was unfair and justice was not rendered.  That is why it has been cross-checked and it has been found that the judgement was falsely rendered and that the review process must be undertaken.  

So, in brief, to answer your question, I did not have any confidence or trust in those Judges following my motion for the Judges to be withdrawn from that case.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	In any case, Mr. Witness, those Judges heard evidence from 14 Prosecution witnesses and reviewed evidence in 35 Prosecution exhibits; right? 
A.	Well, that is false; that is not true.  What you say is false.  You see, the Prosecutor called 13 witnesses, and I called 28.  So the judgement was a one-way decision relying only on the Prosecutor's case.  
So justice was not rendered in my case.  
Q.	According to the judgement itself, the Court heard testimony from 14 Prosecution witnesses, one of whom was an investigator.  Of the 13 factual witnesses, nine were victims or eyewitnesses.  Only 
	four were presumed to have participated in the crimes.  

Now, you dispute the evidence from GAO and GDD.  Do you also dispute the evidence from the 
nine victims and eyewitnesses to those crimes who had no connection with you or the prison in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Let me state again that you're wasting the Trial Chamber's time.  I denied all those allegations and I have applied for a review of my case.  I have already said something about each of those witnesses whom you have referred to, and this is substantiated by evidence that is available to me.  

So, I think -- you see, that there is also information that you withheld from me which was a breach of the law, Mr. Prosecutor.  So, please, do not waste the Court's time.  Because, you see, the Appeals Chamber did not come to a decision without looking at the evidence that I placed before 
him (sic).  

So the allegations that you are trying to confirm here are no longer valid because it has been realised that they were lies and that the witnesses -- even the witnesses whom you are talking about, who are not the criminals who are in court from -- it is -- it is -- there is evidence now that those witnesses were called up and trained one-on-one in order that they support the lies that you have in your statements before the Court.  

So, please, do not waste the time of the Court.  The evidence is there, and the documents are even available to you.  If -- if I had time, I -- I would delve into them, but this -- this is not a matter for -- for my case.  There is evidence as to the lies that they told, and the witnesses themselves have confessed to telling those lies.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Mr. Kajelijeli, you currently stand sentenced to 45 years' imprisonment as a result of the convictions of this Trial Chamber; is that not so? 
A.	I don't think that is a question.  I have already challenged that conviction, and that is why there is a need for fairness and equity to be upheld through a review of that judgement.  So I -- I do not support your -- your -- your statement.  
Q.	You were 47 years old when you were arrested in 1998; right? 
A.	Well, you can calculate that for yourself.  Yes, that's right.  
Q.	So it's possible that you may be released from prison after you celebrate your 92nd birthday given the sentence of 45 years that you were given.  That's correct too, isn't it? 
A.	Well, my destiny is not in your hands.  I have appealed, and I'm going to fight for the truth to emerge.  Even if you try to use tricks to withhold the truth, God will not allow me to die in prison or allow that the 45 years be spent in prison.  Mr. Prosecutor, you're hurting my scars, and that is not good.  
Q.	Couldn't we agree, Mr. Kajelijeli, that you have nothing to lose by any of the evidence that you give in this Chamber.  You already stand convicted.  As things currently stand, you'll serve another 42 years in jail -- excuse me, 32 or 33 years in jail as things now stand.  And the only thing that could assist you in shortening your period of incarceration is the type of evidence that you're giving in this court today.  
To the extent that you can assist Mr. Nzirorera's defence, you further your own attempts to overturn your own convictions.  Isn't that true? 
A.	I have told you a short while ago that Nzirorera's case was separated from Kajelijeli's case, so there was a severance of the case, according to a decision of 10 June 2001.  So that decision is binding.  And my testimony today is in relation to Nzirorera's innocence.  But, if you want to revisit those questions that you put to me during my trial, I will continue to demonstrate that I'm innocent in spite of your denial of that fact.  

I will insist that wisdom will lead the Judges to the truth and they will not always agree to support lies.  
I thank you, Mr. President, I thank you, Your Honours.  
Q.	You testified in your own defence back in 2003, isn't that so?  You testified from -- I believe it's the 14th of April to the 23rd of April.  
A.	Frankly, I can tell you that I had a counsel, but I did not conclude everything, and the judgement was rendered against me.  But the truth is that I am still fighting on.  It's not over yet.  
Q.	Yes.  But, what I'm suggesting to you is that you testified as a witness in your own trial and Trial Chamber II listened to your testimony; right?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	And on every issue where your credibility was in issue, Trial Chamber II refused to believe you and, instead, relied on evidence from the witnesses -- the other witnesses, most of whom placed you at various locations and testified about what you did.  So Trial Chamber II listened to you, and they listened to all of the evidence and on not a single issue, where your credibility was in issue, did Trial Chamber II rely on what you had to say.  That's true, isn't it? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  Let me say that at trial level and on appeal, the Judges relied on the lies in the allegations that you forwarded to them.  That is why I was convicted, and that is why I am challenging the judgement that was rendered against me.  And that is also why I am asking for a review of my case.  

So, as of now, the judgement remains impugned -- or, challenged.  And the Appeals Chamber has revisited the issue and ordered that the review process be initiated, so all what you are saying now relating to the various convictions are baseless because those decisions were not fair.  And that is why the Judges did not believe in you and came to that decision in order to determine whether the trial was fair.  And that is why we have new evidence.  

If you're relying on what you sent to me, if you had looked at it closely, you, yourself, would have asked for a review and for acquittal in my case.  So why do you want to engage in polemics, whereas, there is exculpatory evidence in your possession which discharges me from the allegations that you tagged 
on to me?  

There is evidence.  Last week, for example, you sent me some evidence, evidence -- exculpatory evidence relating to the allegations that you made against me.  And now you want, again, to rely on those very false allegations that you made against me that led to my conviction?  You want to rely on that?  No.  What you are saying now is not current if one were to rely on the evidence that you have sent -- forwarded to me yourselves.  Thank you, Mr. President, thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I take note of the time.  We can pause now and reconvene, or I can continue, but it is -- I believe it is close to 12:30 -- or, 12:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  It is just past 12:30.  We shall take our luncheon adjournment now.  

Now, just a comment I wish to make, Mr. Witness.  I mentioned earlier when you were being examined by counsel for the Defence  -- and I think the same point is applicable now -- that it's really up to us as the Judges to determine whether questions are proper or not.  So it doesn't really benefit any of us for you to engage in too much debate with counsel as to whether his questions are allowable or not.  You'll get on much quicker if you allowed us to take the responsibility for keeping him on the proper track.  Okay?  

So we take the luncheon adjournment now. 
THE WITNESS:
I will comply with your instructions, Mr. President.  Thank you.
(Court recessed at 1233H) 
 (Pages 27 to 36 by Jean Baigent)










(Court resumed at 1410H)
 MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We can continue.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good afternoon again, Mr. Kajelijeli.
A.	Good afternoon, Prosecutor. 
Q.	I want to revisit an issue that I had raised previously.  It's a document that I had handed around, and I actually need to correct the record because I referred to it as a document that you had signed.  And on closer inspection I realised that it was actually signed by Assiel Ndisetse but it went out under your signature.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And I'd like to have the registry pass it back to Mr. Kajelijeli.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And if you look on the first page of that document, at the bottom right-hand corner, you do see your name and then there is a signature.  You can tell us if that's your signature or that of Assiel Ndisetse.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Counsel for the Prosecution, this is not my signature.  This is Ndisetse's signature.  He was the conseiller and he signed in my name.
Q.	In any case, we can agree that this was a memorandum that was sent to the préfet, and it includes a census for Mukingo commune for three months, for June, July and August of 1992, when you were still the bourgmestre.  
A.	Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	And according to this census, for the month of June there were 38,139 inhabitants in Mukingo commune, of whom 661 were Tutsi.
A.	I can see 331 here. 
Q.	It's 331 and then next to it is 330, and they are the male and female population, and when you add those two numbers you get 661.  But the whole point of my putting this document before you, Mr. Kajelijeli, is to ask you to agree with me that even if I don't have a list of the Tutsi that you compiled, or that the commune compiled, you must agree that in the ordinary course of business on a monthly basis the commune took stock of the number of inhabitants, the number of births and deaths, the number of Tutsi, how many were male and female.  That was done for the three ethnic groups that were tracked, Hutu, Tutsi and Twa.  

So you asked for proof from the Prosecution that lists of Tutsi had been compiled, and what I am suggesting to you is that even if we don't have a list of Tutsi that you wanted to kill, it's clear that the commune authorities had lists and information about the number of Tutsi and their identities and where they lived and things of that nature, right?  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Counsel for the Prosecution, this census was launched during the colonial times.  Belgian colonialists are the ones who initiated that census, and this carried on up until independence.  The census was, therefore, done -- it was being done before the powers in place came into -- took over power.  So the goal of the census was not to carry out any form of 
ethnic discrimination, but, rather, it was to know the composition of the population and to represent it in the various ethnic representations in a table.  

So we met this situation.  This was not done only during the war.  As a matter of fact, it did not begin under Habyarimana's period.  It did not begin even with the people who were in power before Habyarimana.  It all began before.  

So this census had always been done.  And as a matter of fact, Mr. President, Your Honours, the United Nations also conducted a census which was presented in a table where the various 
Rwandan ethnic groups were represented.  Therefore, that census was not made solely during the times of war.  Rather, it was a census where they meant to show commune by commune, 
préfecture by préfecture how the population was changing.  And this could be of assistance in development projects so that some parts of the population would not be left out in development.  So this census was not done only during the war, but it had been done before at various times in the history of the country. 
Q.	Thank you for your response.  It was very complete and fair.  You would agree with me that regardless of who actually started the process of compiling this type of information, this was the type of information that was still being compiled in 1994.  You can just say yes or no.  You don't need a long response for that question, Mr. Witness.
A.	At that time the government had decided to change the identity cards and to stop including the ethnic grouping in it.  It is likely that while I was bourgmestre that was applied.  Some people said that you had identity cards that bore ethnic groups, but I think there was an intention, a plan, to produce identity cards without showing the ethnic groups.  

So in April, Counsel, I was not bourgmestre of that commune, and I am unable to tell the Chamber how the census was done.  As a matter of fact, I believe the last census was done in 1992, and this had been done by the United Nations. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you.  Now, you told this Chamber earlier this morning that the Interahamwe did not exist in Mukingo commune, right? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I remember the question and the answer.  I stated that there was no association with the name Interahamwe.  And I insist on saying that as a matter of fact there was no association called Interahamwe in that commune. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you can rely on my representation when I tell you you will have ample time to expand on your answers if an expanded answer is really necessary.  But the questions I'm asking you right now, you can simply say yes or no.  I'm not going to deprive you of an opportunity to give your full evidence, but in order to get through this line of questioning could you please help us by just saying yes or no if you can answer the question in that way.  

Now, on the point of the existence of the Interahamwe, you gave that very same evidence before 
Trial Chamber II, didn't you? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Counsel for the Prosecution, I answered that you had people who claimed to be Interahamwe, but officially Interahamwe did not exist.  
Q.	That's the evidence you gave before Trial Chamber II back in April of 2003, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	All right.  We will go through the transcripts.  In any case, Trial Chamber II did not rely on your evidence on that point, and they found that in spite of your denial that the Interahamwe existed, that you were a leader of the Interahamwe in Mukingo, and they make that finding at paragraph 404 of their judgement of the 1st of December 2003.  

Now, you testified before this Chamber that you had no knowledge of military training of the Interahamwe, right? 
A.	Mr. President, I would -- you know, that is a complex question.  As a matter of fact, this is a question that has two sub-questions.  It says that I denied the existence of the Interahamwe, and it talks about paragraph 404.  That is untrue.  

Counsel for the Prosecution, we need to reach an understanding, and that is why I have always said and insisted that a judgement is done.  Your witnesses talk about Interahamwe leaders, and they don't talk about me, and I'm going to talk about that in my appeal.  So I have never been an 
Interahamwe leader, especially considering the fact that I was not a member of that
commune's administration.  Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Let me ask you the question again.  You testified before this Chamber that you had no knowledge of military training of the Interahamwe.  That's a very simple question.  Just say yes, you testified, or no, you didn't.
A.	I told you no.  
Q.	So there was military training of the Interahamwe.
A.	That is not true.  I have no proof that that training was provided. 
Q.	Were you aware of Interahamwe being militarily trained in Mukingo commune before the 6th of April 1994?  That's the issue.
A.	That never happened. 
Q.	And you gave similar evidence before Trial Chamber II in your own trial, didn't you? 
A.	I denied it, and I insist on doing so.  There was no training -- in any case, at the time when I was bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune there was no training provided to that youth whom you are describing as Interahamwe or whom you call Interahamwe.  There was no such thing. 
Q.	But Trial Chamber II found that by the 6th of April 1994 you, Mr. Kajelijeli, were actively involved in training the Interahamwe.  And they make that finding at paragraph 400 of their judgement.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, what counsel for the Prosecution is saying is not true.  It has been demonstrated that all these accusations and claims were wrong, especially since 
Prosecution witnesses stated that they lied.  And the Prosecutor has their statements to the effect that they lied with respect to the military training that was provided to what you describe as Interahamwe.  
In any case, that did not exist while I was bourgmestre of that commune. 
Q.	You testified before Trial Chamber II that the Interahamwe did not wear a specific uniform.  Isn't that so? 
A.	I didn't say that.  Mr. President, Your Honours, I didn't say that.  And I insist on stating that while I was bourgmestre that never happened. 
Q.	But Trial Chamber II found that you, Mr. Kajelijeli, participated in the distribution of those uniforms, and they make that finding at paragraph 402 of their judgement.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I stated that I don't agree with the findings of that Chamber.  And I had also stated that those Judges had to withdraw because they were -- they were unfair.  They favoured the Prosecutor.  And what you are telling me has no value, and I have challenged that -- I have challenged that judgement.  
MR. NIMY:
Counsel says that there was a mistake from the French translation because they said that the Judges were impartial, and this does not go in line with what they were saying, I would think.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Kinyarwanda booth confirms that he made a mistake and he meant to say that the Judges were partial.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	You called Witness RGM to testify on your behalf in your own trial, right?
THE WITNESS:
Was the error corrected?  I said that the Judges were biased.  I don't want to continue without being reassured that that error was corrected.  

Mr. Prosecutor, was the error corrected?  I said that you were basing yourself on a judgement which I challenged because the findings were based on lies, and they did not take into account the evidence that the Accused adduced. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if there was ever any error on the record, you have now corrected it.  So let's return to the question.  

You called RGM as your witness in your defence, right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  Mr. President, Your Honours, Witness AGM testified on my behalf. 
Q.	RGM.  And that witness identified himself as the president of the Interahamwe in Mukingo in 1993, isn't that so? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Your Honours, he himself said so, but I continue to insist that it would be worthwhile to follow exactly what he said in his testimony.  He said it was people who had qualified him as Interahamwe, but officially this name Interahamwe was not recognised.  You have continued calling that name about that association, and whoever could stand up and describe himself as an Interahamwe?  But there was no official recognition of this group of Interahamwe.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, the portion of RGM's testimony in which he clearly explains that he was the 
president of the Interahamwe, that he was approached by Jean-Damascène Niyoyita, the 
president of the MRND in Mukingo commune, to form the Interahamwe, that he did so and got members of his youth organisation to join the Interahamwe is all clearly on the record in this trial as a Prosecution exhibit.  I believe it's P. 355.  And it was on his testimony, on the basis of his testimony, that the Trial Chamber in your trial was able to make the factual finding that there were Interahamwe of the MRND party in Mukingo as early as 1993 or 1992, I believe, in any case, well before the 6th of April 1994.  That was your witness that provided that information, right? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you.  Mr. Prosecutor should not mix up official information and rumours.  You said that Niyoyita contacted Witness RGM, and so far as I am concerned, I don't know whether they saw him as the president of MRND in Mukingo.  Whatever the case, so long as I was no longer bourgmestre of Mukingo, I did not have any contact with the members of that party.  And if he went to see Witness RGM, that was his business and that did not concern the communal authorities.  He went and contacted him maybe to ask him exactly what all this was about.  

But if you have proof of their discussion, what transpired from their discussion, I do not have it.  But so long as I'm concerned, I was not bourgmestre and I was not following closely activities of 
political parties.  And so I continue to insist by saying that when I was bourgmestre, what you refer to as Interahamwe, I did not know anything about them.  I did not recognise them.  

Maybe you'd have to find further proof concerning the period during which I was no longer bourgmestre and determine whether there was any authorisation or official recognition of the existence of Interahamwe concerning the inception of the group, whether they, in fact, existed within the Mukingo commune.  But to the best of my knowledge, up to when I left there was no such thing in Mukingo commune.  

And you have not this far provided any written proof of their existence.  You are basing yourself on an opinion expressed by someone which is not backed by official documentation that would prove or buttress the fact that the government recognised the Interahamwe or that he himself was recognised or known as an Interahamwe by the said authorities. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, you know who Casimir Bizimungu is, don't you?  
A.	Yes, I do know him.  Mr. Prosecutor, I know Casimir Bizimungu. 
Q.	You agree with me that he was the president of the MRND at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture back in 1992, right? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And one would expect the president of the MRND party at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture to know if there were Interahamwe organised in Ruhengeri préfecture or not; wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I do not know exactly where Mr. Prosecutor is coming from with this information.  All I know is that when I was bourgmestre in 1992, this was during the war, I never received any message originating from Bizimungu about the fact that there was an official installation or existence of Interahamwe within that commune.  But if, by chance, the Prosecutor has in his possession any document from Bizimungu officially stating the existence of Interahamwe, let him produce the document.  We will together look at it.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I have four documents that I can show you, which are already evidence in this case.  And I will simply summarise them and I'll allow Mr. Issa to place them in front of you so that you can look at them.  But the first one is a transcript of what Casimir Bizimungu said on the 
15th of November 1992 when he was introducing the MRND rally in Ruhengeri, which you attended.  And you told us you attended that rally when you testified in your own trial.  

And in introducing the events of that day, Casimir Bizimungu thanked everyone that helped to prepare the rally, including Interahamwe from all over Ruhengeri that had come to that rally.  

If I showed you a transcript where he thanks everyone, the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri, for helping to assemble or organise that rally, shouldn't that convince you that the Interahamwe were recognised and existed in Ruhengeri back in 1992? 
A.	You are saying that I attended that meeting.  Mr. President, I do recall that mention was made of the Interahamwe in November 1992 in a meeting or a political rally who -- when we welcomed the 
president of the republic.  That was before his death.  But I want to inform this Trial Chamber that at that time there was no Interahamwe or any intention of creating the Interahamwe.  But I'm saying that Interahamwe were coming from Kigali, which was proof that they could have existed elsewhere.  That is what I recall.  But it was not specifically stated that they were in existence in each commune and that these were being thanked for their activities.  No, that is not true.  That is not what was said during that meeting. 
Q.	All right.  So I'll ask Mr. Issa to show you my document, which is identified in our record as P. 368.  It's a letter dated the 28th of October 1992.  It goes out under the signature of Casimir Bizimungu.  It's actually signed by Karoli Hategekimana.  And in this letter the topic is, "MRND meeting to be held at Ruhengeri préfecture on the 15th of November."  So it's a letter to prepare the meeting.  And it's calling for another meeting, a preparatory meeting, to be held on the 18th of October, and it's asking for the word to be spread in relation to this meeting.  And it's directed to MRND chairmen at the level of the commune, and it's copied to Interahamwe presidents in the commune, all of Ruhengeri.  

So to satisfy yourself, Mr. Witness, you can have a look at this.  It's P. 368.  But there are at least 
three or four of the letters that we've addressed in this trial, all going out under the signature of 
Karoli Hategekimana representing Casimir Bizimungu, all dating from 1992, and all copied to Interahamwe presidents at the level of the commune.  

I don't think it's necessary to go through each one.  This Chamber has seen all four of them already.  But let me show you one, just to satisfy you.  And parenthetically, these are documents that only came to light within the last year.  They weren't available to anyone, in the ICTR anyway, when you were being tried back in 2003.  

Have you had a chance to read the document, Mr. Witness?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, now, the Prosecutor just told us that this document was not available sometime back during my trial and that this document allegedly was sent to the MRND organs within each commune.  And I would like to tell the Chamber that the copy that has been given to me is not the one that is talking about Mukingo.  I will ask him for the copy that has to do with Mukingo, because this copy has to do with Nyakinama.  

Maybe that document may convince me that I was informed about that invitation, because here something else is being raised.  I will only answer about events that took place within the Mukingo commune.  But here I have a copy that has to do with Nyakinama commune.  So please, please, give me a copy that was addressed to Nyakinama commune -- Mukingo commune, rather.  

But if you're still talking about Nyagaba and Mukingo, well, you need to prove to me that those bourgmestres were invited.  But I myself, bourgmestre of Mukingo, I was informed.  But the copy that has been given to me has nothing to do with the Mukingo commune.  So I will not make any pronouncement on the document, and I will only say anything whatsoever for documents that have to do with Mukingo commune.  And that done, the Judges will be able to follow us and consequently come up with a ruling. 
(Pages 37 to 43 by Claudette Ask)

1445H 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa would retrieve the document for me, please.  
THE WITNESS:
No, no, no, no.  Don't withdraw this document.  I still need it. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	We'll give a copy, Mr. Kajelijeli.  There is no problem giving you copies.
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, the copy that should be given to me is the one on which you find the words "Mukingo commune".  I will only talk about Mukingo while I was bourgmestre.  If you do a photocopy and we put Mukingo, then I would ask the President and the Judges not to accept that document because you simply would have fabricated that document right here.  So that is inadmissible, legally speaking.  So don't say -- or pretend to have a copy concerning the Mukingo commune.  Consequently, if you manipulate that document, then the Judges should not accept it.  That's it, Mr. President, Your Honours, thank you. 
Q.	All right, Mr. Witness, you will agree that at the bottom of the document there is a notation that it is to be copied to the presidents of the Interahamwe in all communes of Ruhengeri, and where there's a mention of Nyakinama that's specifically with regard to the bourgmestre.  Right?  In any case, the document is in evidence.  I'm sure the Chamber can examine it to its own satisfaction at a later time.

You know the witness, GFA, do you not, Mr. Witness?  He's also referred to as BTH, either GFA or BTH.  In any case, this is the Prosecution witness that recanted his evidence and came to testify in this trial in April of 2008 and claimed to be giving truthful evidence which would not help the Defence, withdrawing much of his Prosecution evidence.  You know whom I'm referring to when I point to that person GFA or BTH, right? 
A.	I first would answer your question by asking the President and Honourable Judges of this 
	Trial Chamber to let me know whether that document is admitted in evidence or not.  I want the Judges to understand that the Mukingo commune was not copied regarding that document.  I have not said anything regarding that commune in that document.  My commune was not copied to.  I wish to warn the -- the -- the Judges so that they're not misled by that document.  That document does not concern the Mukingo commune.  

Now that said, concerning BT -- Witness BTH, Mr. President, Your Honours, I heard talk about the involved individuals.  And you, Mr. Prosecutor, I thank you for having communicated to me all those statements.  And now I am considering these statements to be able to file for a review of the trial, which you have consistently alluded to and which -- and at the end of which I was sentenced.  Well, all I will say now is I do, indeed, know the witness. 
Q.	And you've reviewed his testimony from April of 2008 when he recanted Prosecution evidence, right? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you would agree with me that the substance of GS -- or BTH's evidence back in April of 2008 was given in a manner that was favourable to the Defence, right? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And you're not accusing him of manufacturing any evidence in his recantation in April of 2008, are you? 
A.	No, that's not true. 
Q.	You would not expect that BTH was in cahoots with the Prosecution to help anyone based on his testimony in April 2008, would you? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like the Prosecutor to be much clearer in his question.  Can he state further explanations regarding the statements made to that witness so that we can say exactly 
	what -- whether what he's saying is founded.  

I cannot content myself with yes or no when you have not read the statement of this witness.  You've said nothing about the testimony of this witness.  What exactly did he say concerning the trial on course?  What did he say concerning my own trial?  I really cannot follow you.  I do not know what you're talking about. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my suggestion to you, or my question to you, you having already reviewed the transcripts of BTH in his testimony of April 2008, is that you would not accuse BTH of being -- of conspiring with the Prosecution to manufacture false testimony against you or Mr. Nzirorera, would you? 
A.	Let me inform you that during my trial you did not mention that witness as a Prosecution witness.  All I know is I saw a statement which he gave to you, but he never came right here to testify against me.  

Now, in the document you handed me concerning his testimony in the Nzirorera trial under which he appears as BTH, it's a document in which he states that you and him collaborated to manufacture accusations and allegations against all the people in Ruhengeri who are being tried in this Tribunal.  If there were -- if there are any other things you manufactured, you concocted, together to unfairly accuse us, well, that would be found in the document, and the Judges have already seen the document.  And his testimony is very, very convincing.  

By the way, he's not the only one who submitted such a testimony.  There are other witnesses who have testified and who asserted that there was a little group which existed and which was created to -- they were trained to make false testimonies against those many persons in Ruhengeri.  

All those witnesses who were in the Ruhengeri prison were trained and coached to make false testimonies against us.  And you also have some civilians who were coached and trained to come out here and testify against us, firstly.  Now you're talking about his testimony in April 2008.  I do agree with you it was a good testimony.  It has a basis.  It has to be taken into consideration. 
Q.	Well, thank you.  But that last sentence was really all we needed for you by way of a response.  

You agree that his April of 2008 testimony was favourable Defence evidence and it was not concocted with the Prosecution.  Right?  Just say yes or no, Mr. Witness.
A.	I am saying that this witness spoke about the role of the Prosecutor in the statement he gave before that which he gave in April 2008. 
Q.	In any case, in April of 2008 BTH also testified about the existence of a militia in Mukingo, which was in existence before the 15th of November 1992 when the MRND rally took place.  His testimony was that some time between 1991 and 1992 there was a militia headed by Michel Niyigaba that used to beat up Tutsi on the road and chase them into IASE sometime in January and February of 1993.  Do you have any reason to dispute his evidence on that point? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  The Prosecutor acknowledges that this witness mentioned a militia.  And I told the Trial Chamber, Your Honours, that at the time there were -- there was fighting and members of the population and all communes which had been taken over by the RPF, all these people had found refuge in the -- within the Mukingo commune.  

And among these people there were members of militia who could leave their family and work, commit crimes to the authorities.  It is true that these militia existed and we tried to fight them.  And I have given proof about them.  So I'm not contesting what BTH said.  These militia carried out attacks and you went and found them, brought them out here to testify against the defendants or the accused persons.  We, in turn, we also combatted them.  

But what I do not accept is the fact where you said Niyigaba, Michel, was the head of this militia.  That is not our knowledge of the facts.  Everybody was responsible for his own leads, and the problem is that we were in a period of war.  For some people they were lucky.  There were no wars in their countries.  But imagine, do you know how difficult it would be to lead the people who are victims of bombardments?  Well, these young people could very well involve themselves in crimes against authorities.  And so I recognise, I accept, that this militia existed, but we did all in our powers to quell them, to fight them.  And you, yourself, you just said that this militia were unable to reach the areas where we had put the Tutsis in security.  

And so I thank you for having stated that these militia could not reach the areas where we had put the Tutsis in safety. 
Q.	You're suggesting that Michel Niyigaba was not involved in this militia, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I wish to inform the President and Your Honours that Niyigaba, Michel, was instead the boss of the organisation mentioned by the Prosecutor, and even the Defence counsel mentioned, and it has to do with the Uruyange association, and so we should make things very, very clearly and make a distinction between the militia and the Uruyange association.  

All these persons were fleeing from the fighting and they mix up with these militia.  But Niyigaba was not the boss or the chief of all these persons.  In short, Niyigaba, Michel, was head of the 
Uruyange association.  If some people left his group to commit crimes, that may have happened, but each person was punished according to the crimes he or she committed. 
Q.	What about Musafiri, Gervais?  Was he a part of that militia? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Counsel for the Prosecution, Musafiri was a deserting soldier.  If I have repeated it, I'll say I arrested him for -- about ten times.  First, I arrested him with a firearm and I imprisoned him, and that wasn't easy because I was one of his targets.  

Musafiri was a deserter who had been handed over to military authorities, and he was then about to escape.  I saw him in military uniform and I was stunned.  I called on the military authorities which arrested him.  He didn't approach commune authorities despite everything that he did.  Please bear with me.  Don't consider him as part of somebody from the Mukingo commune or somebody who collaborated with people from Mukingo.  He was a criminal who was usually on the run.  

And when I took over power in the commune, I arrested him.  And when I had to transport him to Ruhengeri, you had fighting and the prison was not functional, and so we had to take this man out of the populace in Mukingo.  He was a criminal bandit who was on the run and who was committing crimes.  So that is not a typical example of Mukingo inhabitants. 
Q.	What about Noeli Dusabe?  Was he a part of that militia? 
A.	I remember there's one Noeli Dusabe who was shot down.  He had been a soldier during the period of interest to us, which is to say when I was no longer bourgmestre.  I used to see him, but I did not pay interest to him as I was no longer bourgmestre.  I worked as a private person.  The events happened after I had left the commune.  These events were of no interest to me as I was focussed on my own business.  Thank you.
Q.	But my question to you is:  Was Noeli part of that militia that you took note of?  
A.	My answer is no.  I told you what I know and what I don't know.  As a matter of fact, I don't know those militia.  I don't know their names.  I didn't pay any attention to know the people who comprised those militia.  I don't know their names. 
Q.	What about Bigabo, is your answer the same with respect to him?  You don't know whether he's a member of that militia or not? 
A.	My answer is the same. 
Q.	What about a person by the name of Aloys Karekezi?  Do you know that individual?  
A.	If he was part of that militia, well, I don't know him. 
Q.	No, I am talking about Aloys Karekezi, who was a Tutsi.  He was a teacher in Busogo primary school and his wife was a nurse.  Having said that, do you recognise or can you think of the person 
	Aloys Karekezi? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I knew Karekezi. 
Q.	And is my description of him accurate?  Was this man a Tutsi and was he a teacher at the 
	Busogo primary school and who had a wife who was a nurse.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  That is correct.  But there's a minor difficulty in what I know.  When he completed his studies, he was employed as a teacher, but subsequently he changed his occupation and worked for an NGO in Gisenyi.  Subsequently, he went to work in Kigali.  During that period of the militia, Karekezi no longer worked in Ruhengeri.  He lived in Kigali where his family had gone to meet him, including his nurse of a wife whom you referred to. 
Q.	This was a man who was harassed in Mukingo, right?  Wasn't he harassed by the local toughs who constituted a militia in Busogo?  He was chased out of Mukingo commune because he was Tutsi.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, if you allow, I will answer the Prosecution's answer (sic) because what he's saying is not true.  When Karekezi left education, teaching, he asked for a testation of his employment.  And indeed, when I was going to Kabgayi through Giciye, I would meet him and we would share a drink.  On weekends he went back to his home in Mukingo, up until when he was transferred to Kigali.  If he changed his occupation after leaving the teaching field, it isn't because he had problems in the commune.  And what you're saying, Mr. Counsel for the Prosecution, is incorrect. 
Q.	Do you know what happened to him in 1994, or during the events of 1994, if you know?  If you don't know, just say I don't know, and we'll move on to something else.  
A.	No, we can move on to something else.  Before I answer you, I told you that his brother-in-law and himself settled in Kigali.  And I don't know what happened to them because they were in Kigali. 
Q.	Well, the information that we have is that he was killed along with his family in April of 1994 during the genocide.  Do you have any reason to dispute that information? 
A.	I just informed the Chamber that during the time you are referring to, Karekezi and his family was no longer in Mukingo.  They had settled in Kigali.  I cannot say anything with respect to what happened to him in Kigali, whereas I was not there.  I have no intention of lying before the President and the Honourable Judges who are assisting him. 
Q.	Well, in any case, Mr. Witness, I bring the issue of Karekezi to our attention or to you in my question, because we have a letter that he wrote back on the 30th of November 1993, which was addressed to the prime minister at the time.  And he's writing on behalf of some sort of human rights organisation.  And he's complaining about the harassment that the Tutsis faced in the Mukingo commune.  And he gives a lengthy recitation, but at the end of his letter this is what he says --  

And here I'm referring to a document, for the record, it's IP. 51.  It's in the bundle of documents that I have circulated in the second tab towards the back.  I can read it very slowly, and I think everyone will be able to follow from my reading.  And this is from the unofficial English translation.  And he says:  
"Other information and first person accounts coming from a refugee from Mukingo dated 
29th of November 1993.  

"Mr. Joseph Nzirorera, executive secretary of the MRND, has an armed militia in Byangabo, 
Mukingo commune, which includes a certain Noeli, a nephew of Nzirorera, who was a former student at the Ecole des sous-officers in Butare, and includes Musafiri, the son of Rwirasira, Ephrem, who is a former soldier of the Rwandan army that was dismissed for disciplinary reasons and includes Bagabo a cousin of Nzirorera and son of Mukangahe and Nyiramajerenge (the paternal aunt of Nzirorera).  These persons fired shots during the night of Saturday to Sunday, the 27th of November.  The day before they had rifled through the homes of the Bagogwe, threatening that they were going to kill them because, according to them, the Inkotanyi was going to attack that same night." 

I don't think it's necessary for me to read the entire passage, Mr. Witness.  In any case, I believe you would get the gist, that this is someone that you know who is complaining about an armed militia in Mukingo, which you have confirmed existed.  But he identifies Noeli, Musafiri and Bagabo as members of that militia.  And he tells us that Musafiri was a deserter from the army who was dismissed, which is consistent with what you told us about Musafiri.  

So wouldn't you agree with me that this letter from Karekezi from November of 1993 confirms portions of your own response that there was some sort of armed militia in Mukingo and goes a bit further by telling us who the members of that militia was. 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to ask the Prosecutor to be reasonable.  He's mixing up things, and he's attributing things to me which I did not state in my answers.  When he says that I acknowledge that there was militia in my commune, I simply gave him an example by telling him that all the refugees who were found in Mukingo commune amongst whom you had youth.  

But I didn't acknowledge the existence of militia in our commune.  I said that if you had youth who committed crimes, all of those people were prosecuted.  But I did not acknowledge the existence of armed militia.  

Now, to revert to what the Prosecutor read to you and which he probably had read and which was allegedly by Karekezi to the prime minister, I am stunned to realise that he wrote to the prime minister without copying the préfectoral authority for that authority to be able to provide explanation.  

He didn't even copy the commune authorities for them to add their remarks.  Granted, in October 1993, when that document was written, I was no longer a bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune.  So I didn't have to answer that -- those militia.  
Nevertheless, I reassert that that letter, which was written by Karekezi, was written from Kigali when I was living in the coveted position of bourgmestre in Mukingo, Karekezi had settled in Kigali.  He wrote a letter which he didn't copy to the préfectoral authority nor the commune authority.  It is a lie.  We arrested lots of people, including Musafiri, who is referred to in that letter.  

So what I have to say to this august Chamber is that this document is baseless.  We're talking about Nzirorera in that letter.  I would refrain from saying that he didn't have influence.  If he had so wanted, he would have set up a militia which was even more powerful without including Musafiri.  

I know that at the time you had -- there were documents which targeted -- which was meant to tarnish the image of the MRND authorities.  In particular, Nzirorera could not have colloborated with these types of people.  And as I was no longer a member of the commune authority, I am not in a good position to tell you.  

So, therefore, I'm in no position to grant -- lead any credence to that document before this 
Trial Chamber as I had moved away from the commune authority.  But considering the fact -- but considering what I know, Nzirorera could not have gone so low to go and collaborate with those people, and it has nothing to do with those people we were continually arresting.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
Q.	What about Dusabe, also referred to as Dusabimana?  This is another individual who was a source of trouble to you as bourgmestre in the commune.  Not so?  Or a source of trouble to the Tutsi inhabitants, wouldn't you agree? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  I know that Dusabe committed offences, and I punished him for them because I was competent to do so.  I did not punish him because he had problems with Tutsis.  I sanctioned him as bourgmestre of Mukingo.  And after the sanctions I meted against him, I no longer punished him before leaving the commune office. 
Q.	We can agree that Dusabe, or Dusabimana, is Nzirorera's nephew that lived at the home Niyiraramakuba in Busogo secteur.  Right?  We're talking about the same individual.  
A.	I have not denied the relationship between Nzirorera and Dusabimana. 
Q.	I'm asking you to affirm it, not to deny it.  You agree, Dusabimana or Dusabe was Nzirorera's nephew that lived in the home of Nzirorera's mother? 
A.	No, he was not his nephew, and I'm categorical.  With respect to the fact that he lived at 
	Nzirorera's mother's house, that is true.  But Dusabe was not Nzirorera's nephew. 
Q.	His younger brother then? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Then based on your last series of responses, we're agreed that Musafiri, Dusabe and Niyigaba were three individuals that were a source of problems in Mukingo.  They were criminals.  They were involved in criminal activity.  You were aware of that back in 1992.  
A.	I'm not going to focus on those individuals.  I was talking about each of them.  I was saying that Musafiri was imprisoned on several occasions.  I stated that Musafiri had committed offences and that he had answered for them at the time I was bourgmestre, but I don't know what those individuals did when I was no longer bourgmestre.  I had nothing to do again with regard to the administration of the commune. 
Q.	Yes.  But I think you're avoiding a portion of my question, Witness.  So I'll repeat it for you.  Can we agree that Musafiri, Dusabe and Niyigaba committed violent crimes, were arrested for them and were a source of irritation to you, or a source of trouble to you in your capacity as bourgmestre back in 1992, and that their criminal behaviour continued into 1993?  Can we agree with that? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Dusabe committed crimes while he was a soldier and I punished him.  Subsequently, he returned to the military barracks and he did not come back to Mukingo commune.  In any event, while I was bourgmestre I saw Musafiri.  I arrested him and jailed him on several occasions.  He was a deserter.  But when I left the office of bourgmestre, I can't tell what he did.  The bourgmestre at the time, that's the one who replaced me, can provide me -- or can provide you more information regarding him. 
Q.	And what about Niyigaba?  This is someone that you arrested on a number of occasions who was known to you as a criminal.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  I arrested him once.  He paid a fine and he was released. 
Q.	Was the criminal profile of these three individuals something that was known and discussed among the population of Mukingo? 
A.	I can't deny it.  But, sir, I can't tell what they did after -- up to the 22nd June when I was no longer bourgmestre.  

So as from 1993 up till 1994, on the 22nd of June, I was not bourgmestre in the commune and I can't tell what happened -- what happened during that time.  I believe investigations were conducted.  I have no solid proof in that respect, and I believe if you wish to know more about what happened during that period, you should seek more information from the commune authorities at the time.  As far as I was concerned, I punished him for ordinary offences and not for crimes you just mentioned a short while ago. 
Q.	But my question to you, Mr. Witness, or my suggestion to you, is that these three individuals had a reputation in your community for being miscreants or criminals for involving themselves in crimes or violent activity, each one of them individually, Musafiri, Dusabe, and Niyigaba, isn't that so? 
A.	I have seen that in some documents, especially in some statements made by witnesses.  But -- but they make statements with respect to a period when I was no longer bourgmestre.  I cannot found myself on those statements to say whatsoever about those people whereas I was not bourgmestre and I -- and I had no role to play in their arrests and I did not make any form of sanction against them at that time. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'm not asking you about what you learned from witness statements.  I'm asking you to put yourself in the frame of mind of April 1994.  

Going back to March and April of 1994, wouldn't you agree with me that those three individuals already had a reputation for being criminals in your community, something that would be known to you?  If you disagree with me, that's all you have to say.  But that's the question I'm asking you to answer.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, Counsel for the Prosecution, I already told you everything I know with regard to those people, with respect to facts for which I have no proof and which happened at the time when I was no longer bourgmestre.  I also told you that I didn't know anything about that.  As for that witness who gave statements, I cannot confirm or deny what they said.  Those are the witnesses who saw what they stated, and they are the ones who are with those people.  I can't add anything to their statements. 
Q.	In any case you've already told us that you've arrested each of those three individuals at least once when you were the bourgmestre. 
A.	I have nothing further to add to that. 
Q.	In other words, you agree you've arrested each of them at least once.  
A.	When they committed offences as individuals, I would arrest them, but I did not arrest them as a group.  And it was during individual offences.  

Musafiri was someone who was on the run in Mukingo, and when people complained against him, we would send soldiers who arrested him, and he was arrested as such as a soldier, not as a civilian.  And when these three individuals were arrested, they were not arrested in a group.  They were arrested for committing minor offences.  But as for Musafiri, he was punished because he was bearing a weapon illegally.  

We shouldn't mix up things.  The offences for those three people when I was no longer a bourgmestre are different from the offences they committed while I was bourgmestre and for which I punished them. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, let's try to focus our attention on 1992 when you were the bourgmestre.  So the next questions -- the next few questions that I'll ask you are only directed to the year 1992.  Did you arrest any of those three for setting up a roadblock and stopping passengers that were travelling from Gisenyi in the direction of Ruhengeri? 
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I can't understand how three individuals can set up a roadblock and stop people from Gisenyi on their way to Ruhengeri.  That's something I don't understand.  It is impossible.  That never happened. 
Q.	So a simple "no" would suffice in that instance, right?  Either you arrested them or you didn't.  That's all you have to say, Mr. Witness.  
A.	I did not arrest them because they had set up a roadblock.  They never did that.  And that -- such a roadblock never existed. 
Q.	What did you arrest Niyigaba for then?  You told us he committed some minor infraction.  What was the infraction when you arrested him? 
A.	He had stopped someone from going to fetch water.  He didn't want that person to go and fetch water, and that was reported to me, and I sanctioned him, and he no longer did that.  In any event, he didn't commit that offence at any roadblock whatsoever. 
Q.	You arrest someone for stealing water? 
A.	Maybe the English interpretation was poorly done.  That's not what I said.  I said I sanctioned Niyigaba because he stopped someone from going to fetch -- to go and look for water.  That is why I sanctioned him. 
Q.	Was that a violent crime? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I still have quite a bit to explore with you on this issue, but I think we're going to do it tomorrow morning, because it's already 3:30.  

But perhaps overnight you can give some thought as to why you arrested these three individuals on the number -- the numerous occasions that you arrested them.  And we'll pick that up tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. Webster.  

We have come to the end of the day's session.  And we'll adjourn until tomorrow.  

I remind you, as I did yesterday, that you should not discuss the case or your testimony with anybody during an adjournment while you're on the witness stand. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I'm going to respect your instructions.
(Court adjourned at 1533H)
