MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, can you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 13th of June 2006, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hometowu.  And welcome back from the other location.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.
MR. WEBSTER:
They are the same.  But we welcome back Mr. Hometowu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you bring the witness, please.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have something I need to raise with the Trial Chamber on an urgent basis not relating to this witness.  We received this morning a decision -- we were served by -- with a decision by Trial Chamber I in the Serugendo case.  It's a decision on urgent motion for the deposition of Joseph Serugendo, and it provides that Mr. Serugendo should be deposed immediately within one week of the service of a statements -- his statements, and that the deposition should include all Defence parties who his -- are concerned with his testimony, which includes our case.  

And we did receive this morning the 200-page statement in French of Mr. Serugendo, so now we're in a situation where it appears that because his -- he's very critically ill, it's not known how long he is going to live, and so the Prosecution wants to have his testimony preserved by deposition.  

This is a man who is -- who was supposed to be a Defence witness and who was interviewed before the Prosecution arrested him and gave statements, exculpatory to Mr. Nzirorera and the other Accused.  A very important witness.  And we're very keen to have his deposition or some other testimony in which we're a participant so that we can have his evidence before this Trial Chamber before he dies.  

And so I'm asking the Trial Chamber today to suspend these proceedings until we -- so that we can prepare for this deposition and we can hold the deposition.  What we're faced with right now is the following tasks:  First we have to read the 200-page statement, which is in French, and assimilate the information.  Then, if necessary, dispatch our investigators to interview witnesses who could either confirm or contradict any information contained in the statement that is essential to an understanding in -- of his testimony and a preparation of his cross-examination, and then to receive that information and use it in the preparation for the cross-examination.  And also for myself to prepare the cross-examination of this witness, which will be extensive, because he deals not only with the Interahamwe committee, of which he was a member, but the RTLM, of which he was founding.  I think his testimony is about the same scope as that of Witness T, maybe a little bit less.  

So we're in a situation now where we have a witness who we -- is very important.  We need to have his testimony somehow preserved before the Trial Chamber, and also we need time to prepare for that testimony.  And given that the Trial Chamber I has indicated that it is a matter of great urgency, due to his health, I'm asking that we suspend these proceedings.  Witness GSA is very healthy.  He'll be around whenever we need him, and that we immediately turn our attention to the Serugendo problem so that he doesn't die before he can give testimony which is very important to Mr. Nzirorera.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
First thing I'd like to say is that there should be a more delicate way of discussing Mr. Serugendo's health, and I would ask the Court to strike all the references to the -- you know, the urgency of his health.  These are public proceedings.  I think many of the motions that concern this witness were filed confidential.  And although I understand Mr. Robinson's point, I'm concerned about the public record and how this information circulates, and I'd ask the Court to strike the portions of Mr. Robinson's submission where he talks about the imminence of Mr. Serugendo's demise.  If that can be stricken as well.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, can I just respond to that part?  The statement -- the decision which is not confidential, which is filed publicly on the 8th of June, says he suffers from a terminal illness; his current state of health is fragile, deteriorating; his prognosis is poor.  We need to take this deposition before he dies.  So I don't understand why I'm saying anything that's not already in the public record.  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's a matter for the Court's discretion.  I think I've made my point.  Maybe I'll allow Mr. Weyl to -- so we hear all of the Defence concerns before I respond.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would just like to point out that if there are things that are currently in the public domain, these communications have not yet been given to the Defence in the case of Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  We have not yet received the documents referred to by Mr. Robinson.  Therefore, it is a further task that the Defence must shoulder.  First of all, we need to procure documents that were given to Mr. Robinson and that we do not yet have.  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, I would just like to add that the Defence for Édouard Karemera has not received the same documents, but given the exceptional circumstances referred to by Mr. Robinson, it would be preferable for the Defence to be provided with a reasonable time limit allowing it to carry out investigations properly, as well as conduct its cross-examination.  I, therefore, fully support Peter Robinson's motion.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the materials that Mr. Robinson refers to were served on CMS sometime last week.  It may have been Thursday or Friday.  And apparently they're only now arriving in the hands of the Defence.  There was a pending motion to depose Joseph Serugendo.  It was not filed by this trial team.  It was filed by the trial team that is actually handling his case before the Tribunal.  

The matter of how this trial team will attempt to use his evidence is still under discussion.  We're still thinking about it.  We haven't arrived at a position yet.  Mr. Robinson raised this issue with me this morning.  My advice to him at that time was to give us another 36 hours to think about how we would like to proceed and that if he made this application on Thursday, we'd be able to discuss it in a more serious matter -- manner.  That's still my position.  I don't really have a response substantively for how we should proceed, but I do not think and my submission is that we should not interrupt our proceedings today or at any time this week simply because of the decision and the motion that has been filed with regard to Serugendo.  

If the Court allows me another 48 hours, we're giving the situation some very thoughtful consideration.  I've discussed some of the options with Mr. Robinson.  I don't want to put them on the record now.  When I discussed them with Mr. Robinson this morning, I asked him to confer with his colleagues on the Defence side to see how they collectively would receive my suggestions, and we can come back to you in another two days with a much more practical solution.  So it's too early to make any specific recommendation, but the trial need not stop at this point.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm not quite certain exactly how this Trial Chamber got involved in this.  How does this trial get involved in that activity?  
MR. WEBSTER:
In the deposition itself?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The application was made to us.  We have made no orders.  How does it concern our trial?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It may concern us eventually because whatever is recorded in the deposition may be entered by any party to the proceedings as evidence in the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just like that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Not just like that.  There would have to be some sort of motion and some sort of debate that this Trial Chamber would resolve.  But what I'm trying to anticipate -- what I assume Mr. Robinson is trying to anticipate is how we could productively use the evidence that is recorded in a deposition before another judicial officer.  So it's those issues that we're trying to think through critically -- or my suggestion is that we think through them critically before we make any further moves.  So I think the application from the Defence is premature at this moment.  It's a matter that's still in the discussion, and I don't think it should interrupt our proceedings today.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  In relation to Mr. Webster's -- how this Trial Chamber is involved, right now the Trial Chamber is not involved.  I'm asking for time to prepare for the deposition of Mr. Serugendo that has been ordered by Trial Chamber I, and I need that time away from this trial to be able to prepare for that.  And so that's what is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but maybe there are things that I don't know, but I don't understand why we should grant that request.  I don't understand its relevance to our trial.
MR. ROBINSON:
Because Mr. Serugendo is a witness whose testimony will be presented to this trial in one form or another, and it's a witness that the Defence wants his testimony.  Well, the Prosecutor can think about it all they want, but we -- we want to have his testimony.  We think he's a Defence witness, as far as we're concerned, like Witness T.  And so the Trial Chamber I has ordered a deposition to be taken as soon as practicable.  We want that deposition to be taken.  We want that evidence to be presented to the Trial Chamber if he's not alive at the time that the Defence would call him.  

If the Prosecutor also wants to offer his evidence, they can do that also, but this is -- the point is to preserve testimony now of a person who is dying.  And time seems to be of the essence, and we need time to prepare for that and to go forward with that procedure as soon as possible so that we don't lose the ability to have his testimony before the Trial Chamber.  
So I'm asking you to -- in light of the fact that a deposition has been ordered, that a one-week period has been stated as the time -- minimum time between the disclosure of his statement, which I received today, and the time the deposition can be taken, I'd like to be in a position to have that deposition taken as soon as possible, and I need time outside of this courtroom to be able to prepare for it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If it clarifies matters for the Court, the decision did not provide an instruction that the deposition would take place one week from the receipt of Serugendo's statement.  My understanding of the decision is that the deposition could not take place unless the Defence had received the statement within a week of the scheduled date.  So because Mr. Robinson received the statement today does not mean that the deposition is going to be scheduled for a week from today.  So the date of a proposed deposition is still up in the air; it's still to be -- to be set.  And there are matters that I would like to discuss within my office and with the Defence in this case before we know how we are proceeding with this.  So I still restate my position, which is that it's too early to make any comment on whether time is needed to prepare.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we can't stop right now.  We have taken note of what you have said.  We will also make certain other inquiries, but we will proceed now with the cross-examination of the witness.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
While the registry is -- is bringing the witness in, can I raise two other issues?  One has to do with the exhibits that the Prosecution would introduce through this witness.  It's a matter I tried to raise with -- with the Defence when the Court was coming in.  I presume that Mr. Robinson and Mr. Sow and Mr. Weyl are going to go back and look at this, but there were transcripts of a Radio Rwanda broadcast that are independent of the portion that was admitted in evidence yesterday.  It comes from another tape, and it has another set of transcripts, but the text is exactly the same.  And what I would like to do, with the Defence's consent, is to introduce one page of the transcript of KT000584, which was disclosed in the Prosecution's exhibit bundle, both the recording and the transcripts to -- under the same number, P. 31, that we used yesterday, to identify the same content on another tape.  

So I clarify that now before Mr. Robinson starts his cross-examination.  It's something that we can work out during one of the breaks, but I just wanted to bring it to the Court's attention before we move into the phase of cross-examination.  

The other matter is one of scheduling as well.  Yesterday I was present in Trial Chamber I when Mr. Robin -- when Mr. Nzirorera completed his cross-examination.  During the course of those proceedings it became quite clear that Mr. Karemera would be called as a witness in that trial as well.  Judge Møse indicated -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Excuse us, the French booth is being disturbed by the sound of curtains being pulled continuously.  Would he please refrain.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The Presiding Judge in Trial Chamber I for the Bagosora trial indicated that he would not attempt to schedule Karemera's testimony this week because he had already impinged upon the scheduling of our case this week, but that he would make some attempt to schedule Mr. Karemera's testimony for one of the following weeks.  And what I'm asking this Trial Chamber to do is to give the parties at least 48 hours' notice before our proceedings are interrupted for Mr. Karemera to testify in another trial.  So I'm simply requesting, as a matter of courtesy, notice from this Trial Chamber before any decision is made to stop our proceedings to allow Mr. Karemera to testify anywhere else.  So it's a matter that we can discuss at a later time.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. WEBSTER:
I notice that the witness is on -- is in the box now, so rather than slow down the proceedings, I simply wanted to bring that to the Court's attention and we can discuss it at the end of one of the breaks.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue this morning.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began.  You will now be cross-examined by counsel for Nzirorera.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, my exhibits were distributed to the Prosecutor yesterday and are now being distributed to the Trial Chamber and the parties.  Also, Mr. President, I -- in light of your order yesterday that we receive the unredacted statements, I'm planning on using those this morning, but I haven't yet received them.  So I'm wondering if the Prosecution can take some steps to get them ready so that they can -- when I get to that point in my cross-examination, which will be sometime this morning, they can be used.  In the meantime, I used redacted copies as part of my exhibits.  So I'm just alerting the Prosecutor to the need for those unredacted statements this morning.  

Okay.  So turning to Witness BTH.  
WITNESS BTH, 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	(Kinyarwanda spoken)
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  I am well.  
Q.	Witness BTH, we last spoke to each other on Friday, the 2nd of June; correct?
A.	You're right. 
Q.	And that was in the witness room where you wait before you give your testimony just outside of this courtroom; is that correct?
A.	Indeed. 
Q.	And when we met, there was also my legal assistant, Leopold Nsengiyumva, and the protection officer from the witness victim support section, Mr. Diop; correct?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And when I had made a request to meet with you, you had agreed to that request and requested that the meeting be without the presence of the Prosecutor; correct?
A.	Indeed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, if the registrar could take number 15 out of my packet of exhibits and show it to the witness, I would appreciate that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what's been placed in front of you is a document that bears a signature of a witness.  Is that your signature?
A.	Yes, it is my signature.  
Q.	And where it's typewritten, "I accept to be met and contacted by the said Defence counsel" in handwriting is "without the presence of the Prosecutor."  Did you write that? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ128. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ128 admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, during this meeting you offered to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda; is that correct?
A.	Before I answer that question, I would like to ask the Defence counsel to spell out all the details of the discussion we had with him -- that I had with him.  That way I will be in a position to answer the questions he intends to put to me.  
Q.	Yes, we're going to do that.  I can assure you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I will give you a full opportunity to say anything you would like to say at this trial about any meetings or anything you want to say, but I'm going to ask you some questions, and it would be useful for you to just give direct answers on those questions, and if you want to elaborate after you've answered the question, you can do that.  

And my question to you is:  Did you offer to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda?
A.	That was not the first issue we discussed, so I would like to call on you to provide all the details of our discussion.  I do recall very well the issues that we dealt with, and that is why I am asking you to spell them out to the Court, and then I will be ready to answer any other questions you intend to put to me.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm -- I think this is a matter of time for your intervention.  I've asked the witness the same question twice, and he doesn't want to answer.  He wants me to ask him different questions.  I think you need to inform him that it's his responsibility to answer the questions that are put to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, it is really the job of the Court to determine whether questions are proper or not proper.  If we think that a question is not proper, we will prevent counsel from asking it.  In this case, the question he has asked you is a proper question and you ought to answer it.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you very well, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, repeat the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I will.  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness BTH, you offered to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda; correct?
A.	I have been asked to explain everything and I am going to do so.  You requested to meet me on the 2nd of May, and the first question you put to me -- well, let me say what you told me before making that offer to me.  You told me that someone had called you from abroad and that -- well, before that person called you, they had already called me, and so you asked me whether I was ready to accept the offer that was being made to me; namely, to be a Defence witness for Nzirorera.  And I told him that in Rwanda all what we do is speak the truth at our Gacaca trials.  So I told him that anybody who attempts to lie gets punished.  So I told him that it was possible for someone who was not in Rwanda to do that.  

So if I had told you that I could accept that offer, it is because you made the offer in the first place.  You told me that I either change my testimony or I refuse to testify, and you said that you were ready to provide a lawyer who would solve that problem for me.  And I'll stop there so far.  We can proceed later on to discuss this further.  
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, you recognise, do you not, that there was an officer of the witness -- Witness BTH, you recognise, do you not, that there was an officer of the witness victim section there during our conversation, correct?
A.	Yes, I do remember.  
Q.	And you realise that should you fail to recount accurately and truthfully what was said in our meeting, that he is able to come into this courtroom and give testimony to these Judges about exactly what was said.  Do you understand that? 
A.	Yes, I am fully aware of it.  And what I'm telling you is nothing but the truth.  After you left, I had a discussion with the Prosecutor and I told him everything that had transpired.  And I too am ready to provide evidence to the effect that when I was in Rwanda I was contacted by *********************who made that offer to me, and that when you came before me for the first time, it's the same offer you made to me.  I, therefore, am also ready to provide evidence to that effect.  
Q.	Well, isn't it true, Witness BTH, that it was you who contacted an individual named ************in Europe by telephone and you offered to change your testimony if Mr. Nzirorera would give you enough money to leave Rwanda?
A.	No.  You are saying that I called someone in Europe on the phone.  No.  It is the person who is in Europe who contacted me.  I told this to the Prosecutor and even to the Rwandan authorities.  They are aware of this.  I do not know how he came into possession of my telephone number, and it is for that reason that I asked the Prosecutor to change my pseudonym because my security is not guaranteed.  It is *******************who called me and not the other way around.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, we'll hear from him about that, and it will be up to the Trial Chamber to decide that point.  

Let's return to our meeting, because when we began our meeting, it was you who had requested that the meeting be -- take place without the presence of the Prosecutor, correct?
A.	Well, I had two options:  Namely, that it was possible to meet you in the absence of the Prosecutor, but that I could also meet you in the presence of the Prosecutor.  And that is why I decided to meet you without the presence of the Prosecutor, particularly in view of the fact that when I came to testify here for the first time, you asked me why I had not sought to have any discussion with you.  And that time around -- rather, that -- this time around I decided to have that discussion with you to prove to you that I wasn't afraid of anything. 
Q.	Well, isn't it a fact that the reason you wanted to meet without the presence of the Prosecutor was so that you could make this offer to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda?
A.	No, I am not the one who made the request to meet you.  You are the one who asked to meet me.  So I had no benefit in meeting you prior to my testimony.  You are the one who made the request to meet me. 
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, you are the first witness that has ever asked to meet the Defence counsel in the absence of the Prosecutor.  What was your reason for doing that?  
A.	The form which I was given had two options, and I opted for one.  I knew very well that nobody would beat me up if I decided to meet you in the absence of the Prosecutor, and that is why I opted for that solution because I didn't see that it entailed any particular problems.  
Q.	Well, if before coming here you were concerned about having been approached by Mr. Nzirorera's family and you had reported such a thing to the Rwandan authorities, what was your reason for wanting to meet with the Defence counsel in private, without the Prosecutor?
A.	I believe I have already answered that question.  I told you that I did not want to waste the Prosecutor's time because they knew very well that all what we would talk about would ultimately be brought up before the Court.  I am saying that I knew that you were going to tell the Prosecutor what we have already talked.  So I believe that everybody is aware of what we discussed.  
Q.	And I'm going to now return to my first question to you.  Did you offer to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda?
A.	You asked me whether I was ready to change my testimony, and I told you that it was possible if I were outside of Rwanda, because if I attempted to change my testimony and return to Rwanda, I would be punished for that.  So you asked me the manner in which I -- you could assist me in changing my testimony.  And let me say, by the way, that this is not the first time you made this offer to me.  In January 2004 I came here to testify.  You sent somebody by the name **********to make the same offer to me.  I know that I even wrote down something in that connection.  So let everybody be aware of this.  This individual proposed an amount of money to me and I turned it down.  So this was your second attempt.  I am not ready to change my testimony.  I am ready to speak the truth, and it is up to the Trial Chamber to determine.  
Q.	Witness BTH, I -- I suggest to you I've yet to hear a word of the truth about this meeting so far.  And you still haven't answered my question.  Did you offer to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda?
A.	No, I am not the one who offered.  You, on the contrary, are the one who made the offer.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Robinson, you've asked this a number of times.  Hasn't he answered the question?  You are suggesting to him that he offered, he made the offer.  He says you, rather, made the offer, and this is the second time you are making the same offer.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I think he just clarified his answer, and I'm -- I agree that he's now answered the question.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, isn't it true that I probably told you at least five times in that meeting that it was against the law for a lawyer to pay money to a witness and that I wasn't going to break that law?
A.	Yes, you told me that.  But I would like to ask you to tell the Court why you said that it was necessary for me to look for a lawyer who would assist you in that matter.  Can you please explain to the Court why you said to me that you were ready to provide me the services of a lawyer?  
Q.	Yes, isn't it a fact that I told you that you should ask the Trial Chamber to appoint a lawyer to represent you, because you had already perjured yourself at your first -- at this first trial and that if you were to repeat that testimony, you would be committing perjury, and that if you were to testify now in favour of Mr. Nzirorera, you would be admitting that you had lied in the first trial, and that, therefore, the best thing for you to do was to consult with a lawyer to see what this lawyer could do for you in that situation.  Isn't that what I told you? 
A.	No.  Please, do not try to change anything.  You asked me to testify in the Defence of Nzirorera, and I told you -- or, rather, you told me that it was not to my benefit to continue down that road.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we missed what the witness was saying.  So if the witness could repeat, the interpreters would be able to -- witness continues.  
THE WITNESS:
You told me then that you were ready to help me to find a lawyer. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, once again, the English booth did not get the full meaning of the witness's testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, the interpreters are not picking up what you're saying adequately.  Probably you're speaking much too quickly, so please slow down.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And if he would repeat his last answer, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
They also request that you repeat your last answer.  
THE WITNESS:
Robinson asked me to be a Defence witness for Nzirorera and he asked me to withdraw from this matter.  He told me that it was not good for a young man like myself to continue to delve into problems of this nature.  So I told him that when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.  And I said the elephants are the state of Rwanda and Nzirorera.  And then he told me that if I ever decided to change my testimony, there would be a problem between myself and the Prosecutor.  And I told him, no, that there will be no problem, that the contrary would happen.  That is, there will be a problem between myself, the state of Rwanda and Nzirorera.  And I asked him why he wanted to prove Nzirorera not guilty by causing problems for me.  So I told him that he was seeking to create problems for me.  Then he answered saying that he was ready to get a lawyer to assist me to solve that problem.  Then I told him -- I asked him who would provide that lawyer for me, and he -- and who would pay for that lawyer.  I also asked him the location at which we would have to conduct such a transaction.  Then he told me that I should apply to the Trial Chamber and that during that period I will be accommodated by the Tribunal in terms of housing.  And then I asked him whether subsequently I would have to go back to Rwanda.  He said that I would be expected to return to Rwanda.  Then I asked him what Rwandans would say of this kind of transaction.  Then he told me that I needed to get a lawyer to assist me, and that it was for that lawyer to tell me how to solve that problem.  

He told me that I could say that I wasn't ready to testify as well and that I will go back to Rwanda without testifying.  

I told the Prosecutor all of this, and I provided this information to the Rwandan authorities, because I knew in advance that this matter was going to become a problem.  So, Your Honours, I would like to ask the Defence counsel to speak the truth and nothing but the truth.  When I came here he said that he was aware that one ************** had called me on the phone.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, did you receive any money from me or anyone connected with Mr. Nzirorera?
A.	Well, you operate in -- through different means, and you know yourself the means that you use to give this money.  Even in Rwanda there are people working on your behalf.  Even if you or someone on your team, did not give me money, Nzirorera has people in Kigali who can give out money.  
Q.	Did myself or anyone from Mr. Nzirorera's team give you any money?
A.	No, but you tried to do so.  
Q.	Well, Witness BTH, isn't it a fact that you requested a private meeting with me.  You offered to change your testimony if we paid you enough money to leave Rwanda.  You said you could not safely return to Rwanda if you didn't testify against Nzirorera.  I told you that it was against the law for Defence counsel to pay money to a witness.  I suggested you consult a lawyer who could represent only your interests to decide how to proceed in this manner.  Isn't that correct?
A.	No, that is not correct.  That is not true.  All what you have said is false.  First of all, I am not the one who came looking for you; you are the one who sought to meet me.  I am not the one who was at the safe house asking to meet you.  You are the one who indicated a desire to meet me because you knew that you had your own interests -- that it was in your interest and in the interest of Nzirorera to meet me.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, we're going to move on, Witness BTH, and this will be a matter for the Trial Chamber to decide after they have heard from Mr. Diop and my legal assistant.  

But you've told many lies in the course of your case in Rwanda, haven't you?
A.	No.  
Q.	Well, let's look first at your first statement you made after you were arrested in Rwanda in April of 1995.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And I'm going to ask that the witness be provided with number 1 in my packet of exhibits.  And the first two pages are Kinyarwanda, so if that can be placed before the witness, just those first two pages.  And those who are following in English will find two pages of English after that.  And those who are following in French will find two pages of French -- actually, three pages of French after that as number 1 in the exhibit packet.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, the document that has been placed in front of you is a statement dated the 3rd of April 1995, and it is an audition of -- a name of a person who I won't repeat because your name is protected, but it's your statement, is it not?
A.	Yes, that indeed was my statement.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer this statement as D. NZ129A in Kinyarwanda, 129B in French, and 129C in English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ129A, D. NZ129B and D. NZ129C admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, it's true, is it not, that when you were asked the following question, tell us -- this is the first question:  "Tell us about the attack that you launched against the family of Epimaque Samvura."  That's E-P-I-M-A-Q-U-E.  Samvura being S-A-M-V-U-R-A.  "The killing of the members of his family and the destruction of their houses."  And you answered, "We never attacked that family."  That was a lie, wasn't it?
A.	Let me provide the following answer:  Since I was arrested on the 1st of April '95, up to the 12th of September 2002, all my testimony throughout that period was not true because of reasons relating to my security and safety.  
Q.	And when you said "We never attacked the Samvura family," that was a lie, wasn't it?
A.	I have just explained to you that I told lies during that period because I could not incriminate my own self, given that once you confess that you had killed people, you were automatically killed as well. 
Q.	So the RPF was killing prisoners who confessed?
A.	We were told that it could happen that some soldiers take out their vengeance on you if you pled guilty.  
Q.	And when you said that you never attacked the Samvura family, that was a lie; correct?
A.	I have already answered you on several occasions, Counsel, that these were lies, and I gave you the reasons for which I told lies during that period. 
Q.	And not only did you tell lies, but you accused other people about lying about you.  Down further on the page you were asked, "You deny killing people during the genocide.  If ever we find evidence that you were one of those that killed the Samvura family, how would you react?"  And you answered, "Unless such evidence comes from people who were present at the time, since people tell lies or blame you for crimes that you did not commit, let me be punished if such evidence is produced."  

So did you also say that people who would blame you for participating in the attack on this Samvura family would be telling lies?
A.	I never made any such statement.  I simply said that if there were two -- if ever any witnesses were to surface to blame me, then I would accept punishment.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry for interrupting.  Could Mr. Robinson direct me to the last question that he asked the witness?  I can't seem to find it on D. NZ129.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  In the English version on the second page K0290492.  The first answer on the second page reads that, "Unless such evidence comes from people who were present at the time, since people tell lies or blame you for crimes that you did not commit, let me be punished if such evidence is produced."  

Mr. President, if the witness can now be shown document number 2.  This is also a statement in Kinyarwanda of two pages, followed by an English translation of three pages, and followed by a French translation of three pages.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what I've placed in front of you is a two-page statement in Kinyarwandan and it's dated 1995, on the 4th day of a month that begins with the letter A, but we can't make out the rest of it, so it's either April or August.  Is that a statement you made to the Rwandan authorities?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you remember if it was in April or August of 1995?
A.	It was in April. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would move into evidence as Exhibit D. NZ130A, the Kinyarwandan statement of the 4th of April 1995; as 130B, the French version; as 130C, the English version. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ130A, D. NZ130B and D. NZ130C admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, the first question that you were asked is, "Why did you ********************************* *****************belonging to the priests?"  And your answer was, "It was Dusabe, Nzirorera's younger brother, who************************************************************************************.  At the time, they were chasing us to kill us because they said we were hiding Inkotanyi and that we, ourselves, were Inkotanyi.  They also said that we were running a radio station for the Inkotanyi.  Therefore, they forced me to do so, threatening to kill me, together with my entire family, if I refused.  So I did it to save my life and the lives of my family."  

So when you told the prosecutor in Rwanda on the 4th of April 1995 that you were forced to ********** the Interahamwe, you were lying, were you not?
A.	Now, whether I was forced to ***********these people or to ********those persons is a fact that I can confirm even today, but wherever -- the fact is that wherever I went, it was under duress.  I was forced to do so.  
Q.	Were you forced to be among ********************the Interahamwe for a period of at least two years, according to you?
A.	I was not an Interahamwe ********for two years only.  At that time anyone who refused to be part of the MRND was considered to be an enemy, so whether one wanted it or not, one was forced to be part of the MRND in order not to be perceived badly.  
Q.	And so is it your testimony that you acted under duress for two years in Rwanda and everything that you did was done under threat?
A.	Yes, that is my testimony.  I never had any personal intention to kill any Tutsi or to hurt anybody whosoever.  If I had not been constrained to do so, I would never have done so.  By the way, I was not the only one who acted under duress.  Many others were under the same circumstances, and they were forced by people such as your client.  
Q.	Turning to the next page -- or further down, it was indicated that in our investigations at your home we questioned five people, namely, Gaston Kamanzi, that's G-A-S-T-O-N, K-A-M-A-N-Z-I; Esther Nyirajyambere, that's N-Y-I-R-A-J-Y-A-M-B-E-R-E; Immaculée Mukumugema, M-U-K-U-M-U-G-E-M-A; Joseph and Jerome Ntagungira, N-T-A-G-U-N-G-I-R-A.  "Kamanzi and Nyirajyambere accused you of being an Interahamwe and of having played a big role in the genocide.  What do you say to that?"  And you answered, "I have never been an Interahamwe.  This Gaston Kamanzi who told you that I am an Interahamwe saw me on the day I was *************************** *********under threat of death from the Interahamwe.  I repeat that I am not an Interahamwe and that Nyirajyambere is lying because she was not at the place because she had fled and her house had been occupied by refugees from Butaro.  Those who reported that to her misled her, just like those who told Samvura that I participated in the murder of his --" and it's illegible, but I suggest it means "family".  

So did you lie to the prosecutor in Ruhengeri by telling him that you had never been an Interahamwe?
A.	Yes, I lied to him, and the reasons are provided.  Epimaque Samvura was a judicial police officer at the very location where I was being questioned, and members of his family have been exterminated.  In 1995, I therefore could not admit in 1995 that I had killed members of his family.  I needed to save my own skin, because at that time there were no laws on such cases as ours that would reduce our early sentences.  And that is why we felt that anybody who told the truth at that time ran the risk of being killed, and that is why I did not tell the truth at that time.  
Q.	And the very last question and answer, when you were asked:  "Do you have anything to add or to change in your deposition?"  You said, "What I can add is that they are giving false testimony against me."  So you not only lied, but you accused other people of lying; correct?
A.	Many people told lies.  
Q.	And you were accusing people who said you were Interahamwe of telling lies; correct?
A.	Those -- some of those witnesses were liars.  Some came to testify against me on issues they never witnessed with their own eyes.  
Q.	But those who said that you were an Interahamwe were telling the truth; correct?
A.	No.  They were telling the truth, but sometimes you see witnesses who come to testify on events they did not witness with their eyes.  
Q.	But what you were doing, you were giving false testimony, accusing people of lying when they said you were an Interahamwe, and you knew that you were an Interahamwe; correct?
A.	Yes, I told you, give the reasons -- I gave the reasons that made me give false testimony at the time.  There was no law governing the guilty plea and confession procedure.  There was no Gacaca.  When you dared to tell the truth, you could lose your life in the process.  
Q.	So your history of falsely accusing people goes back at least 11 years to 1995; correct?
A.	I think I have already given you an answer.  I told you that between my arrest and the 12th of September, throughout this period I told lies, and I have given you the reasons.  
Q.	And before you signed this statement, in Exhibit 130A, you certified to the ministry of justice, department of public prosecutor, government of Rwanda, that it was true and accurate; correct?
A.	I did not take an oath at that time. 
Q.	But doesn't it say above your signature, "I certify that the above is true and accurate"? 
A.	The person who wrote that -- moreover, if you look carefully, that is put in French.  I did not take an oath before I gave that statement.  
Q.	And that made a big difference to you, then.  It was okay to lie to the prosecutor of Ruhengeri, but had he stopped the proceedings and asked you to raise your right hand and take the oath, you would have then told the truth; is that correct?
A.	I gave you the reasons that drove me not to tell the truth.  I think my answer was clear on that matter, and I have repeated this many times.  In September 2002, that is when I made my confession.  Prior to that date, I explained why I was not telling the truth.  
Q.	But had the prosecutor asked you to raise your right hand and take an oath, would you have told him the truth at that time? 
A.	When the prosecutor is conducting his investigations, no one takes an oath before giving his PV.
Q.	But had the prosecutor asked you to take an oath at the time you were giving this statement, would you have, all of a sudden, told the truth?  
A.	I knew they could not ask me to take an oath before they asked me questions.  Besides, it was not the prosecutor asking me questions, it was the criminal investigations officer who was asking me questions. 
Q.	And had the criminal investigations officer asked you to take an oath to tell the truth, would you have changed your statement and all of a sudden told the truth? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, I'm objecting to the question.  The question has been asked at least three times.  The witness has responded to it.  Mr. Robinson is dissatisfied with the response.  It's not going to change anything.  I'm suggesting that he move on.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, the witness has avoided giving an answer to the question, which is why I'm trying to get an answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just try once more and see what happens.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, if the criminal investigation officer had asked you to raise your right hand and take an oath, would you have told the truth to him at that time?
A.	I know there is a provision under the law that prior to conducting an examination -- interrogation, that the criminal investigation officer should not subject anyone to an oath taken.  Besides, this was not my trial.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think, Mr. President, that I don't need to pursue that any further.  And perhaps you would like to take your recess at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is 10:30.  We take our mid-morning break now. 
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1106H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Mr. President, if the witness could now be provided with document 3 in my list of exhibits.  And that contains a one-page statement in Kinyarwanda.  

And Mr. Issa, we're just speaking of item -- Mr. Issa, we're speaking item number 3 in my list of exhibits.  If you could place the first one-page document, Kinyarwandan, in front of the witness.  And then there's also a three-page French and two-page English translation.  Item number 3.  So it's a new document to be shown to the witness.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't want to be disruptive of Mr. Robinson's cross-examination, but I notice looking at his list of potential exhibits that we have another five or six statements to go with respect to these Kinyarwanda PVs that were taken prior to 2002, and I'm starting to wonder what the point is.  

The witness has already stated that he was not truthful in his responses to the Rwandan authorities through the period from the beginning of his arrest on the 1st of April 1995 all the way through the 12th of September 2002.  

So what I imagine is that we're going to spend another hour and a half going through material that the witness is going to admit having lied about and it will go into evidence anyway.  What's the point?  Mr. Robinson is free to continue.  It's a permissible line of questioning, but I don't think much is to be gained at this point.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, I'm -- I am selecting the substance of various topics that this witness has been questioned about on prior occasions that he -- also the subject of his direct testimony.  So I think I'm entitled to do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You're entitled.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed in front of you is a statement dated the 27th April 1995.  And I'm going to ask, is that a statement that you made to the Rwandan authorities and does it bear your signature?
A.	Yes, it is my signature.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer that document as Exhibit D. NZ131A for the Kinyarwandan version, 131B for French, and 131C for English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ131A, D. NZ131B and D. NZ131C admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, this time, Witness BTH, you were actually speaking to an officer of the public prosecutors; correct?
A.	You're correct.  
Q.	And the third question he asked you to explain how, during the war, you used to ******the Interahamwe who were going around killing people.  And your answer was, "I ******them once.  They took me on 7 April 1994 at 1:00 p.m. and asked me to****************************************.  They did not go anywhere that day, but just ******around the centre of Byangabo.  They were preparing attacks against Hutus who were married to Tutsi women.  They told me that they were going to kill the people who were at our house."  

Now, when you told the prosecutor that you ******the Interahamwe only once on 7 April, that was a lie; correct?
A.	I believe I explained it all, the reasons that drove me to tell lies.  I explained to the Judges, and I have nothing further to add.  
Q.	Because, in fact, you *******the Interahamwe on the 7th of April and you also drove them to Musumba on the 8th of April; correct?
A.	I have already answered this question.  Once again, I will give you the answer I had given you.  I said that all I said before the 12th of September was a lie.  I did not give the exact nature of my role in the events.  Therefore, I have give this explanation and I have nothing to add.  
Q.	When you said on the 27th of April 1995 that you drove the Interahamwe once, that was a lie, because you've told us that you drove them on the 7th of April and you drove them again on the 8th of April to Musumba; correct?
A.	I believe I gave you the answer to that question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, may you direct the witness to answer the question?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, even if you have answered the question already, you should answer it again.  There is a level which I will not permit the attorney to ask you the same question too often to the extent that I consider he's beginning to embarrass or harass you.  But it will probably save time if you just answered.  And if it sees (unintelligible) risk being overdone, I will stop the questioning from continuing along that line.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I may.  I don't want to belabour the point, but respectfully, I think we're getting to the point where it's starting to get overdone.  And if we direct our attention to Rule 95, which provides for exclusion of evidence on the grounds by which it was obtained, there actually is a basis to make an argument under Rule 95 that none of these statements taken prior to 2002 should be admitted.  This witness already -- has already stated on the record -- and it could be developed further if I requested a voir dire on any one of these exhibits from him -- that he made these statements under duress, that he was not given a choice to respond, that he thought he would be killed if he answered truthfully.  And on that basis this Court should really think about whether it is appropriate to admit these statements as Defence exhibits.  So I bring that to the Court's attention.  It's a matter for the Court -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not a (unintelligible) to bring it to my attention, Mr. Webster.
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
At this level, what we're dealing with is a statement which appears to be a prior inconsistent statement.  Now, if there are other issues involved, then you make a proper motion at the time.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The statement itself -- first of all, it was put in evidence before the witness was even asked to comment on it.  I didn't ask for Mr. Robinson to lay a foundation because it's clear where he's going with the statements.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Precisely.  
MR. WEBSTER:
But the witness in his previous responses has indicated that he made these statements under duress.  He was not represented by counsel.  At the time that he answered these questions, he felt he had no option but to answer and to say something.  I would think that that's a basis to question whether the evidence is so unreliable that it can even be admitted as a prior inconsistent statement.  

So I'm asking the Court to exercise some discretion to cut this line of questioning short, because it's going nowhere.  I can address this during my re-direct, but I don't think it's inappropriate to bring it -- bring my concerns to the Court's attention at this stage.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So my question, Witness BTH, is when you told the prosecutor on the 27th of April 1995 that you had ******the Interahamwe only once, that statement was a lie, because as you've told us, you ******them once on the 7th and again on the 8th to Musumba; correct?
A.	You are correct.  On that occasion I told them lies.  I thought I had answered your question, and I pointed out to you the reasons that drove me to tell lies in 1995.  The war had just ended, and no one would have dared to admit that they had killed people.  If one had dared to say that one had killed people, one would have been killed.  That was April 1995.  

And throughout that period, therefore, stretching from the 1st of April 1995 to the 12th of September 2002 I told lies because I wanted to save my skin.  Perhaps if the Court had given counsel to persons arrested, however, in the circumstances I faced, I was in no position to tell all, unless you want me to give the answer you would like me to give.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, you may proceed.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The other point, Mr. Robinson is that it's the -- in view of what's been happening, the answers are quite predictable.  Is there a quicker way of doing it?  
MR. ROBINSON:
There may be a quicker way of doing it, but I think for each statement I'm trying to go through just a few topics, and I'm trying to do it as quick as possible, but I don't think it's -- a witness can avoid the substance by taking a general -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're not stopping you. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  I'm doing the best I can to be selective.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, two questions later, you were asked:  "Were you not a member of the Interahamwe?"

Your answer:  "No."

Question:  "Why are you, therefore, accused of being one since 1991?"  

Answer:  "I simply knew about their activities."  

Question:  "How could you know about their activities, whereas you were not a member of their group?"  

And your answer:  "I was informed by some of their members."  

So it's true, is it not, that you continued to deny you were a member of the Interahamwe, and you fabricated a story as to how you knew about their activities?
A.	All the answers I provided during that interview amounted to lies only because I knew that if I confessed having killed anybody, I could have been easily killed myself.  I have already told you that when I was arrested I did not have a lawyer, and the law on reduced sentences was not yet adopted.  So we had already noticed that people had been killed and that those who had recently come to power were not happy, and so we feared for our lives.  We feared that we would be killed if ever we had accepted that we had killed anybody.  
Q.	And so when you were fabricating these stories, it was because you thought it was in your interest to do so at the time; correct?
A.	Yes.  And, by the way, it did help me significantly because nothing evil befell me.  You see, I am not the only one who did this.  Your client, for example, is saying that he did not play any role in the killings, yet he played a role in the killings.  
Q.	Well, for example, you've accused my client of providing you with a firearm, but when you were asked on the 27th of April 1995, what type of firearm did you have, your answer was, "I have never owned a firearm."  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that is the answer I provided.  You see, one could not afford to confess that one was in possession of a firearm before the Inkotanyi, so I said that I never owned a firearm.  But it is true that he gave us the uniforms and firearms.  At some point, I began to tell the truth, and I want to make it clear that even here today I am telling you the truth.  
Q.	Now, at the end of this interview when you were asked about your participation in the Interahamwe and the extermination of the family of Samvura, and whether you owned a firearm, when they asked you if you wish to add anything to your statement, you said, "Nothing.  It's a false accusation."  So you continued to accuse those who were telling the truth of making false accusations against you, correct?
A.	I have already answered, mentioning the reasons for which I did this.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if the witness can now be shown document number 4.  And this document is first in Kinyarwandan, in two pages, and then in English and French.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed in front of you is a two-page statement in Kinyarwandan that was taken on the 30th of July 1997.  It's more than two years after the previous three statements were taken.  And I'll ask you if, first of all, you recognise this statement as one having been made by you?
A.	Yes, it is my statement. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that the statement be admitted as exhibit D. NZ132A for the Kinyarwanda, 132B for the French, and 132C for the English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ132A, D. NZ132B and D. NZ132C admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, directing your attention to this statement, and on the bottom of page 1 of your Kinyarwandan version, and on page 3 of the English and French versions, you indicate that you are being accused by Epimaque Samvura, and when you were asked, "Could you tell us where you were and what you were doing during that period?" you stated, "My whole family was in hiding.  In fact, they were -- in fact, they were looking for us because they said my mother was Tutsi.  I was *************** ************and I was, therefore, able to get out but with some difficulty."  

And further on you state about -- that it was true that you***************, but it was after the extermination.  And when you were asked who you*****************************, you said that when you came out, the younger brother of Joseph Nzirorera, Sergeant François Dusabe, Michel Niyigaba, and Noel Ndayisaba, the son of the younger brother of Nzirorera, arrested me immediately, and they instructed me to ******them."  Were you arrested on the 7th of April 1994?  
A.	I was telling lies, and, therefore, I believe that it is not necessary to ask whether or not I told the truth.  So, first of all, what I am saying is that I was telling lies.  
(Pages 1 to 23 by Roxane Meena)

























1130H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, the very last question and answer on this statement, they asked you, "If you had anything to add?"  And you said that "I would like to add that I never saw Makombe," M-A-K-O-M-B-E, "involving himself in the criminal acts.  And I cannot conceal the truth to protect a criminal." That's what you said? 
A.	Yes, the question was put to me about Makombe and I told them that he did nothing wrong.  That was the answer that I gave to the question about Makombe.  I believe that what I said about that person was the truth. 
Q.	And when you said "I cannot conceal the truth to protect a criminal," that was, in fact, exactly what you were doing, you were concealing the truth to protect yourself, correct? 
A.	No, the question that was put to me was in relation to Makombe.  I am not Makombe. 
Q.	But you were concealing the truth to protect yourself, were you not?  
A.	I believe that you read this question before putting it to me, and you can see for yourself that there is no reference to my name in that question; rather, it refers to Makombe.
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could now be shown number 5 in my series of exhibits; it is a two-page statement in Kinyarwanda, followed by English and French? 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed before you is a statement dated the 8th of June 1998 in two pages.  Do you recognise that as your statement, bearing your signature? 
A.	Yes, I recognise that document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, at this time I would offer the Kinyarwanda version of this statement as D. NZ133A; the French as 133B and the English as 133C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ133A, D. NZ133B and D. NZ133C admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, you see that when you are questioned by the public prosecutor on the 8th of June you acknowledge that you were detained because you were accused by Samvura of having participated in the massacre of members of his family.  And when you were asked, "Were you really responsible for this?"  You answered, "No, not at all."

So, you lied about that on the 8th of June 1998, correct?  
A.	Yes, all of the answers that I provided amounted to lies, and I have given you the reasons for that.  I thought that if I confessed having taken part in the killings, I would myself be killed.  So, I didn't have confidence in the state of the law in Rwanda at that time. 
Q.	And further down in that statement, on page 1 of the Kinyarwanda, page 1 of the English --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreters didn't get the first part of Counsel Robinson's question because there was an overlap from the Kinyarwanda booth. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Sorry about that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	At the bottom of page 1 of the Kinyarwanda and page 2 of the English, you talk about going to Busogo parish.  You told them, did you not, that you went to Busoga yourself to borrow a vehicle from the priest,  and the priest lent you a Suzuki Samurai; and that wasn't true, was it? 
A.	Those were lies. 
Q.	And, in fact, you want to Busogo parish to kill Tutsi and you stole the vehicles there, correct? 
A.	No, I did not steal any vehicles; we simply confiscated those vehicles. 
Q.	Now further along in that statement were you asked If you were a member of the Interahamwe.  And you said, "That is not true.  I was a student.  When I was arrested I was in Form I in secondary school."  And then they asked you, "If you could give the names of some honest people who know you, that know that you were on the list of those to be killed and not an Interahamwe?"  And you gave the names of many people, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And among the people whose names you gave was a person by the name of Israel Surwumwe, that's S-U-R-W-U-M-W-E, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, at this time I would like to have the witness shown the statement of                   Israel Surwumwe, which was among the Rule 68 material that was provided to us.  I have it in Exhibit 23.  And in this particular case, the name has not been redacted, but I'm now to the point where I'm going to need unredacted statements of the other people; but in the meantime, if number 23 can be placed in front of the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is this part of the material, translated document -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
We did not really receive any translations, we just -- copies, we just received oral translations.  So, I have my notes and within the transcript for that day you can find the translation. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed before you appears to be a statement made to the Prosecutor, the same François-Xavier Mutsindashyaka, that's spelt M-U-T-S-I-N-D-A-S-H-Y-A-K-A, that you had spoken to on the 6th of June.  And now on the 13th -- or some time in July of 1998, he has gone to speak with the person you referred to, Israel Surwumwe, and taken a statement from that person.  Now directing your attention to the document that has been placed in front of you in Kinyarwanda, does that appear to you to be a statement of Israel Surwumwe about you? 
A.	I know nothing about this.  I wasn't present when he was being interviewed.  By the way, when investigations are conducted, the documents are filed; one is not called up to be shown those documents.  All I know is that he was a witness to what could have happened to my family at the time my family was being threatened. 
Q.	Well, can you read for us the question and answer; the first question and answer? 
A.	He was asked whether he knew me, and he said yes. 
Q.	Can you read his full answer, please? 
A.	"I know him.  He was born in Busogo and grew up in Busogo." 
Q.	And then does he go on to tell about what happened -- what your involvement was in the events of  April 1994, correct? 
A.	Yes and I believe that he gave his own version of the facts. 
Q.	And that version was that you were not involved in any of the killing.  And, in fact, you and your family were hunted, correct? 
A.	Yes, that was his testimony, or his statement.  But I wasn't present and I am reading that here and now.  And I believe that must have been what he said. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this statement as D. NZ134. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we have had this discussion already. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, first of all, I have offered an exhibit to which there has been no objection, so maybe the exhibit can be admitted on that basis, or if you would like I can make a further presentation about why I believe it is admissible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is a (inaudible) trial.  There are certain issues which consent doesn't cure legal breaches.  We have raised before the issue as to whether the testimony of somebody else can be introduced in this manner through a witness.  We still are of the view that this is not an appropriate -- it is not admissible to be introduced in this manner.  We have suggested in the past that you could mark it for identification and if at some stage it is proper to introduce it through a proper witness, then the record would be here and you can introduce it at that stage.  But that is the problem we have in accepting your proposition that it could be admitted at this time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand, Mr. President.  Just so I make a full record on this, because this is a situation where I don't intend to call -- this is unlike the other situations.  I don't intend to call these declarants, because I don't think it would be necessary.  But my position is that pursuant to Rule 89(C) that the documents that you have in front of you have sufficient indicia of reliability to meet the threshold of admissibility, notwithstanding that they are hearsay.  And the indicia that you have is the official records -- showing that it is an official record of the parquet of Ruhengeri; that it was provided to us from the Prosecution who obtained them from the Rwanda authorities; and also that the statement is taken within a short time after this particular witness had referred the Prosecutor to Israel Surwumwe.  

So, the overall circumstances in my submission are such that there is enough reliability that, in fact, this is the statement of that individual.  And that it coincides with the false explanations given by the witness to the authorities at that time.  So it has both authenticities and relevance and probative value.  So, based on that, I would ask that you consider it be admitted, notwithstanding the fact that it is a statement of an individual who will not be before the Trial Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I would like to on this occasion invite you to address this issue. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm having trouble with my microphone, I didn't hear what you -- the Court said, I'm sorry.  There is a lot of interference on the line.  Can you repeat it, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I had taken the trouble to extend an invitation to you to address us on this issue. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Before you do that; Mr. Robinson, are you introducing this statement to impeach his credibility, to contradict his testimony?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I'm introducing it not to contradict his testimony, in fact --  
JUDGE SHORT:
What is purpose of introducing it?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be asked to take his headphones off, please? 
JUDGE SHORT:
Witness, can you take your headphones off?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Your Honours, the purpose of introducing this is to show that not only did the witness himself lie about his own conduct to the authorities, but that he got others to lie for him, and so that is the purpose of introducing this statement.
JUDGE SHORT:
So, it is to impeach the witness?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
To impeach him, generally, but not with an inconsistent statement of another witness but with the circumstances of the testimony of another witness. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
First of all, assuming that Mr. Robinson is on the right path I don't think he has laid the sufficient foundation, but even if the witness himself mentioned the name of this other declarant in his statement, there has been no evidence to suggest that this witness invited the other witness to testify, or to give evidence before the parquet.  We don't know how the parquet actually contacted this other individual.  

But -- actually, I object to this whole line of questioning and I object to the admission of all of the exhibits that Mr. Robinson has tendered so far, including this one.  And my objection is based on     Rule 95.  Mr. Robinson seems to suggest that Rule 89 is broad enough because the material themselves are reliable.  I suggest the contrary, that the materials are not reliable, that it is abusive to admit these prior inconsistent statements because of the manner in which they were taken.  This witness himself states that the statements were taken under duress.  With respect to this last statement, it is not an inconsistent statement of this witness.  It is being offered by a declarant who is not going to be subject to cross-examination.  

I understand Mr. Robinson's logic, but I find it objectionable.  I didn't say anything because it seemed as if we were on a train ride that would not stop and that an objection would have been superfluous.  But this whole line of questioning is objectionable as far as we are concerned.  And I oppose the admission of this particular exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we don't admit it at this time. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. President.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed.  Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.  At this time, then, I would like to have marked my number 23 in my exhibits as ID. NZ20; that is the statement of Israel Surwumwe that we have just discussed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification.
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ20 admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, in order to save time, instead of showing these documents to the witness, what I would like to now do is to mark for identification the remainder of these statements taken from people who the witness referred the authorities to in his interview of the 8th of June 1998.  So, I don't have unredacted copies.  The copies that are here are redacted copies, but I will say the name of the person, and the identification number and asked that you direct the Prosecution to substitute the unredacted copies.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, is there a problem you are having with producing the other documents?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
My understanding was that everything was burned on a CD-ROM and delivered to CMS, Your Honour.  That may have happened earlier this morning, but usually when we put it in the pipeline that way, it takes a day or two before it actually comes out at the other end. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, we will order the unredacted versions to be marked for identification, but can you list them now?
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Exhibit DN -- ID. NZ21, would be the statement of Therese Mugiraneza, that's M-U-G-I-R-A-N-E-Z-A.  ID. NZ22 would be the statement of Felicite Barigora, B-A-R-I-G-O-R-A.  ID. NZ23 would be the statement of Christelle Nyiraturatsinze, that is C-H-R-I-S-T-E-L-L-E, N-Y-I-R-A-T-U-R-A-T-S-I-N-Z-E.  ID. NZ24 is the statement of Isabelle Nyiransabimana, that is N-Y-I-R-A-N-S-A-B-I-M-A-N-A.  ID. NZ25 is a statement of Jerome Ntagunira that is Ntagunira, N-T-A-G-U-N-I-R-A.  And ID. NZ26, the statement of a person identified only as Batamuriza, B-A-T-A-M-U-R-I-Z-A.  

And, Mr. President, these statements can be found in my exhibit packet as numbers 24 through 28.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification. 
(Exhibit No. ID. NZ21, ID. NZ22, ID. NZ23, ID. NZ24, ID. NZ25, ID. NZ26 marked for identification)
MR. ROBINSON: 
And if the witness could now be shown number 6 in my packet of exhibits, which is a two-page Kinyarwanda statement. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed in front of you is a statement of the 24th of August 1998 that is signed by you and taken in front of an officer of the parquet of the Republic of Rwanda in Ruhengeri.  Is that your statement?  
A.	Yes, I do recognise my statement. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this statement as Exhibit D. NZ134A for the Kinyarwanda version; 134B for the French version -- 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, there was an overlap and we missed the first part of Mr. Robinson's statement. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  I am offering the statement of the 24th of August 1998 as Exhibit D. NZ134A for Kinyarwanda; 134B for French, and 134C for English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ 134A, D. NZ134B and D. NZ134C admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, do you see in this statement, at the bottom of the first page, that you were asked the question:  "Are you aware or not that the Interahamwe went to kill at the appeals court?" And you answered, "I heard of it."  

And then were you asked, "How did you hear about it?  Who told you about it?"  And you answered, "I heard it on the radio.  It was said that Inkotanyi launched an attack and killed people at the appeals court.  Later people said the killers were Ruhengeri Interahamwe together with Mukingo Interahamwe, which I was not aware of."  

So it is true, is it not, that on the 24th of August 1998 you lied about your 	knowledge of the people who had gone to the court of appeal?  
A.	Yes, the same answer would stand as previously.  I told lies for reasons that I have already put forth to the Court. 
Q.	And later on in this document when you were asked "You do not know the Interahamwe who came to Ruhengeri to kill at the appeals court?." You answered, "I know Interahamwe from Mukingo among who are François Dusbimana, Noeli Ndayisaba, Muhohamar", M-U-H-O-H-A-M-A-R, "Theoneste Barebereho," B-A-R-E-B-E-R-E-H-O, "Musafiri," M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I, "Iyamuremye," I-Y-A-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E, "son of Zirarushya," Z-I-R-A-R-U-S-H-Y-A.  "Those are the Interahamwe that I know.  I am not aware if they went there." 

	And then they asked you, "Can you tell us what they did?"  And you said, "They persecuted us, that is what I know."  So is it true that not only did you deny being the person who instructed these people to go to the court of appeals -- or collected these people to go to the court of appeals, but you presented yourself to the Rwanda authorities as a victim who was being persecuted?  
A.	At that time you could not dare to tell the truth.  I have told you the reason. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness can now be shown document number 7, which is a one-page Kinyarwanda document, it is followed by an English and French translation. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, what has been placed before you is a document dated the 20th of October 1998.  And is this a document which indicates that you were taken at that time to court in Rwanda and advised of your right to submit to the confession and guilty plea procedure? 
A.	Yes, I see the document. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ135A for the Kinyarwanda, B for the French and C for the English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ135A, D. NZ135B and D. NZ135C admitted, under seal)
MR. ROBINSON: 
And also, Mr. President, I should indicate that all of these exhibits should be received under seal because they contain the name of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Admitted under seal, and that goes with the preceding exhibits connected to this witness. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And it is true, is it not, Witness BTH, that at this time on the 20th of October 1998, you replied that you did not wish to resort to the confession and guilty plea procedure and you maintained your plea of not guilty? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
And now, Mr. President, if the witness can be shown document number 8.  This is a document that exists in Kinyarwanda and French.  It is a document that goes from K number 0000236 to 0000254 in the Kinyarwanda, and if that can be placed in front of the witness.  And then the French is behind it, and that is K number 0000219. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, do you recognise this document? 
A.	Yes, I recognise the document. 
Q.	And could you tell the Trial Chamber what the document is and what were the circumstances under which it was prepared? 
A.	Yes, I will explain it to you.  Forty-seven people detained at Ruhengeri prison who were accused of genocide perpetrated in Busogo, in Mukingo commune, got together and having thought about it concluded that it was not good for them to all remain in jail.  They decided to accuse each other, and exculpate each other as well.  In some cases, there was a need to exculpate, and in others there was a need to lay charges.  
I did not draw up the forwarding letter, but******************************.  I admit that this document is full of lies because people agreed to exculpate -- falsely exculpate others.  In short, that is the content of the document you see here.  If you would like to know how this document came to contain lies, I am prepared to furnish you details. 
Q.	Were you one of the people who was incriminated or one of the people who was exculpated? 
A.	Each one said something about his fellow detainee based on one's relationship with other prisoners.  Sometimes, if one was your friend you would exculpate that person, if he was your enemy, however, you might incriminate him.  If you want to know more about the reasons that made us tell lies or the truth, I am prepared to answer your questions. 
Q.	Well, if you could look at the page that talks about you, and I think you will find it at 0000246, now according to this document did Michel Niyigaba say something about you? 
A.	Yes.  First of all, he said I was a member of the MRND youth wing.  Secondly, he said that I ********* ***************************************were the killers. 
Q.	And what else did he say? 
A.	I note that he only cited two points:  Firstly, the point on my belonging to the MRND youth wing; and, secondly, the ************************************************these people. 
Q.	And looking down further on the chart about you, were there also statements from Nsengiyumva, that is N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A, from Gaston Kamanzi, from Pierre Bashyitsi, that is B-A-S-H-Y-I-T-S-I, from GATO Abdulkarim, ABD period.  

I see Mr. Webster on his feet, so I will stop here.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I am enquiring into the basis for this line of questioning.  If we are going to confront the witness with his own statement that is one thing; but it seems to me that we are indirectly going back to the problem we encounter with the other PV's that were marked for identification.  So to the extent that this document is being introduced as a prior inconsistent statement of the witness, that is one thing, but it should not be used to elicit a lot of information that should not make its way into the record in this way. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, this is a document that the witness has already testified to that he helped prepare.  And it is a collective document which contains, as he has testified, lies by a group of people who agreed among themselves to tell lies, and some truth about each other.  So I believe this is sufficient foundation for the document to be admitted and to have questions put to the witness about the document.  And I will offer the document at this time as Exhibit D. NZ135A for the Kinyarwanda and 135B for the French -- it should be D. NZ136A. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D.NZ136A and D. NZ136B admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
It should be D. NZ136A and B. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness BTH, it is true, is it not, that there were a number of people who said things about you in this document, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct; 12 people talked about me. 
Q.	And did any of them -- did any of them tell the authorities that you had participated in the killings? 
A.	If you had read the document properly, you would see that one *************accused me of that.  Even looking at the documents in Rwanda, it is to be found that he did incriminate me for those facts.  
Q.	And where do you see -- where do you see his name on this document? 
A.	Look at page 000247 (sic). 
Q.	Okay, I have that page, then.  Now where do you see -- maybe we didn't receive the name correctly, but where are you referring to on that page? 
A.	I see his name on the document, look carefully.  He said he was one of the members of the Interahamwe committee in Busogo.  Secondly, he appears on the list of people who perpetrated killings in Busogo. 
Q.	And that is statement of************************************************? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, these documents, this series of lies that were told to exonerate some people and incriminate others, this was forwarded to the prosecutor in Ruhengeri; is that correct? 
A.	My fellow detainees wrote and signed the document.  As for me, I did not sign the document because I was starting to take cognizance of the law as the time went by. 
Q.	And as of -- the date of this document appears to be the 22nd of November 1999; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  It is the 22nd of November 1999. 
Q.	And it was not until the 12th of September of 2002 that you provided a confession to authorities, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And so at this time you were still denying your involvement in these events, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could be shown number -- document number 9?  It is a one-page document in Kinyarwanda, followed by English and French. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, does this appear to be a document reflecting the fact that on the                                  29th day of December 1999 you were once again brought to the court in Ruhengeri and informed of your right to submit to the confession and guilty plea procedure? 
A.	Yes, it is a document on the confession and guilty plea. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this as D. NZ137A for the Kinyarwanda, 137B for the French, and 137C for the English to be admitted under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ137A, D. NZ137B and D. NZ137C admitted, under seal)  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And Witness BTH, it is true, is it not, that on the 29th of December 1999, you informed the authorities that you did not wish to make a confession or a guilty plea and you maintained your plea of not guilty? 
A.	Yes, you are right.  I was not yet ready to make a confession. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I am going to go on to the next document, but if you would like to take the break at this time we can do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take the luncheon recess now, and resume at 2 o'clock. 
(Court recessed from 1230H to 1424H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

You may proceed, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness BTH? 
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the witness can be shown my next document, which I believe is number 9, it is a one-page document in Kinyarwanda, and it is K0294729.

Mr. Hometowu, I don't think you have the right document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you usually are so on the ball that I shudder to suggest that that document may already be admitted as 137. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
That may be, Mr. President.  Unfortunately, the CMS has not given me my packet.  I was the one person who didn't get a copy, so I am working from my own materials, so I -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, my notes indicate that it was admitted already as 137A, B, C under seal. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, very well.  Let me see if I can find which document this is. 
(Pages 24 to 35 by Donna M. Lewis)






























1430H
MR. WEBSTER:
The K-number that you read out is for number 16 on your list, right?  
MR. ROBINSON:
That's correct.  Thank you, Mr. Webster.  This would be number 16 then.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Which is one of the documents that we were discussing at the beginning of the witness's testimony of the three that were included in the Rule 68 materials. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  That's correct. 

Mr. Hometowu, it doesn't look like you have the correct document there, so maybe you could take my copy. 
MR. WEBSTER:
In the bundle, it's right in front of the excerpt from the book of Ruzibiza, I believe. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, we have it.  Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It's number 16 in the bundle, is it?  Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, the document that's been placed before you appears to be dated on the 26th of December of 2001.  Do you recognise that document?  
A.	Yes, I recognise it.  
Q.	And it -- is this a -- is this a notice that was given to you indicating that you have been placed in the first category of offenders and scheduling an appearance before the court for the 14th of January 2002?  
A.	No. 
Q.	Can you tell me then what the document is? 
A.	It's a summons to appear before the court of first instance of Ruhengeri, and more particularly, before the special trial chamber. 
Q.	And does it indicate in the document that you have been placed in category 1?  
A.	No.  Give me some time to read through the entire document, to acquaint myself with the contents of the entire document.  I do not -- I do not see any reference to that anywhere, and I believe that according to the Rwandan law, that is not expected to appear on any document of this nature. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, this was not one of the documents we had an official translation of.  If I could just have a minute.  

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, does this document indicate what crimes you're charged with? 
A.	Yes, absolutely. 
Q.	Can you tell us what those crimes were? 
A.	Generally speaking, they refer to the*********************.  They simply -- carried forward the same charges that had been brought against me.  However, that does not mean that I was accused with all those crimes or offences.  What they simply did, therefore, was to carry forward all the charges that were mentioned in that file. 
Q.	And what were those charges? 
A.	I believe that you have several documents from my file and I believe that you must be in possession of that document which outlines all the charges brought against me.  As for those included on this document, these are general, or charges of a general nature, but I wasn't accused of all of them. 
Q.	So can you read the charges that appear on this document?  I believe it's the handwritten lines next to the word "Ashinsuwa" (phonetic).  
A.	Yes.  I read them:  "Genocide, extermination, murder, plundering or looting, abuse of domicile, rape, torture -- "  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that this document be -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- and creation of an association of evildoers."
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  Mr. President, at this time I would ask that this document be admitted as NZ138. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  This requires to be under seal as well?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.  
(Exhibit D. NZ138 admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, you have told us that on the 12th of September 2002 you made a confession to crimes in Rwanda; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And I would like to have you explain to the Trial Chamber the law under which you made your confession, because we have not yet had any witnesses to talk about this.  So, was there a time during the time you were imprisoned when the law in Rwanda changed?  
A.	Yes.  The Gacaca was introduced when we were in prison. 
Q.	And as a result in the change of that law, did it become possible for people who were imprisoned to be released if they made a confession?  
A.	Yes.  However, it all depended on the manner in which the procedure unfolded for that particular individual.  So let me explain that, according to this law, the document which you have shown the Court is a summons, and that is not exactly where I was supposed to appear, because my file came before the courts after the Gacaca system had been introduced.  The law provides that the transmission of files to the courts which took place after the introduction of the Gacaca system would be revisited so that the files under such transmissions are sent back to the prosecutor's office and processed through the Gacaca system.  So the document which you have referred to, that summons requiring that I appear before a court, I am sure that you looked at the part that you and your client were interested in, but may I say that this document is of no value because all such documents were written out after the introduction of the Gacaca system, and it is for that reason that my file was returned to the prosecutor's office, which, in turn, handed it over to the Gacaca system.  

Now, as to the question on the structure of the law, it all depends on the category under which one was classified and on the sentence that one fell under.  As far as release goes, the time already spent in jail was taken into consideration.  If such time was equal to or less than the sentence, you were promptly released.  For those in the second and third category, there was the right to be released accordingly.  But those who fell under the first category did not enjoy that right insofar as the provisions relating to those in category 1 were different from those relating to those persons in the second and third categories.  As a matter of fact, that law is what was applied in the case of my release 
Q.	How many categories are there under the law? 
A.	There were four categories previously, but today there are only three. 
Q.	And can you tell us your understanding as to what it is that determines whether a person is in category 1 or 2 or 3?  
A.	I cannot be as exhaustive as the law itself, but those who planned and organised the genocide fall under category 1, as well as those who incited others to be involved; that is, those who actually carried out the genocide.  All those persons fall under category 1.  

Those under category 2 are those who executed the genocide or who committed those offences but who do not fall under category 1.  

Category 3 includes those who wounded other persons and whose actions led to disabilities, and then the fourth category is those who were involved in the looting and plundering.  Today those under the first category are tried in the ordinary courts which were in place before the Gacaca system.  Those under the second and third category are tried before the Gacaca in their specific secteurs, whereas those under category 4 are tried before the systems at the cellule level. 
Q.	Now, for somebody who wanted to benefit from the new law and to try to obtain their release, was there a procedure in which they would have to submit a letter or some materials to the office of the prosecutor?  
A.	When we were in detention, we sent a letter to the state prosecutor.  The detainee also has the right to write to the Gacaca system.  If one chooses not to write, they may still be summoned to appear before the state prosecutor or before the Gacaca and state their version of the facts before the prosecutor or before the Gacaca.  
Q.	And in September of 2002, did you come to the conclusion that it was in your interest to submit a plea of guilty and confession to the prosecutor in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes.  I realised that it was in my interest to enter a plea of guilty.  And my file was still with the state prosecutor in Ruhengeri, so I sent a letter to the prosecutor. 
Q.	And at that time had you already been placed in a category?  
A.	The prosecutor's office looks at your confession and plea of guilty and then determines what category one is placed under, but they do not inform one immediately of the category in which one has been placed.  It all depends on the nature of one's file and the manner in which the plea of guilty was entered. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  And now I would like you to be shown document number 10, which is a one-page document in Kinyarwanda, followed by two pages in English and two pages in French.  

Witness BTH, I'm going to present these documents to you in three parts: one being your cover letter; one being known as annex 1; and one being known as annex 2.  And I'd ask you, first of all, if the document that's in front of you now is the letter you sent with your confession and explanations to the prosecutor on the 12th of September 2002 in Ruhengeri.  
A.	I did not quite understand your question, Counsel. 
Q.	Is this the letter that you sent to the prosecutor in Ruhengeri on the 12th of September 2002, submitting your confession and plea of guilty and your testimony?  
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would ask that this be admitted as D. NZ139, A for the Kinyarwanda, 139B for the French, 139C for the English, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit  No. D. NZ139A, 139B and 139C admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And now if you could be shown document number 11, which is also Kinyarwandan, English and French.  And the Kinyarwandan is K0262365.  And Witness BTH, is the document that's been placed in front of you your confession and plea of guilty that you submitted on the 12th of September 2002?  
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time I would ask that this document be admitted as D. NZ140, A for the Kinyarwandan, 140B for French, 140C for English, under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ140A, D. NZ140B and D. NZ140C admitted, under seal) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, we're going to look at this confession and plea of guilty in detail.  So, first of all, we want to establish what it was that you -- what offences it was that you were admitting.  And under item Roman numeral i, it's true, is it not, that the two crimes that you admitted were involvement in a criminal transaction, that's number one, and number two, ****************************************************, Théogène Nsengimana, N-S-E-N-G-I-M-A-N-A, Sergeant François Dusabimana, which is number 16 on the spelling list, Michel Niyigaba, 62 on the spelling list, Habyarimana, H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A, and Jean Damascène, alias Bagabo, number 2 on the spelling list, during attacks they launched to flush out and exterminate the Tutsi in the following locations:  At Gahibali's house, G-A-H-I-B-A-L-I'-S, at the ESTB school complex, and in Musumba in Nkuli commune.  Now, were those the two charges to which you plead guilty?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, turning to the facts, which is under Roman numeral number ii, you have first indicated that "On the 7th of April 1994, around six o'clock in the morning, Sergeant Dusabimana, the younger brother of Nzirorera, arrived at Byangabo market opposite Haguma's tea restaurant, saying that Habyarimana was dead and that his death should be avenged, and that Dusabimana immediately requested Michel Niyigaba to go and look for Rukara in order to set the example.  And Niyigaba went to look for him, and they killed him immediately opposite Barayesesa's house" -- and that's B-A-Y -- excuse me, B-A-R-A-Y-E-S-E-S-A'-S -- "using stones and a little axe.  Rukara was killed by Niyigaba with the help of Musafiri -- number 57 on the spelling list -- and Dusabe, who had a pistol in hand.  After killing him, Sergeant Dusabimana asked all those on the scene to follow him, to go and kill Tutsis.  The first group of people followed him and they went to kill people." 

Now, Witness BTH, that is the first paragraph of your confession, and was it true?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	And I notice that it's consistent with the accounts that you've given in this trial, only that at the trial of Mr. Nzirorera, you have added the fact that you received -- that you went back to the home of Mr. Nzirorera's mother and that you saw Kajelijeli, Nyabusore and Baheza and that they were the ones who gave the instructions to begin the killing.  And I believe you further testified that you were informed that it was Mr. Nzirorera who had been in contact with these people and had given that instruction.  Can you tell us why you included none of those facts in your plea of guilty and confession on the 12th of September 2002?  
A.	Yes.  What my testimony before this Tribunal has been is true and what I mentioned in my plea of guilty is also true.  At the time I wrote this document it was a confession of my own role, and I was not referring to Nzirorera or Kajelijeli's roles.  If you read the cover letter carefully, the cover letter to my confession and plea of guilty, I wrote it along the lines of the requirements of the law and the reference to that law is mentioned in the document.  

According to that law, the procedure to be followed is laid down in respect of confessions and pleas of guilty.  The law requires that the document must be a written document and that those to whom the document is forwarded must invite you to confirm that what you have written is indeed true.  

You see, in Rwanda, some of us had been in prison for a very long time and they were aware that one may not recall all the facts properly in one sitting.  That is why the law allows room for any new facts that might surface in one's mind to be put on the record.  One has the right, at any point when one does remember, to write up another document in which one would include any such new facts.  At that date, however, it is clear that Nzirorera's name is mentioned in annex number 2, so I refer to that -- to his name in annex 2.  However, this does not mean that the second annex was exhaustive in itself.  That is why I have been summoned to appear before this Tribunal, to provide further information.  
Q.	Looking at the second paragraph under Roman numeral ii, you say that, "After a while the second group of people armed with guns arrived, Felix Ndayambaje," which is spelled N-D-A-Y-A-M-B-A-J-E, "and Théogène, son of Esdras Baheza" -- which is number 4 on the spelling list -- "were at the head of all these people drinking tea at Haguma's restaurant.  Ndayambaje then asked me to accompany him.  I told him that I was sick."  

Was that true? 
A.	Yes, that was true.  I know why I told him that I was sick at the time.  Otherwise, what is written down is true.  When I told him that I was sick at the time, I know why I had said so.  Maybe you want to ask me why I told him I was sick. 
Q.	Why did you tell him you were sick? 
A.	When he came, he was bearing or carrying a weapon.  I did not know where he wanted us to go.  He said, "Let's go."  And I did not want to agree with him immediately without knowing where he was taking me.  You see, when somebody shows up with a firearm and asks you to go along with him, you cannot just jump up and go with him.  Now, if you read further, he provides an explanation. 
Q.	Okay, let me read further then. "Nsengimana told me that they were not asking me to go and kill but, rather, to assist them to start a vehicle because they did not have the ignition key.  'If you refuse,' they said, we shall kill you on the spot."  

Was that true? 
A.	Yes.  All of those things were said at that time; I had a discussion with those people.  
Q.	Now, in your testimony in this trial, you mentioned none of these people, but, in fact, what you said was that when Sergeant Dusabimana came and said, "We have to start killing Tutsis," and Michel grabbed Rukara, that you were there observing that event and that thereafter, you yourself went to kill.  But in your own confession, when you were trying to convince the Rwandan authorities of your situation, you said that -- you first said you were sick and then you were told it was only to go to start a vehicle, and they threatened you that they would kill you on the spot if you refused.  So, did you go with the other members of the Interahamwe on the 7th of April to Rwankeri area voluntarily, *************************** ************, or did you only go when you were threatened with death, yourself? 
A.	They asked me to come assist them in********************, and they threatened to kill me if I refused.  So let me repeat:  Even if I had been a member of the Interahamwe, I did not voluntarily take part in the killings.  We were ordered to take part in those events.  

Allow me to add that this is not the only document containing my testimony, so if there are some aspects of the testimony that are not in this particular document, you will find them, certainly, in another document because I am certain that I told the whole story.  I have written several times; I have provided explanations to the things that I have written, and I know that you are in possession of several documents.  So I ask you to refer to all those documents because my testimony is not contained entirely in one single document.  
Q.	I assure you we'll be looking at all your documents, at least, all the ones that have been provided to me.  Now, what I want to get from you, though, clearly, ************************************, you've told us that for two -- well over two years, you were engaged in an organisation whose purpose and activities were to hunt down Tutsis and to kill them.  And are you telling us that on the morning of the 7th, when you learned of President Habyarimana's death, that instead of leading the group as you had been in the past, this time you had to be threatened to be killed before you would agree to join in that activity?  
A.	I spoke of various degrees of responsibility, various types of responsibility.  There was the Amahindure Virunga force and the Interahamwe.  Did ever I say that I was a leader in one or the other group, a responsable?  I'm telling you that we fulfilled, executed, the orders given to us by the responsables, the authorities.  

*******************************************************************************, and there wasn't just one responsable, there were several of them.  And I should also like to explain to you that François Dusabimana, Nzirorera's younger brother, was responsible for all the actions, all operations.  He supervised everything, and it was not me.  Consequently, we were acting under the orders of that gentleman and he, in turn, was acting under the orders of the people he was answerable to, his responsable.  
Q.	Did Ndayambaje and Nsengimana threaten to kill you on the spot on the morning of 7th April if you didn't accompany them? 
A.	They told me the following:  If I refused to go and*************************, they would kill me.  "If you refuse to**************************, we will kill you".  That is different -- that doesn't have anything to do with going and killing.  And you often put my -- a question to me to -- "according to your memory," "according to what you know."  If, for one or another question, I don't remember, I don't find the names, well, you'll find it elsewhere.  

I've always mentioned both names on several occasions, before various tribunals, including the present one, and those people were influential.  The father of one was Esdras Baheza, the big trader I told you it was -- influential businessman, who worked closely with Nzirorera in all actions, operations.  
Q.	Continuing on in your confession after speaking of this conversation at the Haguma's restaurant, it continues on:  "We all went together.  When we arrived at Busogo, we found a lot of people there."  And then you go on to describe the events at the Busogo parish.  You don't include -- you have left out a few events that happened in between, though, haven't you?  
A.	There is a reason for that.  There were several things, several conditions, that you have to fulfill.  When you acknowledge an offence, you must be ready to provide proof of the exactitude of what you're saying.  You must have corroborative witnesses.  And as far as I'm concerned, I don't think I omitted anything, and I repeat that it was the beginning of my confession and not the end.  That was just at the beginning of my confession.  
Q.	Well, let's talk about some of the things that you left out, because when you left Haguma's restaurant, you told us you went back to your own residence and retrieved the Kalashnikov weapon; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct, and that is in another statement, but not the one we have before us.  If possible, bring forward all the documents, put before us all the documents, and I'll show you where that element is -- where that item is found. 
Q.	Yes, we're going to do that.  Now, another thing that you left out in the chronology is that after getting your weapon, but before you arrived in Busogo, you went up to the area of Rwankeri where the Tutsi families lived, including the Samvura family; correct? 
A.	I have told you, you should consider the whole body of my testimony.  This document is not the only one containing my confession.  If you take all the documents together, I am sure I can show you where that item appears. 
Q.	In any event, it does not appear in your confession and plea of guilty that you submitted on the 12th of September 2002; correct? 
A.	I have told you that was the beginning of my confession.  And as the law allowed, I could always provide additional information.  It is not a reason to exculpate Nzirorera.  I have told you that you can always provide the Trial Chamber with all the testimony, and you will find in that body all necessary items. 
Q.	Now, another thing that you left out of this document is the fact that when you were in Rwankeri, you took your rifle and you shot and murdered five people; correct? 
A.	I have told you that those items of evidence, which isn't in this document, is -- other additional document.  You must show them all to the Trial Chamber.  In my opinion, you should better put that sort of question to me after you've shown all the documents to the Trial Chamber, then perhaps you'd be in a position to ask me why one item or another does not figure in my testimony.  
Q.	Did you kill five people in Rwankeri before you went to Busogo parish? 
A.	I am accused of having murdered several people.  I'm accused of having killed six people in Rwankeri.  
Q.	And did you kill six people in Rwankeri? 
A.	Three people, rather.  Out of the six of which I was accused of killing, there were only three, but they were all together at the same place. 
Q.	Now, another thing that you left out of your confession was the fact that after killing the Tutsi in Rwankeri, you went up the road to the location where Ingabire and others were living -- and Ingabire is 32 on the spelling list -- and you participated in the killing of more Tutsis at that location before arriving after the Busogo parish; correct? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  And I have never said that I have killed Tutsi where Ingabire lived.  However, I did say that when we killed Ingabire, I was present.  I saw him killed; I was there when he was killed.  That's what I stated.  Consequently, you must understand I committed no crime there.  I'm merely testifying as to that incident of which I was a witness -- which I had witnessed.  
Q.	And the people who did kill Ingabire were part of the Interahamwe, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, returning to what you did talk about in your confession, you describe that "When we arrived at Busogo, we found a lot of people there.  The sound of shooting and grenade explosions at the sister's home was deafening.  They made me enter by the main door."

Now, what you didn't tell the prosecutor in your confession was that you were one of the people shooting and part of the group launching the grenades; correct?  
A.	That is not the truth.  I have never said that I was among the people shooting at the people at Busogo parish, in particular, at the convent.  If you have any proof of that, show it to us.  I never said that at any time, whether here before the Tribunal or before the Rwandan courts. 
Q.	That's correct, Witness, you have never said that, but other witnesses have said that about you.  So let me ask you:  Did you participate at Busogo parish in any shooting or launching of grenades?  
A.	That is the very first time I'm hearing it.  I think it's you that are testifying against me, rather.  I was in that attack but I fired no shot; I lobbed no grenade, I threw no grenade.  But I was present there.  
Q.	And did someone force you to enter by the main door? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And who was it who forced you to do that? 
A.	The people who wanted to take the vehicle, Ndayambaje, Théogène Nsengimana. 
Q.	Now, further on you go on to describe the events at Busogo parish in which you participated, and you indicate that when you arrived at the place where the sister's vehicle was, you saw that it had no battery. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd like to make an objection at this point.  The Court in the past has ruled that this line of questioning was permissible.  Maybe it is, but I'm asking the Court to use its discretion to speed things along and to focus this witness's testimony on matters that are germane for the determination of the evidence in this trial.  

Now, if Mr. Robinson wants to put prior inconsistent statements to the witness, that's one thing, but to read through his confession, paragraph by paragraph, we're going to be here for at least another day if we do it methodically with respect to every document that's in this witness's criminal file.  

The Kajelijeli trial in this Tribunal dealt with this very same incident, and it took over a year to present all of the evidence in relation to that attack to a Trial Chamber in this Tribunal.  How long should we remain with this witness going through statement after statement after statement, and no inconsistency is coming forward?  The witness has admitted his criminal wrongdoing.  If Mr. Robinson has a statement that he would like to put to the witness that is inconsistent with his testimony, that's one thing, but I don't see that happening here now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, we're discussing the very events that were the subject of his direct testimony, the attack at Busogo, the killings on the 7th, and I'm doing it in the context of his confession.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  It's not some collateral issue we're discussing, and so we're making time in the sense that we're discovering -- we're discussing the very events that were the subject of his testimony.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the prior consistent statement of a witness is not usually admissible.  If the only thing you're doing is to get him to rehearse what he has confessed and it is consistent with his testimony here, there's no point in doing it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Absolutely, there's no point in bringing out consistent statements, but the point is, as we're going through this, you're seeing all the inconsistencies and the things that he didn't mention, his own -- and I'd ask the witness to remove his headphones if we're going to continue this discussion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't need to carry on with if for very long but what we -- is beginning to bother us is that it's just a rehearsal, that a large percentage of it was just a rehearsal of consistent statements. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I think most -- a large percentage of this is actually omissions of what the witness did not say and what he's testified to here.  So -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, I would disagree, and in disagreeing I'm relying on the witness's own responses to some of your questions.  What the witness has stated -- and if we can go back a bit, he was asked in his cross-examination to explain the judicial procedures in Rwanda, and he quite clearly stated that the process of making a plea was protracted, that it extended over time, and that he made many statements that collectively constitute his confession or his guilty plea.  And even with respect to this first document, that -- this annex 1, the witness has already stated that there was a second annex dated the same day, the 12th of September 2002, and many of the quo -- many of the assertions, rather, of Mr. Robinson that there were omissions are included in annex 2, which was submitted on the same date, the 12th of September 2002.  And the witness has stated that repeatedly, and the witness has gone beyond annex 2 to other documents that are part of his proceedings in Rwanda.  And almost every question where Mr. Robinson has asserted that there was an omission, the witness has stated that he has made a confession to those facts in other documents.  

So, if we look at the witness's file globally, I think we'd find that it's pretty consistent to everything that he said during his direct examination.  Now, if the Court considers this a useful exercise, I'll sit down and we can go through this for another three or four hours, but after a certain point we really have to wonder what are we trying to achieve.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm going about this methodically.  I'm going to be very fair to the witness.  I'm going to give him all the documents that I have.  He can show us where things are.  But I have the right to put to him items pertaining to his confession which are not complete and which minimise his involvement in order to get the benefits.  So I'm planning on continuing in that way unless I'm directed otherwise. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the other issue that's bothering me is, you see, his confession before the Rwandan authorities is not really evidence before us.  We are concerned with his testimony here.  That's -- you've been spending a lot of time on it, showing that his confession before was incomplete.  Whereas it does have some impact on his credibility, it's more interesting to us to show what's inconsistent with what he has said here.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, for example, Mr. President, you saw that his description of the events involving the so-called phone call from Mr. Nzirorera in his confession didn't include any mention of that telephone call; in fact, that doesn't really come up for approximately nine years.  So I think those are things that affect the credibility of the witness as well as the evidence, the substance of the evidence he's given. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I agree with that example.  If you could focus on examples like that, then there would be no problems.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Well, I'll try to eliminate some of the things that I was going to cover, but I would like to continue to do it in the method that I've been using.  Would you like to take the break now?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-afternoon recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1530H to 1558H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I just wanted to call your attention to one more part of this annex 1 and then we'll move on to annex 2.  In the last paragraph of item number 2, Roman numeral ii on page 3 -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the document can be put back before the witness, Exhibit D. NZ140A.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And directing your attention to page 3, in the paragraph right above the list of eight persons who drove the vehicles, I want to call your attention to that paragraph where you describe the role that you played.  And it's true, is it not, that you indicate that the role you played in the attack against ESTB, the attack against Gahibali's residence and the attack in Musumba, "was to **********Dusabimana, Michel Niyigaba and Jean Damascène Habyarimana***********************************, but I did that to save myself because my mother was being sought as she was Tutsi.  Moreover, Dusabe had already announced that he would kill anyone who did not participate in the expedition."  And is that consistent with how you were presenting your crimes that you had committed to which you were confessing and pleading guilty?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Could I have the question restated, please?  I'm not quite following what exactly is being asked. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	What I have just read to you, is that a fair summary of your position as to the crimes that you committed and those that you were confessing to?  
A.	The paragraph you have just read out is part and parcel of my confession and plea of guilty.  I therefore do not see why you are putting this question to me.  Furthermore, it was not my intention to kill anybody.  I was ordered to kill people.  And apart from the fact that these people were Tutsi, I was aware that they had not committed any offences, they were simply being killed because of their ethnicity.  
Q.	But is it fair to say that in offering your plea and guilty and confession on the 12th of September 2002, what it was that you were confessing to was ****************************************************and you claim that you did that under duress; is that correct? 
A.	Let me repeat my answer.  I was an Interahamwe but that didn't mean that I loved the MRND party.  I have already explained to the Court that whoever did not belong to the MRND party was considered as an enemy of the MRND and an enemy of the country.  So, in the same vein, I was involved in the killings not because I wanted to but because I didn't want to be referred to as the enemy of the country or as a collaborator of the Inkotanyi.  So I have already explained to the Court that I took part in the killings, and that is a truism, but I did not want to participate in those killings.  I never had any intention to kill any Tutsi.  
Q.	But is there anywhere in annex 1 in which you admit to having killed anyone? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll sorry, but I'm going to object again because the point is not what this witness said when he made his confession.  My understanding is that the purpose of this exercise is to dispute this witness's credibility on the basis of -- in relation to his previous testimony in this trial, and that if this statement was inconsistent with that, then that's what Mr. Robinson should be bringing in -- bringing out.  But to constantly go over the statement to point out omissions, when the witness has already clarified that his confession involves much more than this one statement, is really misinforming this process.  So I object again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if you would like a response from me, I would ask that the witness take off his headphones. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, Mr. Robinson, I'll let you ask the question. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	You can put them back on.  So my question to you, Witness BTH, is there anywhere in this annex 1 that you acknowledge that you killed people on the 7th of April?  
A.	I believe that you are a man of law.  When you belong to a group of evildoers or an association of evildoers, or to be involved in a criminal enterprise, yes, I did confess that I was involved in an association which had killed people.  So if I have confessed having been involved in such criminal transactions, it means that I did confess that I had killed people.  So we must look at the testimony in all its components and not focus only on one document.  You may want to look at all the documents comprehensively.  

If you are not in possession of all the documents, then I believe that the government of Rwanda should be able to provide all the documents.  But I do believe that you had told me that you have all those documents.  But if there are any documents that you do not have, please let us know.  
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could be shown document number 12. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, looking at the document that has been placed before you, is that annex 2 to your confession and testimony that you submitted to the prosecutor on the 12th of September 2002? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would offer this document, D. NZ141, A for Kinyarwandan, 141B for French and 141C for English, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  
(Exhibit No. D. NZ141A, D. NZ141B and D. NZ141C admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, it was in this document that you first accused Mr. Nzirorera and others of responsibility for the killings and the preparation of those killings in Rwanda; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was more than eight years after the events themselves, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And is there anywhere in this document that you elaborated on your own conduct in the massacres of April 1994?  
A.	When I wrote this document, I did not have to deal with my behaviour that was covered in annex number 1.  Annex 2 focused on the manner in which the killings began and those who planned the killings, and the manner in which that association of evildoers was set up, and I also talked about the persons who were responsible for the creation of that association.  I therefore referred to Nzirorera and his colleagues in that document.  Furthermore, I went on to talk about the leadership of Amahindure Virunga force and how Nzirorera had provided uniforms and material.  And, by the way, my name is also mentioned in this document with reference to the manner in which we received the weapons and the material.

1615H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Were there any other documents submitted to the Prosecutor in Ruhengeri in connection with your confession or guilty plea on the 12th of September 2002 besides the cover letter, Annex 1 and 
	Annex 2? 
A.	No other document was presented to the Prosecutor on the 12th of September, but other documents were written subsequently. 
Q.	And as you -- I believe you explained -- just to be clear, annex 1 was the confession of your own responsibility and Annex 2 was your testimony about the responsibility of others; is that correct? 
A.	Please could I be given a copy of annex number 1? 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	The issues which I did not raise in annex 1 are mentioned in Annex 2. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the registrar could please give a copy of Exhibit 140A to the witness please, which is in annex 1?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, I put it to you that in this document that was submitted on the 2nd -- on the 12th September 2002, you made no mention whatsoever of your participation in the murders of Tutsis in Rwankeli, for example, the family of Samvura, in which you personally shot your weapon and murdered people.  Am I correct about that? 
A.	Well, please do not put any such questions to me any longer without making available to me all the statements that I have made.  I have told you that if you do not find part of what constitutes my testimony in one document, I am certain that you can find it in another.  So please make available all my previous statements made before the government of Rwanda. 
Q.	We are going to do that.  As of the 12th of September 2000 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, there is something that is bothering me.  The formulation of your question suggests that what he says in this trial is true and what he said in his statement was not true.  What is the point of that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
May the witness be asked to take off his headphones?  

Mr. President, the point is that what this witness has done is minimise to the Rwandan authorities his own involvement, his own personal involvement in these events, in order to benefit himself.  So when it was in his interest to lie and deny his involvement, he did that.  When the law changed and allowed people who were in category 2 to 4 to get a lesser sentence, he then decided to minimise his own involvement in what had happened to get himself into category 2 so he can be released.  And so he presented a false picture of what he had done.  My position is what he said he did on the 7th of April is true.  He killed -- I think he actually killed five people, but he said three.  We will argue about that later.  But my position is that that's the truth and what's false is that he omitted that from his statement as of the 12th of September and presented the information -- a false picture to the Prosecutor in order to get himself released, which he did in January of 2003, just a few months after making the statement.  So that is my point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How does it impact on this trial?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Because it shows that whatever this witness does, he lies in order to serve his own interests.  When it is in his interest to deny the crimes, he denies it.  When it is in his interest to minimise the crimes, he minimises it.  When it is in his interest to accuse Mr. Nzirorera, he accuses Mr. Nzirorera.  And that everything you are hearing is basically -- comes from that perspective and is completely unreliable. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, the Court -- I see you shaking your heads, so I assume that you are satisfied by that response, but I don't find that response particularly satisfying.  The witness was not asked when he made his confession and his plea, if he was told that he had to confess to every single thing that he has ever done wrong in 1994.  That foundation has not been laid.  What I see on this document, although the first page is two crimes, it is still not clear to me whether those two crimes are what he was charged by the prosecutor's office or what he voluntarily suggested to the prosecutor he was guilty of.  That has not been explored by the cross-examination.  

So regardless of what the witness pled guilty to in 2002, it's not necessarily inconsistent with his testimony; it is simply because it doesn't include everything that he did wrong.  Beyond that, 
Mr. Robinson asked the witness to explain the procedures in Rwanda, and the witness started to do that.  In addition to these pleas, and the process of entering a plea, there is also a Gacaca trial; so the volume of this witness's confessions goes far beyond this one document from 2002.  So to suggest to this Court that somehow the inadequacy of this one document means that the witness is not believable is fallacious.  And I think we are going down the wrong track with this cross-examination.  If the issue for this Court is whether this witness's testimony can be believed, if he said something previously that contradicts his testimony, that's one issue, but that's not what we have been doing for the past several hours.

Mr. Robinson has been questioning the validity of his plea as if he has a basis to do so.  There has been no explanation to this Court; no further explanation of what the criminal procedures were in Rwanda in 2002 because that's the standard by which this plea would have to be judged for this Court to make a determination of whether the witness was trying to hoodwink the system or lie and get away with something or not, and none of that has been explored.  So there has been no foundation for that at all. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would suggest that Mr. Webster can explore that in his re-direct examination if he thinks it is important.  

May I continue my questioning?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
No, because I don't think it is important that the whole -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we were not at this stage trying to evaluate the credibility of the witness.  We were considering whether or not to permit the line of questioning, that is.  So what we are doing now is not an evaluated process.  We are going to permit the line of questioning.  Mr. Robinson is aware of what we are thinking of.  I think we are going to permit the line a bit more.  This is cross-examination of a witness who was a fairly important Prosecution witness.  We are going to allow the party to examine a bit more on this line.  

But, Mr. Robinson, you understand the issue that is contained here?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So it is not an indefinite line of -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, after you submitted this confession -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
If the witness could be asked to put his headphones on. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, it is true, is it not, that your confession was accepted by the Prosecutor? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And just two weeks after making this confession, you were visited by investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor on the 24th of September 2002; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And in that interview, you charged Mr. Nzirorera with being responsible for the killings in Mukingo, as you had in your testimony in annex 2, correct? 
A.	Yes.  He and his collaborators are responsible for all the killings that took place in Mukingo region. 
Q.	And then a few weeks later, on the 18th of October 2002, the Prosecutor's investigators at the ICTR came around again to the prison and they asked you about Colonel Ephrem Setako, correct? 
A.	I do not remember the exact date, but I do know that questions were put to me in that connection. 
Q.	And you charged Colonel Setako with involvement in the massacres as well, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you received provisional release from Rwanda prison in January of 2003, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that meant that you had been evaluated by the prosecutor in Ruhengeri and he had determined that you were not among the people who should be in category 1 and, therefore, under the law you were entitled to a provisional release since you had already served a lot of time in prison, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And after your release in March of 2003, you again were interviewed by the Prosecutor for ICTR, this time about Juvénal Kajelijeli, correct? 
A.	I don't remember the exact date but I remember that questions were put to me in that regard.  I know that at the time I was in the solidarity camp. 
Q.	And then on the 24th of April of 2003, you wrote another document that was submitted in connection with your case; is that correct? 
A.	I don't recall the exact date, but I know that I did draft such a document, which was not the only document I drafted, moreover.
MR. ROBINSON:
If the witness could be shown item number 13 in my sets of exhibits. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, do you recognise the document that's been placed before you? 
A.	Yes, I recognise this document. 
Q.	And is this a -- is this part of the documents that you prepared and submitted in connection with your case in Rwanda? 
A.	That is correct, but I think it is incomplete. 
Q.	I have another document I am going to show you that is dated the same day that contains a table of the names of victims and the persons implicated.  Is that what you are referring to? 
A.	Yes, that is what I am talking about, but there isn't just the table of victims. 
Q.	Okay.  We will look at that document in a minute.
MR. ROBINSON:
But just to go over this document, I would like to have this submitted, Mr. President, as D. NZ142, A for the Kinyarwanda and B for the French and C for the English, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry, Counsel, but I see a number D. NZ139 on it -- on my copy.
MR. ROBINSON: 
The exhibit that is being admitted now is K0350185. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is not the number I have.  Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's item 13 in the list of exhibits. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, 13A, B and C.  My number is K02623064 -- 262364.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think in the packet of exhibits there are some documents that have some other numbers in the right-hand side because they were using that in our previous trial.  They were given exhibit numbers in the previous trial.  But in the packet, if you look according to the order from 1 through 29, there should be a number 13, that is the Kinyarwanda document dated the 24th of April 2003.  And if the English booth doesn't have that -- I can't locate that.  Perhaps Mr. Issa could go to the booth and help them find the correct document. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is not seen, but all the rest is different.  Sorry.  Sorry to -- I just wanted to be sure there was no confusion, sorry. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, if the English booth still needs to find the document 13 that we have been referring to, if the registrar could assist them meanwhile, I will ask that -- 

Could be have this document admitted, Mr. President, in our last track if you have already admitted this as 142A, B and C?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't think this has been admitted.  I think I see the -- I think what the interpreter is speaking to is that there is a notation of the exhibit entry into the former trial.  So there are exhibit numbers which were dated in 2004.  So I think that they were probably entered in the last trial.  So that is actually what is causing the confusion.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But this document has not been admitted into this trial as yet. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Okay.  I am asking now that it be admitted as Exhibit D. NZ142A, B and C, under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Submitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ142A, D. NZ142B and D. NZ142C admitted, under seal)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, what was your purpose in submitting this document? 
A.	I have already explained that Rwandan law allows us to -- each time there is new facts or that you find a better way to explain what you were saying before, the testimony I began on the 
	12th of September 2002 never finished -- never ended.  I went on completing it, which is the reason why you have all these documents.  Each time I was explaining things more amply, I produced a new document, and the main purpose of all that was to beg for forgiveness. 
Q.	And this document appears to deal with the events of the 7th and 8th of April; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was there anywhere in this document that you acknowledged that you had killed people by shooting them on the 7th? 
A.	If that item of information is not there, you will find it elsewhere.  You said that I had omitted to speak of the attack against Samvura's family.  I did make it clear that we first threw stones at their house, and I think I have provided all the information in one document or another.  So when we get to the appropriate document, I will show you the information you are looking for.  I have written documents and I have testified orally, and whenever I did, someone took notes and at the end I countersigned.  I signed the PV with my testimony. 
Q.	Just looking at this document, and I am going to read what you talked about with the events in which the killings in Rwankeli on the 7th were concerned.  And I am looking at the paragraph that began with the word "Rukara", which is the third paragraph in the English.  I think it is perhaps the second paragraph in the Kinyarwanda, but after talking about the death of Rukara and his brother Lucien, it goes on to say that "Many people then went up.  When they reached the neighbourhood inhabited in particular by members of the Rudatinya family," and Rudatinya is number 75 on the spelling list, "and of" -- and it is illegible.  "The people who were there fled to the top of the hill.  We threw stones at them because they were defending themselves, shooting with their bows and throwing stones."

Excuse me, Witness BTH.  Are you fatigued?  I notice you are rubbing your eyes.  Are you okay?  
A.	Yes, I am tired.  I am even a bit ill, but I must make an effort to come and testify.  I am actually a bit ill.  If I feel too tired, I will beg the leave of the Trial Chamber, but I will go on although I am ill, yes, actually. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, Witness BTH, for me I always want you to be in the best possible conditions to answer my questions.  So if at any time you feel that you are not in those conditions and you would like us to -- you would like to ask the Trial Chamber to recess early or take a break, please feel free to do that because I don't want any of your answers to be inaccurate.  Do you understand? 
A.	I understand you, Counsel. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we will take advantage of this opportunity and take just a short break. 
Mr. Witness, we will rise for about five minutes and resume. 
(Court recessed from 1639 to 1646H)
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I could just put one housekeeping matter on the record before we proceed.  A little while ago I delivered to Mr. Constant a number of printouts of the Rule 68 material that Mr. Robinson had made -- had used in his cross-examination.  It is ID. NZ20, 21, 22, 23 and 25, and Mr. Robinson is looking for identifying information, ID. NZ24.  When he finds that, I will provide it for the -- to the registry.  And I discussed this with the Defence teams earlier today.  These are three transcripts in relation to 
P. 31.  I would like to have them marked in evidence as P. 31C for the original Kinyarwanda, P. 31D for the French translation and P. 31E for the English translation.  This is with regard to the broadcast on Radio Rwanda concerning the court of appeals attack and I discussed this with all three Defence teams earlier this morning.  So I could give this to the registry.  If Mr. Issa could show this to the Defence teams before it is actually marked. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We admit the documents.  

Mr. Issa, could you just confirm the number for the record?  
MR. MJUI:  
Yes, Your Honour, the number is correct.  It will be entered as directed by the Prosecutor and it is correct.  Thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think that is 31C and D and E. 
(Exhibit No. P. 31C, P. 31D and P. 31E admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, are you able to continue? 
A.	I have no problem.  We can continue for today, I will make an effort. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  So I was going -- I was reading to you from the letter of 24th April 2003, the part after Lucien had been killed when you were describing the events in Rwankeli.  And it said that "Many people then went up.  When they reached the neighbourhood inhabited in particular by members of the Rudatinya family and of" (illegible) ... "the people who were there fled to the top of the hill.  We threw stones at them because they were also defending themselves, shooting with their bows and throwing stones.  Some of us fell back with the run, but those who had grenades, particularly Noel NdayIssaba," and that's ND -- excuse me, that is number 60 on the spelling list.  "François Dusabimana, Bimenyimana," and that is not on the spelling list.  So it is B-I-M-E-N-Y-I-M-A-N-A, "Ndagijimana," N-D-A-G-I-J-I-M-A-N-A, then illegible, "Baheza's two sons, Muwana, M-U-W-A-N-A and Théogene, and the others whose names I don't recall, faced them.  When they started throwing grenades at them, some victims fell and the others ran towards their houses.  When we were on the road soldiers came on board two vehicles and gave fuel to Mwambutsa," number 59 on the spelling list, "to burn the houses.  He immediately started by burning houses thatched with straw.  The soldiers then distributed grenades to ex-soldiers who threw them at the houses where people were hiding.  Many people took part in this attack.  While some were burning houses, others were looting cows and household items and demolishing the houses.  Those who took part in all these activities are listed on the table attached hereto.  However, those who were on the scene did not carry out the killings.  There were many victims of these attacks, but I did not know their names except Suwarisi," S-U-W-A-R-I-S-I, "Bihutu", B-I-H-U-T-U, "and Nyiraburanga, N-Y-I-R-A-B-U-R-A-N-G-A.  In order to kill them, the firearms brought by Musafiri," number 37 on the spelling list, Rwasibutare spelt R-W-A-S-I-B-U-T-A-R-E, "Racheli," that's R-A-C-H-E-L-I, "and Baheza's son, as well as bludgeons, machetes, knives, stones and other weapons were used.  The victims were burnt alive."  

And then you go on to talk about how you came to go to the Busogo parish.  So it is true, is it not, that in that entire description in Rwankeli cellule you made no mention whatsoever of having killed anyone yourself? 
A.	What I am saying is that all those who participated in that operation are listed in the table.  Show me the table.  Do you have it?  And then we can speak of it.  I have told you that this document is not the totality of my testimony.  If you provide me with all my statements, I will show you where all the items are contained.

Furthermore, the perpetrators of the crimes acted in particular circumstances.  They took up positions on the hill and threw stones.  You couldn't fire them because we might be -- we couldn't shoot at them; we might be shooting each other.  So when we threw the grenades some people fell.  Some people sought refuge in their home where they barricaded themselves.  So we tried to make holes to be able to access the inside, and each time one person or another tried to run away, we threw grenade at them.  Some people even killed themselves, committed suicide.  You know, people died in various ways and all that was made clear.  I know all this information is contained in another document.  That is why I am telling you that this does not constitute the totality of my testimony, but as we proceed, you are only giving part of the statement -- of my testimony. 
Q.	Okay.  We are going to come to what I hope would be the entirety of your statement that you made.  So I am going to do this one document at a time.  So looking at the document that is now in front of you, when you go on to talk about the events at Busogo parish, you indicate that Baheza's son -- Baheza's sons made you enter the compound.  And then at the end, in the very second-to-last paragraph, you talk about "In reality, my involvement in these events was not moved by any hatred whatsoever against the Tutsi.  I could not do otherwise, considering that******************************************************* **********, that everybody can bear witness to this.  I acknowledge my criminal participation because I *****************************************************the killers.  I could not do otherwise.  I could not refuse to ********************because my mother was under threat.  I did it without any malice but to save my life and that of my relatives."  

So it is true, is it not, that you are presenting your role in these events as being present at the scene of killings and********************************, correct? 
A.	I should like to address the Trial Chamber and say the following:  I think you have omitted to read something.  I said that I participated in the crimes and I recognise criminal participation.  That was the terminology we used in the trials.  I think the essence of that notion must be explained to -- criminal activity is as a co-perpetrator, but not out of malice, out of evil intention.  It is because of the circumstances.  We were ordered to kill.  Some people even killed their own mothers, killed their own relatives involuntarily, that is the truth.  
I will repeat.  I have nothing against the Tutsis.  The MRND asserted that all Tutsis were accomplices.  I did not agree with that, but I had to comply with orders or I risked being myself accused of being an Inkotanyi accomplice and my mother would be killed.  They told us to beat up anyone who wasn't a member of the MRND.  So if I didn't want that to happen to me, I had to comply. 
Q.	Okay.  Let us look at the table that was referred to in that exhibit.
MR. ROBINSON:
Number 14 can be placed before the witness. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness BTH, directing your attention to the document that has been placed in front of you, is this the table that accompanied your letter of the 24th April 2003? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, we have this only in Kinyarwanda and English, so I would ask the Kinyarwanda be 
Exhibit D. NZ143A and the English D. NZ143B, and I ask that it be admitted under seal. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted under seal.
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ143A and D. NZ143B admitted, under seal) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, Witness BTH, looking at this table, you have listed a total of 10 events in which you divided up by victims and persons implicated; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And those places where you have included yourself as persons implicated are number 3, ************ **************************living in the built-up area as well as their neighbours, and number 9, persons who had sought refuge in the convent of the sisters of the Busogo parish; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  You may continue, you will see other things concerning me. 
Q.	The next thing I see concerning you is the fact that you list yourself as ******************************* ************************number 1 coming from the parish; is that correct? 
A.	I spoke of the people who were killed in Nkuli.  I didn't mention names but my participation.  I did, 
	in fact, participate in the events that occurred there, and the persons, whatever you mentioned, the vehicles and the drivers of the various vehicles. 
Q.	And then turning to the very last page, there is a list of persons who encouraged, aided and ordered killings and gave the list of those to be killed, and you have 16 names listed there; you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	Can you tell us about this list of those to be killed?  Was there such a list? 
A.	Yes, absolutely, lists were drawn up.  I mentioned that lists were drawn up. 
Q.	And can you tell us whether those lists that were drawn up were used by the people who committed the crimes on the 7th and 8th April 1994 in Mukingo? 
A.	It was the authorities who used them.  They knew how to channel the various groups.  They would say go here or go there because you will find so-and-so here or so-and-so there. 
Q.	And they were working from lists; is that correct? 
A.	They had their strategy to organise that.  I know we had been asked to draw up a list of all of the people who collaborated with the Inkotanyi.  So when we had to kill someone we knew, we already knew where they lived, but I think the important thing is not that the lists were drawn up, but the important point is indeed the Tutsi were killed. 
Q.	I understand that, Witness BTH, but I have to say that in all of your statements and testimony in three other trials this is the first that I have seen any reference to there being lists of those to be killed drawn up in Mukingo.  So I am wondering if you could tell me who it was that draw up such a list, whether you ever saw the list yourself, and if not, where you got that information. 
A.	I shall repeat what I have already said.  I think we are backtracking.  Before 1994 we were asked to dig out all the people who collaborated with the Inkotanyi so that we could identify them, and at that time we drew up lists.  They weren't exhaustive.  When we identified someone, we put them on the list and gave the list to Kajelijeli.  That was preliminarily -- but here the list we are referring to is that of people who encouraged others to kill people or give orders in respect of the slaughter -- of the killing and they gave lists of the people to be killed. 
(Pages 50 to 59 by Sithembiso Moyo)









	1715H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Well, did anyone give you a list of people to be killed? 
A.	No, it was we who drew up the lists.  We were asked to go and seek them out and we gave the list to the authorities who could give us lists when we were at the source of those lists -- the source of those lists. 
Q.	And the way you described the killing on the 7th of April, it seems as if you simply went to the area where the Tutsis were sheltered and killed people indiscriminantly rather than trying to target individuals from lists; is that correct? 
A.	Those who gave us orders had their procedures, they knew where they were sending us, they knew what they were doing.  They had their plan in place.  Let me give you an example.  At some time people were killed and then subsequently it was said that so-and-so had not been killed.  Let's take the case of Suarez (phonetic), for example.  It was said that people had been killed, but a specific request was made for his dead body to be sorted from among the others to make sure that that person had been killed.  So, I think that this is exactly what happened, because there was a name on the list; Gasahani's name was on the list and he was killed; Biniga's name was on the list and the same happened to him.  So there are many people who were killed, but other's names were simply on the list.  And the target, clearly, was the Tutsis.  And those who organised this matter knew exactly how they went about it. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Gasahani is number 21 on the spelling list, and Biniga is number 11.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And with respect to those two people, it is true, is it not, that they were killed before 1994? 
A.	Yes.  Even at that time, there were already lists that had been drawn up and the Tutsis were being killed. 
Q.	Now, Witness BTH -- well, can you tell us if there were any other written documents that you submitted or any other interviews that you signed with the Rwandan authorities between the 24th of April, when you submitted this document with the table, that's 24th of April 2003, and the *************2005, when you appeared before Gacaca in Mukingo? 
A.	Yes, when the information was being gathered at the cellule level I was interviewed.  What happens is that you are summoned and questions are put to you, and you are expected to relate or narrate the facts and you then determine whether -- or, you state whether you knew or were aware of this or that fact.  And I think such a document was drawn up following my interview. 
Q.	And did you sign that document? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when? 
A.	In 2003, after the month of May.  We had just left the solidarity camp, so that must have been after May 2003.  The document was prepared in Rwankeri and Busogo cellules.  These are two Gacaca jurisdictions at two different cellules.  So, I was questioned at both Gacaca jurisdictions, and a document was drawn up accordingly. 
Q.	Is that one document or two? 
A.	Two documents:  One for my testimony at Busogo cellule and another in respect of my testimony at Rwankeri cellule.  In 2005, another document was drafted in Manjari, Manjari I and Manjari II. 
Q.	And, again, is that a total of one document or were those two separate documents? 
A.	Each cellule attended to the situation of his victims and, therefore, would also look at the situation of the perpetrators, so those were two different documents. 
Q.	And did you sign those documents? 
A.	Yes, I was supposed to sign them and I did sign them. 
Q.	In other than the four documents that you have spoken of from Rwankeri, Busogo, Manjari I and II cellules, are there any other statements that you have made prior to your appearance in Gacaca in May 2005? 
A.	No other document.  But, the other testimonies were given verbally and I am not aware of any other documents written in respect of my testimonies. 
Q.	And do you, yourself, have copies of any of these four documents from the Gacaca? 
A.	No.  Those documents or PVs are filed, but I don't have any copy.  After judgment has been passed, the judgment is read out to you, but I must say that I am not in possession of any copy.  All what I have entitlement to is the -- a copy of the judgment, but one needs to ask for it in order to be given -- given the judgment. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Witness BTH.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, it is our request -- well, first of all, as you know there was a request by the Trial Chamber to the government of Rwanda which covered all of the statements of this witness, among others.  

The government of Rwanda never responded to that request and, despite the passage of the deadline which was set for this witness which I believe was the 6th of March 2006, and -- there's presently a motion pending for reporting the government of Rwanda to the Security Council for failure to comply with that request.  So, it's going to be -- I've asked, also, that the cross-examination of all those witnesses covered by those orders are suspended until we receive all of the material we're entitled to.  Obviously that hasn't happened, you have not ruled on the motion yet.  But I am going to ask that my -- I reserve our right to recall this witness after those documents are obtained if they're ultimately obtained. I just want to make a note of that, at this point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We obviously cannot rule on that until the documents are obtained. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  And I'd appreciate it if you could rule on the pending motion, that is, trying to obtain the documents.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:  
Q.	Okay.  So now I want to talk to you a little bit about the Gacaca meeting in which you participated on the 11th of May 2005.  You received the sentence of seven years' imprisonment at your trial in Gacaca; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And because you had already served that amount of time, it was not necessary for you to go back to the prison; correct? 
A.	Correct. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And if the witness could be shown item 29 in my series of exhibits.  This is a document entitled "observations des jurisdictions, Gacaca, de province Ruhengeri Mai 2005".  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness BTH, what has been placed in front of you is a document which is in French, and it's observations made at Gacaca proceedings in Ruhengeri in May 2005, by an organisation known as d'Avocats sans frontières, lawyers without borders, from Belgium.  And this is the only document that I have been able to find concerning the Gacaca proceedings in your case.  And I want to, first of all, direct your attention to page 9 -- which actually on the very top says "page 12 of 23" -- and on that page it talks about proceedings on the 11th of May 2005.  This is on page 12 of 23 on the top right-hand side, and then there is a "page 9" also written a little below that.  And it talks about the trial of three accused.  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes, I can see that. 
Q.	And I think what I would like to have you do, and with the permission of the President, given the hour and the somewhat length of this document, is to take that document with you and read it this evening.  And tomorrow morning I will ask you some questions about it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
May that be permitted, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't know what is in the document. 
MR. ROBINSON:
It is a report of the Gacaca proceedings for his case, as well as some other cases that were heard at the same time.  I can easily go through it with the witness -- I was trying to save some 10 or 15 minutes. If there is some problem with that we can -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, you asked us to make a ruling, and I was suffering from a lack of knowledge, that is all.  

Yes, Mr. Witness, did you want to say something?  
THE WITNESS:
I do understand French, but I am not very comfortable with French.  I would like the document to be translated into Kinyarwanda to enable me to fully understand its content. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Mr. President, well, tomorrow, when we resume, I'll have the portions -- I'll ask him oral questions about those portions that I'm interested in and they can be translated into Kinyarwanda. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Just for trial management, about what percentage of your cross-examination do you think you have completed?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think greater than 25 per cent.  So, I think I am well within the estimate that I gave to your Trial Chamber coordinator for the cross-examination --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we can take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, I remind you that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.
