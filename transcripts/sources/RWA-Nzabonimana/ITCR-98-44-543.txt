         3                    

         4     MR. PRESIDENT:

         5                    Trial Chamber III is now in session.  The 

         6                    proceedings are now resumed.  Would you 

         7                    kindly indicate to the witness that he is 

         8                    still on his oath. 

         9                    

        10                    Mr. So'o, can you give us an indication how 

        11                    much longer you are likely to be with this 

        12                    witness? 

        13     MR. SO'O:

        14                    Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you for 

        15                    giving me the floor.  I will try to be as 

        16                    brief and as precise as possible in my 

        17                    questions. 

        18             

        19                    I think if I can finish before midday, that 

        20                    would be practical, useful.

        21     MR. PRESIDENT:

        22                    Well, we hope that you would be relevant, 

        23                    because if you are not then we will have to 

        24                    sort of take control of matters, because 

        25                    this has been dragging on for quite some

         1                    time now. 

         2             

         3                    Yes.  You may proceed with your 

         4                    cross-examination.

         5     MR. SO'O:

         6                    Mr. President, it will always last less than 

         7                    eternity.

         8     MR. PRESIDENT:

         9                    Well we certainly hope so.  I don't think I 

        10                    will be around at eternity. 

        11     MR. SO'O:

        12                    Mr. President, I will be as precise, as 

        13                    concise as possible.

        16     CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. SO'O (Continued)

        17                    

        18     Q.             I would now like to address the injury of 

        19                    the witness and the sequels of that injury.  

        20                    The witness declared that he was a victim of 

        21                    shrapnels from a shell, and that he was 

        22                    wounded on the forehead.  Yes or no -- and 

        23                    that he was wounded at the war front, sorry.

        24     A.             That's correct.

        25     Q.             He also stated that he was injured on his

         1                    head.  Is that correct?

         2     A.             Yes, that's correct.

         3     Q.             He stated to the investigators of the Office 

         4                    of the Prosecutor that he was a victim of 

         5                    paralysis, and I can find the passage where 

         6                    he said that, that is paragraph 4 of the 

         7                    statement that was made to the investigators 

         8                    of the Tribunal.  This is on page three 

         9                    five, paragraph 4:  "In January 1994, I was 

        10                    at home.  Since I had just resigned from the 

        11                    Army, and my wound restricted my movements, 

        12                    I did not leave my home until April." 

        13             

        14                    Can I know where the paralysis was located, 

        15                    Witness?

        16     A.             One of my sides was affected, was bent, but 

        17                    that did not prevent me from walking.  That 

        18                    is the paralysis I was referring to.

        19     Q.             The Defence does not understand clearly, 

        20                    "one side bent or paralysed."  What do you 

        21                    mean?

        22     A.             The word "paralysis" is a French word.  But 

        23                    what I mean to say is that I was limping, I 

        24                    was not walking straight.

        25     Q.             Therefore, you were free to move about?

         1     A.             I could move about without problems, but 

         2                    from the fact that I had the problem of 

         3                    walking straight.  I was limping on one 

         4                    side.

         5     Q.             Are you the person who wrote the statement 

         6                    which is signed, and which is in the 

         7                    possession of the Tribunal?  Are you the 

         8                    person who made that statement which is in 

         9                    the possession of the Tribunal, and which 

        10                    you signed?

        11     A.             It depends.  First of all, I must look at 

        12                    the statement, and there I would be in a 

        13                    position to say whether, yes or no, the 

        14                    statement was made by me.

        15     Q.             You did sign the statement?

        16     A.             Yes.

        17     Q.             You have read it, or it was read to you 

        18                    before you signed it?

        19     A.             Yes.  It was read to me in its entirety, and 

        20                    I appended my signature to it.

        21     Q.             You stated that up to the month of April you 

        22                    did not leave your home because you were 

        23                    paralysed, you were disabled.  Yes or no. 

        24     A.             I made my statement in Kinyarwandan, perhaps 

        25                    it was not well understood.  Saying that I

         1                    did not leave my house, that meant that I 

         2                    did not have work, I did not go to any 

         3                    workplace.

         4     Q.             Very well.  Have you ever used crutches?

         5     A.             I had a crutch which I used at the Kigali 

         6                    Hospital Centre.  I took it with me because 

         7                    it belonged to me, but I did not use it.  It 

         8                    stayed at home.

         9     Q.             Did you bring a crutch to Arusha?

        10     A.             Since the war of 1994, I was healed, I was 

        11                    healthy, and that is why I was able to do 

        12                    what I was asked to do.

        13     Q.             Very well.  The Defence takes notes of these 

        14                    variations and the contradictions, but we 

        15                    will, nevertheless, proceed with our 

        16                    cross-examination. 

        17             

        18                    Now I will be talking about roadblocks.  Did 

        19                    you talk about roadblocks to the prosecutor, 

        20                    to the investigators of the Office of the 

        21                    Prosecutor?  Did you ever talk about 

        22                    roadblocks?

        23     MR. PRESIDENT:

        24                    Mr. So'o, there is no point going over 

        25                    matters that have already been gone over.

         1                    It just becomes repetitious and rather 

         2                    boring, quite frankly.  You know, we just 

         3                    waste time, we waste time when we go over 

         4                    matters.

         5     MR. SO'O:

         6                    Your Honour, I am not at all indulging in 

         7                    any repetition, Mr. President, I'm sorry.  

         8                    To our mind, the questions that we are 

         9                    asking are intended to prove to the Tribunal 

        10                    that the witness is contradicting himself, 

        11                    and I come back to the issue of the 

        12                    credibility of the witness.  What he says 

        13                    before the Prosecutor is not at all what he 

        14                    said before this Court, before your Court.  

        15                    He said he was handicapped or disabled.  Now 

        16                    he says that he was well.  He made 

        17                    statements at the roadblock, and this 

        18                    contradiction was not underscored by my 

        19                    learned colleague.

        20     MR. PRESIDENT:

        21                    Mr. So'o, once you point out the 

        22                    contradiction, then we move on.  We are not 

        23                    taking a slow boat to China and returning, 

        24                    because China has nothing to do with the 

        25                    case.  Credibility is such a nebulous term

         1                    that it is sometimes really abused, you 

         2                    know.  

         3                    

         4                    So let us try and confine ourselves to what 

         5                    is really relevant and move the process 

         6                    forward.  Otherwise, we would be like we are 

         7                    on an exercise bicycle that you have at home 

         8                    that you keep pedalling but you are not 

         9                    getting anywhere.  It doesn't move. 

        10     MR. SO'O:

        11                    Mr. President, you are a judge.  I am a 

        12                    lawyer.  We have two different manners of 

        13                    pedalling the bicycle. 

        14             

        15                    If it is the Defence that defines a 

        16                    question, the Defence knows where it is 

        17                    going with his questions.  If the Court 

        18                    wants to define a mode of questioning, the 

        19                    Court should define that mode of questioning 

        20                    and the Defence will follow.

        21     MR. PRESIDENT:

        22                    Get on with it, please.  Just try to save 

        23                    the repetition and let us deal with issues 

        24                    that are relevant and important.

         1     MR. SO'O:

         2                    I am only asking relevant questions since 

         3                    the beginning of the start.

         4     MR. PRESIDENT:

         5                    Would you please get on with it, just get on 

         6                    with it.  Don't let us waste any more time.  

         7                    Get on with it. 

         8     MR. SO'O:

         9                    Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you once 

        10                    more, Mr. President.  Thank you for your 

        11                    kind attention.

        12     BY MR. SO'O:

        13     Q.             Witness LAJ, you said before the Prosecutor 

        14                    in Paragraph 5, the middle of Paragraph 5,  

        15                    "I realized that roadblocks had been mounted 

        16                    by the Interahamwe."  Is that true or not?  

        17                    "I noticed that Interahamwe had mounted 

        18                    roadblocks in the commercial centre."  Is 

        19                    that true or not?  Did you say that, or you 

        20                    didn't say it?

        21     A.             The roadblocks I am referring to are 

        22                    roadblocks that were mounted on that day 

        23                    across our secteur, and the conseiller 

        24                    entrusted me with the responsibility of 

        25                    manning the roadblock in our centre.  The

         1                    Interahamwe had mounted other roadblocks 

         2                    across our secteur.

         3     Q.             Very well.  So you spoke in the past, you 

         4                    said that you left very early in the morning 

         5                    and that you found that the roadblocks had 

         6                    already been mounted.  But to the Court you 

         7                    said what is different.  Did you not testify 

         8                    that you left your house early, that it is 

         9                    you who mounted the roadblocks, and that you 

        10                    became the leader of the roadblock?  Did you 

        11                    ever say that to the Court?

        12     A.             I was not of the authority in charge of the 

        13                    secteur and I did not say that I was the one 

        14                    who mounted the roadblocks.  The roadblocks 

        15                    I was in charge of, it was mounted by the 

        16                    conseiller of the secteur.

        17     Q.             That is pertinent, because it betrays the 

        18                    contradictions. 

        19             

        20                    Mr. Witness, can you tell me whom you met 

        21                    first?  Is it the bourgmestre, or Munyakazi?

        22     A.             The first person I met going, when I was 

        23                    going to where?

        24     Q.             When you left your house you testified that 

        25                    you received a letter of summons from the

         1                    bourgmestre.  You also testified here before 

         2                    the Court that you received summons from 

         3                    Munyakazi.  I would like to know who of 

         4                    these two persons you met first, and on 

         5                    which date?

         6     A.             The first person who received me was 

         7                    zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

         8     Q.             On what date, Witness?

         9     A.             zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

        10     Q.             And when did the bourgmestre receive you?

        11     A.             On the 15th of April.

        12     Q.             Witness LAJ, can you tell me the weapons 

        13                    that you used throughout the period of the 

        14                    events?

        15     A.             The first weapon I used was a Kalachnikov 

        16                    which I had received from the bourgmestre.

        17     Q.             I am listening to you, Witness.  My question 

        18                    was, the weapons that you use from the 

        19                    beginning of the events until the killings 

        20                    stopped.

        21     A.             So I used a Kalachnikov grenade made in 

        22                    China called, what is made in China, 

        23                    grenades of the M-26 type, and a pistol.

        24     Q.             Are you saying that those were all the 

        25                    weapons you used?

         1     A.             I also used a bayonet.

         2     Q.             Did you ever tell the investigators of the 

         3                    Office of the Prosecutor that you ever used 

         4                    a bayonet?  Yes or no.

         5     A.             I think I did not make that statement 

         6                    because I only answered the questions put to 

         7                    me.  When the question was not put to me I 

         8                    did not answer it.

         9     Q.             Did you ever tell the investigators of the 

        10                    Prosecutor that you used a pistol?

        11     A.             I told him, I must have told him that I used 

        12                    a pistol that was given to me by Bandetse.  

        13                    That was when I was looking for Father 

        14                    Joseph.

        15     Q.             Do you have a statement, do you have in your 

        16                    possession a statement that you signed?

        17     A.             Are you referring to a statement made to the 

        18                    investigators of the Office of the 

        19                    Prosecutor of the ICTR?  I was not given a 

        20                    copy of that statement. 

        21     Q.             I want to remind you that you did not make 

        22                    that statement.

        23                    

        24                    Did you tell the investigators of the

         1                    second lieutenant?

         2     A.             I made that statement later on to a certain 

         3                    zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz(ph).

         4     Q.             Did you tell the investigators of the 

         5                    Prosecutor that you were received by 

         6                    zzzzzzzzzzz
         7     A.             I answered the questions that were put to 

         8                    me.  No question was put to me concerning 

         9                    zzzzzzzzzz

        10     Q.             Therefore, were you asked a question 

        11                    concerning the bourgmestre?

        12     A.             When I talked about the bourgmestre I had 

        13                    been asked a question concerning the person 

        14                    who had given me a weapon, and therefore I 

        15                    started talking about the bourgmestre.

        16     Q.             Witness LAJ, you had the opportunity of 

        17                    meeting many soldiers and of working with 

        18                    many soldiers.  Were those soldiers paid as 

        19                    you?  Were they -- did they offer their 

        20                    services to go and kill the Tutsi against 

        21                    the ward, as you did?

        22     A.             There were two soldiers who had worked with 

        23                    me and who were killed when they went to 

        24                    loot.  They were denounced and they were 

        25                    killed.

         1     Q.             You are not answering my question, Witness.  

         2                    My question is, the soldiers with whom you 

         3                    worked, were they paid as you?  Did they 

         4                    lay, as a condition, that before they went 

         5                    to kill they should be paid or they should 

         6                    be paid for going to kill?  Did they pose 

         7                    that condition, Witness?

         8     MR. PRESIDENT:

         9                    Yes, Mr. Karegyesa?

        10     MR. KAREGYESA:

        11                    I am objecting to that question, My Lords.  

        12                    The witness is testifying about himself, not 

        13                    about whether other soldiers were paid.  

        14                    It's not within his knowledge.

        15     MR. PRESIDENT:

        16                    Well, that's the question he should have 

        17                    been asked first, whether he has any 

        18                    knowledge of the matter.  That's a format 

        19                    the question should have taken at the 

        20                    beginning.  If he had no knowledge, then 

        21                    that would be the end of it.  If he had 

        22                    knowledge, then he would be able to say.  

        23                    

        24                    So if you reframe the question, Mr. So'o.

         1     Q.             Witness, do you acknowledge that you put as 

         2                    a condition to the bourgmestre for the first 

         3                    time, and to Bagambiki, according to your 

         4                    statement, a second time, did you put as 

         5                    conditions to these people that you needed 

         6                    payment in order to go and kill the Tutsi, 

         7                    and to strengthen his request?  Do you also 

         8                    recognize that you presented your papers to 

         9                    show that you were handicapped or disabled?

        10     A.             I did not quite understand the question.

        11     Q.             You had the opportunity of meeting the 

        12                    bourgmestre  --

        13     MR. PRESIDENT:

        14                    One moment, Mr. So'o.  If you break the 

        15                    question up - it's about two or three or 

        16                    four questions in one - if you break it up 

        17                    into individual questions, because he cannot 

        18                    answer four questions in one, because the 

        19                    answer to one part of it might not be the 

        20                    answer to the other.  So if you break it up 

        21                    and go one stage at a time.

        22     BY MR. SO'O:

        23     Q.             Witness, were you ever received by the 

        24                    bourgmestre?

        25     A.             When he summoned me, we had an interview.

         1     Q.             Did you ask him for money by showing him 

         2                    your documents to prove that you were 

         3                    disabled?

         4     A.             It is he who made the proposal of offer of 

         5                    money.  It did not ask him to give me money, 

         6                    because I had not yet accepted to do what he 

         7                    was asking me to do.

         8     Q.             Is that what you declared to the 

         9                    investigators of the Office of the 

        10                    Prosecutor?

        11     A.             Yes.

        12     Q.             I would like to remind you that you 

        13                    declared, I quote: "I demonstrated my 

        14                    refusal to participate in the killing of 

        15                    Tutsi civilians, that as an incentive he 

        16                    promised me a mobylette for going around 

        17                    fuel arms and a sum of 200,000 francs." 

        18             

        19                    Were you received by the préfet Bagambiki?

        20     A.             Yes.  I made that statement. 

        21     Q.             I read to the witness a statement that he 

        22                    made regarding the 200,000 francs promised. 

        23                    

        24                    Did you ask for money from préfet Bagambiki 

        25                    in order to go and kill?

         1     A.             I was nothing before the bourgmestre.  I had 

         2                    no right to ask for money from him.  He 

         3                    promised to give me a bonus or reward once I 

         4                    completed the work, the work I was asked to 

         5                    do.

         6     Q.             I'm talking about Bagambiki.  Did you ask 

         7                    him to give you money in order to go and 

         8                    kill, Witness?

         9     A.             No.  It is he is the one who gave me money.  

        10                    I did not ask.

        11     Q.             You didn't ask him to give you a million 

        12                    francs, Witness? 

        13     A.             After I was given grenades, he promised me a 

        14                    reward of 300,000 francs if I discharged or 

        15                    carried out perfectly the work I was given 

        16                    to do.  So I told him that given that I was 

        17                    working a great deal, and the scope of the 

        18                    work I had to do, that it was necessary for 

        19                    him to give me million francs.

        20     Q.             Very well.  Now, if the bourgmestre had not 

        21                    given you money, would you have gone to kill 

        22                    the Tutsi?

        23     A.             If he didn't give me the motorcycle, the 

        24                    fuel and money, I would not have killed the 

        25                    Tutsi, because we were working together at

         1                    the roadblock, and since President 

         2                    Habyarimana died I had had no problem with 

         3                    the Tutsi.  I never attacked any Tutsi.

         4     Q.             If préfet Bagambiki did not give you money, 

         5                    according to your statement, would you have 

         6                    gone to kill the Tutsi?

         7     A.             If he had not given me money I would have 

         8                    continued to kill the Tutsi, because when I 

         9                    went to see him I had killed some.

        10     Q.             Did you ask for money from the bourgmestre 

        11                    after the event, the balance?

        12     A.             I went to ask for the balance and that was 

        13                    at the time I was going to give the 

        14                    motorcycle back.  But he refused to give me 

        15                    the balance.

        16     Q.             Did you ask for the balance from préfet 

        17                    Bagambiki?

        18     A.             I went and saw him two days after the French 

        19                    arrived, but he refused totally, and said 

        20                    that if I had not killed the Tutsi the Tutsi 

        21                    would have killed me.  So I killed them as 

        22                    in self-defence.

        23     Q.             Taking into account what you have just said, 

        24                    do you define yourself as a hired killer, or 

        25                    as somebody who was involved in genocide?

         1     A.             I place myself in the category of people who 

         2                    killed the Tutsi following orders that they 

         3                    received.

         4     Q.             You killed many of them, didn't you?

         5     A.             That's correct.

         6     Q.             I am asking the question: You had a diary.  

         7                    Why did you have a diary?  Why does the 

         8                    number of people you killed declared to the 

         9                    Prosecutor different from the number you 

        10                    stated to the Court?

        11                    

        12                    My questions were related to the place of 

        13                    the events.  You had a diary since February 

        14                    1994.  The facts that you recounted to the 

        15                    Prosecutor are not the same facts that you 

        16                    stated to the Court.  Why?

        17     MR. PRESIDENT:

        18                    Mr. So'o, you need to identify what is it 

        19                    you are saying is different, rather than 

        20                    just make a general statement, if that is 

        21                    the question you wish to put to the witness.

        22     MR. SO'O:

        23                    Mr. President, I first found out if he knew 

        24                    that.

         1                    All I'm saying to you, if you are saying 

         2                    there is a difference between what he made 

         3                    in his statement and what he said to the 

         4                    Court, you should point it out specifically 

         5                    to him, rather than simply make a general 

         6                    statement.  So if you follow that direction.

         7     MR. SO'O:

         8                    That is what I am doing, Mr. President.

         9     BY MR. SO'O:

        10     Q.             You actually stated before the Prosecutor 

        11                    that you first killed two persons.  Is that 

        12                    correct?

        13     A.             I said that I killed two persons within the 

        14                    context of a question which was addressed to 

        15                    me.  When I was asked what I did with the 

        16                    firearm that the bourgmestre gave me, I 

        17                    answered that I used it to kill two persons 

        18                    in the bourgmestre's cellule.  But I killed 

        19                    a third person using a knife.

        20     Q.             That you did not say to the Prosecutor.

        21     A.             The way we went ahead with the confessions 

        22                    in Rwanda, we said everything.  We did not 

        23                    hide anything.  But when I was answering the 

        24                    questions, I only answered questions that 

        25                    were asked me; in particular, the number of

         1                    persons that I had killed with the firearm.  

         2                    I said two people.  Now I am adding the 

         3                    third person, because I am being asked to 

         4                    say everything that happened.

         5     Q.             You also stated to the Prosecutor that you 

         6                    threw two grenades in the Mibilizi parish.  

         7                    Is that true?

         8     A.             That is correct.

         9     Q.             Now, after that did you look for the priest, 

        10                    for the father, to eliminate him?

        11     A.             That is correct.  I went and looked for him, 

        12                    and it is Bandetse.  I will spell Bandetse: 

        13                    B-A-N-D-E-T-S-E.  It is Bandetse who had 

        14                    asked me to do that and I went right to the 

        15                    living quarters of the nuns to look for him.  

        16                    I did not find him.  

        17                    

        18                    I remember that there was another priest who 

        19                    was an old guy, and he said that, "My child 

        20                    is not there."  I'm telling you the truth.  

        21                    If he were there I would tell you, and when 

        22                    I noted that he wasn't there, I left.

        23     Q.             After that, in front of the Prosecutor, you 

        24                    stated, without specifying, that you 

        25                    participated in the elimination of refugees

         1                    in the Mibilizi hospital.  Did you state 

         2                    that, without any other specifications?

         3     A.             That is correct.  It is true that I did not 

         4                    add any details, but it is because I was not 

         5                    asked to add any.

         6     Q.             Now, here before the Court do you recognize 

         7                    that on the 15th of April 1994, you killed 

         8                    three persons, two of them using a firearm, 

         9                    and a second-grade student with a bayonet?

        10     A.             On that very day, on that date, I did not 

        11                    kill only three people.  I think I killed 

        12                    nine.  The three people I killed in the 

        13                    bourgmestre's cellule, but when I returned 

        14                    to my own cellule of origin I killed six 

        15                    more people.

        16     Q.             Let me remind you, you stated before this 

        17                    hearing and this Court that the three 

        18                    persons you killed were from a list drawn up 

        19                    by Ngendahimana at the bourgmestre.  Those 

        20                    three people were people whose names 

        21                    appeared in that list.  

        22                    

        23                    The six other people, you took them from the 

        24                    bourgmestre that you killed and you allowed 

        25                    the others to kill the other people because

         1                    they, too, had to kill the Tutsi.  Do you 

         2                    now recognize, after these clarifications, 

         3                    that you stated that you were the leader of 

         4                    the roadblock?

         5     A.             Yes.  That is what I said.  I said that I 

         6                    was the head of the roadblock, because I was 

         7                    answering a question that was asked me.

         8     Q.             Do you recognize that you stated before this 

         9                    Court on the 23rd of October in the year 

        10                    2000, that you were at the roadblock and 

        11                    that you killed all the people who were 

        12                    brought to you on the 16th of April 1994.  

        13                    You made that statement on the 23rd of 

        14                    October in the year 2000, that you were on 

        15                    the roadblock on the 16th of April 1994, and 

        16                    that you killed all the people who were 

        17                    brought to you?

        18     A.             It is not only on that date that I killed 

        19                    people who were brought to me.  I was all 

        20                    the time at the roadblock for two days and 

        21                    two nights where I was drinking beer, and 

        22                    all the Tutsis that were brought to me, I 

        23                    killed them.

        24     Q.             Were you killing them normally, or in a 

        25                    state of drunkenness?

         1     A.             I was following specific orders.  If I were 

         2                    given a firearm it was not to keep it, it 

         3                    was to use it, and I used it.  It is true 

         4                    that often I drank, but it did not stop me 

         5                    from pulling the trigger.

         6     Q.             Do you recognize that you stated that the 

         7                    bourgmestre, on the 17th of April 1994, 

         8                    invited you to go to Mibilizi and join the 

         9                    others?

        10     MR. PRESIDENT:

        11                    Mr. So'o, you are simply taking him through 

        12                    the evidence he gave originally.  What 

        13                    purpose -- all we are doing is having a 

        14                    repetition of the evidence that he gave 

        15                    originally.  

        16                    

        17                    I don't think that is the purpose of 

        18                    cross-examination, to go over the evidence 

        19                    that the witness gave in-chief.  The purpose 

        20                    of cross-examination is to test the 

        21                    credibility and to put forward a different 

        22                    point of view, not just to take him through 

        23                    what he said originally.  So maybe if we can 

        24                    get on to some effective way of dealing with 

        25                    this matter, then we might be able to get

         1                    somewhere. 

         2     MR. SO'O:

         3                    Mr. President, it is you who asked me to 

         4                    show the contradiction between the 

         5                    statements he made to the Prosecutor and the 

         6                    statements he made here.  I am proving to 

         7                    you that what he declared to the Prosecutor 

         8                    is totally different from what he stated 

         9                    here, that the number of dead people could 

        10                    be multiplied by one million in relation to 

        11                    what he stated to the Prosecutor, and that 

        12                    every day he says something different.  

        13                    

        14                    A fact is a fact.  He has a diary.  So we 

        15                    should see the same facts.  A fact should 

        16                    not change.  I am proving, therefore, that 

        17                    what he said to the Prosecutor is not the 

        18                    same thing that he said here, and I'm taking 

        19                    successive dates.  The people he killed, 

        20                    what he stated here is not the same thing.  

        21                    That is what the Court asked me to do, and 

        22                    that is what I am doing.  So I am surprised 

        23                    that the same Court is asking me to do some 

        24                    other thing.

         1                    Mr. So'o, we know that this witness killed a 

         2                    lot of people.  That is not in doubt.  He 

         3                    has admitted it.  I don't think we have to 

         4                    quibble about the numbers that he killed.  

         5                    If he killed one person, it was too many.  

         6                    And he is not the one who is here on trial.  

         7                    He is going to be tried somewhere else for 

         8                    the people he killed.  So we don't have to 

         9                    concentrate entirely on how many people he 

        10                    killed.  We can move on.

        11     MR. SO'O:

        12                    We are moving on, Mr. President.  It is 

        13                    perhaps the Court that does not understand 

        14                    that this witness lies from the beginning to 

        15                    the end.  The Defence is proving to you that 

        16                    this witness is a liar from the beginning to 

        17                    the end.  The same facts, he is recounting 

        18                    them in different ways.  And that is the 

        19                    direction in which the cross-examination is 

        20                    going on.  I would like to ask the last 

        21                    questions.

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    You are overlooking the fact that he has 

        24                    given explanations as to why there is a 

        25                    difference.  You seem to totally ignore that

         1                    and just going on.  You know, let us get on 

         2                    with it.  We are not making any progress. 

         3     BY MR. SO'O:

         4     Q.             Witness LAJ, are you sure that the refugees 

         5                    in Mibilizi were attacked on the 19th of 

         6                    April, 1994?

         7     A.             The attack that was launched by myself, by 

         8                    the way, took place on the 18th at the 

         9                    parish.  If at one point or another give the 

        10                    date of 19th, I might perhaps have been 

        11                    mistaken, because you would realize that six 

        12                    years in prison is a long time.  I could 

        13                    make a mistake, but the events took place on 

        14                    the 18th.

        15     Q.             There you go.  Is the same thing.  He told 

        16                    the investigators, 19th; the Court, he said 

        17                    19th; today, is the 18th.  What do you 

        18                    think?  

        19                    

        20                    Another witness stated here, Witness, that 

        21                    the 19th was --

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    Mr. So'o, he is not concerned about any 

        24                    other witness.  And do not put to him 

        25                    anything about any other witness.  Deal with

         1                    his evidence. What another witness says are 

         2                    matters for later on when the Tribunal 

         3                    itself comes to assess the evidence.  But he 

         4                    is not responsible for what any another 

         5                    witness say.  So let us move on. 

         6     MR. SO'O:

         7                    Mr. President, the Defence insists on 

         8                    showing the contradictions the witness is 

         9                    making, and that is the role of the Defence.  

        10                    I'm going to ask the last questions. 

        11     BY MR. SO'O:

        12     Q.             Witness LAJ, you were shown pictures of 

        13                    Mibilizi.  You recognized only one picture.  

        14                    Could you tell me why you operated in 

        15                    Mibilizi and you could not recognize 

        16                    pictures of Mibilizi?

        17     MR. KAREGYESA:

        18                    I object, Your Honour.  Witness was shown 

        19                    three photos -- in fact, four: Exhibits 14, 

        20                    15, 16 and 17, and he identified them all.

        21     MR. PRESIDENT:

        22                    Your statement that he was shown one and 

        23                    identified one, is not correct.  I think you 

        24                    will concede that.

         1                    If the Prosecutor stopped the projection, it 

         2                    is because he realized that the witness did 

         3                    not recognize anything.  I will remind you 

         4                    and the records will show.  I have a last 

         5                    question. 

         6             

         7                    The records will reflect what I said that 

         8                    the Prosecutor stopped the projection 

         9                    because he realized that the witness did not 

        10                    recognize any pictures.  The records will 

        11                    show. 

        12     MR. PRESIDENT:

        13                    That is not a correct statement, and you 

        14                    know it, and you should not put the 

        15                    situation in a misleading manner.  14, 15, 

        16                    16 and 17 exhibits, that's the exhibit 

        17                    number, Exhibit 14, 15, 16 and 17, were 

        18                    shown to the witness, and the witness 

        19                    indicated that he recognized those places, 

        20                    and what you are saying is not true, and you 

        21                    should be man enough to admit that you have 

        22                    made an error. 

        23     BY MR. SO'O:

        24                    Mr. President, I don't know which side is 

        25                    making a mistake.  The records will show.

         1                    Let me ask a second-to-the-last question. 

         2             

         3     Q.             Witness LAJ, do you think that your job was 

         4                    facilitated because you stated that you were 

         5                    Hutu?

         6     A.             Thank you for asking me that question.  I 

         7                    would like to clarify that everybody who 

         8                    killed has to answer to that crime, because 

         9                    there were Tutsis who killed other Tutsis.  

        10                    Is not only Hutus who killed Tutsis.  There 

        11                    were Tutsis who were members of the MRND who 

        12                    were Interahamwe and who killed their Tutsi 

        13                    brothers.  They ran away, they ran away with 

        14                    the government.  But those who stayed in the 

        15                    country who are Tutsis who killed their 

        16                    Tutsi brothers were arrested, and they are 

        17                    also being prosecuted.

        18     Q.             One last question, the last one.  Witness 

        19                    LAJ, if you were asked to prove that you 

        20                    were Hutu, how would you do that?

        21     A.             Once again, thank you for asking me that 

        22                    question.  Now, to make a difference between 

        23                    the ethnic groups in Rwanda it was 

        24                    different.  A Hutu had an identity card 

        25                    issued by the commune in which it was

         1                    marked, it was marked that he was Hutu, and 

         2                    Tutsis had identity cards where it was 

         3                    indicated that they were Tutsis.  That was 

         4                    what established the difference between the 

         5                    two ethnic groups.

         6     Q.             That suggests another question.  There are 

         7                    three people that you killed.  You 

         8                    recognized that you killed two people 

         9                    because they had two national identity cards 

        10                    - one Hutu, one Tutsi.  Did you state that, 

        11                    or not?

        12     A.             That is correct.  I stated that.

        13     Q.             I will not ask you if you have two identity 

        14                    cards. 

        15             

        16                    Mr. President, that will be it.

        17     MR. PRESIDENT:

        18                    Thank you, Mr. So'o.  I am glad to know we 

        19                    have arrived at eternity. 

        20             

        21                    Before I call on Mr. Benoît, I have been 

        22                    informed that one of the issues which you 

        23                    raised with us has been settled partly, and 

        24                    that you have now been assigned as lead 

        25                    counsel.  Is that correct?

         1     MR. HENRY:

         2                    Yes, indeed, Mr. President, although I have 

         3                    not been officially informed in writing, 

         4                    indeed the answer was given to me by the 

         5                    person in charge of the Lawyers and 

         6                    Detention Facilities Management Section.  So 

         7                    I am waiting for the formalities to be 

         8                    completed, and I wish to assure you that we 

         9                    are going to submit our application to have 

        10                    a second counsel within the team as soon as 

        11                    possible.  We will even try to do so between 

        12                    now and Friday of this week.

        13     MR. PRESIDENT:

        14                    Very well. 

        15     MR. HENRY:

        16                    I would like to take to this opportunity to 

        17                    tell you, Mr. President, that your 

        18                    intervention was more useful than any 

        19                    intervention we had since the 18th of 

        20                    September.

        21     MR. PRESIDENT:

        22                    We are here to help as best we can. 

        23     MR. HENRY:

         1                    (Court recessed between 1103H and 1126H)

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3                    The sitting is resumed.  The Prosecution 

         4                    will continue.  Oh, yes, Mr. Lurquin?

         5     MR. LURQUIN:

         6                    A short motion, Mr. President.  If the 

         7                    procedure should proceed to the 

         8                    identification of the witness (sic), to 

         9                    avoid the problems we should not put on the 

        10                    video of the witness when they are talking 

        11                    about an accused.  We should film it and 

        12                    after the identification -- and we go to the 

        13                    testimony there could be problems.  So could 

        14                    we not stop the video of the witness and use 

        15                    it only for problems of identification if 

        16                    that creates a problem.  It would solve also 

        17                    what happened yesterday during the 

        18                    identification procedure. 

        19     MR. PRESIDENT:

        20                    I don't quite follow.  Can you explain to me 

        21                    again?  I had made an indication that they 

        22                    should not do what they did.  Is there 

        23                    something wrong with that?  I'm not quite 

        24                    clear what you're asking me.

         1     MR. LURQUIN:

         2                    It's not an objection; it's to strengthen 

         3                    what you said, but the problem is that 

         4                    there's a video that the witness is seeing.  

         5                    Instead of asking the cameraman not to film 

         6                    the accused, we should stop the screen of 

         7                    the witness so that the witness can only 

         8                    identify the pictures that he has to 

         9                    identify.  What he is saying is that during 

        10                    the proceedings they should cut off the 

        11                    screen of the witness, so the witness can 

        12                    not see it unless he has pictures to 

        13                    identify and then we show him the pictures 

        14                    on the screen. 

        15     MR. PRESIDENT:

        16                    Yes, we entirely agree with you.  We 

        17                    entirely agree with you.  While pictures are 

        18                    being shown to the witness, pictures should 

        19                    not be shown to him, which includes the 

        20                    photograph of any of the accused, and, worse 

        21                    yet, when he's identifying, it should never 

        22                    come on the screen at all.  Yes, I'm sure 

        23                    the Prosecution understands that. 

        24     MR. LURQUIN:

        25                    And also we are asking that the screen of

          NTAGERURA ET AL                                  25 OCTOBER 2000




         1                    the witness should not show anything, 

         2                    because during the audience when you're 

         3                    talking about Imanishimwe or Bagambiki the 

         4                    cameraman has the habit of focusing on that 

         5                    person and the witness sees the portrait of 

         6                    that person, because after that 

         7                    identification it is a problem because 

         8                    throughout their testimony each time they 

         9                    talk about the accused the picture is shown.  

        10                    So what we are proposing is that before the 

        11                    identification of pictures they should 

        12                    absolutely put off the screen of the 

        13                    witness.

        14     MR. PRESIDENT:

        15                    Yes, I will have to find out from the 

        16                    technical people.  What you're really asking 

        17                    is keep the screen of the witness blank, 

        18                    unless, of course, the witness is pointing 

        19                    out some particular place. 

        20     MR. LURQUIN:

        21                    Voila, Mr. President. 

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    Is that clear, Mr. Prosecutor?

        24     MS. MAKWAIA:

        25                    Yes, Mr. President, it is clear.

         1     MR. PRESIDENT:

         2                    I understand.  It's really not a technical 

         3                    problem.  All they have to do is turn it off 

         4                    from there.  They can turn off the witness's 

         5                    screen and only bring it on when it's 

         6                    appropriate.  Very well.  I think that is 

         7                    understood by the Prosecutor.

         8     MS. MAKWAIA:

         9                    Yes, Mr. President, it is very clear. 

        10     MR. PRESIDENT:

        11                    Very well.  So ordered. 

        12     MR. LURQUIN:

        13                    I thank you, Mr. President. 

        14     MR. PRESIDENT:

        15                    Yes, would the Prosecutor proceed.

        16     MS. MAKWAIA:

        17                    Good morning, Mr. President.  The next 

        18                    Prosecution witness is LB1 (sic).  Can the 

        19                    Registry please summon her?

        20     MR. PRESIDENT:

        21                    I should just formally indicate that we are 

        22                    now back in open session, so can you pull 

        23                    back the screens -- oh, after the Witness 

        24                    comes in.  I just want to indicate that we 

        25                    are going back into open session.

         1                    Swear the witness, please. 

         2     THE WITNESS: 

         3                    I solemnly declare that I will speak the 

         4                    truth, the whole truth and nothing but the 

         5                    truth.

         9                    

        10     After first having been duly sworn, testified as follows:

        11                    

        12     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

        13     Q.             Good morning, Witness.  Could you tell this 

        14                    Court what your ethnic group is, please? 

        15     A.             I am a Tutsi. 

        16     Q.             Where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 

        17     A.             I was in Cyangugu, in Kagano Commune -- 

        18                    K-A-G-A-N-O, Kagano Commune.

        19     Q.             Do you recall hearing of the President's 

        20                    death in subsequent days? 

        21     A.             I remember. 

        22     Q.             And when did you hear of this?

        23     A.             I learnt of that on the morning of the 

        24                    7th of April at 6 a.m.

        25     Q.             And how did you hear of this, or from whom

         1                    did you hear it? 

         2     A.             It is my mother who told me after hearing it 

         3                    on the radio. 

         4     Q.             So when you heard this news, what did you do 

         5                    in the next two to three days? 

         6     A.             In the three days that followed, the 

         7                    situation deteriorated and we escaped to the 

         8                    parish. 

         9     Q.             Now before we get to the parish, how did the 

        10                    situation deteriorate in your area? 

        11     A.             We had already seen, where we were living, 

        12                    that Tutsi houses were being put to the 

        13                    torch and everybody was saying, everybody 

        14                    who was going along the road told us stories 

        15                    of killings.  We also heard on the radio 

        16                    that the Prime Minister Agathe had been 

        17                    killed and N-D-A-S-I-N-G-W-A, as well as 

        18                    Ndasingwa, and that the Kigali church -- I 

        19                    beg your pardon -- had been burnt down.  So 

        20                    after we learned of that, we decided to 

        21                    escape. 

        22     Q.             Was your own house burnt down as well, your 

        23                    parents' house? 

        24     A.             No. 

        25     Q.             Was anything looted from your own house?

         1     A.             That happened, but after our departure. 

         2     Q.             So then, you were telling us you fled to the 

         3                    parish, which parish is this? 

         4     A.             We went to Nyamasheke -- 

         5                    N-Y-A-M-A-S-H-E-K-E, Nyamasheke. 

         6     Q.             And why did you choose to go to Nyamasheke 

         7                    parish? 

         8     A.             We thought that it was impossible to attack 

         9                    somebody who sought refuge within the church 

        10                    and kill the person.

        11     Q.             And how many of you from your family went to 

        12                    Nyamasheke parish? 

        13     A.             We were a total of nine people in my direct 

        14                    family.  My brothers and sisters and myself 

        15                    were eight and then my mother, and we were 

        16                    with a few relatives, close relatives. 

        17     Q.             Now when you arrived at the parish, who 

        18                    received you? 

        19     A.             We found people who were recording the 

        20                    arrivals of people, who were at the entrance 

        21                    of the parish.

        22     Q.             Could you describe to the Court exactly what 

        23                    happened when you arrived on this day?

        24     A.             First we started off and on the way we were 

        25                    carried by a commune vehicle.  When we got

         1                    to the parish we found gendarmes who were 

         2                    guarding the parish and a little further, at 

         3                    the entrance to the parish, were people who 

         4                    were recording those who were coming in.  

         5                    They took note of the families and everybody 

         6                    who was coming into the parish. 

         7     Q.             Were there other people that you found at 

         8                    the parish when you arrived? 

         9     A.             When we arrived at the parish we found other 

        10                    families.  We were not the first family to 

        11                    get there; we were not the last either.  We 

        12                    were somewhere in the middle and at the 

        13                    entrance we were asked to leave all our 

        14                    property outside. 

        15     Q.             And why were these other people at the 

        16                    parish; did you find out? 

        17     A.             They had escaped also because the situation 

        18                    had deteriorated. 

        19     Q.             And do you know which ethnic group they 

        20                    belonged to? 

        21     A.             Yes.  They were Tutsi. 

        22     Q.             Now, did you also find out why you had to be 

        23                    registered as you entered the parish? 

        24     A.             No, I do not know why.  All I learnt was 

        25                    that the préfet had ordered that everybody

         1                    who came there had to be registered or put 

         2                    on the record. 

         3     Q.             Which préfet is this that you're talking 

         4                    about? 

         5     A.             Emmanuel Bagambiki. 

         6     Q.             So, what happened to you and your family on 

         7                    this day at the parish? 

         8     A.             We got into the premises of the parish, but 

         9                    since there were numerous people, it was not 

        10                    possible to find a place to shelter us, so 

        11                    some people were around the buildings and 

        12                    the courtyard behind the parish. 

        13     Q.             So, did you spend the night at the parish? 

        14     A.             Yes. 

        15     Q.             Can you tell me which date this was? 

        16     A.             That was on the 10th. 

        17     Q.             What happened on the 11th?

        18     A.             On the 11th we spent the entire day on the 

        19                    spot.  Nothing extraordinary happened, apart 

        20                    from the fact that the refugees came 

        21                    streaming in.

        22     Q.             And did anything happen on the 12th of April 

        23                    1994 at the parish? 

        24     A.             As from the 12th there were attacks, but 

        25                    attacks which did not result in too many

         1                    deaths because the attackers were throwing 

         2                    stones at us.  We were trying to defend 

         3                    ourselves by throwing stones back at them 

         4                    and there were no deaths.

         5     Q.             And who was attacking you?

         6     A.             Hutus who came singing. 

         7     Q.             What were they singing? 

         8     A.             They were singing, "Let's exterminate them, 

         9                    let's exterminate them".

        10     Q.             What did you understand this to mean, "Let's 

        11                    exterminate them"?  Who was to be 

        12                    exterminated?

        13     A.             I understood that they were talking of 

        14                    Tutsis, because the Tutsis were being 

        15                    attacked. 

        16     Q.             Witness, did any of your relatives arrive on 

        17                    this day from elsewhere? 

        18     A.             Refugees kept coming in in their numbers, 

        19                    and amongst them I had relatives of my 

        20                    grandfather's who came from the 

        21                    sous-préfet's office.  They came from the 

        22                    sous-préfet's residence, from his home. 

        23     Q.             Why did they also leave that place, why did 

        24                    they leave the sous-préfet's residence to 

        25                    come to the parish; did they tell you?

         1     A.             The sous-préfet who had provided them 

         2                    shelter said that he could no longer protect 

         3                    them.  They went there because the 

         4                    sous-préfet was a friend of the family.  He 

         5                    advised them to run away and join the other 

         6                    Tutsi.  These people were the wife of my 

         7                    grandfather and the grandsons. 

         8     Q.             Okay, so what happened on the next day at 

         9                    the parish? 

        10     A.             There is a step that we missed.  I would 

        11                    like to clarify that at the time they left 

        12                    the sous-préfet's residence the 

        13                    sous-préfet's office had been burnt down and 

        14                    one of the children of my grandfather was 

        15                    burnt and he died in that incident, along 

        16                    with his wife and their children and his 

        17                    child. 

        18     Q.             So we get this clear, where exactly were 

        19                    they burnt down? 

        20     A.             The sous-préfet's office was attacked 

        21                    because there were refugees there.  Those 

        22                    who sought refuge there were killed and the 

        23                    building burnt down.  At that time the 

        24                    mother of the child was at the sous-préfet's 

        25                    residence.

         1     Q.             What's the name of the sous-préfet? 

         2     A.             The sous-préfet's name was Gérard 

         3                    Terebura -- I'll spell Terebura, 

         4                    T-E-R-E-B-U-R-A, Terebura. 

         5     Q.             What happened to the people at the parish on 

         6                    the 13th of April 1994? 

         7     A.             On that day we saw attackers appear.  It was 

         8                    around 10 a.m.  When they launched the 

         9                    attack, we tried to defend ourselves because 

        10                    amongst us there were young people who would 

        11                    not allow them themselves to be killed 

        12                    without any effort.  So the women and the 

        13                    children went to look for stones and handed 

        14                    them to the young people, who threw them at 

        15                    the attackers.  The fighting continued and 

        16                    when the gendarmes noticed that things were 

        17                    getting serious they shot at the attackers 

        18                    and killed three of them. 

        19                    

        20                    After the death of the three people the 

        21                    attack came to an end.  The attackers left, 

        22                    and it was in the afternoon of that day that 

        23                    a meeting was held at the parish. 

        24     Q.             Okay, before we get to the meeting, I just 

        25                    want to ask you a few questions.  Who was

         1                    attacking you on this day?  What was the 

         2                    composition of the attackers? 

         3     A.             We were being attacked by Hutus, people that 

         4                    we knew, people who were our neighbours with 

         5                    whom we had been living up till that point. 

         6     Q.             What type of weapons were they attacking you 

         7                    with? 

         8     A.             They had weapons -- machetes, spears, clubs, 

         9                    firearms and grenades.  They also had 

        10                    bayonets.

        11     Q.             Were there policemen among the attackers? 

        12     A.             Amongst them there were policemen from the 

        13                    Kagano Commune.

        14     Q.             And was the bourgmestre of Kagano there? 

        15     A.             The attackers were numerous and it was 

        16                    difficult to recognise each and every one of 

        17                    them, except those who were in uniform.  It 

        18                    is only later that we learnt that the 

        19                    bourgmestre was there as well as his elder 

        20                    brother, who in the past had also been a 

        21                    bourgmestre. 

        22     Q.             Okay, could you go on?  You were telling us 

        23                    about a meeting that took place after the 

        24                    attack.  Can you tell us what happened?

        25     A.             Yes, around 2 p.m. we saw the préfet of

         1                    Cyangugu arrive in the company of Bishop 

         2                    Ntihinyurwa -- I will spell that, 

         3                    N-T-I-H-I-N-Y-U-R-W-A.  Also with the 

         4                    sous-préfet, who was called Sewabeza --  

         5                    S-E-W-A-B-E-Z-A -- with also the sous-préfet 

         6                    of Rewesero -- I will spell Rewesero, 

         7                    R-E-W-E-S-E-R-O -- who was called Gérard 

         8                    Terebura -- I will spell, T-E-R-E-B-U-R-A.  

         9                    Also along with the bourgmestre of Kagano, 

        10                    who was called Kamana, Aloise -- Kamana is 

        11                    spelled, K-A-M-A-N-A -- the older brother of 

        12                    Aloise, who had been a bourgmestre in the 

        13                    past and who was called Antoine Hitimana -- 

        14                    H-I-T-I-M-A-N-A.  Also there was a 

        15                    commander, and we were not able to tell if 

        16                    he was of the gendarmerie or the army, and 

        17                    all of them had their close bodyguards. 

        18     Q.             So then, what happened? 

        19     A.             Thereafter the préfet asked the refugees to 

        20                    consult one another and to set up a small 

        21                    team of representatives.  Each secteur had 

        22                    to choose just one person.  But before that 

        23                    there were searches in homes, the homes of 

        24                    the priests, because it was said that it was 

        25                    one of the priests, called Ubald, who

         1                    allegedly was responsible for the death of 

         2                    the three persons whom I said were shot by 

         3                    the gendarmes. 

         4     Q.             So when you selected representatives from 

         5                    within your secteurs, what happened next? 

         6     A.             Yes, after choosing the representatives a 

         7                    meeting was held between the latter and the 

         8                    préfet, as well as a delegation accompanying 

         9                    him.  But I forgot a detail and that is that 

        10                    he also came with the conseiller. 

        11     Q.             What is the name of the conseiller?

        12     A.             He was accompanied inter alia by conseillers 

        13                    from the Nyamasheke Secteur, who was called 

        14                    Fabian; the conseiller from the Butambara -- 

        15                    B-U-T-A-M-B-A-R-A -- and he was called 

        16                    Buranga, Mercure -- Buranga is 

        17                    B-U-R-A-N-G-A.  There was also the 

        18                    conseiller from the Mukinjo -- or rather, 

        19                    sorry, says the witness, there was a 

        20                    conseiller from Mukinja -- 

        21                    M-U-K-I-N-G-A (sic).  That was the name of 

        22                    the secteur, Mukinja Secteur, but I do not 

        23                    know the name of the conseiller from that 

        24                    secteur.

         1                    He was also accompanied by the conseiller 

         2                    from Ngoma -- I spell Ngoma, N-G-O-M-A.  

         3                    That conseiller was called Mvungamukenke, 

         4                    Siméon -- M-V-U-N-G-A-M-U-K-E-N-K-E, 

         5                    Mvungamukenke, Siméon -- and others whom I 

         6                    did not know. 

         7     Q.             Okay, so did the meeting take place with the 

         8                    préfet? 

         9     A.             The meeting took place and later on the 

        10                    préfet came and held a meeting with all of 

        11                    us who were assembled there. 

        12     Q.             So when the préfet held a meeting with all 

        13                    of you who were assembled there, what did he 

        14                    tell you? 

        15     A.             He said that it emerges that the gendarmes 

        16                    on the spot had become useless, that they 

        17                    were going to be taken away and it was hoped 

        18                    that the people remaining behind would be 

        19                    safe, maybe some gendarmes would be left, 

        20                    but that the gendarmes would receive the 

        21                    punishment that they deserved. 

        22     Q.             Did he tell you why those gendarmes were now 

        23                    considered useless? 

        24     A.             He said, he wanted to say -- or what he 

        25                    meant was that the gendarmes who were there

         1                    had come to ensure security and it could be 

         2                    seen that the Tutsis who planned to kill 

         3                    Hutus were not going to be killed, and that 

         4                    the Tutsis had planned to kill Hutus but 

         5                    that the Hutus were not going to do anything 

         6                    against the Tutsi. 

         7     Q.             Did he say anything further? 

         8     A.             He continued explaining, saying that there 

         9                    was no problem, that we could stay there, 

        10                    that we were safe, but we could see that he 

        11                    wanted to say that if the gendarmes stayed 

        12                    there they could ensure our security, they 

        13                    could even help us to defend ourselves. 

        14     Q.             I just need a bit of clarification, Witness.  

        15                    You just told the Court that he was going to 

        16                    send the gendarmes back because they were 

        17                    useless.  Are you -- I'm going to rephrase 

        18                    that.  You just confirmed that he was going 

        19                    to send the gendarmes back because they were 

        20                    useless.  Right?

        21     A.             To us the gendarmes were protecting us, but 

        22                    to the préfet, who had sent them with a 

        23                    mission which they had not discharged, they 

        24                    were becoming useless. 

        25     Q.             Did he tell you who was responsible for

         1                    killing the President, the préfet? 

         2     A.             In the meantime he continued saying that it 

         3                    was a Tutsi who started everything by 

         4                    killing the father of the nation and that it 

         5                    was a plot which they had hatched. 

         6     Q.             Okay, how long did this meeting with the 

         7                    préfet last, if you can give an estimation 

         8                    of the time? 

         9     A.             About one hour or more. 

        10     Q.             And during the attack before the préfet 

        11                    arrived with the conseillers, were some 

        12                    Tutsis wounded, and others actually died, as 

        13                    a result of the attack? 

        14     A.             The Tutsi who had died died at the 

        15                    sous-préfecture, but for those of us who 

        16                    were at the parish, all of us were still 

        17                    alive.  All of us were still alive. 

        18     Q.             We are talking about the 13th of April; were 

        19                    some Tutsis injured during the attack? 

        20     A.             Are you referring to the 13th or the 14th of 

        21                    April?

        22     Q.             13th of April -- which day did the préfet 

        23                    come to speak to the refugees at the parish?

        24     A.             On the 13th. 

        25     Q.             My question is:  There was an attack prior

         1                    to the arrival of the préfet; were some of 

         2                    the refugees injured or died as a result of 

         3                    this attack? 

         4     A.             No. 

         5     Q.             So when the préfet left, what happened to 

         6                    the refugees, what happened to you? 

         7     A.             After the departure of the préfet the bishop 

         8                    stayed with us, but he was afraid because it 

         9                    was said that he killed the persons who had 

        10                    died, the préfet taking the bishop's vehicle 

        11                    and fleeing.  The bishop stayed with us up 

        12                    to the 15th.  He baptised and celebrated 

        13                    weddings and carried out other ceremonies 

        14                    because he did not want anyone to die as a 

        15                    sinner. 

        16     Q.             So what happened the day after the 

        17                    ceremonies were carried out by the bishop? 

        18     A.             After giving the sacrament the bishop took 

        19                    four brothers with him, but one of them, who 

        20                    was a director, preferred staying with us.  

        21                    Moreover, he died there together with the 

        22                    others.  In the course of the road, those 

        23                    who left with the bishop were taken and were 

        24                    killed, and on the 15th we saw an attack 

        25                    come.  We could not defend ourselves because

         1                    we thought the situation was beyond us. 

         2     Q.             Okay, can you describe this attack of the 

         3                    15th to us, please?

         4     A.             The assailants arrived at about 2 p.m.  My 

         5                    brother was among the first who tried to 

         6                    beat them back, but he came back with one of 

         7                    the arms cut.  He was dying and he was 

         8                    brought where I was. 

         9                    

        10                    When my brother was brought where I was 

        11                    there were many other people who had died.  

        12                    We realised that the situation was very 

        13                    serious.  What I could do for him was just 

        14                    to cover him.  I did not want to show him to 

        15                    my mother to sadden her by the sight of him.  

        16                    Later on, we saw that the area was encircled 

        17                    and later on destroyed and the assailants 

        18                    enter it. 

        19                    

        20                    After the arrival of the assailants we tried 

        21                    to run in order to hide in the rooms.  I 

        22                    went to hide in an old house which belonged 

        23                    to the brothers at the time but which was 

        24                    used by the school group, which was used by 

        25                    the school group -- or, rather, the house at

         2                    time it was used as a residence for students 

         3                    and brothers who were called Abadahinyuka -- 

         4                    I will spell that word, 

         5                    A-B-A-D-A-H-I-N-Y-U-K-A. 

         6                    

         7                    Here I'm talking of students who were 

         8                    members of the congregation of the brothers, 

         9                    because since the brothers' home was not 

        10                    enough the students were lodged in the 

        11                    parish, in the homes of the parish priest. 

        12                    

        13                    Later on they started killing.  They threw 

        14                    grenades, they used machetes, spears and, 

        15                    finally, they arrived in the house where I 

        16                    was.  They starting throwing mattresses here 

        17                    and there, emptying bags, and they brought 

        18                    petrol, petrol that had been provided by 

        19                    traders -- or a trader called Anatole and 

        20                    another trader Anastase -- Anatole and 

        21                    Anase.  These were the traders who had 

        22                    provided them petrol.

        23     Q.             How old was your brother, the one who was 

        24                    shot during this attack?  No name please.

        25     A.             He was 18 years old.

         1     Q.             And what was his occupation in life? 

         2     A.             He was a trader. 

         3     Q.             And what was his ethnic group? 

         4     A.             He was Tutsi. 

         5     Q.             Can you give an estimate of the number of 

         6                    people who died during this attack, just an 

         7                    estimate? 

         8     A.             Are you referring to the attack of the 15th?

         9     Q.             Yes, the attack of the 15th, the number of 

        10                    the refugees, the people who were in the 

        11                    parish and its surroundings with you? 

        12     A.             We were very, very many.  When the census 

        13                    was taken we were over 25,000 people, but 

        14                    many were killed.  I think about 

        15                    three-quarters of those who were there were 

        16                    killed.

        17     Q.             Who were the attackers during this attack?  

        18                    Who were the perpetrators, the people who 

        19                    were attacking you?

        20     A.             It was the Hutus who resided there.  There 

        21                    were also the policemen, young people we had 

        22                    known before, but this time they came armed 

        23                    with guns. 

        24     Q.             Was the bourgmestre there? 

        25     A.             Yes.

         1     Q.             Was there any conseillers? 

         2     A.             Yes, there were conseillers.

         3     Q.             Can you give us the name of the bourgmestre, 

         4                    please? 

         5     A.             He was called Kamana, Aloise -- Kamana is 

         6                    K-A-M-A-N-A -- Kamana, Aloise. 

         7     Q.             And he was the bourgmestre of which commune? 

         8     A.             He was bourgmestre of the Kagano Commune. 

         9     Q.             Can you give us some names of the 

        10                    conseillers that you saw on this day? 

        11     A.             There was Conseiller Fabian from Nyamasheke 

        12                    -- I spell that N-Y-A-M-A-S-H-E-K-E.  There 

        13                    was Siméon, who was conseiller from Ngoma -- 

        14                    Ngoma is N-G-O-M-A.  There was also Mukinja

        17                    conseiller whose name I do not know, but he 

        18                    was conseiller of the Mukinja Secteur -- 

        19                    M-U-K-I-N-G-A (sic).  Mukinja Secteur is

        21                    divided into two secteurs. 

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    When you come to a convenient point, we will 

        24                    take the luncheon adjournment.

         1                    Yes, Mr. President, I'm about to wrap up on 

         2                    this attack.

         3                    

         4     Q.             (By Ms. Makwaia) Witness, were you wounded 

         5                    during this attack? 

         6     A.             The house in which I was was torched.  The 

         7                    trousers I was wearing were burnt.  I also 

         8                    was burnt on the legs.  We were so packed 

         9                    together we could not move.  They came and I 

        10                    was hit twice with a machete.  They would 

        11                    return and cut me with a machete.  This was 

        12                    done three times.  I was also wounded on the 

        13                    leg.  I do not know whether I was wounded 

        14                    with a hammer or a machete.  All I realised 

        15                    was that the place had opened up -- that is, 

        16                    where I was hit had opened up. 

        17     Q.             As these attackers attacked you on the 15th, 

        18                    were they also singing? 

        19     A.             They came singing and saying, "Let us 

        20                    exterminate them, let us exterminate them".

        21     Q.             Thank you, Mr. President, I think that's a 

        22                    convenient time to take a lunch break. 

        23                    

        24                    Maybe one final question.  As you heard them 

        25                    singing, "Let's exterminate them, let's

         2                    your mind, Witness? 

         3     A.             I cannot describe exactly what was going on 

         4                    in my mind.  I thought I was going to die.  

         5                    But it was not just ordinary death, it was 

         6                    as if the hair was breaking loose on us.  It 

         7                    was the end of the world to us. 

         8     Q.             Thank you, Mr. President. 

         9     MR. PRESIDENT:

        10                    We'll take an adjournment now and we'll

         1                    (Court resumed at 1500H)

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:

         3                    The proceedings are resumed, would you 

         4                    indicate to the witness that she is still on 

         5                    her oath - or I should say affirmation - I 

         6                    am accustomed to oath.  You may continue 

         7                    with the examination-in-chief.

         8                    

         9     EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF BY MS. MAKWAIA: (Continued)

        10     Q.             Witness, you were describing to the Court, 

        11                    events of the 15th of April, 1994.  You had 

        12                    also told the Court that the Bourgmestre 

        13                    Kamana, Aloys, and some conseillers whom you 

        14                    had enumerated, were present during this 

        15                    attack.  Now, what were they doing when the 

        16                    other attackers were attacking you?

        17     A.             He came along with the others, he was armed 

        18                    with a machete; I did not see him use it 

        19                    because I escaped but I did actually see him 

        20                    with a machete in his hand.

        21     Q.             Okay.  You had also told the Court you were 

        22                    injured, so how did you survive this attack 

        23                    of the 15th of April, 1994?

        24     A.             The attack continued until midnight.  They 

        25                    continued killing people around me until

         1                    midnight and they got tired until around 

         2                    midnight and left.  I was struggling to come 

         3                    out.  Finally, I succeeded.  When I got to 

         4                    the outside, I saw several dead bodies and I 

         5                    could not make any difference between those 

         6                    who were alive and those who were dead, so I 

         7                    started going towards Mataba where there was 

         8                    a center of nuns.  When I got to the nunnery 

         9                    in Mataba, the sisters and the soldiers who 

        10                    were there, drove us away; there were dogs 

        11                    there too.  

        12                    

        13                    So, since I could not go there, I decided to 

        14                    go back to the parish where I had come from.  

        15                    Since I was alone amongst dead bodies, I 

        16                    could not withstand that situation, so I 

        17                    went towards a latrine which was around 

        18                    there and there were piles of sticks that 

        19                    had been -- cyprus that had been cut and 

        20                    that is where I hid myself.  

        21                    

        22                    The following day, on Saturday, another 

        23                    attack came and the attackers removed the 

        24                    refugees who were remaining, who had hidden 

        25                    themselves within the church; and amongst

         1                    the refugees was one of our children who was 

         2                    younger than I was.  They also removed my 

         3                    mother who was amongst the refugees and the 

         4                    child that she had.  They started, at that 

         5                    time, they started throwing people, alive, 

         6                    in the latrines, and I saw how my mother and 

         7                    the child she was carrying, were thrown in 

         8                    one of the latrines.  The refugees, who were 

         9                    remaining, were killed, cut up in small 

        10                    pieces.  And at that time, they were saying 

        11                    to the Hutus that if there are any Hutus 

        12                    amongst the refugees, they should come out 

        13                    so that their lives would be spared.

        14     MS. MAKWAIA:

        15                    Is the Witness having a problem.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        17                    The Witness seems a little disturbed.

         1     A.             We could go ahead.

         2     MR. PRESIDENT:  

         3                    All right, very well.

         4     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

         5     Q.             Yes, you were describing to the Court how 

         6                    your mother and a child was thrown into a 

         7                    latrine, can you go on, please?

         8     A.             Then they continued to kill people and a 

         9                    vehicle arrived.  The vehicle was coming 

        10                    from the Cyangugu Prefectural Office.  

        11                    Amongst those on board were Yusufu 

        12                    Munyakazi, Y-U-S-U-F-U, and he was one of 

        13                    the leaders of the Interahamwe.  And 

        14                    according to what he said, the Prefect had 

        15                    sent them to reinforce the people in

        16                    Kagano because they were not effective 

        17                    enough.  Yusufu, who came, he went around 

        18                    and said that he would continue to Kibuye 

        19                    because Kibuye also needed reinforcement.  

        20                    So he left with the Interahamwe.  I could 

        21                    see the scene because I was hiding in the 

        22                    bushes and they could not see me.

        23     Q.             All right, can I just stop you there for a 

        24                    moment, Witness.  The attack that took 

        25                    place, what date was this, the day that your

         1                    mother and a child were thrown into a 

         2                    latrine, can you tell us the date?

         3     A.             That was on the 16th of April.

         4     Q.             The latrine, where is it found in relation 

         5                    to the parish?

         6     A.             It was very near the parish.

         7     Q.             And the child was, what sex was it?

         8     A.             The child was a boy.

         9     Q.             Was it your brother?

        10     A.             Yes.

        11     Q.             And how old was he?

        12     A.             The child was three and a half years old.

        13     Q.             And who were the people who attacked the 

        14                    parish on the 16th of April, 1994, who were 

        15                    the perpetrators?

        16     A.             They were Hutus, assisted by Interahamwe who 

        17                    came from the prefecture and were sent by 

        18                    the Prefect.

        19     Q.             How do you know they were sent by the 

        20                    Prefect?

        21     A.             Because Yusufu said that himself that they 

        22                    were sent by the Prefet to reinforce those 

        23                    in Kagano and those in Kibuye because they 

        24                    were not effective enough.

        25     Q.             Could you tell this Court how did they

         1                    reinforced the other attackers at the 

         2                    parish, how did they do this, Youssef 

         3                    Munyakazi and the Interahamwe he brought?

         4     A.             They assisted the other attackers who were 

         5                    on the spot in carrying out the victims from 

         6                    the church because most of the people who 

         7                    had got themselves hidden in the church were 

         8                    women who had spent the night there.  They 

         9                    had hidden themselves the day before and 

        10                    they took them out to kill them. It was 

        11                    mostly the women who were, later on, being 

        12                    thrown into the latrines, and they were 

        13                    turning over the corpses to see if the 

        14                    people were indeed dead, and very often, 

        15                    they gave them, they speared them to see if 

        16                    they were still alive or not.

        17     Q.             At this point in time, Witness, you had 

        18                    already been wounded and injured yourself, 

        19                    did you get any treatment for your injuries?

        20     A.             I did not have any medical treatment because 

        21                    my wounds were bleeding and I used mud to 

        22                    stop the wounds from bleeding.

        23     Q.             How about food; did you get any food to eat?

        24     A.             No, I did not find anything to eat and when 

        25                    night fell, I went and looked for foods that

         1                    I ate raw and I ate what I met, but that 

         2                    situation did not last because I ended up 

         3                    becoming very weak and I did not even go and 

         4                    look for vegetable, cabbages and cassava.

         5     Q.             So ultimately, Witness LBI, what happened to 

         6                    you on this day?

         7     A.             After that scene, after the departure of 

         8                    Yusufu and the Interahamwe, the others 

         9                    stayed on the spot and continued to look for 

        10                    people to kill.  When they had finished the 

        11                    killings, they went to the countryside to 

        12                    remove people to kill. I stayed there until 

        13                    around midnight, 1:00 a.m..  Then I went to 

        14                    the cemetery.

        15     Q.             And how long did you spend at the cemetery, 

        16                    and why did you choose to go to the 

        17                    cemetery?

        18     A.             I spent about three days within the 

        19                    cemetery.  I went there because I did not 

        20                    see other places where I could hide myself 

        21                    and that was a place where there were bushes 

        22                    and I was telling myself that nobody was 

        23                    going to think about coming to look for me 

        24                    there.  Inside the cemetery, I found a big 

        25                    tomb which had been covered with grass or

         1                    bushes and that is where I hid myself.

         2     Q.             After these three days or so, where you hid 

         3                    at this cemetery; where did you go next?

         4     A.             After those three days, I tried to get into 

         5                    a Hutu family which was a friend to my 

         6                    family, but night fell while I was on my way 

         7                    and I decided to hide myself.  I was 

         8                    assisted by a group of young people.  

         9                    Amongst the young people, there was a 

        10                    certain Damascene Harindintwari 

        11                    H-A-R-I-N-D-I-N-T-W-A-R-I, who had taught me 

        12                    in primary school and another young person 

        13                    who was a student in Kibuye.

        14     Q.             And then what happened to you?

        15     A.             Later on, the two people that took me, I 

        16                    followed Damascene, I begged him to kill me 

        17                    but he said that he could not kill me and 

        18                    that instead he was going to take me to 

        19                    people who had family relations with me.  

        20                    But in reality, he did not want to take me 

        21                    to relatives but rather they took me to a 

        22                    house which did I not know.  When I arrived, 

        23                    I was raped by young people for several 

        24                    days.

         1                    We perfectly well understand, you need not 

         2                    apologize.

         3     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

         4     Q.             Witness, you just told the Court that you 

         5                    were raped by many men for several days, did 

         6                    you know some of the men who raped you?

         7     A.             Yes, I know the persons.  There was Mr. 

         8                    Harindintwari - Damason, who was my teacher 

         9                    and the other one, the second one was a 

        10                    student in Kibuye but I did not know his 

        11                    name.

        12     Q.             Now, as they raped you, did they say 

        13                    anything to you?

        14     A.             They told me that if they were raping me, it 

        15                    was not out of love but just to prove that 

        16                    everything was possible, that they could do 

        17                    things against, on me, against my will.

        18     Q.             So how long did you stay in this place where 

        19                    they took you?

        20     A.             I spent days, and one night when they were 

        21                    not there, I escaped through a window which 

        22                    was behind.  I broke the window and fled.

        23     Q.             Where did you flee to?

        24     A.             I took the road towards the residence of a 

        25                    Hutu friend and on that occasion, I was able

         1                    to arrive at that house.  I arrived there; I 

         2                    knocked at the door; it was towards 

         3                    midnight.  When they opened and saw me, they 

         4                    shouted and they prevented me from entering.   

         5                    After they prevented me from entering their 

         6                    house, I went to the rear part of their 

         7                    plot; there was a banana plantation and 

         8                    there were banana stems that had been cut, 

         9                    as well as fir trees that had been parked 

        10                    there.  So I hid myself in the leaves and 

        11                    among the banana stems.  I stayed there 

        12                    until about eleven o'clock the following 

        13                    day, that is 11:00 a.m., and at about that 

        14                    time, some children passed by, and one of 

        15                    those children, on passing, stepped on me.   

        16                    When he stepped on me, he jumped, turned and 

        17                    saw me, and I told the child, I am the one, 

        18                    do not denounce me.

        20                    Later on, I told the child that I was very 

        21                    hungry and asked the child whether he could 

        22                    not give me something to eat and water to 

        23                    drink.  They brought me something to eat and 

        24                    give me water but they said I could not use 

        25                    their plate; they cut a large leaf off a

         1                    plant which was there and they served me 

         2                    food on that leaf.  I was very thirsty, so 

         3                    thirsty that there were wounds in my throat 

         4                    so I wasn't able to eat but at least I was 

         5                    able to drink the water.   

         6                    

         7                    Later on, they called their father and told 

         8                    the father that they had just found me at 

         9                    that place.  Since they had driven me away 

        10                    the day earlier, they said they did not want 

        11                    to have an Inyenzi at their home, so they 

        12                    called for people passing in front of the 

        13                    house and they told them to come and take 

        14                    this Inyenzi away.

        15     Q.             What is an Inyenzi?

        16     A.             The word Inyenzi was used to designate the 

        17                    Tutsi.  So the assailants took me away and 

        18                    on the road, they hit me on the chest with a 

        19                    club.  On arrival at the commune, I found 

        20                    the communal driver who was also the head of 

        21                    CDR Party.  So I found Kalisa who was the 

        22                    commune driver.  When I saw him, he was 

        23                    somebody I had known before, and I told them 

        24                    that I wanted to go and see him, that he was 

        25                    somebody I had known in Kigali because

         1                    sometimes he came to do repairs in our 

         2                    house, he was somebody to whom I had 

         3                    rendered services, and I thought that on 

         4                    this occasion, he was also going to render 

         5                    me a service in his turn.  He told them to 

         6                    free me, to allow me to go.  He said that he 

         7                    knew me and he said, leave this young girl, 

         8                    I know her, she is Hutu.  They refused.  

         9                    They cried, rather that he shouted and then 

        10                    looking at their reaction or seeing their 

        11                    reaction, he said, and now I am giving you 

        12                    an order, leave her alone, and I was left 

        13                    alone.  Can I give names here?  Can I give 

        14                    names.

        15     Q.             Yes?

        16     MR. PRESIDENT:  

        17                    There wouldn't be any problems with regard 

        18                    to --

        19     MS. MAKWAIA:

        20                    No, Your Honour, she can give the names, 

        21                    there is no problem.

        22     A.             So once I arrived at the commune office, I 

        23                    found children whose mothers were Hutu but 

        24                    whose fathers were Tutsi and those children 

        25                    had been hidden there.  Therefore, at that

         1                    place, at the bureau communal, I found 

         2                    children who were born out of wedlock.  It 

         3                    was said that their fathers were Hutu and 

         4                    those children were set aside and I was kept 

         5                    at that place and there, I found, in 

         6                    particular, a girl called Prisca.  Can I 

         7                    give names?

         8     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

         9     Q.             Yes?

        10     A.             At that place, I found other people, in 

        11                    particular, Gahongayire, Prisca, with two of 

        12                    her children - I will spell the name - 

        13                    G-A-H-O-N-G-A-Y-I-R-E.  There was younger a 

        14                    sister called Kagoyire, K-A-G-O-Y-I-R-E.  

        15                    There was also a girl, Cuwera, C-U-W-E-R-A, 

        16                    another girl called Gatesi, G-A-T-E-S-I.   

        17                    There was also the wife of the man called 

        18                    Kalisa who made me enter with two of her 

        19                    children.  In fact, Kalista had a Tutsi 

        20                    woman whom he had driven away.  There were 

        21                    also two other children whose names I was 

        22                    unable to find out.

        23     Q.             How long did you stay at the communal 

        24                    office?

        25     A.             We stayed there for about two weeks.

         1     Q.             Now, during these two weeks, did any 

         2                    authorities come to the communal office?

         3     A.             During the two weeks that I spent at the 

         4                    bureau communal, nobody paid us a visit, but 

         5                    on the contrary, they held meetings behind 

         6                    the bureau communal before going to kill and 

         7                    after killing, when they returned from their 

         8                    killings.

         9     Q.             Can you tell us about these meetings?

        10     A.             I remember a meeting in which I recognized a 

        11                    sub-prefect of Gisoro, called Keribouragr.  

        12                    There was also Kamana, Aloys, who was a 

        13                    Bourgmestre, as well as other people who 

        14                    accompanied them.  It was -- the Interhamwes 

        15                    were asked to bury those who had been killed 

        16                    because up to that point, those who were 

        17                    killed, were not buried, but to bury them, 

        18                    the vehicles of the Tutsi had to be sold so 

        19                    as to know how to pay compensation to those 

        20                    that did the work and it was said that it 

        21                    was the prefect who gave the order for 

        22                    things to happen that way.

        23                    

        24                    Apparently the prefect also said that all 

        25                    those who killed more than 50 people should

         1                    be given a reward; that reward would be a 

         2                    motor -- or bicycles which belonged to the 

         3                    Tutsis of Kagano.  

         4     THE INTERPRETER:

         5                    The Witness wants me to repeat that it is 

         6                    the prefect who gave that order.  

         7     A.             What I have just said, with regard to the 

         8                    reward of motorcycles that had to be given 

         9                    to anyone that killed more than 50 people, 

        10                    these statements were made by the 

        11                    sub-prefect on the order of the prefect.  

        12                    After the sub-prefect, the Bourgmestre 

        13                    Kamana said that what the sub-prefect had 

        14                    just said with regard to the orders of the 

        15                    prefect was true and that it was necessary 

        16                    to bury the bodies and then pay the rewards 

        17                    to those who had killed many people.  

        18                    

        19                    After having said that, we saw many 

        20                    Interahamwe who came to resettle that place.  

        21                    We ran into hiding and we were unable to 

        22                    say, upto here, what was said thereafter.

        23     Q.             Where was this meeting being held?

        24     A.             It was in front of the bureau communal of 

        25                    the Kagano Commune.

         1     Q.             And where were you?

         2     A.             We were, I was in a room of the bureau 

         3                    communal at a place where Kalisa had taken 

         4                    me and where there were other refugees who I 

         5                    have mentioned earlier and we were looking 

         6                    through the window which, moreover, had been 

         7                    broken, and we could hear all that was being 

         8                    said.

         9     Q.             Can you situate the time when this meeting 

        10                    took place, after your arrival at the 

        11                    communal office?

        12     A.             The meeting in question took place even 

        13                    before I had spent five days, or one week, 

        14                    at the bureau communal.

        15     Q.             You had also spoken about other women who 

        16                    were at the communal office, were they ever 

        17                    raped?

        18     A.             Yes.

        19     Q.             And how did you know about this?

        20     A.             I could give, as an example, Prisca, who was 

        21                    raped by the Brigadier of the commune.  When 

        22                    she saw me arrive, wounded, and the wounds 

        23                    were full of the muds which I had put there 

        24                    to stop the bleeding, she told me that she 

        25                    was going to ask for medicine from the

         1                    Brigadier, that she was not afraid of the 

         2                    Brigadier because, in any case, the 

         3                    Brigadier had already raped her.  

         4                    

         5                    When I arrived there, I did not tell Prisca 

         6                    Gahongayire that I had been raped, therefore 

         7                    she told me that I had -- she had been raped 

         8                    by the Brigadier, but she told me, you are a 

         9                    young child, you are only a small girl, if, 

        10                    she said, if those people want to rape, do 

        11                    not accept.  You should rather prefer to be 

        12                    killed than to be raped.  

        13                    

        14                    They came and they took the women, one by 

        15                    one.  Gatesi was taken by a certain 

        16                    Mubumbyi, M-U-B-U-M-B-Y-I.  They also came 

        17                    to take away Cuwere and there was only 

        18                    Gahongayire, Prisca, who was left, her 

        19                    younger sister, Kagoyire, as well as the 

        20                    wife of Kalisa and myself.  I stayed there.  

        21                    They came from time to time to see me and I 

        22                    said, come what may, if you take me, no 

        23                    member of my family would come back.  If you 

        24                    take me, do what you want to do with me.

         1                    office?

         2     A.             Later on, when these people were taken, one 

         3                    after the other, there was a communal 

         4                    meeting and they said that the commune had 

         5                    to resume its activities.  That was not the 

         6                    residence, we had to leave the premises of 

         7                    the office of the commune, and that was 

         8                    because they had to resume the activities of 

         9                    the commune bureau as usual.  After saying 

        10                    that, they said that a decision had been 

        11                    taken to take us to the Nyamasheke Health 

        12                    Center, N-Y-AM-A-S-H-E-K-E.

        13     Q.             Who gave the order that you should leave the 

        14                    communal offices?

        15     A.             It is Bourgmestre Kamana, who, during a 

        16                    meeting, said that the prefect had ordered 

        17                    that the activities should resume throughout 

        18                    the prefecture, and that they had to hold in 

        19                    the Kagano Commune.  And consequently, we 

        20                    had to vacate the premises of the office and 

        21                    go to the Nyamasheke Health Center.

        22     Q.             So how many of you left the communal office 

        23                    to go to the Nyamasheke Health Center?

        24     A.             There were six of us.

        25     Q.             And how long did you stay at the Health

         1                    Center in Nyamasheke, at the Nyamasheke 

         2                    Center Health?

         3     A.             We spent only a few days because the other 

         4                    guys, who survived, were being attacked at 

         5                    the Center.

         6     Q.             Who was attacking you at the Center at this 

         7                    point in time?

         8     A.             First, there were Hutus who were going 

         9                    around and looking for the girls in the 

        10                    Center and then families who were looking 

        11                    for girls amongst us to go and work for 

        12                    those families.  Later on, a man called 

        13                    Rurangandabo, Pascal, 

        14                    R-U-R-A-N-G-A-N-D-A-B-O, Rurangandabo 

        15                    Pascal, who was Bourgmestre of Kagano, he 

        16                    was also a friend of the family, he had 

        17                    grown up in my mother's family and he told 

        18                    me that he was taking me to a family in a 

        19                    place called Murwa, M-U-R-W-A.  Murwa is 

        20                    part of the Nyamasheke, which goes right 

        21                    into Kivu and no Tutsi had lived there.  Any 

        22                    Tutsi who dared into that area, was killed.

        23     Q.             So any Tutsi who dared into that area that 

        24                    was killed, where did you stay?

        25     A.             I didn't go there.  In fact, what happened

         1                    was that there was a certain rivalry; all 

         2                    these people were looking for ladies or 

         3                    young girls to take them and use them as 

         4                    servants.  On the way, I was told, 

         5                    therefore, that I had trapped (sic) and I 

         6                    was afraid and I went back to the Health 

         7                    Center.

         8                    

         9                    I told the people who came to take me to 

        10                    wait and to come back and look for me around 

        11                    6:00 p.m.  These people warned me, they told 

        12                    me that at exactly 6:00 p.m., the Health 

        13                    Center was going to be attacked by Kalisi's 

        14                    people and they told me that they were going 

        15                    to throw a stone on the roof and that 

        16                    immediately I hear the stone on the roof, I 

        17                    should come out, they would be behind the 

        18                    Health Center and they would grab me.  

        19                    

        20                    Then I met some other person who had, in the 

        21                    past, worked in our house and who told me 

        22                    that, in fact, those people who are 

        23                    proposing to save my life, want to kill me.  

        24                    He made a counter proposal, in particular, 

        25                    that I should jump, but this time, I should

         1                    fall in a part of the Health Center where 

         2                    they were working because he was working at 

         3                    that Health Center.  

         4                    

         5                    After these contradictory proposals, we 

         6                    decided to flee.  The only person who 

         7                    remained was the wife of Kalisa, because in 

         8                    her opinion, since her husband wanted her 

         9                    dead, she could not escape death.  So she 

        10                    decided to stay there, come what may.

        11     Q.             Where did you flee to, Witness, after the 

        12                    Health Center at Nyamasheke, where did you 

        13                    flee to?

        14     A.             Finally, they threw that stone on the roof, 

        15                    as I said earlier, and I jumped.  I went 

        16                    towards this from a house servant, and since 

        17                    he was working close to the Health Center 

        18                    and where he was working, there was a banana 

        19                    plantation where there was a hole where he 

        20                    had inserted a ladder and I used it to get 

        21                    right to the bottom of the hole.   

        22                    

        23                    I spent the night in that hole.  Later on, I 

        24                    learnt that Prisca also seceded in escaping 

        25                    but the lady I talked about, remained with

         1                    her wounded children, and when the attack 

         2                    started, they died.  I would like to point 

         3                    out that the children were not her children, 

         4                    they were children that had been picked up 

         5                    here and there, who were injured, and who 

         6                    had been put together and brought to the 

         7                    Health Center, but amongst this group, were 

         8                    also her two children, two small children, 

         9                    two small boys, I should say.

        10     Q.             Did you stay there or until when did you 

        11                    stay in the hole?

        12     A.             I spent the night in that hole.  The 

        13                    following day, the gentleman came back.  He 

        14                    was a servant in that family, but the family 

        15                    had a girl who had been my classmate and he 

        16                    decided to reveal that to her, and when he 

        17                    said that, the little girl said, I cannot 

        18                    say that to my mother because I do not know 

        19                    how she will react, just wait, and during 

        20                    the night, I will tell you what we will do.  

        21                    

        22                    The gentleman brought me food later on and 

        23                    during the night, he came back and told me 

        24                    that the little girl had decided to help me.  

        25                    And indeed, in the middle of the night, she

         1                    opened the door of their house and asked 

         2                    that gentleman to let me in, and she hid me 

         3                    in her room without the knowledge of her 

         4                    parents.   

         5                    

         6                    I spent another night there and the day 

         7                    after, the little girl decided to tell her 

         8                    mother and told her that she knew where I 

         9                    was hiding.  In the meantime, I went back to 

        10                    the hole and the mother said, go and bring 

        11                    her back to the house; if they want to do 

        12                    anything to her, they should do it in this 

        13                    house, but she should not be killed in the 

        14                    bush.  So they asked the boy of the house to 

        15                    stand in front of the house and they asked 

        16                    the servant to go and look for me and he 

        17                    came and looked for me.

        18     Q.             Did you ultimately get sheltered by a Hutu 

        19                    family?

        20     A.             Yes, they hid me at home for about two days 

        21                    and told me that there were public servants 

        22                    and that for quite a while, they had not 

        23                    been receiving a salary and they did not 

        24                    have the means to keep me.  They proposed 

        25                    me, therefore, that they should hand me over

         1                    to another family whose head was a Hutu and 

         2                    whose name was Meshaki, M-E-S-H-A-K-I.  

         3     Q.             And for how long did you stay at Meshaki's 

         4                    place, if you can give us an estimated time?

         5     A.             I spent about two months there.

         6     Q.             Now, during your stay at Mesahki's house, 

         7                    what happened to you; did you get occasion 

         8                    to see any of the authorities there?

         9     A.             When I was at Mesahki's, I did not reveal 

        10                    that I was Tutsi because I did not live in 

        11                    Cyangugu, I had come from Kigali and I told 

        12                    them that the owner of the house, where we 

        13                    lived, was my father's and they believed me, 

        14                    but the wife continued to suspect until the 

        15                    day the prefect came to visit them.

        16                    

        17                    When the prefect came to visit the family, 

        18                    he sat in the living room and while he was 

        19                    talking with Mesahki, in the presence of his 

        20                    wife, I was in the neighbouring room, but 

        21                    the door of that room was ajar.  I could see 

        22                    him and I heard him say to what extent he 

        23                    was satisfied with the work of the people of 

        24                    Kagano; that he did not expect them to be 

        25                    that efficient.

         1     Q.             How did you know it was the prefect at 

         2                    Mesahki's house?  How did you know it was 

         3                    him who visited at the time, that day?

         4     A.             On the one hand, I saw him, as I said, and I 

         5                    had seen him before when he was holding a 

         6                    meeting, the meeting in Nyamasheke, and even 

         7                    after his departure, their family continued 

         8                    to talk about the visit, repeating that the 

         9                    prefect congratulated them on their good 

        10                    work.

         1                    1625H

         2     BY MS. MAKWAIA: (Continuing)

         3     Q.             Before you saw the prefet at Nyamasheke on 

         4                    13th of April when he held the meeting, had 

         5                    you seen him before?

         6     A.             I had seen him once, but I did not remember 

         7                    him well.  I saw him for the first time 

         8                    during a meeting he held in Kagano.

         9     Q.             Now, I want you to look around this 

        10                    Courtroom and tell me, if you see anybody 

        11                    that resembles the prefet that you are 

        12                    talking about?   With the Chamber's 

        13                    permission, can she stand up? 

        14     THE INTERPRETER: 

        15                    The Witness is asking if she could stand.

        16     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        17                    Yes, you may stand.

        18     THE WITNESS:

        19                    It is the gentleman who is sitting there in 

        20                    the middle.  He resembles him.

        21     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

        22     Q.             Could you describe for the Court the colour 

        23                    of his shirt, please?

        24     A.             When he came to Nyamasheke, he was wearing a 

        25                    different shirt that could be recognised.

               NTAGERURA, BAGAMBIKI, IMANISHIMWE           25 OCTOBER 2000


         1     Q.             Yes, I am asking you about the shirt he is 

         2                    wearing today?

         3     A.             He is wearing a white shirt. 

         4     MR. PRESIDENT: 

         5                    Why don't you get the row the person is 

         6                    sitting.  He says in the middle, but, you 

         7                    know, what row is it? 

         8     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

         9     Q.             Yes, could you tell us the row he is 

        10                    sitting, which row?

        11     A.             He is seated on the last row, and beside 

        12                    him, is a gentleman wearing glasses, but he 

        13                    is not wearing glasses.

        14     MS. MAKWAIA:

        15                    Mr. President, may the record reflect that 

        16                    the witness has identified the Accused, 

        17                    Bagambiki?  

        18     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        19                    Yes, very well.

        20     BY MS. MAKWAIA:

        21     Q.             Thank you, Witness.   You may sit down.  

        22                    Now, I'm just going to ask you a couple of 

        23                    questions of a general nature. 

        24                    Did you listen to the radio in 1994 in 

        25                    April, or January, February, March.

               NTAGERURA, BAGAMBIKI, IMANISHIMWE           25 OCTOBER 2000


         1     A.             Yes, I listened to the radio.

         2     Q.             Which radio station did you listen to?

         3     A.             I listened, especially, to Radio Rwanda, the 

         4                    BBC, RTLM and Radio Muhabura, which was the 

         5                    Radio station of the Inkotanyi.

         6     Q.             Okay.  Can you tell us the nature of the 

         7                    broadcast of RTLM in 1994, or prior to that?  

         8                    What kind of broadcasts were been aired?

         9     A.             RTLM was inciting Rwandans to kill, 

        10                    themselves.  But from the very beginning it 

        11                    was not that obvious.  It is now, when I 

        12                    look back, taking into account what happened 

        13                    in Rwanda, I can understand the nature and 

        14                    the real meaning of those broadcasts.

        15     Q.             Could you give the Court an example of what 

        16                    was being broadcast in April, for example, 

        17                    l994?

        18     A.             The example I can give is a song which was 

        19                    usually aired.  A song which was composed 

        20                    with the intention of criticising the Hutu, 

        21                    but if you look at it closely, they were 

        22                    talking about specific Hutu like Pasteur and 

        23                    Kanyarenge, Hutus who did not have any 

        24                    memory, and that, in my opinion, meant that 

        25                    in the past, the Tutsi, during the monarchy

         1                    oppressed the Hutus, something like that.  

         2                    So he criticised, and said that he hated 

         3                    them because they were greedy people whose 

         4                    only concern was their stomachs.  I also 

         5                    remember, for example, that people were 

         6                    urged to kill all the Inyenzi because 

         7                    according to the radio, they had killed the 

         8                    parent of the nation, and he was asking them 

         9                    to ensure that no Inyenzi is spared.

        10     MS. MAKWAIA: 

        11                    Thank you, Witness.  Now I would like to 

        12                    show some photographs and I will ask you a 

        13                    few questions.  With the assistance of the 

        14                    Registry, can we have them on the projector, 

        15                    please?

        16     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        17                    You need to indicate to us what exhibits 

        18                    they are?

        19     MS. MAKWAIA: 

        20                    No, these haven't been tendered yet. 

        21     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        22                    I see.  Very well. 

        23     MS. MAKWAIA:

        24                    Can the technician beam on the photograph so 

        25                    that we can see it on the screen?

         1     BY MS. MAKWAIA:  

         2     Q.             Witness, you have a picture on your screen 

         3                    now, can you see that?

         4     A.             Yes, I can see the picture.

         5     Q.             What did it represent?

         6     A.             It is a photograph of the Nyamasheke parish.

         7     Q.             Is this the same parish you've been talking 

         8                    about throughout your evidence, today?

         9     A.             That's true.

        10     Q.             Are you able to show the Court where you 

        11                    were hiding, from this photograph?

        12     A.             If it were possible to move the photograph 

        13                    to the right, I would be able to show you 

        14                    the spot because it is on the left.

        15     MS. MAKWAIA:

        16                    Mr. President, if, maybe the curtains were 

        17                    closed, then the Witness could move to the 

        18                    projector and it would be easier for her to  

        19                    indicate. 

        20     MR. PRESIDENT:

        21                    I think, to be on the safe side, we should 

        22                    go into closed session.

        23     MS. MAKWAIA:

        24                    As the Chamber, pleases, Mr. President.

         1                    (At this point in the proceedings, a portion 

         2                    of the testimony of Witness LBI was redacted 

         3                    and sealed under a separate cover as the 

         4                    session was heard in camera)  

         5     MR. HENRY:

         6                    Mr. President, before I start with the 

         7                    cross-examination, I would like to bring to 

         8                    your attention, because in order to lose as 

         9                    little time as possible, I'm going to start 

        10                    my cross-examination immediately, with a 

        11                    number of questions.  In any case, I did not 

        12                    have many questions for this witness, but I 

        13                    should add, however, that the testimony 

        14                    given by the witness at the end of the 

        15                    testimony, raised new questions which were 

        16                    not given to me and which I did not examine 

        17                    with my client, Mr. Ntagerura.   

        18                    

        19                    So I'm in a situation where I need to 

        20                    consult the notes that have been given to 

        21                    me.  I cannot read them while I'm doing the 

        22                    re-examination -- cross-examination and 

        23                    listening to the witness.  So I would like 

        24                    you to grant me a few minutes now, that I 

        25                    should start the cross-examination, but that

         1                    you should permit me to continue tomorrow 

         2                    morning after consulting with my client.

         3     MR. PRESIDENT: 

         4                    Very well.

         5     MR. HENRY:

         6                    Thank you, Mr. President. 

         7     MR. PRESIDENT: 

         8                    Of course, on the understanding that it will 

         9                    be limited to those issues that are raised 

        10                    at the end, not that we go over the whole 

        11                    thing all over again.

        12     MR. HENRY:

        13                    Unless, of course, the time I have does not 

        14                    allow me to complete all the questions that 

        15                    I had written down now.  

        16     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        17                    Very well.

        18     MR. HENRY:

        19                    Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you.

        22     BY MR. HENRY:   

        23     Q.             Witness LBI, good afternoon.

        24     A.             Good afternoon.

        25     Q.             I have a few questions to ask you, please in

         1                    relation to the looting of your house to 

         2                    start with.  Do you know the individuals who 

         3                    looted your house?  I think this was around 

         4                    the 9th of April?

         5     A.             When the looting was carried out I was not 

         6                    there.  So I couldn't recognise any of them.

         7     MR. HENRY:

         8                    I'm sorry, Mr. Interpreter.

         9     KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:

        10                    I would repeat.  When the looting took place 

        11                    I was not there, but later on, we were given 

        12                    the names of certain people who were 

        13                    involved.

        14     BY MR. HENRY:

        15     Q.             Now, these people who looted your house, 

        16                    Witness, do I --  am I correct to think or 

        17                    to propose that they were your neighbours?

        18     A.             You are correct.

        19     Q.             Do you know how many persons carried out 

        20                    this looting of your house?

        21     A.             I recognised three of them.

        22     Q.             You recognised three of the people you were 

        23                    told had looted your house.  Is that 

        24                    correct? 

        25     A.             That's correct.

         1     Q.             But in reality, I understand from your 

         2                    answer that more than three people looted 

         3                    the house?

         4     A.             Yes, that is correct.  They are three of 

         5                    them, and one of the them did confess that 

         6                    they did take part in the looting of our 

         7                    house.

         8     Q.             Well, are you capable of saying that letters 

         9                    of apology was sent to you or your family?

        10     A.             No, no letters of apology was sent, but 

        11                    after the war, when we caught up with these 

        12                    people, the person who confessed, who 

        13                    admitted it, said that they had taken some 

        14                    objects from our house.  He even gave the 

        15                    names of the people who looted along with 

        16                    him.

        17     Q.             Good.  I was going to come to the property 

        18                    that was stolen from your house, Witness.  

        19                    Could you please describe, very shortly, the 

        20                    property that disappeared from your house?

        21     A.             Our house was completely equipped, but 

        22                    today, if we were asked to give the things 

        23                    that were in the house, it would be 

        24                    difficult for me to establish a list like 

        25                    this.

         1     Q.             Do I understand -- 

         2     MR. PRESIDENT: 

         3                    Mr. Benoit, how does this help us?

         4     MR. HENRY:

         5                    Well, Mr. President.  I would change my line 

         6                    of questioning. 

         7     BY MR. HENRY:

         8     Q.             Witness, you did mention that you sought 

         9                    refuge in Nyamasheke parish, and that along 

        10                    the way you boarded the communal truck or 

        11                    pick-up.  Is that correct, you understood my 

        12                    question?

        13     A.             Yes.

        14     Q.             Very good.  Should I understand also from 

        15                    your answer, Witness LBI, that your family 

        16                    and yourself, were accompanied by many or 

        17                    several other people who were also seeking 

        18                    refuge in the parish on that day?

        19     A.             What day are you talking about?

        20     Q.             The day that you decided to seek refuge in 

        21                    that place?

        22     A.             That is correct.

        23     Q.             Why did you, your family, and yourself, why 

        24                    did you decide to seek refuge at the parish?

        25     A.             I think I answered the question when the

         1                    Prosecutor put that question to me.

         2     Q.             Was it because you felt that you would be 

         3                    better protected in the parish than you 

         4                    would be in your house?

         5     A.             I think you understood the answer I gave to 

         6                    the Prosecutor.

         7     Q.             Thank you, for that clarification, Witness 

         8                    LBI.

         9     Q.             You talked on a number of occasions, and you 

        10                    described the assailants as being Hutu, you 

        11                    said there were gendarmes, there were 

        12                    policemen and you also talked about the 

        13                    Interahamwe.  Witness LBI, how did you know 

        14                    that some of the assailants were 

        15                    Interahamwe?

        16     A.             I could recognise the Interahamwe because 

        17                    they had distinctive signs.  First of all, 

        18                    they wore uniform in the Egitinge material, 

        19                    E-G-I-T-I-N-G-E, which Habyarimana, the 

        20                    President, had sewn for them.  And secondly, 

        21                    they did not come with traditional arms like 

        22                    other members of the population, but they 

        23                    carried along military weapons.  The other 

        24                    ordinary Hutu did not sing like the 

        25                    Interahamwe.  The Interahamwe sang that they

         1                    would put on their uniforms, we are going to 

         2                    wear clothes so we will look good and then 

         3                    we will descend and climb back.

         4     Q.             You are saying that the Interahamwe took 

         5                    their time to say that they were going to 

         6                    dress up or wear uniforms and get down?

         7     A.             They sang the song even before the genocide 

         8                    in Kigali, when they went to meetings.  It 

         9                    is those who had a particular uniform, they 

        10                    were the only group with a particular 

        11                    uniform, and the group sang the song just 

        12                    after the uniforms were sewn for them.

        13     Q.             Now do you know how the Interahamwe had to 

        14                    get or obtain this uniform?

        15     A.             I was not an Interahamwe to know, but some 

        16                    of them came to us and told us that it was 

        17                    the President who had bought the uniforms 

        18                    because they supported him.

        19     Q.             Now, did some Interahamwe also tell you that 

        20                    they had to pay out of their own pockets for 

        21                    the uniforms in question?

        22     A.             No, they did not tell us anything like that 

        23                    because they -- we didn't see any need to 

        24                    have stronger relations with them.

        25     Q.             Thank you, Witness LBI.  During the events

         1                    following the death of President Habyarimana 

         2                    until the take over of power by the RPF, on 

         3                    how many occasions did you see groups of 

         4                    Interahamwe, the groups of people that you 

         5                    called Interahamwe?

         6     A.             The first time I saw them was on the 16th, 

         7                    they were coming back from the prefecture, 

         8                    they were led by Yusuf.  And I also saw them 

         9                    when they were going to Nyamasheke in 

        10                    Kibuye, and when we were at the communal 

        11                    office, they passed and passed back.

        12     Q.             The group of Interahamwe included how many 

        13                    individuals, approximately?

        14     A.             I did not have the time to count them 

        15                    because even where I was, I was very worried 

        16                    about my survival.

        17     Q.             We understand that you didn't have the time 

        18                    to count them, Witness.  What I'm asking you 

        19                    today is that, are you capable of giving us 

        20                    an estimate of the number of people in that 

        21                    group of Interahamwe? 

        22     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        23                    Mr. Benoit, what particular group?  At what 

        24                    particular time.

         1                    You are correct, Mr. President.   I would 

         2                    try to be more precise in my questioning. 

         3     BY MR. HENRY:

         4     Q.             I'm referring to the date of 16th of April 

         5                    because that is the group you talked about 

         6                    when you said you saw them for the first 

         7                    time.  How many people that you called 

         8                    Interahamwe were in that group?

         9     A.             The group of Interahamwe filled a Toyota 

        10                    pick-up.  If you count, you, yourself, 

        11                    count, you realised that in a pick-up, more 

        12                    than 20 people can be contained in a 

        13                    pick-up.

        14     Q.             So now, according to you, I did not see the 

        15                    pick-up, how many people could be in that 

        16                    pick-up?

        17     A.             I did not count, and please, I don't see why 

        18                    you insist that, why I should give you an 

        19                    exact figure.

        20     Q.             All I asked you was an approximate figure, 

        21                    but if you don't want to answer, I would 

        22                    stop there.  Would you have the same answer 

        23                    for the other groups you saw, those who were 

        24                    going to Kibuye?

        25     A.             It is the same answer, but later on, they

         1                    came in many vehicles, they were going to 

         2                    Kibuye and they realised that they were 

         3                    still many people there.

         4     MR. HENRY:

         5                    Let me take a few minutes of your time, 

         6                    Mr. President, to look through the topics I 

         7                    had prepared before I, perhaps, ask you to 

         8                    adjourn to tomorrow, to ensure that we will 

         9                    have only new questions which were raised by 

        10                    the witness at the end. 

        11     MR. PRESIDENT: 

        12                    Very well, Mr. Benoit.

        13     MR. HENRY:

        14                    I think, Mr. President, that that would be 

        15                    it with this witness except for the few 

        16                    questions which require consultation with my 

        17                    client.

        18     MR. PRESIDENT:

        19                    Thank you, very much. 

        20     MR. HENRY: 

        21                    Thank you, Mr. President.

        22     MR. PRESIDENT:

        23                    In that case, we will take the adjournment 

        24                    now, and we will resume tomorrow morning at 

        25                    9.30.
