MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Tuesday, the 11th of October 2005, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can see that the appearances before us are the same as yesterday.  

Just before you continue your examination-in-chief, Mr. Rapp, there's a preliminary decision I wanted to make, and I would like The Hague to ensure that the witness's earphones are not on.  Can we have that confirmation, please.  
MR. JUMA:
Thank you, Mr. President.  We have removed the headphones from the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

This is a decision, or directive.  The Chamber notes that on 7th October 2005, the Prosecution filed a statement of Witness T, taken on 29th September 2005, faxed to the Prosecution on 5th October 2005.  Some portions of this document have been redacted.  Yesterday the Defence requested to obtain an unredacted version of this statement.  The Prosecution responded that this redaction was justified since it deals with issues that, if they were disclosed, would impact the right of fair trial of Witness T in his country of residence.  It further indicated that for that reason some information should be excluded from disclosure until his trial takes place in that country.  

The Prosecution refers the Chamber to its motion under Rule 66(C), currently pending.  The Chamber notes, however, that the Prosecution motion under Rule 66(C) has been filed on the 26th of September 2005, before the filing of the additional statements of Witness T.  It considers that the Prosecution should provide evidence that they were requested to make such a redaction.  The Chamber, therefore, orders the Prosecution to file this information within 24 hours.  

In addition, the Chamber notes that yesterday the Prosecution mentioned several times the name of a country regarding Witness T, this mention should be redacted in the transcripts and placed under seal.  The Chamber orders the registry to act accordingly.  
MR. MORLEY:
May it please Your Honour, Your Honour and Your Honours' colleagues will see that I am on my feet.  Your Honour may remember yesterday that there was some interest which arose over the distribution of an e-mail which made its way into the hands of the helpful Mr. Robinson, which then got read out to Your Honour and Your Honours' colleagues.  And Your Honour may remember that we hadn't realised that Mr. Robinson had somehow got his hands on that e-mail.  A great enquiry was initiated in which I was actively involved.  We were looking for a mole, but we found a fool.  I'm standing on my feet to tell you that the fool may come as no surprise.  It was me.  I accidentally sent Mr. Robinson, when I was sending him some correspondence, what Mr. Webster had written to myself.  I'm very sorry to Mr. Webster.  I apologise to the Tribunal if it ruffled the Court's feathers, and I must disappoint Mr. Robinson by explaining that, unhappily, I'm not going to make that mistake again.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I did everything I could to protect my source, but given the fact that he's made this confession, I tell him that I'm sorry that -- to have embarrassed him, and I fully accept his mea culpa.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, in fact, Mr. Morley, we appreciate your frankness with the Court.  And I'm not certain what I should say to Mr. Webster, but in any event, the information contributed to the decision that we took yesterday.  So thank you all very much.  

Could the witness now be prepared to resume his testimony?  

Mr. Rapp. 
WITNESS G, 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to deal with the financing of the Interahamwe.  Beginning in the formation of the Interahamwe in November of 1991, how were funds raised and spent for the expenses of the organisation?  
A.	When the Interahamwe were set up in November 1991, there were no funds.  As it turned out, we had to organise rallies, and our members needed uniforms and other things for those rallies.  Thanks to President Juvénal Habyarimana, we were given funds.  Through Désiré Murenzi  we were given 500,000 francs.  The money was used to rent buses and to buy uniforms.  It was also used to buy refreshments for after the rallies.  Later on, members contributed.  The contributions were based on each person's income.  Generally, however, each member gave 50 Rwandan francs.  This was the practice up until 1992.  

When the Interahamwe were created in the préfectures, the committees of the MRND in the préfectures wanted to organise rallies.  When they wanted to do so, they gathered the necessary funding to organise those rallies.  When they wanted to invite the Interahamwe from Kigali, they would send money to the MRND executive committee.  That committee would rent buses so that the Interahamwe could travel to the préfectures who were organising those rallies.  At times there were people who had their own vehicles.  They would have free gasoline vouchers from Petrorwanda.  That's how financing from the préfectures continued.  

Then in 1993, the president of the republic organised a fund-raising campaign.  It was at the Ribeiro Horizon Hotel.  Many members of the executive committee of the MRND were there, as were many financiers.  During that event they promised 1.5 million.  These are the only fund-raising events that I can recall during my time there.  
Q.	Witness, just, first of all, a question of value.  In the period of '92, '93, '94, the rate of exchange for the Rwanda franc and the US dollar, what was it, approximately?  
A.	I believe that one US dollar was worth 80 Rwandan francs in 1992.  Up until 1993, the US dollar was worth 175 Rwandan francs.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Some point of clarification about the flow of funds.  Did the national committee of the Interahamwe have a treasury?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And on Exhibit P. 9, can you tell me who was in charge of the treasury and who had to approve any disbursements from the treasury, by reference to number of the individuals that are named there?  
A.	Encashment was organised by number 2 on the list and by number 5 on the list.  
Q.	Now, the half a million Rwandan francs, worth maybe around $6,000 in '92, that came from President Habyarimana, did that go through the national treasury?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	You mentioned the one-and-a-half million Rwandan francs that were promised to (Microphone not activated)... Ribeiro Horizon Hotel under the -- under the -- as part of the fund-raising campaign initiated by the President in 1993.  Did those funds go through the treasury, the national treasury -- or the treasury of the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President.  Could counsel please repeat that question for the benefit of the interpreters. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp?
MR. RAPP:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There's a problem.  Could you repeat the last minute or so?  
MR. RAPP:
Thank you, Your Honour.  And I'm sorry it wasn't clear.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	You mentioned 1.5 million Rwandan francs that was pledged at a fund-raising event in 1993, under the sponsorship of a fund-raising event that was part of the fund-raising programme organised by President Habyarimana and that that event, it was at the Ribeiro Horizon Hotel.  Did those funds flow through the treasury of the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	If my memory serves me well, during the fund-raising event at the Ribeiro horizon Hotel, the President gave 300,000 Rwandan francs to show -- or set an example.  The president of the republic directly gave that money.  The remaining 1.2 million went through channels that I am not aware of.  I don't know whether it was deposited into the Interahamwe account.  That money could have been          recuperated (sic) by a group of people who handed the money over to the executive committee of the MRND.  The executive committee of the MRND used those funds by hand- -- handing it, rather, to other individuals besides the treasurer.  
Q.	Witness, could you just estimate how much -- how much Rwandan francs flowed through the treasury of the national committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	As I told you before, during the fund-raising event organised by the president of the republic, only 300,000 was handed to the treasurer.  
Q.	I was looking for a more comprehensive answer dealing with the entire period during which there was a treasury of the national committee of the Interahamwe.  If you could estimate the total amount of funds that might have flowed through that treasury, in Rwandan francs.  
A.	I will give you an estimate.  I would say one million Rwandan francs.  
Q.	Now, let's return for a moment to that fund-raising event at the Ribeiro Horizon Hotel.  You mentioned that the president himself began the giving by donating 300,000 Rwandan francs but that a total of 1.5 million was pledged.  Who else, if you recall, pledged funds to the Interahamwe at that event?  
A.	On that occasion, there was Mr. Joseph Nzirorera who promised -- who pledged 300,000 francs.  There was the director of the Rwandan Commercial Bank who pledged about 200,000 Rwandan francs.  There was also the manager of Continental Bank, Pasteur Musabe, who pledged about 500,000 Rwandan francs.  There was Mr. Augustin Bizimungu who also pledged an amount.  There was Augustin Ngirabatware who also pledged some few hundred thousand francs.  And there was   Séraphin Rwabakumba who pledged audio equipment which was to be used during rallies organised by the MRND.  
Q.	Thank you very much, Witness.  
A.	I can say only those people.  That's all I can remember.  
Q.	Witness, we'll depart now from the issue of fund-raising.  We may deal with it again in the closed session.  

The -- let's go to another subject.  During this period -- and we're now after November of '92 and into 1993 -- what attracted young people, or people, to join the Interahamwe?  
A.	As I said yesterday, during the establishment of the Interahamwe, there were promises that the MRND, through ministries and parastatal organisations, were going to -- the MRND was going to ask the managers or ministers of the ministries and the parastatal bodies to employ the Interahamwe who were unemployed.  And many other Interahamwe were recruited because of the expectations of employment.  There was the ministry of public works, which had work for construction, and then there was the ministry of transport and communications.  There was Electrogaz and OCRT, and all these bodies and ministries were led by MRND members.  

And with those who were in business, they were promised that banks -- commercial banks, led by members of the MRND, would be approached in order to ensure funding for their businesses and -- through easy loans.  And this is how people were attracted to the Interahamwe.  

I can mention the case of number 2 on our list and number 3.  These people, during the multiparty era, they were part of the MDR.  They were members of the MDR.  Number 2, number 3, and number 10 were -- were involved in recruitment for the MDR, and they were very vigilant.  And since they were drawing away a lot of the MRND members, the MRND recruited themselves -- recruited them by promising them loans from banks.  They did not hesitate, and they were there right at the beginning of the Interahamwe meetings.  They abandoned the MDR and joined the MRND.  That's all I can say.  
Q.	Just one clarification, Witness.  You mentioned OCR tay (phonetic) or T.  What was that?  
A.	OCRT was a parastatal body managed by a member of the MRND whose name was Bichel - Michel Bagaragaza, Michel Bagaragaza.  It was a parastatal which was responsible for managing the tea factories in Rwanda, and it was very easy for members to have employment in the tea factories in Gisenyi, Gikongoro and everywhere where there were tea plantations.  It was easy for them to obtain employment because the MRND had, as its members, the manager of this company.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Yesterday you told us that you continued to attend rallies of the MRND in which the Interahamwe participated on into 1993.  Did you attend a rally of the MRND at Nyamirambo stadium in Kigali on the 7th of November 1993? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this answer has been extracted and filed under seal)  

MR. RAPP:
Your Honours, I think perhaps we've come close to identifying the individual if one puts together all of the information, so I would ask that that last answer be placed under seal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is so ordered.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Let me at this time, with the Court's permission, ask that the video system play some clips from that rally on November 7th, and then we want to ask you if you recall those particular presentations.  And this is in a series of CD digitised audio that we have provided to the Defence -- digitised video and audio.  And it's the matters that are on a certain series of KV numbers, 394A, 394B, and 395.  First let's go to the 394A at minute -- is that the one we're going to? -- minute 32 of 394A, and ask if that can be played on the system so that you can see it -- so we can see it in the courtroom and you can see it here at the -- and you can see it at The Hague.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Rapp, do you want him to see the video and hear what was said?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, I do.  
JUDGE SHORT:
Then ask him questions about what he has already heard.  
MR. RAPP:
Excuse me.  Just a moment.  Stop the video.  The Judge is putting a question here.  

Yes, the witness indicates that he believes he attended the rally.  Obviously we would be playing it for two reasons:  one, to refresh his recollection, which is somewhat uncertain in regard to the -- to the attendance of the rally and what he heard; and two, if indeed he attended the rally and this appears to be a correct record of what he saw and heard, we'd be using him as a foundation witness to offer this as an exhibit in the case.  

And as you indicate, we would then also be asking him to comment on any remarks made at the rally and what he understood at least one of the speakers to -- to say at the rally.  

We have a technical problem that it's showing on the laptop but not on the screen in the booth.  Sometimes that requires hitting the function button and -- 

Well, Your Honours, let's skip to the next subject, and we can play this after the -- after our next break, whether it's in mid-morning or this afternoon.  Okay.  Well, anyway, let's proceed.  

BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Okay.  Witness --
MR. RAPP:
It's ready now?  Okay, if it's ready, then we'll go ahead.  Can we now show that first segment, the one that's 394A at 32 minutes.  
(Video played)
MR. RAPP:
I think that's sufficient on that clip.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Let's ask the witness then:  Who is that speaking?  
A.	This was Mr. Joseph Nzirorera.  
Q.	And do you recall this specific occasion now that you've seen the particular footage of the rally?  
A.	You know, I can't be specific because I did not see whether it was at the Nyamirambo stadium.  It was difficult for me to determine that.  So I cannot say that I attended this particular rally.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, let's move ahead to the next clip which perhaps provides a more complete background of the -- of the location.  Let's go to 394B at about 14 minutes and 40 seconds into that video.  
(Video played)
MR. RAPP:
I think that's sufficient.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Okay.  Witness, I believe that gave a broader angle of the event.  Do you recognise the location, and do you remember the presentation?  
A.	Yes.  The speech was made by Mr. Édouard Karemera, and it was at Nyamirambo, and I do believe I was present on that occasion in Nyamirambo.  
Q.	And, Witness, in that particular clip, I saw people in uniform standing behind the speaker.  What -- what -- who were those people, or what organisation, if you know, were they affiliated to?  
A.	These people were wearing the MRND uniform.  They were the Interahamwe of the MRND.  
Q.	And I heard a reaction where there was a chanting of some kind.  What was -- if you could hear it and if you're familiar with that chant, what was -- what were they saying?  
A.	You know, all the parties had their own chants or songs, speaking of unity, development, and peace.  Unity, development, and peace.  For the MRND, it was preaching unity, development, and peace, and that's what many people would sing about.  And on this particular occasion, as I just heard, it was a song or chant which talked of peace, development, and peace (sic), which the MRND should continue to protect.  Generally speaking, that's what it was about.  
Q.	Let me -- we may come back to this in a moment, but let's go ahead to the last segment from this particular -- excuse me.  We may come back to this in a moment, but let's go back to the last segment from this rally, and that's in tape 395 or KV00395, and that's the segment that begins at about 16 minutes in that tape and ask you to look at that.  
(Video played)

1100H
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Now that we have looked at the particular clip, Witness, were you able to see that clip at The Hague? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And who was speaking there? 
A.	Mathieu Ngirumpatse. 
Q.	And do you recall that particular speech? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	And what is Mr. Ngirumpatse saying at the time and -- in that speech? 
A.	This speech was made while the opposition parties were in Brussels at a meeting with the RPF.  The MRND was invited but refused the invitation.  During that rally he is telling the population that those people who were in the Brussels meeting, whenever they tell us they are protecting the Hutus, how could they do so when they are negotiating with the RPF?  The coalition -- the CDR requested a seat in the government to represent the Hutus.  Those are the same people in the opposition who refused a seat for the CDR in the government.  So they said that they were in favour of protecting the Hutu masses; so he is saying that he would never go to secret meetings but only public meetings during the day -- in broad daylight, rather.  That was the essence of that rally. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, I had an objection in principle regarding the methods used by the Prosecution right now.  First, they are showing clips from video but only excerpts from it; this can lead to all kinds of manipulation and things out of context.  

Second objection, if we are going to be made aware of the content of a speech, it would have been preferable to transcribe it and then translate it, rather than have a witness give an approximate reading thereof.  He explained it was, more or less, what he understood from the speech.  This is not reflective of the sincerity of what was said, and I do not think this approach is acceptable.  And we cannot base ourselves on the witness's appreciation of that speech.  It would have been preferable to have a transcription and translation of the speech, but also for the entire document, the entire video be tendered into evidence, and not just excerpts thereof.  I would ask that the witness's last answer and comments on the video be stricken from the record.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we are largely in accord with, at least, what our learned colleague is requesting in this case.  And we think it is important for that reason to -- when the witness does see an event that he had familiarity with and can comment on it, because of his own understanding of what was occurring at the time, to put in the record itself.  And for that reason we will be seeking leave of the Court to admit these CD-ROMs, these three CDs that contain the entire record from the MRND meeting, the official party video.  

And, additionally, I was prepared to ask the witness to go to Tab 233 here, in a moment, in a binder which will show the transcripts of these speeches by these three individuals in their original Kinyarwanda and French translation.  I don't know if that is necessary to lay that foundation with the witness, because they were documents prepared by our registry.  If the Court wishes to save time, I would simply propose that we offer the video, the three segments, as I think -- we are in the 12, A, B, C and then the segments from Tabs 232 and 233 containing the transcripts of the witnesses that we would have corresponding numbers to them.  I will leave it to the Court and the registry to determine how to do that because, obviously, we have a Kinyarwanda and French transcript or translation of each of the speeches.  

So, if the Court wishes me to lay additional foundation by having the witness confirm that this is a record of what he heard, we can do that, but it is, of course, merely a transcription of what appears on this video. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I can state our position on this:  We favour the admission of the video in its entirety.  And, in fact, I was intending to go into this in my cross-examination and admit the video.  Also we favour admission of transcripts; I would think they are more reliable than the witness's summary.  So, we also favour the admissions of the document in Tab 232 and Tab 233.  

However, this raises an issue with respect to transcripts and translation that this is the first time this issue has come up and it is probably going to arise a few other times during the trial; and that is that we understand that this is the best efforts of the language section to transcribe and translate what was actually said.  In some cases, however, we have prepared our own translations or, in other cases, even experts have provided translations of the same material, and they differ in some respects by those being offered by the Prosecution.  It is our position that the Prosecution should be allowed to have its translations admitted and we should be allowed to have our translations admitted.  And if it become necessary, if there are material differences that are important, then testimony can be taken as to which -- which weight the Trial Chamber should give to which translation.  So, with that caveat, I don't have objection to the admission of either the video in their entirety or the transcripts of this meeting.  Thank you. 
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, with your leave, Mr. President, I also have something to say on this issue.  First, I embrace Mr. Weyl's motion.  I don't understand how a witness can interpret a speech.  The witness is simply here to say what he experienced or what he saw, and not to interpret speeches.  This is a useless exercise in my view, and the parties should be provided the transcripts of the entirety of these speeches.  Thank you. 
MR. RAPP:
Mr. President, Your Honours, first of all, in regard to the objection to the witness, we have a witness who was an eyewitness, who was part of this milieu at the time.  And when witnesses -- when he hears speeches and they are speeches that he specifically recalls, I suggest that he can tell us what he understood the speaker to mean --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, this is not what actually happened in this case.  These speeches had been -- were captioned, even I could tell who the speakers were, because the name was written on the clip.  And then he heard what the speech said, and then you asked him what the speech said, so his memory was refreshed by hearing the video.  So, this affects the weight that we can ascribe to his testimony.  It is not normal for a witness to be -- have his memory refreshed from documents that he did not prepare.  So it affects the weight of what he says, because all he did was reproduce what he saw and hear in the video.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, you will recall that the witness was uncertain about what occurred and whether he attended these particular rallies, so it was important to refresh his recollection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
In --
MR. RAPP:
And I submit, that under the precedents of this Tribunal we have many times given witnesses statements from other sources to refresh their recollection. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
In examination-in-chief?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought it was to refresh their recollection from statements that they made from notes that they made at the time. 
MR. RAPP:
Well --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is usually a practice in cross-examination, they are cross-examining a witness; but I didn't realize that one cross-examined or used those techniques in examination-in-chief. 

MR. RAPP:
I'm willing to go back, Your Honour, and to see if this Tribunal occasions when this has been down, both in direct and cross-examination here, because of the nature of historical events, and the need if a witness recalls something and doesn't recall it completely, he can refresh his recollection from other documents and it has occurred.  And I think that is inconsistent with the rule that I follow from my system and, I think, presumably, from yours, but it is a practice that has occurred here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the discussion is a little bit unnecessary at this stage, because we have a situation here now where there is no -- where the clip is going to be admitted in its entirety, so there is no controversy over the admission of the clip and the translation.  But there is just something that I would like to consult first before making a further statement on this issue.  It will be just one moment. 

Mr. Rapp. 
MR. RAPP:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is clear that the issue of admission of the clips and the -- not the clips, the admission of the speeches in the format of a video and also the translation, the transcription of the Kinyarwanda to French is not contentious.  Now, I don't understand why there was not some administrative arrangement.  This is something that should not take up trial time.  If both sides agree on the issues of these materials, couldn't we have the parties submit a list with these documents so they are admitted within a            five-minute segment at some stage of the proceeding?  
MR. RAPP:
(Microphone not activated)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, are you going to allow --   
MR. RAPP:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel, microphone. 
MR. RAPP:
But obviously we are dealing with a specific issue here.  Obviously, we also would be -- we have been attempting to use the witness as a foundation for the admission of these items; and, obviously, if there is no dispute as to that, we can get them straight in -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well --

MR. RAPP:
And he can comment to them if he wishes because they will be items in evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I just thought that the comment should be made that we think that the witness is entitled to comment on the speeches.  My comment had to do with the technique of using the video to refresh his memory, which I don't think is quite proper, you have not persuaded me on that issue.  But the witness is entitled to be asked what he understood and then to express his opinion about it, I would think. 
MR. RAPP:
It is just -- and I don't want to belabour the issue, understand that it is a difference.  It is refreshing whether he was there or not and not specifically what was said.  That is the way we were using.  But I think our issue here is resolved for the moment.  I don't know if it is necessary to engage in anything further.  Hopefully, before we proceed with later examination, we can determine whether other video clips or other documents that we will ask the witness to comment on are objectionable to the Defence, and that would make it much easier for us to put it before the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honour's microphone, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I presume the Defence already knows what exhibits you are tendering through this witness. 
MR. RAPP:
That is correct, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That facilitates my question. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Let me make our position clear, and maybe this can answer some of the problem.  When a witness can provide sufficient foundation for the admission of the contents of a speech at a meeting which is in the indictment, we prefer that, where it is available, the actual transcripts and the video be admitted rather than a witness's recollection, because that is the most accurate evidence that this Trial Chamber should have.  And we believe that when that kind of evidence is before the Trial Chamber, it will help our Defence.  It will show what was really said, not what somebody later claims was said.  So we are in favour of that.  

On the other hand, if the Prosecution is unable to lay a foundation at all for any evidence as to what occurred at a particular meeting being brought, then we not going to agree.  So we are insisting that a foundation be laid before they can admit the contents of any particular meeting.  Once they lay the foundation, as they did in this case, then we prefer that the transcripts and the video be admitted, and we won't object to that.  But I don't think we are in a position to make some kind of stipulation in advance of hearing the testimony of the witness as to whether or not there is a sufficient foundation for the speech or the event to be brought into evidence.  So, I don't think we are able to really shortcut so much as you would like for that reason. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, my question was not really asking for a stipulation.  I didn't expect in a criminal trial that you would make a stipulation.  But this is an issue where there is no issue on the issue of what is to be exhibited.  In this case, for example, the Prosecutor was going through a process that was quite unnecessary when the Defence was saying, Look we want the entire speech introduced; we want the transcript and the translation introduced, and you said that you wanted an alternative translation introduced.  To my way of thinking, that is administrative.  There are no legal issues here.  And I was trying to ensure that our trial time was not wasted dealing with matters that are not controversial.  So to me, my question had to do with, how do we manage this without wasting time on unnecessary issues?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand that, and not to spend my time defending Mr. Rapp, but honestly, until he provided that foundation that the witness could remember this meeting, I wasn't prepared to agree to the admission of the transcript, at least, with this witness.  So, I think what he did was necessary. And so, at least, from my prospective that is the kind of foundation that has to be laid before transcripts can come in.

To further muddy the waters, I just would advise the Trial Chamber that there was a case from the Appeals Chamber in ICTY called Hadzihasanovic that was decided, I believe, in March 2004.  And the holding of that case was essentially that memory -- a witness's memory can be refreshed from documents other than those prepared by the witness.  And I believe that is contrary to the way the English system works and other common-law systems, but it is in accord with the way we do things in the United States.  It is actually said in the United States that can you refresh a witness's memory with anything, even a ham sandwich, they say.  

And, so, we discussed -- Mr. Webster will probably recall that this issue came up in the first trial and it was finally determined that this Appeals Chamber decision does allow for a witness's testimony to be refreshed by things other than their own statements.  So I have that helpful information for you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  That might clear the water rather than muddy it, but thank you very much. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I think I know how I will proceed in the future.  We will try to lay a small amount of foundation for these exhibits without the witness commenting on what was said.  And then if they are admitted with that foundation, and then we will proceed to the comments.  

So, in that last case, we did both at the same time and I think that created the problem here.  But that said, we got the housekeeping.  And I will leave it to the registry how things should be numbered, but we have these three exhibits, these three CDs that have been previously disclosed to the Defence which have on them the numbers 394A, 394B and 395.  

And then in the -- in the binders, at 232 there are, in fact -- at 232 there is the French.  It begins with the French of Karemera, followed by the Kinyarwanda of Karemera, followed by the French of Nzirorera, followed by the Kinyarwanda of Nzirorera.  And then at 233, is the French of Ngirumpatse and the Kinyarwanda of Ngirumpatse.  That seems to me that we have, really, a total of nine specific pieces here, three CDs and six transcripts, or three translations and three transcriptions.  And I would propose that they come in as 12A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, that is, Prosecution exhibits.  
JUDGE SHORT:
But, Mr. Rapp, the one issue which I think is important is this, that if what someone said at a rally is important, if a statement made is critical and important, then it is important for the witness to indicate before playing the tape what his recollection is of what was said.  But if you are only interested with what he understood, having laid the foundation that he heard the speech or was there, and you are only interested in his understanding of what was said, I guess there is no harm in playing the speech and asking him what he understood by that.  But if what was said is what is in issue, then there is no value in his testimony if you play the tape to him and then ask him to, virtually, repeat what he has already heard.  It loses its value completely. 
MR. RAPP:
I understand, Your Honour.  Just dealing with the practical things, we have a witness here who said that he attended many rallies.  He couldn't recall which rally this was.  It was only after everything was played through that he recollected it.  And so, we have a difficult issue:  He is both refreshed, and to some extent, we lose some of the weight and value that his testimony would have because it is impossible to ask somebody about something that happened 12 years ago and remember it with great precision as having occurred at a specific event.  

So, obviously, if we can, in many cases, as we were prepared yesterday on the CDR rally to ask for recollection without playing any tape at all, that is very good.  But sometimes we may have to play the tape in order that the witness be refreshed sufficiently that he can remember what was said and that he was there.  
JUDGE SHORT:
I assume that you know what your case is, what your witness knows beforehand.  I mean, you must know beforehand whether a witness attended a rally.  And you must know from his statements to you what he knows and what he is going to testify about. 
MR. RAPP:
Well, obviously, we meet with witnesses beforehand and talk to them, but when you deal with events that stretched over such a period and dates and times and places, witnesses aren't prepared to such a rehearsed state that they remember every date exactly.   They need, naturally, to be refreshed about the event, and then we want them to reflect on and tell us about their own recollection, rather than anything that came out of preparation.

Your Honour, if we are -- as far as the exhibits are concerned, are we settled with that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar, how do you receive these exhibits in a clear manner?  Do we give all three videos the same number or -- Mr. Registrar? 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, as far as the numbering system 12A through I would be okay.  We just need to be sure which one is which. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  And they are admitted, Exhibits 12A through I. 
(Exhibits No. P. 12A, P. 12B, P. 12C, P. 12D, P. 12E, P. 12F, P. 12G, P. 12H, P. 12I admitted) 
MR. RAPP:
And if only as a housekeeping suggestion, when these kinds of things occur, if there was some notations when the document is prepared about what has been offered and admitted, if there could be a reference to tab numbers so people could keep track of themselves of what is in evidence and what has merely been disclosed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where are the exhibits that you are tendering?  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we provided, of course, the set -- 
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, this is from The Hague.  We have a problem with the numbering of exhibits, particularly between 232 and 233; if the registry in Arusha could repeat the numbers, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  The process is not yet concluded and we are still trying to get it clarified now.  And as soon as that is done, the registrar will repeat the numbers for you.
MR. JUMA:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp, do you have the material that is being tendered?  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, of course, we have the material and each do.  I mean, it was our vision -- I believe the team's vision here that since the registry has been provided a copy of these documents, that they would then remove them from their binders and those would become the specific exhibits that would go into evidence.  

Obviously, it is possible for us to pull them out of our binders and hand them across, which would be the normal practice, but then we would end up with an incomplete set on this side.  So maybe            Mr. Morley, who has been involved in the organisation of materials, can address this subject.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar has indicated his preferred method of approach, because you have to recognise that part of this issue now is for the Court to be able to maintain an accurate record which is useful to the Judges, so I will just ask Mr. Fry to express himself, which may be helpful.  
MR. FRY:
Thank you, Your Honour.  Yes, if the Prosecution could just go one by one, Exhibit 12A is this CD, and it reference and then we can --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your microphone. 
MR. FRY:
Sorry, if the Prosecution could go one by one, 12A through I and indicate which tab refers to which number.  That's all.
MR. MORLEY:
May I address Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues.  Your Honour has so many binders, I apologise to some extent for that.  I know Your Honour is interested in electronic copies of things.  And it may be that the reason you have so much hard copy presented in over nine volumes is because of an element of influence from my own background, whereas Your Honour may be familiar -- the use of files in Court is more prevalent than the use of electronic mechanisms of identifying exhibits.  

I am quite anxious as we start this trial to ensure that we don't lose sight of what is going into evidence and what is in the binders and what has yet to go into evidence.  And when an exhibit is referred to by it P number, that it is referable to its tab number within the bundles which have been prepared, because I can envisage that by the time we got through half of the nine binders, which have a plethora of documents in them, if what is happening is the registry is taking documents out of their nine binders and not putting them back, we are going to be at cross purposes as to where everything is. 

So my suggestion is and has always been -- but I'm now getting an opportunity to articulate it before Your Honours, that on each occasion that an exhibit is identified as being entered into evidence, it is given a P number.  And we can assist Mr. Fry with identifying exactly what document that P number refers to.  But each P number should have after it, in brackets, as a notation, the tab number so that the Prosecution exhibit marked P can be immediately found within the Court working bundle, which is the nine bundles, with Tabs 1 to 276, and it will no doubt get larger as the trial goes along.  

When a document is identified and entered into evidence as a P number, I envisaged and I hope this assist Mr. Fry, the document comes out of Mr. Fry's bundle which consists of the nine binders; it gets entered into TRIM, but then the next day it goes back into -- I see he is shaking his head.  In an ideal world, it goes back into Mr. Fry's bundle, marked on the top right-hand corner as Prosecution exhibit P whatever, entered into evidence such and such a date, because then we will have in working form visually presentable to the Trial Chamber, and all counsel, a record of what is in evidence, when, by reference to the tab numbers.  So the only thing that I have seen Mr. Fry shake his head to -- and I'm wondering whether he may be open to, as it were, revisitation in his mind about this -- is the business of once the document has been entered into TRIM, it cannot come back and be put back into his own bundle.  I'm wounding whether that is simply something we can get around somehow.  

The important thing here is to maintain the integrity of the files which Mr. Fry works from and which the rest of us work from, and I see that he is nodding his head with respect to that.   And with Your Honour's permission, I would invite Mr. Fry to indicate whether documents coming back from TRIM and going back into Mr. Fry's bundle is feasible.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I do not think that the courtroom time should be used for this purpose.  This is an administrative activity.  We asked our trial coordinator to work with the teams to get this accomplished some time ago.  What I am going to propose is that another meeting is established as soon as possible to try to resolve this issue.  I don't think that we should do it during our courtroom sitting time.  

So we are going to have to travail as best we can today, and, hopefully, as within -- as soon as possible we will try to get the matter resolved.  You all must take into account the fact that the purpose of adducing evidence is so that the Judges can adjudicate.  So some care must be taken that we are able to utilise information which is exhibited, and that has been a problem for us up to now in this matter.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I see the force of that.  I apologise that I have taken up a little bit of time, but I'm conscious of the fact that Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues need to be able to work from the material that is going around the Court. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Rapp.  

MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I don't want to divert time on housekeeping.  I suspect that Mr. Fry and I could meet during the break, and we can determine exactly which item was A, and which was B, C, D and E.  And then we could announce that afterwards, and rather than spending time here mentioning K numbers    et cetera and wasting time with The Hague, if that is okay. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, what would useful is, I think, that all of the players need to be informed of this, so the Defence should also participate in that.  If it is possible to just prepare a documentary list, and that is circulated so that everybody would be on the same page, that, I think, would facilitate it.  But I prefer if you proceed now. 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you very much, Your Honour.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Let's go on to talk about -- okay, we were discussing this particular rally in November of 1997 (sic).  And I want to discuss this general period that followed the rally on November 7th, 1993.  You had indicated yesterday, you had discussed this arms distribution of 400 arms.  And I wonder if you could fix that precisely in time.  You may have done it yesterday, but refresh us, if you did, about approximately when those 400 arms were distributed to the Interahamwe in the secteurs of Kigali? 
A.	The 400 weapons were distributed before the arrival of the RPF in Kigali, and I place myself in the second half of the year, 1993.  
Q.	Were they distributed before the arrival of the United Nations peacekeeping force known as UNAMIR or MINUAR? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you happen to know -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Mr. Rapp.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Under the Arusha Accords that were enforced by that peacekeeping force, do you know if it was allowed for individuals like the Interahamwe in the secteurs to have these kinds of arms in their possession? 
A.	In the Arusha Accords the bearing of weapons by individuals was not allowed.   
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness gave an example of a kind of individual, but this interpreter did not hear it properly. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you ask the witness to repeat his testimony, please?  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, the interpreter had a problem with your answer in terms of a missed part of it.  Could you repeat your answer? 
A.	The Arusha Accords did not allow individuals such as the Interahamwe to bear arms. 
Q.	Well, do you know if the UNAMIR did anything to enforce this prohibition on arms by persons such as members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I know that at a given point in time, UNAMIR wanted to carry out searches for weapons in some parts of Kigali where the Interahamwe lived. 
Q.	Do you know if the Interahamwe knew of those searches before they were conducted? 
A.	Each time that such searches were going to take place, the Interahamwe were warned. 
Q.	How do you know that the Interahamwe were warned? 
A.	There was a meeting between Dallaire and the minister for defence.  During that meeting Dallaire was telling -- telling the minister of defence that UNAMIR was going to carry out searches.  Now, the minister for defence on that occasion, since he was the one who had given the 800 guns to                Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, he called Mathieu, summoned him and told him that soon UNAMIR was going to carry out searches, so they needed to do everything possible so that the weapons were not taken by UNAMIR.  

After that meeting between Mathieu and the minister for defence, Mathieu called -- convened the Interahamwe committee, including Number 1 from -- from Number 1 to Number 5 on our list attended that meeting.  And he said to those people, that soon UNAMIR was going to start searches and that they must be careful and informed the people to hide the weapons.  Subsequently, he allegedly said to Number 1 that every time there was to be a search done by UNAMIR, they would be forewarned by the gendarmerie chief of staff.  Mr. Augustin Ndindiliyimana needed to warn them because when UNAMIR were circulating in the town or were to carry out searches, they were always accompanied by the gendarmes of the national gendarmerie.  So each time there was a search, the Interahamwe were warned and the weapons were moved. 
Q.	Did the national committee of the Interahamwe take a position, public position, regarding the deployment of UNAMIR -- or the actions of UNAMIR? 
A.	I didn't quite understand your question, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	Did the national committee of the Interahamwe take any position, publicly, regarding the actions of UNAMIR? 
A.	Yes, I believe there was, indeed -- the letter was written, I believe, to the secretary general -- the special representative of the United Nation's secretary general.  It was said that the manner adopted by UNAMIR for searching for weapons together with Rwandan soldiers was not appropriate and that this needed to be reviewed because, otherwise, that method may aggravate the prevailing situation in Kigali. 
Q.	Would you describe the process by which this letter was written? 
A.	That letter was written to Mr. Booh-Booh on that occasion, and it was prepared in lawyer's chambers of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who had summoned the national committee plus the individuals, Number 1 to Number 11.  And he guided (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal) in the way that the letter needed to be drafted.  The letter was drafted and, I believe, it was signed by individuals Number 1 to Number 11.  It was re-read by Mathieu Ngirumpatse to see whether there was information to be added to it or material to be removed from the letter.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Just a moment, in terms of the record being in a public session, there was the use of the                    (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal) at one point there.  And we would ask that that word be stricken, obviously, that would tend to identity this particular individual.  If you heard the answer he said, (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and filed under seal).  And so we would simply ask that the word (By order of the Court, this word was extracted and filed under seal) be stricken from the public record? 
MR. PRESIDENT:	
So ordered.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, and I would ask now that a document be placed before you.
MR. RAPP:
And I would like the Judges here and those in The Hague to look at it.  In the binder we have Tab 86; this is in the second binder.  It is a document that begins with the words, "MRND/Interahamwe19/01/1994".  If I could ask the registry to place that document in front of you? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I think I am the only one here in possession of you scheduling order, but in looking at it, it seems that we were supposed to recess at 11:30, so I'm just calling that to your attention. 
MR. RAPP:
We are prepared to work through break, Your Honour, so whatever -- we know an order is an order, so if there is a break, we are glad to observe it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I suppose we ought to take a recess.  We were trying to make up time, but I think probably it might be more sensible to take a short recess at this time; 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1153H to 1217H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I was unclear whether I was to proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. RAPP:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Let's turn -- we were at the break looking for Tab 86, and asking that the witness have Tab 86 placed in front of him at The Hague, a document in which the cover pages indicates MRND/Interahamwe/19/01/1994.  Is that document in front of the witness at The Hague?
MR. JUMA:
Yes, Your Honour? 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	I'm not sure -- Witness, is the document in front of you? 
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	And is that the letter that you have described that prepared in Ngirumpatse's office with him, and signed by the 11 people on P. 9? 
A.	Yes, this is the letter written to Mr. Booh-Booh which is signed by the 11 persons, figuring on P. 9. 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we would asked that this be admitted as Prosecution Exhibit P. 13. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, P.  13.
(Exhibit No. P. 13 admitted)
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Now, Witness, you had, in your answers before the break, discussed searches to be initiated, or were initiated by UNAMIR, and under the command of General Dallaire to seek out weapons in Kigali that were held contrary to the peace that UNAMIR was enforcing.  Do you know if Dallaire was receiving any information -- 
A.	For UNAMIR?  
Q.	Yeah.  Witness, I was just formulating my question, if you will wait just a moment.  Do you know if Dallaire and MINUAR were receiving any information of the Interahamwe having arms in Kigali? 
A.	According to what we heard in Kigali at that time there was someone among the Interahamwe who worked for UNAMIR, who was an informant, in fact. 
Q.	Do you have any knowledge of who this informant was that was informing on the Interahamwe to UNAMIR? 
A.	It was Emmanuel Turatsinze, but we call him Kassim. 
Q.	Now, yesterday you mentioned in the context of the distribution of arms Mr. Turatsinze, himself; was he the same Turatsinze who was involved in distributing the arms to the Interahamwe, obtaining the 800 and giving 400 to Number 1 to be distributed in Kigali?  
A.	He is the same one. 
Q.	Who -- what specific role did he play in the Interahamwe in late 1993 and early 1994? 
A.	Emmanuel Turatsinze was in charge of being the middleman, or the intermediate person between Ngirumpatse and the Interahamwe.  In other words, whenever Ngirumpatse had something to tell the Interahamwe, if he could not see Number 1, he would go to Turatsinze to find Number 1.  Turatsinze worked for the MRND, he worked at the MRND office in Kigali. 
Q.	Well, did you receive any information indicating that Dallaire knew from an informant about the specific possession of arms by the Interahamwe in Kigali? 
A.	The information that Turatsinze had to give to Dallaire as an informant, at one point in time we no longer saw him; during that period we began to say that Turatsinze was an informant working for Dallaire. 
Q.	Just by way of identification, if it is possible -- we have a photograph that has been exhibited here as    P -- the photograph -- this particular photograph is exhibited as what item? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
That is P. 6.
MR. RAPP:
If this could be placed on the Elmo, I don't believe it is with the witness in The Hague, I believe if it is placed on the Elmo, it is possible then for the technicians to show the courtroom and The Hague the image of that document.  

Now, is it possible for that to show on the courtroom monitor, technical booth?  We are still looking at myself on the monitor, I don't think I am the one.  Is it possible to --
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, it seems we have a small technical problem with the machine. 
MR. RAPP:
Yes, well we will deal with that later.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Let me ask you to take a look at Tab Number 85 and in the binder, a document that has been labeled MRND1101/1994.  I think -- excuse me, we will have you do that, but at the same time I think our system is now working adequately that we can show you the picture.

Witness, this is an exhibit in the case, Exhibit P. 6 that was sent to us, could you indicate, if you know, who you believe this individual to be, this picture to be an image of what individual, if you know?  
A.	Could you kindly move the photo down a bit?  

Still more, please.  
Q.	Witness, can you identify the individual in that photo? 
A.	It is very difficult for me to identify this person. 
(Pages 9 to 23 by Donna M. Lewis)

1230H 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	So we'll just take the picture off the Elmo and proceed to look at this Exhibit 85 -- or the item that's in Number 85.  And I just wanted to ask you, Witness, this item labeled "an outgoing code cable", have you seen this document before?  
A.	I believe that I've seen this document before. 
Q.	And what is the document?  
A.	It's a document that deals with Turatsinze and how he was giving information to UNAMIR.  
Q.	Now -- 
A.	And he -- he was saying that he was in charge of training.  He was talking about how that training was provided and how the Interahamwe were able to execute people.  He was talking about the fact that the killings were being prepared, and he was asking for protection.  In other words, he wanted to be brought out of the country with his family. 
Q.	Now, Witness, following the date of this cable or this date that's on the front of the cable, 11-1-1994, do you know if any inspections were made by Dallaire and UNAMIR without the presence of the -- the gendarmerie?  
A.	As for me, the searches that they wanted to carry out, there were always gendarmes, the searches that I heard that they had made in the secteurs in which the Interahamwe lived.  
Q.	Do you know if the information that's in this cable was communicated to -- to anyone in the MRND or the Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  
Q.	At this point, Witness, I'd like to ask you about another rally.  It's not one that we have on video, but a rally that took place about a week after this cable was issued on or about the -- well, I shouldn't say a week, about five days, 16 January 1994, at Nyamirambo stadium, a rally where Mr. Ngirumpatse spoke and Mr. Mugenzi spoke.  Do you recall that particular rally?  
A.	I know that in January or February 1994 there was a MRND rally, and during that rally, I believe the MRND had invited other members of other parties, and I believe it was the MDR and PL parties involved.  
Q.	Witness, did you -- do you recall attending the rally?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have an objection here.  There's absolutely nothing about this rally in any of the witness's prior statements or testimony in any previous case that I've been able to determine.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, first of all, I would note that this is a rally that is cited explicitly in this indictment in this case; and this witness has consistently talked about attending a number of rallies without focusing on the specific dates of those rallies; and, indeed, now he doesn't fix the particular date of this rally with any great precision.  And, obviously, in the kind of statements that were taken from him, the precision about the dates of rallies that occurred many years before the statements were taken would not normally be in the -- in the witness's statement.  And certainly it's possible for evidence to be led in this matter and, particularly, given the notice of if it's in the indictment, the items that have been disclosed in this case, including the -- the broadcast containing this particular rally that's in Tab 153. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could just briefly reply.  This is a different issue than what we've dealt with before.  I'm not claiming this is not in the indictment.  We have notice of it from the indictment.  The issue is we had no notice that this would be discussed by this witness, and that's a very important consideration in terms of allowing a witness to testify to new material.  That's why we have will-say statements and other forms of providing notice for each witness even of events that are in the indictment.  

Now, I know this witness's statements very well.  I know his testimony very well, and I could tell the Court -- and I am ready to be contradicted -- that he's not described any -- this meeting in any shape -- way, shape, or form, whether it be in any date range from January or February.  He has not described the meeting at which other party -- members of other parties were invited and made speeches, which this was somewhat unique because of that.  So we really have -- there's a lot.  This witness's testimony covers a lot of events, and we're prepared for a -- to cover the scope of his testimony.  But this is something that is not contained within anything that we were given notice of for this witness, and we ask that it not be allowed.  
MR. RAPP:
One additional point, Your Honour.  The purpose of leading this particular testimony as to this rally is not to present argument about the other political parties participating, but it's to deal with the specific issue that we've been exploring with the witness here, which is the weapons inspections in Kigali and to explore, in particular, a speech in which Mr. Ngirumpatse with whom this individual had had dealings, contemporaneous dealings, in terms of that letter that we discussed, commented on allegations regarding there being weapons distributed and training occurring.  And we submit that things in regard to the transactions with the -- with the Accused, speeches of the Accused relative to these events, are within the context of -- of his statement; and certainly it's possible for him to fill in with specific details that further support that basic allegation that Mr. Ngirumpatse was aware of -- of the weapons being distributed, was aware of -- of the searches for those weapons, was aware of the arming of the Interahamwe and was involved in trying to prevent UNAMIR from discovering it.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, if I could have one last word on this topic.  I just want to say that's all well and good.  It should have been in a will-say statement if they intended to lead this evidence.  That's the purpose of giving us advance notice, and it wasn't and so it shouldn't be allowed.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have a -- we have decided to allow the question in the case.  We think that the Defence objection is reasonable.  We think, however, that the evidence is admissible.  It's -- notice was in the indictment, and it is relevant and probative.  

But there's also another rule which requires the Prosecutor to give notice of what the witness is going to say, and that rule is what has been broken in this case.  Now, there are within -- basically two remedies for the breach of that rule:  One is what the Defence has asked, exclusion of the evidence; and the other is granting time where it might be appropriate to facilitate the ability of the Defence to cross-examine.  

We won't emphasise that we think that the principle that the Defence should not be taken by surprise is important.  If -- if there is a breach of that principle, it could affect the fairness of the trial.  And so we hope that this is not a -- a pattern or a policy that the Prosecutor has because we will not be allowing it in that way at all.  We think, however, that in this case that we allow the question and the answer; and, if necessary, we will the grant the Defence time to be able to respond to it effectively.  
MR. RAPP:
I want to be careful with exactly the question that was asked, but I believe it was that I asked the witness whether he had attended this particular rally at Nyamirambo stadium and to use the fact of the attendance of the others to determine, to fix it in his mind; and if he could be permitted now to respond to that.  
THE WITNESS:
I had said that the rally was organised by the MRND which had invited some members of the opposition parties.  I believe that was my last answer.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	The question is:  Did you attend that rally yourself?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you remember a speech by Mr. Ngirumpatse at that rally at which he discussed the United Nations and the UNAMIR mission?  
A.	I think I remember it vaguely.
Q.	Understanding that this may limit the probative value of your testimony as to what happened at the meeting, I would ask that for the purpose of refreshing your recollection that the document at Tab 153 be given to you and specifically there is -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Rapp, couldn't he just say something to indicate that he remembers something about the meeting?  Couldn't you ask him what he remembers?  He says he vaguely remembers.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	What do you remember of the meeting?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Specifically, you asked him about the speech. 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	What do you remember about the Ngirumpatse speech on that occasion?  
A.	Frankly, it's quite difficult for me to remember the content of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse's speech.  
Q.	Do you recall whether he spoke at that particular meeting?  
A.	Yes, I do remember that he spoke.  
Q.	Do you know if the speech itself was rebroadcast on the radio?  
A.	That's for sure.  If it wasn't on Radio Rwanda, there was RTLM; and the RTLM was in the habit of replaying all the speeches made by the MRND officials.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, with -- with that foundation, I'd like to offer material at Tab 17- -- excuse me -- Tab 153, being a radio broadcast of RTLM, this particular rally in Kinyarwanda and in French as 14A and B. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I'm going to take you up on your remedy that you have offered to me to have additional time -- or adequate time to prepare to deal with new material.  This transcript which  is -- and the next one 154, which also deals with the same meeting is about 40 pages in length in English.  There is actually an English version in both of these transcripts, and I haven't had a chance to review that because I didn't have any idea that this meeting would be the subject of this witness's testimony.  

In general, I favour the admission of transcripts over the recollection of the witness, especially in this case where he has no recollection.  And it may be that I agree that there's objection to this, but I have no way to read -- sit here and -- I shouldn't be required to sit here and scan it and make some decision about admissibility when I had no notice.  So I would ask that Mr. Rapp go to a different topic and he come back to this later in his examination, perhaps tomorrow; and then I can let you know whether or not I object. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp had hinted that he might be able to finish today. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I had more recent information to the contrary.  Perhaps he could advise you of that. 
JUDGE SHORT:
Mr. Rapp, why don't you wait for the witness who is going to testify about this rally to enter -- to enter the document through that witness?  I mean -- 
MR. RAPP:
Because we'll never have a better one than this.  Almost all of these -- 

JUDGE SHORT:
Already the witness has indicated he doesn't recollect what Ngirumpatse said, so what would be the purpose of entering the -- this document through him?  And the Defence are not going to be able to cross-examine him about it because he doesn't recollect what he said?
MR. RAPP:
Well, just -- 
JUDGE SHORT:
And it is going to result in the Defence asking for time to -- to look through all the transcripts?  So it's going to cause unnecessary delay.  Wouldn't it be better to wait for the witness who's going to speak to the document for that witness to tender it?  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, I want just to talk a moment about the reality that we deal with, dealing with the context of events in 1994 in Rwanda and having been in the Media trial where we offered more than twenty thousand pages of documents with no witness who could testify to their creation.  Our investigators said that they had received them in Rwanda at documentary centres, but it was impossible to tell how they'd been produced; and they were nonetheless allowed in under Rule 89.  It's -- whenever we could, we would find a witness who recollected some part of the event and that provides some greater foundation for the admission of the evidence.  But unless I'm mistaken, with -- with items like this radio broadcasts, the alternative to a witness who says -- who was there will be an investigator who is merely a custodian of records obtained during the course of an investigation, so that's -- that's the reality of the situation and what we have to deal with in terms of meeting our mandate to determine what happened in Rwanda.  

And so often the best evidence as the Defence has acknowledged, is these actual, contemporaneous transcripts and tapes and translations where we can put -- we can really deal with concrete days and events then supplement that with the live testimony of witnesses who can then remember that context and tell us something about the context, not just the reality of how these cases, not the small cases and not the single-massacre cases, but the cases involving the larger political contexts, I think, realistically have to be done; and it's why it's been permitted elsewhere using Rule 89.  

In this particular case, we would note that we had provided notice to the Defence of the exhibits that we intended to tender through this witness.  Tab 153 was part of that, I believe.  I can confirm that in a moment, but I believe it was because I took it with me to the The Hague to show it to the Witness.  And the -- and for that reason they have notice.  It's in English.  I wish to put to this witness a particular paragraph of it and ask if that's true.  And that's basically what I intend to put to this witness at this time, but I don't think I can put that to him and unless the -- unless the document is in evidence.  I submit that the Defence doesn't have -- I mean, can have time now to challenge or do other things or to raise other issues in terms of their cross-examination which may be days or weeks -- days from now; but I don't see the need to delay now the foundation.  The foundation is not going to get any better than it is right now.  And I submit that we should be allowed to admit this evidence, based upon the witness saying he was there, Ngirumpatse spoke, he believes that it was rebroadcast on RTLM for certain, and that that is at this Tribunal more than sufficient evidence found time and time again to allow in a radio transcript.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, I did not understand that Defence counsel have objected to this -- to its admissibility; but -- so I wasn't aware there was an outstanding admission -- objection to it.  What he said was that he was taken by surprise because he wasn't aware that this witness was going to put it in.  Now, you said that you had to serve notice on him, that this was going to -- that this was going to be put in this document which deals with -- Mr. Robinson, that deals with the point you are raising, as far as I understood. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's exactly correct.  Before the document is admitted, normally, the other party has a chance to give some opinion as to whether it should be admitted.  I would like to have time to look at the document.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but Mr. -- Mr. Rapp indicated that you were given notice that this witness was going to give this document.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I could check on that, Mr. President, because I was actually given a list of about fifty or sixty tab numbers and which -- which were taken to The Hague.  And I was told that some of them would be used with this witness, and I actually didn't go compare each one of them.  But since I had read all the -- this witness's statements and he made no mention whatsoever of this meeting, frankly, I didn't bother to check to see if -- I -- I am surprised.  Maybe it's my own negligence involved in not double-checking every number they gave me, but I was not prepared that this subject would come up during this witness's testimony and the -- the exhibit number, as you see on your exhibit index, it just says "RTLM broadcast."  It doesn't describe the particular meeting, so I think that even if I was on some kind of notice, it didn't register to me that this meeting would be the subject of that witness's testimony by virtue of that exhibit number being included, if it is included.  
MR. RAPP:
One statement for the record, Your Honour.  This -- there was a series of exhibits that we took to The Hague, and we had given the Defence notice of that.  But then we limited the number that we were going to talk about, and Mr. Morley sent an e-mail on Sunday to the Defence listing the ones that we were dealing with.  That is, of course, the famous e-mail that included the attachment of Mr. Webster's statement, so it's clearly something that's been seen, at least some part of it, by Mr. Robinson.  So we've given notice that this was coming up, and we submit that that's sufficient notice that's -- that the Defence should be prepared at least to deal at this point with the objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, did I see you on your feet? 
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I didn't want to be left out of this discussion to confirm what has been said by Mr. Robinson.  But also I do not think that the Prosecutor has provided a foundation for the admission of the broadcast because the witness had never said anything about hearing a broadcast.  The Prosecutor was asking whether he knew if a speech had been rebroadcast, and he -- the witness said that he heard all the speeches being rebroadcast, but we are now being faced with the possibility of having an admission that the rebroadcasting was done. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have decided to admit the document in evidence.  We have to look at it ourselves, and we have seen indications about -- on the document itself which has lead us to think we should admit it as an exhibit.  Of course, this does not preclude challenges to its authenticity by the Defence at any stage.  

Mr. Rapp, we would expect that that -- we don't expect that the method of presenting the exhibits should give us such difficulty in deciding to admit it or not, and the mere fact that in other cases things have been dealt with casually doesn't persuade us that we should follow that type of example, if that's what you are saying.  We would expect that the foundation is laid in a manner which makes it obvious that the document should be admissible, but we have had to spend a bit of time on this issue, and we trust that (inaudible) issues that the presentation should be a little easier for us to accept. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  I have a further objection to this document, and I'm speaking with inadequate preparation, but I will tell you that I notice that the document itself begins with a presentation by a journalist on -- I'm looking at the English version on page K0244820.  And then on the next page, there's the text from Mr. Ngirumpatse which continues until page 10244827 (sic) in which the journalist once again is commenting.  And then it goes on to page 10244831 in which there's a brief sentence by Justin Mugenzi, and then more commentary by the journalist.  Then on page K0244834, there's a speech by minister Ntagerura.  And then it goes back to a journalist speaking on page K0244835.  Then a speech from Mr. Mugenzi on page K0244839, and then we conclude with the journalist on page K0244845.  I don't believe that this entire document is admissible.  I think it should be limited to the speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now, I tell you I haven't had time to read what the journalist says in detail or Mr. Mugenzi or Mr. Ntagerura, so perhaps if I had that time, it would be more harmless information.  I wouldn't be so concerned.  But at this point, I don't think that you should admit the entire exhibit.  You should only admit the statement of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, if that's the purpose of the -- of the testimony, why shouldn't only Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech be admitted?  
MR. RAPP:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  I didn't -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We're also from the Bench in a position of not reviewing this before.  Now, Mr. Robinson has made a comment which has indicated that there might be irrelevant material that's not connected to what you said you were introducing in testimony.  If that is correct, couldn't we isolate Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech and have that tendered in evidence?  
MR. RAPP:
For the purposes of this examination, we certainly could do that, and if that'll facilitate the matter, that would be fine.  Keep in mind that, you know, generally that the argument that's been taken by the Defence is we're best with the total context, with the total document and we -- and particularly with these broadcast materials because it is really as it's represented there a -- a programme which replays the rally and in which the commentary comes in periodically to explain who's coming up next, and it's a good document that way; and we'll need to put things like this in in the future. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But -- well, but that was not what you were introducing from this witness.  I got the impression that you're giving evidence of what was said at a rally by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Now, is it that you're actually leading something different to that?  So this is a little bit different to what I've been led to under- -- expect from you -- from your prior questions.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, understand, Your Honour, I want to leave aside any issue of convenience and ways that things are going to have to be dealt with in the future in dealing specifically with what I'm dealing with today.  And that is:  All I want is the Ngirumpatse speech.  That can be excised from it, and the registry and I can -- can determine exactly what pages we're referring to in the English, French, and Kinyarwanda, and that could be the exhibit here. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we admit.  Mr. Registrar, we admit Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech.  
(Exhibit No. P. 14A, P. 14B, and P. 14C admitted)
MR. RAPP:
Now, if I can have the witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp -- 	

MR. RAPP:
Excuse me.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl wishes to say something.
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I have an objection.  It's almost the inverse of what we've just said.  We have mentioned tendering Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech as if the document in question represented the entire speech, so I do not believe that is the case.  I simply see in the document that was disclosed to us -- and if we work by this way of being surprised all the time, it's going to be difficult.  I am only looking at an excerpt from the speech.  If this document is to be tendered, it can only be tendered as an excerpt of that speech by Ngirumpatse and not as the speech by Mr. Ngirumpatse that he made during the meeting.  Proof of this is that the journalist talking about the excerpt or the speech mentions that this is the end of his speech.  "By ending the speech, he talked about the solution," she says.  The entire speech must be tendered and if this is to tendered, it should only be reflected as a portion of the speech.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, just in response, we're certainly content to have this exhibit denominated on the list as an excerpt of the speech of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, and it's -- it's -- we have it because it was rebroadcast.  We wouldn't have it otherwise, so we're dealing with the best evidence that's available.  And clearly from its context, as Mr. Weyl points out it, it seems to come in in mid-phrase, so I'm -- so it does not appear to be the entire speech.  It's the excerpt. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for both comments.

Mr. Registrar, could the exhibit show -- reflect that position, an excerpt of the speech?  
MR. FRY:
So noted, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.
MR. RAPP:
What I wanted to ask this witness now that this is an exhibit, presumably as 14A, B, and C is to go to that exhibit in the binder and for his purposes to -- to the French version, what's page 5 with a K number on top of it, K0244053, and I intend to go over the page to K0244054.  And I do this because -- I also intend to read the English for the benefit of the Trial Chamber, which is on page 7 of the English version and that is at K0244825 going over to K0244826.  And it's only about four sentences that I wanted to read, but for the benefit of the interpreters so that we don't end up in a 

situation where an official interpretation that's already been done by the language section essentially is redone, I bring those references to their attention.
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness -- 
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, in The Hague we are -- we have a problem.  Are we still in document Tab 153?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you respond, please, Mr. Rapp?  Explain to them where we are.  
MR. RAPP:
Yes, we're in document 153.  
MR. JUMA:
So the document in Tab 153 we have has no K number you have last mentioned.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
That's 154.  
MR. RAPP:
That's -- 
MR. LOMBARDI:
Bear with us while we collect the proper document.  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, while we're waiting, could it be indicated in Exhibit 14A, B, and C, which language A, which language is B, and which language is C. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we would prefer 14A Kinyarwanda, 14B French, and 14C English, if it pleases the Court. 
MR. RAPP:
Do we have -- is the document before the individuals at The Hague?  If it's not, we may take a recess and -- 
MR. JUMA:
Your Honours, in our binder, the tab number you have mentioned with the proper document is missing.  We have 152 and 153, and then it goes to 156.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, let me just ask and we can clarify this over the break if there's a missing document, that it's faxed to you.  The -- the document that is at 153 should read on top "RTLM/Radio Rwanda 16/01/1994".  And then it's a broadcast and lists those K numbers underneath it.  
MR. JUMA:
Exactly.  That's the document we have, and it reads -- the cover reads as follows:  "RTLM/Radio Rwanda 16/01/1994 broadcast RTLM, RTLM K0244049."  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  I think -- 
MR. JUMA:
40 again.  69.  (inaudible)
MR. LOMBARDI:
That's enough.  
MR. JUMA:
(Inaudible) 
MR. RAPP:
Right. 
MR. JUMA:
And then K024- -- 
MR. RAPP:
If you -- if you would excuse me just a second so we can save time.  Clearly, you're on the correct document.  In those F documents 4049 to 4069, is the page 4053; and that's what we wanted you to look at, which is three or four sheets after that heading.  And the K number appears on the side of the documents because two pages are Xeroxed on one single piece of A4.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
This is -- 
MR. RAPP:
Now do you have it?  
MR. JUMA:
Yes.  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  Very good.  So if that's before the witness, let me just ask the witness -- and here, of course, I'm going to the English which is our 14C there on page K0244825.  This is for the benefit of the English speakers, not for the witness.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, how long is this going to take, approximately?  
MR. RAPP:
I would -- three minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Let's hear it then.  It's about 1:30 now.  

BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	In this particular speech, Mr. Ngirumpatse says as follows:  "What can we say about people who went about telling the U.N. soldiers and the representative of the secretary-general that the MR -- MRND is getting ready for combat, that they are distributing weapons here and there, that they were carrying out military training every day and so forth.  One would have the impression that we were no longer working".  And then to skip over about eight lines, because they discuss 1960 and historical context, which is important, but we'll skip it at this point, and go down the page to, say, "However we are requesting them to pay -- not to pay attention to people's lies and not to be distracted by those who are saying that we are preparing attacks and massacres, whereas they are compiling lists of people to" (inaudible) -- now, Witness -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, the document we have doesn't read the way you have read it.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honours -- 
MR. JUMA:
We have the same problem here.  
MR. RAPP:
We're looking in -- on the English at K0244825, which obviously, requires one to go back about eight, nine pages after the French.  It's pages -- it's on page 7 of the English version of this particular broadcast.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you see, we have page 7 here.  Our K number is K0275147.  
MR. LOMBARDI:
Your Honour, this is Mr. Lombardi in The Hague.  I think the confusion is that Mr. Rapp is referring to a document at Tab 152, whereas earlier he had mentioned Tab 153.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Lombardi.  I hope that helps.
MR. RAPP:
Anyway, because there was a chance that as tabs were prepared by the team that certain items ended up either on the one side of 25- -- 153 or the other side; and for that reason, I think we should take our recess, make sure that everyone has the correct page, and we'll make sure that this is, in fact, what we represented it to be, which we can say that it is.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And we'll take the break.  

This makes it even more important that the exhibit which is actually --has been tendered is tendered and that everybody knows that -- what's being exhibited, so hopefully in the -- during the two-hour lunch break, there'll be -- (inaudible) will be found to clarify the position.  

We'll take the recess now.  
Mr. Witness, I remind you that you're still giving testimony during our luncheon recess and you're not to discuss the case or the testimony with anybody. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Your Honour.  
(Court recessed at 1335H)
(Pages 24 to 36 by Priscilla Trillo)





























(Court resumed at 1539H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

As we resume now, the registrar has informed me that Ms. Diagne has asked to make a comment from The Hague, and we have agreed to hear her.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Yes.  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Good afternoon, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Ms. Diagne.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President -- thank you, Mr. President.  

I would like to inform you that -- that the Defence here at The Hague has a problem.  The witness is testifying in a location to which the Defence counsel do not have access.  This means that we are not able to have access to this place.  And for two days my colleague, Ms. Hounkpatin, and myself have tried our best in order to attend all the sessions, but things have gone from bad to worse.  

A moment ago when -- we had security officers come to us and we realised that the problem should be solved in another way.  They are saying that, in any case, here the Defence does not have access to the location.  We cannot have the relevant badges to allow us access, and we can be -- we have to be escorted in all movements that we make.  Mr. Juma, unfortunately, needs to deal with the witness, and he himself clearly said that he could not do the two jobs at the same time, but the security officers at The Hague have not been understanding.  And I've decided to inform you of this because as we are here, we would need to have you get in touch with the relevant authorities so that the Defence counsel here can do their job properly here at The Hague.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Diagne.  I'm not in a position to respond to your request immediately, but I will see that some enquiries are made.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have decided to -- we have asked the Chamber coordinator to make enquiries on this matter and to report back to us.  I think that we should continue in the meantime, and as soon as we are better informed we will see what we can do to address the problem which has been drawn to our attention.  

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, thank you.  But it would seem to me that given the decision you've made, it would be difficult to go into cross-examination if the Defence cannot be represented in the very room the witness is testifying from.  It cannot play the role that you have permitted it should do; in other words, follow the testimony of the witness.  If we cannot enter into the room -- have access to the room from which the witness is testifying, it would seem to us rather difficult to be able to continue.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, perhaps you did not understand me properly.  I have not made any decision as yet.  What I've done, I've asked a senior member of our legal team to make enquiries and to report back to me.  At that time, we will see what, if any action, is required to be taken.  So we have not made a decision as yet.  We are just trying to gather information that would assist us in responding to the problem that has been described.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I did understand you properly.  Maybe I didn't understand my learned counsel - colleague, Ms. Dior.  She said that she wasn't able to enter the room from which the witness is testifying.  And if that is the case, the job of the Defence is being jeopardised, and it is difficult for us to continue to follow the testimony immediately.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:  
I would like to say to my learned colleague that we are, indeed, in the room and the security -- security chief found us in that room.  We are there in the room, but everyday we have to be cross-examined in order for us to enter the location, and this is why I made my plea.  
MR. WEYL:
I have been informed and I therefore withdraw my objection made earlier.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  Hopefully the matter will be resolved shortly when we get some more information from our -- the person whom we've commissioned this enquiry to.  
MR. RAPP: 
Your Honour, just perhaps by way of a professional statement to explain the confusion that we were in before the break, and I think the matter's now been resolved.  There are, indeed, two broadcasts that include excerpts of the rally of January 1994.  And in at least two of the binders they were in opposite locations.  Mr. Robinson's and mine both had it at 153; Your Honours had it at 152.  So when we directed you to 153, we were directing you not to the RTLM broadcast of the event, but to the 
Radio Rwanda broadcast of the event.  Radio Rwanda did a much shorter excerpt of the Ngirumpatse speech that focused, in fact, on the same passage, but was of course translated at a different time, by a different team in the language section and so there are small differences in the words.  As you will see if you look at 152 and 153, as it is in your binder, the more extensive excerpt of the Ngirumpatse speech appears in the one at 152, which is the one that I was referring to, albeit in my binder, it is then misplaced at 153.  

At The Hague, I understand that it is in 152 as it is in your binder and, therefore, I think it's possible, if we can, to turn to it again.  And, again, we are talking the one that's at 152 in the binder that is specifically the one that -- all of them say at the top "RTLM, slash, Radio Rwanda", but in the third line this one says "Broadcast RTLM."  And then the French, which I had asked the witness to look at, is specifically the portion that's at K0244053.  And the English, for the benefit of we Anglophones, is in that document at K0244825.  

And I believe if we can be assured that this document I spoke to and -- the Prosecutor's representative there, and that's in the file and that the -- that that could be placed before the witness.  And I hate to repeat myself but let me then read in English the translation.  And then if we were reading the translation -- but the French may be better, but the witness can look at the French and then I want to ask him a question about it.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Does the witness have this document in front of him at Tab 152? 
A.	I do believe so, yes.  
Q.	And in the French document I'm referring to the bottom of that page, page 244053.  It begins in the last paragraph with the words qui -- or, "que dire".  And so in English, what I wanted to read from the speech is:  "What can we say about people who went about telling the UN soldiers and the representatives of the secretary general that the MRD -- the MRND is getting ready for combat; that we are distributing weapons here and there; that we are carrying out military training every day and so forth.  One would have the impression that we are no longer working".  

And then if you skip about eight lines, and in the French it requires you to go over to the next page on that -- to the right side of the same page, but to the next page of our original text.  And in the English the word that I'm looking for is "however;" in French I believe it's "ce pendant" and it continues:  "However, we are requesting them not to pay attention to people's lies and not to be distracted by those who are saying that we are preparing attacks and massacres, whereas they are compiling lists people to eliminate."  

Now, Witness, if you've seen that from Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech, I just want to ask you:  At the time that he gave this speech in mid-January of 1994, he was accusing people of lying about the MRND distributing weapons and conducting training.  Was he -- was he himself telling the truth when he made that statement, based on your observation? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to object to that statement.  I don't believe it's proper for one witness to be asked if another witness is telling the truth.  I think a witness can comment on his own understanding of facts, but I think the statement is still capable of interpretation and it's not proper.  And I don't think it's proper for one witness to comment whether another witness is telling the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, I think it's a question of words.  Maybe you can rephrase the question.  
MR. RAPP: 
I don't think we are talking here about a witness in the case of Mr. Ngirumpatse, but in any case -- 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Would you comment on this particular passage in terms of what you understood Mr. Ngirumpatse to be saying and what your observation was at the time in terms of what the situation was and what his knowledge was of the situation regarding arming and training and list making? 
A.	After Ngirumpatse's speech -- and I would like to say that the military training and the distribution of weapons did, indeed, occur well before 1993.  So this means that when he made this speech he was not speaking the truth because the distribution of weapons had already been done, as well as the training. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Thank you, Witness.  I think we'll pass from this particular exhibit and ask some questions that don't require us to refer to exhibits.  

Dealing with this period of January 1994, and earlier when you were discussing, I think, the letter that's now P. 13, you discussed a demonstration that occurred at the CND, at the parliament building in -- in Kigali in that month.  Could you please describe -- do you have knowledge of such a demonstration, and could you tell us what you know about the demonstration that -- 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we've lost our signal.  

The system is recovering very quickly.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, I wanted to ask you about a demonstration.  I think you made a brief reference to it earlier that occurred at the CND building, the parliament building in Rwanda in January of 1994.  Could you tell us what you know about the demonstration that occurred at that building? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry for having interrupted you in that manner, but we have received a report on the situation raised by Ms. Diagne.  And perhaps I can just deal with it at this stage and get it out of the way.  

The position seems to be that what has been happening is not something that is exceptional or related specifically to Defence counsel in this matter.  There are sections of the Tribunal facilities to which Defence counsel do not normally have unlimited access.  And the place where this testimony is being taken is one of those areas.  

Now, what is being suggested as a practical matter is that the problem that has apparently been encountered is that the registrar from the ICTR, who would normally escort them to the room which would, in fact, make their travel trouble-free, has had to devote his attention to the witness, which is his primary responsibility.  And the recommendation is being made that the Defence counsel should travel to the location a bit earlier so that the registrar could escort them to the room where the testimony is being taken before he brings the witness to the room.  

So I think that the -- it has been proposed that the matter will be practically resolved by the step of coming to the premises a bit earlier to permit the registrar, Mr. Juma, to take them to the room before he has to deal with the witness.  And I hope that that will provide -- prove a satisfactory solution to the problem that has been encountered.  

Has that been heard in The Hague, Ms. Diagne?  
MR. JUMA:
Yes, Your Honour.  We have heard and will abide by the -- your decision.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Yes, Mr. Rapp.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Diagne, I can hear you.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I do not understand why the registrar spoke on our behalf, because the problem that you -- we raised with you, we were here and he -- when we leave for lunch, for us to come back to the room we cannot even call him so that he can come and fetch us.  In fact, we are hindered from entering the Tribunal, and that is where the security chief and his staff explained to us that they wouldn't be able to allow us to enter.  And as Defence counsel, Mr. President, I hope you understand what this means to have to be escorted.  

But now, even in full session -- there is too much protocol and the registrar himself cannot move around with us.  We have no freedom of movement whatsoever.  Even if we were to have such -- we do understand that it is a place to which the Defence normally does not have access.  The Prosecutor has free rein and can move, go places wherever they want, but we cannot even go to the bathroom.  And we must say that this cannot continue to be like this, and we decided to inform you of this matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne, what is recommended to -- to deal with the other issues which you have raised is that the ICTR representative at the Tribunal there is Mr. Kofi Affande.  He has been apprised of the situation of your report and it is suggested that you speak with him and he will provide any further assistance that is required to solve the matters that you have raised.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Mr. President, I would like to inform you that, in fact, Mr. Affande tried to do that, but the security chief was very severe and strict.  And I think he quickly ran back to his office.  This is merely to provide you with that information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.  We have been informed, and I think that we will see what else can be done -- if anything can be done just using the normal channels available to us.  But, for now, I think that you 
have -- you are in the room where the witness is, and we would like to continue with the testimony.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. RAPP: 
I see my colleague on his feet.  I didn't know whether you wanted the question restated.  He was raising an objection to my question.  If it's clear, then -- otherwise, I will restate it.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I did have an objection, and I'd like to ask the witness to take his headphones off before I state my objection.  

Okay, I see the witness has his headphones off.  Mr. President, from what I can tell just from this question, that this is -- I believe that this is now material for which there is no previous disclosure with respect to this witness.  Although I'm not a 100 percent sure I'm understanding the co-relation of this event to what Mr. Rapp is intending to do.  So I would ask that before this witness be given any questions about demonstrations that occurred in early 1994, that the Prosecution point to some place in the witness statement, or previous testimony in other trials, where this material has been disclosed to us.  
MR. RAPP: 
Well, Your Honours, this witness has given 34 hours of taped interviews and also now a period in trial over the course of four weeks.  We attempted to distil that, the trial team here in the pretrial brief on the statement of Witness G, and referred specifically, "Witness will provide an account of the demonstration in front of the CND on the date set for the swearing-in of the transitional government in early       January 1994, when opposition political party leaders were prevented from taking the oath of office."  

That represents an abstract of testimony -- of previous statements.  Now, we can -- we can go through all of these (unintelligible), but this has been matters that I dealt with, I know, with this witness previously as to this particular occasion.  It's also a matter that's come up in the pre-trial brief.
Paragraph 50 of the pre-trial brief on page 13 describes this succinctly.  It can't come as a surprise to them.  I'm not attempting to connect it up with anything else.  I was dealing with it -- I was taking advantage of the fact the witness had mentioned this demonstration in the discussion of the Booh-Booh letter and meeting, in order to have a transition, but that's not because I intend to connect the two.  I merely want to ask him whether he was there, what he saw, what occurred on that particular day.  And I think that should come as no surprise to the Defence.  

Now, the ability to search the -- several thousand pages to find the specific reference, we can do that, but I submit that this is a fair distillation of it and this is sufficient to give them notice in a very particular way.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I am in a position to search all the prior statements of the witness, and I am keeping track of this.  I have a pretty good idea of what he's testified to and on what page, and what volume, and what date.  And I can tell you that unless I'm flawed in my approach, there is prior statement of this witness on this -- about this event in any of the testimony led by Mr. Rapp in the three previous trials in which he's testified, in any of his interviews with the OTP, in the 23 cassettes, or in any of his interviews with the other authorities from other countries which have eight cassettes.  So, with that representation, I'm telling you that we have no notice as to the substance of this witness's testimony.  And if he was -- there was an intention to lead evidence about this matter, it should have been in a will-say statement.  So, that's my position.  Thank you.  
MR. RAPP: 
We submit that this is sufficient as a will-say statement.  And we can belabour this forever in the day, but they have notice he's going to talk about it; he knows about it.  And if we are going to be forced into a situation every time we turn around of going over thousands of pages in a game of "gotcha" trying to obscure the truth from this Tribunal, then we are going to waste a lot of time.  They knew it was coming.  It's right here; it's on one page.  There's sufficient notice in this statement. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
What page are you referring to, Mr. Rapp?  
MR. RAPP: 
I'm referring to the Witness G, abstract of witness statement that appears as part of the pre-trial brief where matters that he has -- will testify to in this case are laid out.  And in that specifically, "Witness will provide an account of this demonstration."  
JUDGE SHORT: 
What paragraph?  
MR. RAPP: 
First paragraph, probably about 20 lines from the top. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are trying to find it.  What page of the pre-trial brief is that coming from?  
MR. RAPP: 
Okay, now let's see.  The registry page is 20661.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, you said it was the pre-trial brief.  
MR. RAPP: 
This is part of the pre-trial brief.  These are each -- this is part of an addendum to the pre-trial brief which -- in which the summary -- one of the requirements of Rule 73 bis is that the pre-trial brief include a summary of the evidence that each witness will offer, and this is the portion that deals with Witness G.  As you can see, from AFQ, on down to Z somebody -- ZF, these are all laid out there.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Do you have that, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have not been able to see it yet.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
It's not -- as far as I understand, it's not available electronically, because it was in a different software than the pre-trial brief, so even I don't have it electronically, but it's in my office in hard copy.  So probably you don't have it electronically either.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what we've been discovering, but we have been given a hard copy just now.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
So after you've read it if I can make a comment, I'd appreciate it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I see Mr. Sow is on his feet.  
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that the events of the 8th of January do not figure in the amended indictment -- in the new amended indictment.  I have noticed that often times the Prosecution refers to the 1999 indictment where, indeed, the event was spelt out and described, in the 1999 indictment.  In that indictment, you see a description of the events of 8 January; however, in the new amended indictment, that is not the case.  We don't know which indictment we are working with.  If you would like I could read out the 1999 indictment to show this to you.  
These events are not described in the 2005 indictment.  This is very important.  We have to know which instrument we are working with; otherwise, we would be wasting an enormous amount of time.  
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President.  I also incorporate my objection to the comments of Mr. Sow, that the material is not in the amended indictment and should be excluded for that reason.  

But turning to -- specifically to whether what you have in front of you provides adequate notice, it simply tells us that he's going to discuss this subject, but it doesn't give us any substantive information about what the substance of his testimony is concerning this demonstration.  It's our position that's not adequate notice.  That's why will-say statements don't simply list the topics that a witness is going to testify on, but contain the substance of the information that the witness is going to provide.  

And I -- we can ask Mr. Rapp how many times he's met with this witness in preparation for his testimony.  And it was incumbent on him, if he wanted to lead this evidence, to give us notice so that we know what the substance of the testimony is going to be.  

So we are not surprised, and we are not taken by -- disadvantaged and having to ask you for additional time and delaying these proceedings. So I don't believe that what you have in front of you constitutes sufficient information for us to be prepared to cross-examine on this topic, and that's what the purpose of will-say statements are.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to allow the witness to testify on this issue and we will evaluate, after your further testimony on this issue, what, if any, remedy should be granted.  So we would like to hear what the witness has to say before making a final ruling on this matter.  
MR. RAPP: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, perhaps I should restate the question.  I was asking about a demonstration at the CND in January of 1994.  What do you know about that demonstration? 
A.	I believe that it was on the 5th of January 1994 that the president took the oath of office as president of the transitional government.  MPs had to take the oath in the afternoon.  There was a list at the president's office of PL members of parliament; it was not the same as that that the PL had.  That afternoon, the MPs were to take the oath.  The PL was represented by Mugenzi MPs who went into the CND.  Lando, the PL MP, came and was escorted by Belgian UNAMIR officers.  
When they got into the CND, they were stopped.  There were Rwandan soldiers present, as well as UNAMIR guards, Bengali guards.  On that occasion, the soldiers, the Rwandan soldiers who were there, were there with Interahamwe.  They stopped the convoy.  They brought out the PL Lando MPs, and they were beaten and they weren't allowed into the room. The MPs in the CND were not able to take the oath because the opposition was against the Mugenzi clan representing the PL party as MPs. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And that would be the end of questions about that particular event.  I just want to deal specifically with another matter just -- and you've to it beforehand, Mr. Robinson, and -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Now that you've heard the evidence, I would ask that it be stricken because it's goes outside the indictment and not sufficient notice given in the -- in the summary.  Thank you.  
MR. RAPP: 
Your Honour, specifically, we would submit that there is sufficient notice because it talks about the deputies being prevented from taking their seats.  And in regard to the issue and the whole question of the indictment, this incident is fully described in paragraph 50 of the pre-trial brief in the area denominated historical background.  

And we are not trying the 1999 indictment.  I want to be clear on that.  This is the 2005 indictment, but there is, of course, historical background that's necessary to understand what occurred.  We are not alleging crimes being committed in that historical background for which the Accused has to answer, but it's important to be able to present that historical background to contextualise the events.  And it also can come in in the context of intent in the same way as in the Pauline Nyiramasuhuko case that you cited yesterday to us from the Appeals Chamber, where it was possible to lead as -- installation of a bourgmestre and his speech that hadn't been pled in the indictment because there was another speech, another event that was alleged.  And this could be evidence of intent; it could be something that could be used to draw the whole picture.  So, for those reasons, Your Honour, we submit that -- that this evidence should be allowed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp.  
MR. RAPP: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to admit it for the limited purpose of the historical background.  But why don't you address the issues that are in the indictment?  There are several issues that this witness can speak about.  
MR. RAPP: 
I have obviously dealt with several of them.  There was -- the rally speech was one, and this is part of the overall contacts to them.  We have a witness like this who was in -- present throughout the period.  He's considered both for the historical background and for specifics in the indictment.  And we are passing through these incidents chronologically.  And we'll get to the --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The trouble is that we are beginning to worry about fairness.  The whole purpose of -- of indictments and disclosure is to comply with the statutory requirement that the Defence should have adequate facilities to defend the matter -- defend the case against them.  So they need to know what is the case against them to defend it properly.  And the rules also require that they need to know what the witnesses are going to say to enable them to cross-examine the witness's testimony.  And -- and -- and, you know, I think you are pushing the envelope on these issues.  
MR. RAPP: 
Well, Your Honour, we'll stay within the envelope.  Understand that in these particular areas that we've dealt with, if one looks at the pre-trial brief, looks at these summaries that they were prepared and much more -- less succinct -- much more succinct, I should say, than the nine volumes of documents or the statements that this witness has given in the past.  We are attempting to give in as concise a way as we can, notice about events that -- about information that we are going to lead.  But we are -- we are well aware we're dealing with an incredible field here.  This isn't the case of a single killing on a single day, the sort of things we deal with in national courts.  These are historical events where pieces of the puzzle need to be fitted together, and -- and we are trying to do that in concise a way as we can, but that necessarily requires a breath of information that's beyond the ability of any particular document, a charging document, which should deal only with specific material facts, can encompass.  But we'll proceed now to the next subject -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Before we do proceed, Mr. President, I just want -- I didn't want to say this before you ruled, but I don't want it to be taken in the wrong way, but this afternoon we've now heard the rally at Nyamirambo and the CND, two areas which I was not prepared to cross-examine this witness on, and two areas which I think are somewhat complicated.  And I just want to let you know, I don't believe -- I'm not going to be able to stay within the time estimate that I previously gave you for my cross-examination, nor do -- am I confident that I can commence the cross-examination, or at least commence these parts of the cross-examination very soon.  So I just want to let you know that these are the remedies that I hope you were alluding to when you made your ruling.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we'll address those issues when we -- when the time is more relevant for that.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, I just want to ask you:  We -- you've dealt with it a moment ago when you talked about these facts, the Mugenzi group, the Lando group, and you dealt with it yesterday in regard to the word "power".  But if I could just ask you to explain from your own observations the splits in the opposition political parties at this time.  
A.	I think in July 1993 splits began to happen in the opposition parties, and the split started in the MDR party.  In the MDR, there was a split such that there was an MDR-Power wing, and the Faustin MDR wing, which was considered as the MDR which was in support of the RPF.  MDR-Power was the MDR wing which was led by one Froudould Karamira, and this MRND was against -- this MDR was against the RPF.  And there was also a split in the PL party.  I believe it was in September 1993, and there was a Lando PL wing and the Mugenzi PL wing.  This was a split which was characterised by the fact that the MDR Lando was one for Tutsis and the MDR Mugenzi was the -- for Tutsis (sic).  And the Lando group was the one which supported the RPF.  

On that occasion, it was realised that Mugenzi, who had not benefitted from a ministerial post when he was an official of the MRND, he obtained the ministry of commerce or trade.  And within the PSD, there was also a split: There was a part or faction which was in support of the RPF, and the second which did not support the RPF.  That is what I can say about the factions that came about in 1993. 
Q.	Witness, let me go ahead to March of 1994.  And are you familiar with a rally that was planned at -- in the Nyamirambo stadium by the MDR, particularly by the MDR that was not the power wing, but the party --  the part of the party that was associated with support of the Arusha Accord? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me.  Mr. President, I'm sorry to say that again this is material that has absolutely never been discussed by this witness in any of his previous statements or testimony.  
MR. RAPP: 
Your Honour, once again, in this particular summary I'm making sure that what I bring up is there.  We discussed, "Witness will recount other rallies and demonstrations, including a '94 demonstration organised by the MRND to prevent the MDR party from holding their own rally in Nyamirambo."  And -- and that's something that the Defence has notice that we are going to lead very exclusively in regard to this, and the context is to prevent.  They know we are going to lead evidence about what they are going to do to prevent.  And under those circumstances, I think they have notice of that in this case and I believe if one gets into the indictment we'll also see references to this.  But, here we are talking -- I think the specific objection is -- is on whether we know whether this witness is going to lead evidence.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, really, I don't know what this witness is going to say on this topic, and if you allow a will-say statement to simply be a list of potential subjects without any notice by the requirement that the Prosecution give us notice as to the substance of the testimony of this witness, we are proceeding in a very, very unfair manner here.  This is -- this is not the kind of notice that a Defence can use to prepare cross-examinations.  And I don't -- honestly don't recall this being in the indictment.  And even if it was, we don't have adequate notice that this witness is going to say anything about this.  And as I'm listening to this testimony this afternoon, I'm finding myself repeatedly in a position where I simply don't know what the witness is going to say about topics because there's been no substantive disclosure.  And I don't think in a case of this seriousness that that should be -- a Defence counsel should be in that position.  Thank you.

1645H 
MR. RAPP:
Your Honours, let me withdraw the question.  I don't want to be -- this is something that's referred to specifically in this witness's statement in the -- in the abstract, and it was something that (unintelligible) expected to hear him saying something --
(Ringing interruption)
MR. RAPP:
(Inaudible) looked at the brief (inaudible) specific reference --
(Ringing interruption)   
MR. RAPP:
-- and for that reason, I'll strike it myself.  
(Ringing interruption)
MR. RAPP:
We're trying to get connected to The Hague.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, I was wondering whether you know what the witness is going to say.  You see, if it -- we -- we are not empowered to know whether Mr. Robinson's comment -- that this does not feature in any of the statements or previous testimony of the witness, but if that is, in fact, correct, it raises a question as to whether you know what the witness is going to say.  
MR. RAPP:
Well, Your Honour, to respond, by way of professional statement, when I saw the witness, I had this summary in front of me, which had been prepared by the trial team based upon their analysis of all his past statements and -- and the relevant issues in this case.  And one of them was this specific issue.  So I did ask him about it and received information consistent with preventing the MDR from holding the rally and -- and that's why I'm leading it, to obtain basically a confirmation that it was prevented.  That's what I'm seeking, and I think that's notice sufficient.  It doesn't say he's going to just talk about it.  It says he's going to talk about it and say they prevent it.  So that's what I was intending to do here.  But what concerns me -- I think that's adequate notice of the witness statement itself.  I'm a little concerned that in the historical background in the pre-trial brief, we don't discuss this particular event.  And I want to be on all fours here, both in terms of notice to the Defence, in terms of what the witness is going to say, and notice to the Court and to the Defence of what we're going to lead evidence of, and I think that perhaps that's lacking here.  

Now, I think there can be an argument made that this is part of the pre-trial brief and that that provides that notice, but this is not such important evidence, as far as this witness is concerned, that I see a need to press this issue, and that's why I'm withdrawing the question.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  So we are still not online with The Hague?  

We still have not got connected with The Hague as of yet.  So I think we have to just wait a few minutes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, not to be a house monitor or anything, but I noticed your scheduling order called for a break at 4:30.  Perhaps this would be a good time.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, periodically the ALOs visit me and ask me when I'm going to finish.  And, you know, I had very high hopes of being able to finish this evening, and more recently I'm saying, well, tomorrow afternoon.  Though, tomorrow afternoon we have a very short session, as I understand it.  So I would hope that if we have a break that it's a very brief one because we only -- we have less -- we would have less than an hour today, and I was hoping to get well into quite important events in April today at least.  So I would be happy to forgo the break unless, of course, we don't have a signal from The Hague. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, that's the problem at the moment.  At the moment, we have to take the break because we're not connected with The Hague.  So we will take the break now.  We'll take the break now. 
(Court recessed from 1650H to 1700H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, are we back online?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

You may proceed, Mr. Rapp.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, let's move ahead to the 6th of April, and I want you to tell me where you were when you received the news that the president's plane had been shot down.  Not your specific home if -- if that's the case.  If not the geographical area, but were you at home, or were you someplace else?  
A.	I was at home.  
Q.	And what time of day was it?  
A.	It was at about 8:30.  
Q.	And, Witness, did you stay home for the rest of that night and -- and into the following morning?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm going to object to that as leading.  
MR. RAPP:
That is leading.  It's an attempt to save some time here on a non-material issue, but we'll ask the witness the other way.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Where were you then after you received that news for 8:30, and for how long did you remain there?  
A.       (No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we're sorry.  There was a technical glitch, and we did not hear the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Rapp, could you ask him to repeat -- 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Witness, would you repeat your answer?  
A.	I remained at home up until the 9th of April 1994.  
Q.	During that time, did you ever have occasion to leave your house and step into the front garden or into the street in front of your house?  
A.	The next day, on the 7th of April, I went outside.  I went out to the entryway.  There I could see all of the neighbours who were outside.  
Q.	Did you see any activity in the streets?  
A.	On the morning of that 7th of April, I saw a minibus or van that came by our road.  Interahamwe were inside.  
Q.	Did you have any opportunity to -- to talk with the Interahamwe that were in that minibus?  
A.	As it turns out, I knew one of the Interahamwe in that minibus, and so I spoke to him.  
Q.	And what did he tell you?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Objection, Mr. President.  I don't believe that sufficient foundation has been laid concerning the reliability of information given by an unidentified person.  
MR. RAPP:
Your Honour, we submit this goes to weight, as do these questions of hearsay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we agree.  

You can answer the question.  
THE WITNESS:
I asked that Interahamwe, whom I knew, where he was going.  On the 7th of April, there was a radio announcement, telling us to stay at home.  That Interahamwe said that he had a mission to accomplish.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Could you recall the name of that Interahamwe?  
A.	I can tell you that when I saw the video on Kigali, I saw him again.  One of the people in petit Kigali uttered the name, and I remember the name.  His name was Suberi (phonetic).  
Q.	Just to be clear here, when you talk about the petit Kigali, you're talking about the video of the -- of the bar in Rwanda that's been shown to you in four CD-ROMs?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Now, Witness, did you learn anything about what mission that particular Interahamwe and that minibus was on in the hours and days that passed?  
A.	He told me that he had a mission.  I immediately imagined that it was a mission to kill all of the Tutsis living in the region around the stadium.  At that time I had a neighbour.  He had a cousin who lived in Kigali.  His cousin worked at the national bank.  He spoke with him on the telephone, and they said that the night of the 6th of April 1994, there were already employees of the national bank, who lived in national bank residences, and they were Tutsis, and they had already been killed on that night of 6th of April.  So when he said that he had a mission, I quickly understood that it was a mission to kill.  
Q.	Witness, if I can follow that up, obviously you're hearing that some people, Tutsis, had been killed.  Now you see Interahamwe.  Why did you believe that the Interahamwe would be involved in such killing?  
A.	I'll tell you that.  On that day, the 7th of April, the Interahamwe were wearing MRND uniforms.  On that occasion, they were also bearing firearms, not traditional weapons.  Already on the morning of the 7th of April, they were armed.  The killings had already begun on the night of the 6th of April.  Nobody was to move.  When I saw those people who were able to move about, when there was an announcement that we weren't supposed to, I believed that they must have had a mission that was given to them by some official.  
Q.	Witness, you told us that you left your home -- left your property on the 9th of April.  Would you describe what happened when you left your home, how you -- how you departed and with whom you travelled?  
A.	From the 7th of April in the morning, I looked for every way possible to contact a friend.  His name is on P. 9.  It's number 9.  He lived in town.  I tried to ask him to get me out of where I was.  I believed that where I was, was unsafe.  I had family obligations to meet near Gicyovu (phonetic).  So I tried to contact that person first on the 6th of April and then on the 8th.  He promised me that he was going to try to come and get me with my family.  Only on the 9th of April at around noon did he show up.  He showed up with number 6 on the list, and they were with soldiers and Interahamwe.  They came to my house to get me and my family, and they brought us to the place that we went to on the 9th of April.  
Q.	And in terms of the distance that you travelled that day, could you tell us roughly how many kilometres you might have travelled with these two gentlemen on the 9th of April?  
A.	I would say that the distance between my house and the place I had to go is about five kilometres. 
(Pages 50 to 53 by Wendy Molnar)




1715H
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And as you traveled those five kilometres, what did you see? 
A.	Well, this was the first time I had left the house since the 6th of April.  I was on the road leading to that place and I could see lots of corpses on the side of the road, and even on the road, all the way up until town, really there were thousands of corpses. 
Q.	Were there any areas where those corpses were more concentrated, the number of bodies greater than others? 
A.	I would say that at one point we arrived at a church, at that church there were many bodies piled up one on top of the other.  In the church, many of the bodies were those of men, women and children all mixed together.  
Q.	As we may be some distance from your own home, could you tell us what that church was, what the name of that church was? 
A.	Charles Lwanga Church, it is located in Kigali at Nyamirambo, very close to the St. André School where the Josephite brothers are. 
Q.	And in terms of this particular part of the city, or Kigaliville prefecture, is this noted for any particular ethnic group that is being represented in larger numbers than is the normal case in Rwanda? 
A.	It was known in Rwanda.  The region around St. André and specifically Mumena was a place where a priest called -- well, I don't remember his name; he was German.  They had built houses for the widows, Tutsi widows of people who were killed in '59 and they lived in that area.  
Q.	Earlier you had indicated that you had made observations about Tutsi and Hutus and the rough percentages of them at a PL rally from appearances.  Could you tell from looking at the thousands of bodies that you saw on the street, what their ethnicity was? 
A.	Most of those bodies were those of Tutsi.  I would say that at that time when we went up to the   Charles Lwanga church, the two friends I was with told me that the operation to kill the Tutsi was carried out by the army and their children; in other words, "their children" meant the Interahamwe. 
Q.	Did you make any stops on this particular -- you mentioned that you go from your home to another location to deal with the family situation, during the course of your travels on the 9th of April did you make stops at other places, other than your home and your family destination? 
A.	Let me tell you something, when I left home on the 9th of April beside the bodies that I saw, there were also roadblocks that were set up all along the road; we went through them.  They were manned by PSD members, as well as MDR members.  At one point we arrived at a very large roadblock, hundreds of Interahamwe were there.  At that roadblock, Number 6 lived nearby. 
Q.	You indicated that you had reached that roadblock near Number 6's house, did you stop at where Number 6 lived, at its house? 
A.	When we arrived there, Number 6 came out.  He went to speak with the people who were there.  There was even a bar that was set up right there.  He went to find out what was happening.  When he finished, he came back to the car that we were in, the car I was in with my family and the Interahamwes and the others. 
Q.	You indicated that you were traveling with your family and going to a location to deal with family -- your family situation; did your family members remain with you for the rest of that day of 9 April? 
A.	On the 9th of April I did not remain with the members of my family. 
Q.	And where did your -- where did you separate from the members of your family, I suppose, if it is a large geographical area that you could describe it as that would not reveal their identity, so if you could tell us, at least, the place name where they stayed? 
A.	You know, we were in Kiyovu, that is where we separated, the Kiyovu upper class area; there was also a lower class area.  I couldn't bring my vehicle, so I was going to fetch it. 
Q.	So, Witness, you have left your family in Kiyovu and you have indicated that you needed to go fetch your vehicle, presumably by returning to your home.  Did you stop anywhere on your return to your home where you were hoping to fetch your vehicle? 
A.	When we went back to get my car, I was in a different car.  And in that one, there was also               Noel Hitimana, he worked at RTLM; he was in the car with me.  We had to drop him off at RTLM on the 9th of April.  Number 9 also took advantage of that opportunity to speak with the director of RTLM who was there, Phocas Habimana was his name.  So we stopped at RTLM for that.  
Q.	Did you yourself go into the offices of RTLM on that occasion? 
A.	Yes, I did, I went inside of the offices. 
Q.	And what did you see inside of the office and whom did you see? 
A.	We went inside of the RTLM offices.  And in one room I saw Ruggiu, he was there as was Noel's family.  Ruggiu was there and he had a blackboard, on it there was a heading and the heading read out people to be killed.  I saw the names of some people I knew on the board.  Some of the names had been checked off, other names had a question mark next to them.  So I asked Ruggiu why are some of them checked off and why are there some question marks?  And he told me that the ones that are checked off means that they have already been killed.  And the question marks represented people whose whereabouts they did not know, they didn't know if they had been killed or not. 
Q.	And, approximately, how many names were on that -- on that board, be they checked off or not checked off or question marked? 
A.	There were 20 or so names. 
Q.	Do you recall any of the names? 
A.	Yes, I can give you the name of Uwilingiyimana, Agathe, Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, Faustin Twagiramungu and Ngango Félicien, Gafaranga, and many other opposition members. 
Q.	Witness, where did you spend the night of April 9th -- well, first of all, did you spend the night of       April 9th at your home? 
A.	I did not. 
Q.	Where did you spend that night? 
A.	I spent that night at Number 9's house. 
Q.	Why did you spend the night at Number 9's house? 
A.	When we came back from my house, when we went to get the car, we stopped at Number 6's house.  We stayed there a while, chatting and drinking, and we left quite late.  Number 9 offered me a place to stay at his house for the night, and I accepted the offer. 
Q.	Could you describe what happened on the morning of the 10th of April 1994? 
A.	On the morning of the 10th of April 1994 between 10 and 12, Number 6 came to Number 9's house.  He came to tell me that Joseph Nzirorera wanted to see us, since I was there.  In fact, he came with the military jeep, and he said that we could take that jeep to the l'hôtel des Diplomates where the government members were.  I was not only with Number 9, Number 8 was already there, as were 7 and 8, they came to stay at Number 9's place.  We got into that military vehicle, and we went to the l'hôtel des Diplomates. 
Q.	I believe you indicated that you were with 6, 7, 8 and 9; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Now, did any of these individuals indicate that they had had any encounters with violence or with conflict during the course of the previous two or three days? 
A.	There was Number 8 who lived on the Remera side of town, which at that time was occupied by the RPF soldiers.  So he wanted to leave his house to come to town.  Since he didn't have a vehicle, he needed to see his neighbour to find ways and means of leaving the area.  When he left his house to go to the neighbour, he met with the RPF soldiers who were patrolling around his house, and he took fright.  The RPF soldier asked him why was he afraid, "What's up, what is wrong with you," they said.  He said that he was afraid to remain in the area, and he wanted to evacuate his family towards the town, towards Kigali town.  So the soldiers told him not to be afraid, if you have the opportunity to leave, you can leave because we are not killers like those people on the other side.  On the other side were the soldiers of the FAR.  So the gentleman went and tried to find out how to leave the area.  And he subsequently left Remera to come to Kigali town. 
Q.	You indicated that you were called to the l'hôtel des Diplomates, what happened at the l'hôtel des Diplomates when you arrived.  
A.	When we reached the l'hôtel des Diplomates, we were received by Mr. Nzirorera, and he took us to a place where we had a meeting.  He was accompanied by Édouard Karemera and Justin Mugenzi.  
Q.	Well, did you see anyone else at the hotel? 
A.	At the hotel there were many people, there were politicians, there were ministers and some individuals who had sought refuge there.  I was able to see the minister, I saw Eliezer, I was able to see the minister for foreign affairs, Bicamumpaka, and I also saw Barayagwiza; amongst the individuals there was the older brother of Robert, his wife and his sister.  There were other men there whom I knew. 
Q.	In terms of political party leaders beyond those that you have just described Nzirorera and Karemera and Mugenzi, did you see any other political party leaders? 
A.	I told you that I saw Barayagwiza.  I saw the leaders of the PSD, the minister of public works, Rafiki, I also saw the chairman of the PSD, François Ndungutse, and he was also there. 
Q.	Any other officials of the political MRND party, were they present? 
A.	There was Mathieu Ngirumpatse who was there.  There was, obviously, the president of the republic from the MRND. 
Q.	And just to be clear, the president --  
A.	There was also Ferdinand Kabagaba (phonetic).  
Q.	And just to be clear, the president of the republic at this stage was -- what was his name? 
A.	He was known as Theodore Sindikubwabo. 
Q.	Now, what was discussed at this meeting that you indicated that you had at the hotel? 
A.	When we were taken to the place where we had been asked to go, the meeting was chaired by   Joseph Nzirorera who told us that the government had given him a personal mission, a mission that he had to accomplish personally, to go and see his Interahamwe.  This is the possessive use of the term, his Interahamwe.  And he said that since he was so involved with the government, he wanted to hand over that mission to us to go and ask the Interahamwe, the people who were manning the roadblocks, to try and stop the killings, put an end to the killings and to collect the dead bodies which were along the roads.  And that the members of government he was, the following morning, was going to ask the general head office of the public works and another ministry to ask for caterpillars or lorries for collecting the bodies and having them buried in mass graves.  He said it was necessary to do this because the international community was beginning to get concerned and the dead bodies had to be gotten rid of. 
Q.	And how did the people that you were with, that were there from the Interahamwe react to this request to undertake this mission? 
A.	When he finished, the people with whom I was, and myself -- I'm sorry I forgot to mention that    Number 4 on our list also attended the meeting, but he withdraw after a certain time because he had other things to do.  So we accepted to carry out the mission.  We accepted to do the job.  And I think I asked, because of the insecurity, I had asked that for us to be able to do this job we needed to be provided with security.  And Joseph Nzirorera did not hesitate to tell us that the soldiers who were his own bodyguards would accompany us on this mission, and they would be responsible for our security, they would watch over us. 
Q.	Was there any discussion of the transport that you would need to undertake this mission and how that would be provided? 
A.	I think I have just said it.  When we concluded the meeting with the group who -- that accompanied Nzirorera, I asked that we be provided with security; in other words, that we be provided with transport and soldiers.  And Mr. Nzirorera said that there was no problem because there were these soldiers, soldiers who were his own bodyguards, those soldiers would be responsible for our security as we did that job.  And we took the soldiers and the jeep, a jeep that was being used by those soldiers, in order for us to do that job. 
Q.	And where did you go in undertaking and fulfilling this mission? 
A.	We went into the secteur, and when I am talking about secteur, the communal secteurs because it is quite easy to meet people in the commune secteur.  We, first of all, started with the roadblock which was at Biryogo, and in the Biryogo area after that we went to the Nyamirambo secteur, after the Nyamirambo secteur, we went into Nyakabanda and after Nyakabanda to Kimisagara and from Kimisagara to Gasyata, Gasyata to Muhima, and then after Muhima, we went to Kiyovu, the lower class of Kiyovu.  We wanted to go to the Remera secteur in Kimihurura.  It was not possible for us to do that because the zone was considered risky because the RPF were there.  So we went to Gikondo, and that is where we ended our mission and went back to the l'hôtel des Diplomates very late at about 6,      6:30 p.m. 
(Pages 54 to 58 by Donna M. Lewis)


























1745H 
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	And what -- what message did you deliver at each of these secteurs?  
A.	At each of these secteurs we delivered the message which was given to us by the Nzirorera group, in other words, that the government had sent us to ask you to stop the killings and to ensure that the dead bodies that were in the neighbourhood to be brought to the roads.  That way the following morning lorries would come by to collect the dead bodies.  That was the message that we delivered to the people.  
Q.	And what reaction did you receive at these various stops?  
A.	In many places they welcomed this quite readily, but at each time they required firearms because there were roadblocks.  And at most roadblocks it's mostly the traditional weapons that were being used, so they were asking for firearms.  We had a small difficulty at Kimisagara where there was a conseiller known as Rose.  As we arrived, she was getting ready to go somewhere.  So we stopped her, and we told her that we had a mission, that we needed to have a meeting with the people from her secteur.  

The lady said, "No, no, no.  You have to wait because I have something to finish.  There are people here whom I have to deal with, and then I'll come back to you."  

We told her at that point in time that "No, no, no.  The government has told us that we must tell you to stop the killings.  Now, you must try to the collect the bodies which are in the neighbourhood."  She thought about this for a while, and she agreed.  That was the only problem that we encountered during that trip.  
Q.	Now, during the course of your -- of your trip through the various secteurs in Kigali-ville, did you see evidence of the killings that had taken place?  
A.	I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor.  I didn't quite understand your question. 
Q.	Well, as you were taking this trip, did you see, as you traveled, evidence that killings had taken place?  
A.	As I have said earlier, when I left my house on the 9th of April, already there were many dead bodies on the roads; and these dead bodies had not been collected or removed.  So when we carried out that mission, apart from the roads that I was on on the 9th -- because the main roads of Kigali city had thousands and thousands of dead bodies on the streets.  And I can also tell you that most of the dead bodies had belonged to Tutsis.  
Q.	And were the bodies of persons that -- were they young or old or men or women?  Would you tell us generally what you observed, in terms of the characteristics of the victims?  
A.	I can tell you that there are all categories -- men, women, children, young men.  All categories were involved.  
Q.	Now, during the course of the -- of this mission, did you ask anyone to take down the roadblocks?  
A.	The mission assigned to us did not include us asking the Interahamwe to dismantle the roadblocks, so we undertook the mission and the roadblocks remained.  We only asked (sic) for what we were asked to do.  
Q.	You told us earlier that you returned to the hotel in the evening.  Whom did you see when you returned to the hotel?  
A.	When we returned to the hotel in the evening, once again we met the same individuals, in other words, Nzirorera, Karemera and Mugenzi.  
Q.	And what did you say to them?  
A.	We gave a report on the mission effected, and we said that there had been many dead bodies on the streets and that the inhabitants had agreed to -- had -- had welcomed the request and that the people were asking for firearms when we spoke to them about what they had to do.  
Q.	Did you describe what you had seen on the streets?  
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, please, could you repeat your question?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, I'd like to object to that question as being leading. 
MR. RAPP:
I don't think it suggests an answer.  Don't believe it's a leading question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I overruled your objection. 
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  Thank you.  
BY MR. RAPP:
Q.	Would you answer the -- Witness, the question again was:  Did you describe what you had seen on the streets, what you had seen as you made your trip around these various secteurs of Kigali-ville? 
A.	As I have just told you, we told those people that the number of dead bodies on the streets was very high.  And when we said that the number was high, amongst the three there were two who demonstrated satisfaction when they heard that the number of dead was high.  
Q.	And -- and who were those individuals, and how did they demonstrate that satisfaction?  
A.	The people were Karemera, Édouard, and Justin Mugenzi.  These two expressed joy, I would say, when they heard that there had been a large number of dead bodies, and this could be seen on their faces, how they were expressing themselves or how they held themselves.  
Q.	You indicated to them -- you indicated to us in your testimony a moment ago that you had told the -- those at the hotel about the request for weapons.  Was there any reaction from them as to that specific request on the evening that you made your report?  
A.	No.  That evening there was no reaction to the request made by the members of the population.  
Q.	Were any weapons distributed that evening at the hotel?  
A.	No.  
Q.	From what you saw and what you heard in your meeting with these gentlemen, did it appear to you that the government wanted the killings to stop permanently?  
A.	As far as I was concerned, it was not for the killings to be stopped.  It was only to give an impression to the international community that there had not been many killings or that there had been none.  That was my view, because they did not express any desire or wish to us in order to ensure that the killings were stopped.  
Q.	Well, Witness, were there any other organisations or -- or groups or means that you saw the government employ at this time to stop the killings that were utilised in conjunction with your mission?  
A.	To my knowledge, no.  
Q.	If the government had wanted the killings to stop permanently, could it have done that at that time, from your observation?  
A.	According to me, the government and the party leaders could give orders to the soldiers to have the killings in Kigali stopped.  It was not by sending us to say that this would have been effected.  The killings could have been stopped if the same individuals -- in other words, the members of the parties and some members of government and some soldiers had themselves carried out that mission by asking to stop the killings and to remove the roadblocks, the killings in Kigali would, indeed, have been stopped.  
Q.	At that time did you see any other examples of -- of government action to stop particular conduct that had worked or hadn't worked, to your observation?  
A.	As far as I know and from the speeches made by the leaders later on, they didn't even have the desire to stop the killings.  To the contrary, in their speeches, they were inciting the people to continue with the killings.  
Q.	After your particular tour, did killings continue in Kigali?  
A.	Immediately after the mission in the evening, the RPF threw bombs into Kigali town.  And the RTLM radio when it was reporting all this -- there were also the Tutsis from Kivugiza who were burnt alive by the RPF.  And all this was on radio RTLM, and the people became angry on that occasion; and the killings began again that very night of the 10th of April.  
Q.	Where did you go on the 11th of April?  
A.	On the 11th of April, I went to spend the night at the place where I had left my family members.  
Q.	And on the 12th of April, where did you go?  
A.	On 12th April, I left Kigali to go to my native area.  
Q.	I think you may have told us in the open session that that native area was Butare, which is a large place which doesn't reveal your identity.  Were you heading toward Butare?  
A.	Yes, I went to Butare.  
Q.	And before you went to Butare, did you make any stops in the Kigali area before your departure?  
A.	Before leaving Kigali, I was obliged to accompany one member of my family -- the members of my family to the Hôtel des Diplomates, and we arrived there in the morning.  The members of government had already left for Gitarama so we went back to the house.  From the house, there was a convoy which was organised, and we went to Butare.  Before getting to Butare, we stopped at Gitarama. 
Q.	And when you stopped at Gitarama, did you see any evidence that there had been killings in the Gitarama area?  
A.	In the Gitarama area, there was nothing which could tell you that there had been killings.  The killings had not stopped -- had not started -- I beg your pardon -- and the people were going about their normal business.  
Q.	Were there roadblocks in -- in Gitarama préfecture?  
A.	No.  No, there were no roadblocks in Gitarama préfecture.  
Q.	You said that you were heading to Butare and made a stop in Gitarama.  About what time of day did you arrive in Butare?  
A.	I would say we got to Butare at around two or three in the afternoon.  
Q.	And when you reached Butare, did you see roadblocks?  
A.	There were no roadblocks in Butare.  
Q.	Did you see evidence of killings in Butare?  
A.	No.  There were no killings in Butare. 
Q.	Now, Witness, during the subsequent days in Butare, did you attend any public meetings in Butare?  
A.	Yes.  I participated in a meeting held by the préfet.  The area commander of Ngoma camp was there.  His name was Hategekimana, if I'm not mistaken. 
Q.	And when you're referring to the préfet, who are you talking about?  
A.	At that time the préfet was Jean Habyarimana.  He was a Tutsi member of the PL party. 
Q.	And what did the préfet say at this meeting?  
A.	He assured the population by telling them that what was going on in the other préfectures would not -- could not happen in Butare and that he was sure of it.  He said that he would be assisted by the soldiers there.  The Ngoma camp representative Hategekimana was there.  He spoke to confirm what the préfet had just told the population.  In other words, Butare would be spared.  There would be no killings there.  
Q.	And approximately what day was this public meeting where Préfet Habyarimana spoke?  
A.	It was between the 12th and 19th of April 1994. 
Q.	Well, did there come a day when things changed in Butare?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  Again, I don't -- now that we're going to a slightly different topic, I just want to let you know we have to move everything out of the courtroom this evening.  As I understand it, we have to leave.  So -- and I need to do some preparation if I'm going to start cross-examination this week, so can we recess around the time of the scheduling order?  
MR. RAPP:
I was trying to get in a few extra questions, Your Honour.  We are moving tomorrow to a different courtroom; is that correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  But we will be here in the afternoon but need to move our materials out so that they don't interfere with the other trial in the morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Something is -- something -- the courtroom has other uses tomorrow morning. 
MR. RAPP:
Fine.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we ought to recess now.  

Yes, tomorrow we start at 3:30 in Courtroom III.  
MR. RAPP:
I -- that's clear.  We're moving courtrooms because -- I didn't know whether video equipment would work in the other courtrooms. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, video equipment will work in Courtroom III.
MR. RAPP:
Okay.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I need to remind you of what I've told you before that during the adjournment, as on all other adjournments, you're not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  

We take adjournment now until tomorrow. 
(Court adjourned at 1810H)
