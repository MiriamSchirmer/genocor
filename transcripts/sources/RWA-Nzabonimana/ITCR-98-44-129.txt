MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everyone.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MR FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, Presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, 21 June 2005, in the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, 
Case Number ICTR 98-44-C-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Fry.  I now have a written counsel appearance slip delivered to me by the registrar, so we can commence proceedings.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Am I not coming through? 
MR. HOOPER:
Loud and clear.  

Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning. 
MR. HOOPER:
Good morning, Mr. Witness. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Counsel.  
MR. HOOPER:
Good morning.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. HOOPER:
I had committed myself to half an hour this morning, but looking at the transcripts that I received last night, it may just go over that.  But I'll see if I can be as quickly as possible -- quickly as possible.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, do you know a man called Laurent Hitimana?  That is, A- -- that's -- sorry, 
	L-A-U-R-E-N-T, Laurent Hitimana?
A.	I do not know that person.  
Q.	*********'s bar in February of 1994, you go in there and you see the named people that you gave us last week, and André Rwamakuba was there, sat with them.  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And was this early or late in February of 1994? 
A.	I remember that it was in the month of February 1994 and that's all.  
Q.	Do you agree that while you have mentioned the bar before, and you've mentioned all but one of those names of people in the bar before, that until you gave evidence, you never said or told anybody associated with the Prosecution that you had heard André Rwamakuba say anything in that bar?  That's right, isn't it?  You never said André Rwamakuba said such and such.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	I didn't know to whom I should speak, and this is why I didn't say anything to anyone whatsoever. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
	If Counsel had mentioned the name of the bar, could he repeat it because it was missed in the interpretation.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
	**************.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, could I remind Counsel to give us the necessary pauses.  That's why we are missing the beginning of his questions because we have this relay system on.  He needs to wait for the French to complete its interpretation.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  I'm just trying to hurry up.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You said that you heard -- you heard them saying that in the coming days the Hutu were going to exterminate the Hutu -- the Tutsis.  Is that right?  Do you remember saying that and is it true? 
A.	That's what I heard and that is what I said and it is true.  
Q.	So why didn't you tell anyone associated with the Prosecutor that it had been said before you entered the witness box?  Why was that? 
A.	Yesterday, I told you that I met three different agents of the Prosecution.  I do not know whether the statements taken by these various agents of the Prosecution was disclosed to you, and I do not know whether they wrote down everything I told them.  
Q.	So you're saying that, in fact, you did tell someone about this before; is that right? 
A.	I've said this when I was making my statements.  I do recall that I had mentioned this to the investigators who, in turn, told me that I would give further explanation when I will be in court.  
MR. HOOPER:
I still see a microphone in the booth, so I'm not saying anything.  Fine.  I think they think I've got the message now.  If I see the light on, I mustn't talk.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But don't you think, Mr. Witness, that the investigators had ears hungry for the kind of thing that you say that they forgot to write down? 
A.	If I were to refer to the statement taken down by the first investigator, I would say that they didn't write down everything I told them.  They only took down a summary.  As for the other team of investigators, which came to meet me, I noticed that in the document that they wrote, there were so many mistakes, and they didn't come back to me so that I could make the necessary corrections.  
Q.	And what about Mr. Morley, Mr. Morley who sits there, who I know?  You're not telling me he missed that, are you? 
A.	I also met the Prosecutor who's here.  I spoke to him about what was said in that bar.  I believe I reported to him everything I'd said when I was meeting with the investigators.  I believe I mentioned that to him.  
Q.	You see, he hasn't got one of your statements of extermination.  It's remarkable, isn't it, if you said that? 
A.	For me, "extermination" means the extermination of the Tutsis.  This is quite evident in the genocide that was committed against the Tutsis.  
Q.	And so, perhaps, Mr. Witness, we are reasonably driven to the conclusion that you never told anyone at any time about André Rwamakuba speaking about extermination of the Tutsis, that you've never used those words before you got into that witness box.  Is that, in fact, the case? 
A.	I have the impression that you are insisting on this matter, and I do not agree with you.  I told you that I told this to the various investigators that I met, and I also told you, that I told this to the Prosecutor who's here today with us in Court.  
Q.	Well, all this talk of extermination of your people in October, November, January, February -- during that period, all this talk of extermination of your people, did you go and talk about this with anybody, or did you keep it to yourself? 
A.	Since these words were very often mentioned in Rwanda, everybody was aware of them, and they were talking about it.  Furthermore, during this period of time, we were suffering oppression.  There were songs which were sung in public and mentioned this extermination.  It was not necessary for me to speak about it because everybody knew.  
Q.	Well, did you go and tell *********************************************, the ticked list, did you go and tell him or discuss with him about -- for example, the meetings about which you'd been getting information from various people and about you hearing -- after the meetings of Rwamakuba talking of extermination in meetings in Nduba and Sha and Kayanga?  Did you go and tell your brother or discuss with your brother about that? 
A.	I didn't speak about this with my brother merely for the sake of speaking.  We talked about the various problems that were facing us, and we didn't want to say this because we would have been attacked.  
Q.	Where does your brother live in relation to you?  How -- how far away from you does he live? 
A.	My brother was my neighbour.  His house was about *********** away from mine.  
Q.	So presumably he heard these vehicles coming by, driven by Rwamakuba or with Rwamakuba on the microphone calling people to these meetings.  He must have heard those as well, must he?
A.	You can ask him that question; I can't speak for him.  
Q.	Well, you're not your brother's keeper.  Do you know? 
A.	I think I have answered your question; I have nothing to add.  
Q.	Well, I'll ask one more question -- I'm going to ask one more question on this:  Did you ever talk with your brother about those meetings, your brother living ********? 
A.	Since he was present in the area and that he was an adult, I think he must know something about it.  But for me, it would be better for you to call him to testify and ask him that question.  I do not wish to answer in his -- on his behalf.  
Q.	I'm not asking you to answer on his behalf.  Did you discuss those meetings with your *********** brother?  Yes or no?  
A.	We discussed this, yes, because he, himself, said that he was a witness of the same events as myself.  
Q.	And by that you mean a witness to the same meetings or the calling of the same meetings in October, November, whenever?  Is that right? 
A.	I think I have suggested that you call him to testify and ask him questions.  I don't think I want to venture into that field of answering questions on his behalf.  
Q.	Let me move to another -- to another subject and that is the other speeches that you heard after the death of President Habyarimana.  And the first one you refer to was the swearing-in ceremony.  You remember yesterday you said that that was -- you heard André Rwamakuba's swearing-in, and it was in Kinyarwanda.  We have a transcript of that, and it's obvious that he was sworn in not in Kinyarwanda, but in French, if you want to change your evidence about that.  
A.	I cannot confirm whether he spoke -- whether he was sworn in in French or Kinyarwanda.  There were many ministers who were sworn in.  I heard him being sworn in and whether he used French or Kinyarwanda, I do not know.  
Q.	But you said yesterday it was Kinyarwanda, so do you want to change that to "I don't know"? 
A.	Counsel, you're asking me a question about the language which was used during the swearing-in.  They were many ministers.  Some took their oath in Kinyarwanda or in French; I can't say that X or Y used Kinyarwanda during the swearing-in ceremony, but I'm happy that you have accepted that, indeed, he did take his oath.  
Q.	There is no dispute about that.  After the oath, there was a speech, you told us, by the new 
	prime minister, Jean Kambanda, and you listened to that with keen interest; is that right? 
A.	Since I was listening to the radio broadcasts, I do remember that other speeches were made.  But the one which was of interest to me, because its content give me fear, was the one made by Kambanda.  
Q.	And you told us this last week, in respect of that speech after the swearing-in on the 9th, that what he said was that they were to get rid of the enemy who were the Tutsis.  He called on the youth to go to the front.  He called on them to erect roadblocks.  In your words, "to ensure no Tutsi escaped."  In your words, "a clear instruction to kill the Tutsis."  And that's what you heard, was it? 
A.	And that is correct.  That's, indeed, what I heard at that time.  
Q.	Do you think perhaps your recollection of that speech is no more accurate than your recollection of Rwamakuba's words after the central hospital in Kigali was shelled? 
A.	I don't know where you're bringing out this speech from Gishaka.  In fact, I never referred to that speech.  As for Kambanda's speech, that was made a long time ago.  I didn't retain everything that was said by Kambanda.  I didn't record that statement, but I gave you the political -- the policy outline that he was speaking of at that time.  
Q.	Well, let me relate to you from the transcript -- I have what he said.  I'll read it slowly for the interpreters, and it's not very long.  "I, Jean Kambanda, in the name of All Mighty God" -- and he swears to be faithful to his duties and to promote the interests of the Rwandan people.  And then he says this:  "These are difficult times for our country.  A government will soon be assembled to deal with the problems of the war, the prevailing insecurity, and the famine which has devastated several regions in the country, affecting mostly those displaced by the war.  The parties participating in the government will focus their work on these three areas and have presented them as the fundamental guidelines that this government will follow.  

"In these difficult times and with these delicate tasks, we would like to see the following ministers help us in this government."  He then recites the names of the ministers.  He ends:  "Here, Mr. President, are the people whose collaboration I seek to help me meet the three objectives set for us by the parties forming this government." 

Now, did you hear something else other than that? 
A.	You're giving the impression that your limiting yourself to certain words, because that's not all that he said in his speech.  
Q.	Can I move to the speech you told us about -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, is there some reference of the document that you put to the witness? 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  There's a -- there's a strange Prosecution document that contain, at least part of that, but it's an amalgam of different speeches, that -- not to be in a contested position, I just read from that document, but I have other translations.  And that document is Exhibit 32 -- or the part of it I read from is 
Exhibit 32 -- radio broadcasts of the speech by Jean Kambanda on the 9th -- of the 9th of April.  And it's in our bundle; the first page of that, which is an amalgam.  So if you come to the bundle, I urge caution for reasons which will become apparent when you look at the document that the Prosecution have put there.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Now, if we can come to the Diplomat Hotel and I look at your evidence of the 16th of June '05, in the draft at page 5 -- those page numbers will not necessary follow into the revised, authorised transcript -- and you may recall -- and I summarise that you told us last week this:  That you heard that the préfets had received instructions to set up roadblocks, to hunt and kill Tutsis, your people, and that the ministers were to go out to the préfecture to organise all this, and that you subsequently heard, amongst other people, André Rwamakuba interviewed on the radio.  And what he was saying, you told us, was this:  "It was necessary to erect roadblocks and the Tutsi had to be hunted, hunted down and killed.  That is what he said in the interview" -- you told us -- and that interview was on the 11th of April in the evening.  And you added, "He said that the Tutsis had to be hunted down and killed, so that when the -- if the Inkotanyi were to come, they would find no Tutsis to support them."  Do you remember saying that, and is it your truthful recollection? 
A.	All I have said is true, and this is what I said last week, and I confirm that.  I stand by that.  
Q.	See, I have a translation of Jean Kambanda's speech of that meeting to the préfet on the 11th of April.  Do you know, it doesn't say anything like that?  Is that a surprise to you? 
A.	As for that speech of the 11th of April, I didn't refer to that myself.  I remember that I spoke about an interview on the radio given by Rwamakuba.  
Q.	You heard no such thing, did you? 
A.	Yes.  During the interview when they were answering questions by the journalists, this is when I heard that the préfets had received instructions to go and erect roadblocks in their various préfectures.  I heard this on the Radio RTLM and on Radio Rwanda.  
Q.	I'm not going to read you all this speech, that is, the directions of Jean Kambanda to his préfet.  It would take too long.  But I'm going to just quote two or three things from it, and I'm going to ask you if, at any time, you heard this reflected in anything you heard when you were listening with keen interest to your radio.  

He said, "We've asked them, the RPF, for a ceasefire.  When we are trying to explain to them, and we're trying to explain to them, that the political problems of Rwanda will not be resolved by armed conflict.  The political problems will be solved by negotiations.  The negotiations must continue even during the fighting; they are indispensable."  Did you hear anything like that? 
A.	I didn't follow the speech made on the 11th of April.  All I did was to listen to the interviews the ministers gave to journalists on the radio.  

Furthermore, like the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, himself, explained before this Tribunal, he admitted having planned and executed the genocide, so I don't know why you're relying on the speech that he made.  I'm referring to Kambanda.  You need to look at the instructions that were given to the structures at grassroots level and the population; that would be more practicable in my view.  
Q.	I'm asking you, sir, direct questions relating to events at the time on the 11th of April.  I'm going to read one other part of it to you.  Directions, this is obviously, to the préfet.  "You have to explain that the events which took place", he said, "the death of the head of state, the violence which broke out in Kigali city, the breaking out of the hostilities by the RPF Inkotanyi, should not be a pretext for the Rwandan people to fight each other.  You have to explain until the people understand that the country is populated by three ethnic groups, the Hutu, the Tutsi and the Twa, that the country is composed by many regions, and that whatever should be his region or his ethnical (sic) group, every Rwandan has a role to play in this country.  Nobody has the right to move away another.  You must tell them to avoid everything which is dividing them."  Now, did you hear anything like that? 
A.	No.  I told you that I didn't hear that speech, and I'm telling you that Kambanda admitted or pleaded guilty to the acts that he committed.  And I do not think that that speech has anything to do with me.  
Q.	You see, I'm not asking you about the intricacies of what happened in the genocide.  I'm asking you whether this speech, the transcript of which I hold, is what you heard or whether you heard something completely different.
MR. MORLEY:
May I raise, at this stage, to my feet.  My learned friend has pursued a line of questioning with regard to the Kambanda speech of the 9th of April, and I fully understand why.  But it may be plain to the Court that the witness has, on four occasions now, answered that his interpretation of events flows largely from the interviews he says he heard on the radio and not the Kambanda speech.  So that my learned friend's cross-examination of the witness with regard to the Kambanda speech is really a vehicle for my learned friend simply reading out the speech, when the witness is not in a position to comment.  

Now, it may be that the Court, I know not, has reached a stage where the line of cross-examination has no further assistance that can be offered to the Court through this witness.  It's a matter for the Tribunal.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm coming to the conclusion anyway of this aspect, and perhaps I'll wrap it up in this way.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You said you heard André Rwamakuba and, as I understand it, others on the 11th of April, relating what Jean Kambanda had said at the préfet meeting.  Is that right? 
A.	Yes, I heard him answer the questions put to him by the reporter, and he was explaining the recommendations that had been made during the cabinet -- during the meeting.  
Q.	You see, I'm putting to you that it's extraordinary that the ministers should have related something so different to what he said.  Do you understand? 
A.	I do not think it's up to me to answer that question.  You must put the question instead to the Accused.  
Q.	And, finally, you spoke about Murambi  -- sorry, you spoke about -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm double pressing on it. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Finally, you spoke about a meeting at Murambi.  Again, something you were listening to on the radio, you told us, and this was about a week after the diplomats -- the préfet meeting on the 11th, you told us.  And by then, you told us, the government had gone to Gitarama, that it had fled Kigali.  Do you know what date, because you seem to have got these dates at your fingertips, do you know what date -- do you know what date the government went to Gitarama? 
A.	You told me that you had all the documents.  I'm sure that this date appears in your documents.  I think, if you wish to know, that government went to Gitarama on the 12th of April.  
Q.	Indeed.  I quite accept that.  And do you know they left at about 10 in the morning and it took about four, five hours to get there?  Did you listen to all of that on the radio? Can you confirm that? 
A.	As to when they left, I know nothing because I do not even know what road they took to go to Gitarama.  All I know is that I heard that the government had moved and had now set up in Gitarama.  
Q.	And you then heard that André Rwamakuba had been made spokesman for the government.  This was announced by a journalist, that the name of the journalist you can't recall.  Do you remember saying that, and is it true? 
A.	Yes, I heard a journalist announce that Rwamakuba had been appointed spokesperson for the government.  I said that, yes.  
Q.	May I make it plain that it's not accepted that he was, but it's not a question, just a statement of the Defence's position on that.  But you then said that you heard André Rwamakuba telling the nation on the radio, I quote from your evidence that the government's objective was to call the young people of the Interahamwe to fight in order to defend the country by killing Tutsis.  And he went on and read out the results of the meeting of bourgmestre and he said that bourgmestres have not been -- who were not active in killing -- in fact, he used the word "extermination" -- the bourgmestres -- some bourgmestres were not active in extermination.  And then you said he said this, "Tutsis should be exterminated.  Go and man the roadblocks, go and exterminate the Tutsis."  And this you all heard on your radio.  Do you remember saying that, and is it the truth? 
A.	I didn't have my own radio.  I had my own radio set.  But I confirm, I did not have a radio station -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- corrects the witness.
THE WITNESS:
-- I had my own radio set.  I confirm that I heard this.  And I heard this both on Radio Rwanda and RTLM.  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	That is a little detail that you have just added, is it, that you just remembered? 
A.	I added nothing.  You asked me whether I heard this, and I just confirmed that I heard them.  
Q.	Are you aware that extensive records have been kept on broadcasts made by both Radio Rwanda and RTLM?  Are you aware of that? 
MR. MORLEY:
May I just interrupt for a moment.  The use of the word "extensive" I'm concerned about.  My learned friend is right, there are records of broadcasts.  But the difficulty with the way the question is being put, is that it is loaded with the word "extensive".  My learned friend is perfectly entitled to say to the witness that there are broadcasts which have been kept, but it is by no means extensive, the collection that the Prosecution has.  
MR. HOOPER:
I used the word "extensive" and I'm going to stick to it.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Are you aware that there are extensive records of broadcasts? 
A.	I'm not a specialist in radio technology.  I asked the Prosecution team member who came to see me in the first instance to go and check these archives, and try to obtain documents that existed at the time.  For example, the announcement or press release that was broadcast on the radio went through our bourgmestre in Gitarama to demonstrate that the bourgmestre had implemented or carried out the instructions that he had received.  As to radio techniques, I have no experience of that.  
Q.	Of the six or seven people in ****************************, two you told us had -- had died during the events.  Do you know how they died? 
A.	Unless the list of these people is made available to me, I would not be able to remember which of these people is dead.  
Q.	Well, I'm not going to take up time, unless I have to.  Do you remember saying that two of those people were dead, and that they, in fact, died during the events?  It's your evidence.  Do you remember it? 
A.	Yes, I remember two people, and I did learn that these two people died in 1994, and that one of them died in prison.  
Q.	I'm sorry to take up time.  Can you be shown the list of names 1 to 11 that you produced.  Will you look please at number 11 on the list.  And was he a judge?  Do you remember?  And did he die, and where and when do you say that he died, please? 
A.	People said that this person was a judge, that he had been transferred to Rubungo court.  Afterwards -- that is, after the war, I learnt that he had died in April or May -- in April or May of 1994, that is, during the genocide.  But, however, I cannot say what month exactly it was, but it was one of the two.  
Q.	In your original statement you say he died in April of 1994.  Do you accept that you said that? 
A.	Yes, it is an estimate.  I gave an approximate time based on the information that I received.  That is why I say that he may have died around April 1994.  However, I was not present when he died.  
Q.	Can I ask you, please, to look at number 9.  When and where and, if you know, how did he die? 
A.	I heard about this person, that this person had died in ******** near this bar -- the bar that we mentioned.  It was said that he had been found near a roadblock and that he had been arrested during the fighting.  The people who arrested him are those who were fighting with the government army -- the then national army, so it was near the bar that has been mentioned in this courtroom before.  
Q.	Sorry, who do you say suggested killed him?  Could you make that clear.  
A.	I have just said that he was found at a roadblock that had been put up by the Interahamwe.  Since there was fighting between the government army and the Inkotanyi, I learnt that the Inkotanyi had found these people at the roadblock -- this person at the roadblock and that this person was arrested in those circumstances.  Later on, I heard that people had been killed, including the person we are referring to.  
Q.	Now, approximately how many people in your area would you estimate were killed by the RPF Inkotanyi when they arrived in your area? 
A.	I cannot give you an exhaustive answer because I didn't count these people, and it is difficult for me to determine people who were killed by the Inkotanyi and those who were killed by the government army.  However, I know that some people were killed based on their ethnic origin -- that is, those who were killed during the genocide and others who were killed when they were found at roadblocks killing other people.  
Q.	So, it's right, the Tutsis were picked on and killed, and it's also right that Hutus were picked on and killed.  Would that be fair to say that? 
A.	You should, instead, ask me questions regarding those who were killed during the genocide.  This is, I believe, a genocide trial.  Apparently, you are not sufficiently curious about these elements.  Other things seem to be of much greater concern to you.  
Q.	Hundreds of thousands of Tutsis, many, many children were butchered in April, May of 1994.  We know that.  It was terrible.  And you lost family yourself; that was terrible.  That's my position.  But do you turn a blind eye to the Hutu dead?  Do you, sir? 
A.	People were killed during the fighting.  There were Interahamwes who had joined government army who were killed during the fighting.  Perhaps you might try to count the people who were killed in these circumstances.  Perhaps that is a duty for the government, that is, to count and find out the people who were killed in these circumstances.  That is what I have to say on the matter.  
Q.	I asked you to try and estimate the number of local people killed -- local people killed, who were Hutu.  In excess of a thousand?  Yes or no? 
A.	I have always -- I've always wondered why you were emphasising this number.  Perhaps you'll end up asking me their names.  Perhaps you have not asked me enough questions about the victims who were killed by these groups of people.  What surprises me is that you're more -- more interested about this group of people and you want to know the details.  I really don't see why.  
Q.	You -- you're more interested in the other group?  Is that the position? 
A.	The reason I'm here is to give testimony in a genocide trial in regard to people who planned and executed the genocide.  Of all the people on the list, most played a part in planning and carrying out this genocide.  That is why I'm here.  
Q.	If I may move to a final -- very final subject.  We heard yesterday how at one time an investigator and, indeed, a Prosecutor of this Court, had understood you to say that you'd been in Gikomero in April, in May and June.  And we heard yesterday that you disputed ever saying that.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	What I denied was the content of the second document prepared by the investigators.  I -- I even got the feeling that the interpreter made mistakes deliberately.  It must be known that Gikomero commune is divided into secteurs and cellules.  Amongst them is Gikomero secteur, which is called Gikomero.  If you want further explanation, I'm quite prepared to give them to you.  
Q.	Let's come to your evidence in this Court.  On the 8th of April you told us that you left to hide in the bush, and you then left ******** on the 14th, some six days later; is that correct?  Do you remember saying that, and is it true? 
A.	You're asking me to say the same thing over and over again.  Yes, that is how it happened; I experienced it.  
Q.	And can you look at D. 3 again, please, which is the sketch plan, just a -- so we're familiar with what you're saying here.  D. 3, please, I thank you.  

Where precisely do you say you were for those six days hiding in - in **********? 
A.	I hope that you're not denying that I stayed in ********.  If the sketch could allow it, I would even show you my residence.  I was in ********* cellule.

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Perhaps you can be shown your -- 
A.	Perhaps we should go out into the field so that I can show you.  
Q.	We might do that, but not just today.  But D. 3-GLM, if you can be shown that again, which is the -- the sketch where you very kindly marked the road for us yesterday, could you be shown that sketch?  And can I invite you to put a cross where -- where your -- where your home is on that document?  It will be under seal then, of course.  
A.	If everybody has the sketch, I can even indicate verbally.  This is the road that leads from ********* bridge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, Mr. Witness --  

I think we're going to say the same thing, so you can say it, if you wish. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour will be more eloquent. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, that information, really, should be confidential.  If you marked it on the map, we would then all see it, and I'm now ordering the registrar to put the map under seal.  
(Exhibit D. 3GLM admitted, under seal)
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	********** (phonetic), Mr. Witness, for that.  And you've shown both your house and by the foray; is that the place where you hid? 
A.	It's a wooded area on the hill, so there are no dwellings.  
Q.	But is that where you hid, where the foray is indicated?  Is that the hiding place?  
A.	Yes.  At a certain point in time, I was in the woods.  At other times, I was in one or another's house where I thought I could find refuge.  
Q.	And during that time, from the 8th to the 14th, some six days, did you hear very much shooting and firing of guns?  
A.	Yes, I heard firing.  And gunshots were coming from the hill opposite.  On the side of Kigali town, itself, there were also gunshots.  There were also gunshots which could be heard coming from Byumba direction.  
Q.	And including in gunshots, did you hear heavy weapons being fired, artillery, heavy mortars, things like that?  Could you distinguish, and could you hear such -- such sounds?  
A.	Yes.  We heard gunshots and detonations, and I think that those sounds were made by heavy weaponry coming from the combat zone.  
Q.	And would it be right to say that that heavy weaponry and firing, in fact, was going on from the 8th, onwards, through those several days, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th; is that right?  
A.	The shots or firing could be heard from the night of the 6th of April, and the sound came from the direction of the town.  We heard other gunshots and other weaponry sounds from the 9th, and that came from the Buriza (phonetic) and Rutongo areas.  Subsequently, other gunshots were heard when we were fleeing towards Byumba.  
Q.	How sure are you about your dates at this point, between the 8th and the 14th?  You're fearful with your family; you're trying to seek refuge.  How sure are you about the dates about when, for example, you got to Rutungo and such like?  
A.	I think that when you're talking about this specific period of time, all Rwandans, I believe, would be able to remember these dates.  Then let me make a correction.  I didn't go to Rutunga, I went to Rudongo (phonetic).  
Q.	Can you spell the name of the place you went to, please?  
A.	You want the spelling of the place name Rutongo?  
Q.	No.  You said, "I didn't go there; I went there."  Where was the place you actually went to?  Can you spell it, please?  
A.	Yes.  A moment ago you spoke of a name, and I realised that the name you gave was incorrect.  So let me spell, R-U-T-O-N-G-O, which spells Rutongo.  
Q.	I must have got my wires crossed.  I thought you said, "I didn't go to Rutongo; I went to Rubongu."  But it is Rutongo that you went to; is that right?  And if we look at our D. 3, our map sketch plan, we have it there; is that right?  
A.	Yes, it is, indeed, Rutongo, the Rutongo parish.  
Q.	And we have it marked there, top left of the Nkubana bridge, on the other side of the river Nyabugogo, there's Rutongo.  And you told us that you left ******** on the 14th.  You stayed the night with someone.  So we're now waking up on the 15th.  And you go to Rutongo, where you were met by priests, and that after two days, the Inkotanyi, the RPF arrived there, which would make it the 17th of April; is that your evidence?  
A.	You are confusing the dates.  Let me explain to you about these events once again.  On the 13th, one three, I crossed the Nyabugogo river, and I spent that night in the house of a member of the population.  On the 14th, I went up, and I got to Rutongo.  I spent a night there, and the following day, we were evacuated from that area because there was fighting.  And we were evacuated to an area which was more secure.  So I would say that would have been the 16th. 
Q.	But you told us that when you got to Rutongo, that it was after two days there, that the RPF Inkotanyi came; is that correct or not?  Or do you want to -- have I got that wrong, misunderstood you?  
A.	I see that you're putting words in my mouth, making me say things I didn't say.  I said that people that looked like soldiers had found me there and that these people informed us that the location was going to become the theatre of war, and they were going to evacuate us.  That's what I told you.  
Q.	Wasn't the position this, that Rutongo, that place, which is, itself, in a commune called Rutongo, but I'm talking about the place there at the top that's marked, fell to the RPF forces on the 8th of April?  They were there holding the town long before you arrived, on your evidence; isn't that right?  
A.	That's not at all true.  What I said is that people who were -- claimed to be Inkotanyi passed by there on the 9th, on their way to Kigali.  They didn't even stay in that place.  And when I arrived in that location, I didn't find them there.  
Q.	So now you're saying they were there on the 9th, but they'd gone on, and they weren't there when you got there?  That's your evidence now, is it?  
MR. MORLEY:
If I may make a small -- 
THE WITNESS:
I have just told you that when I arrived in that location, those people were no longer there.  Those people found me there later.  So I don't know their mode of operation.  I don't know what techniques they used in their operations.  I didn't find them in the location.  That's what I said.  
MR. MORLEY:
My learned friend may be thinking back to the first World War where battle lines were static for four years.  It's quite plain that from everything that my learned friend will know from having researched -- 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry.  Are we about to have some evidence from Captain Morley here?  Because it would be quite inappropriate, particularly as the witness is in the witness box with his earphones on.  And if you want to -- if the Prosecution want to adduce evidence of the flavour which one has just indicated, then they can do so, but it's not appropriate, I think, to put it in this way.  
MR. MORLEY:
I take my learned friend's point.  I'm simply responding to his.  He's been putting a presentation of the conflict in Rwanda which, in the way he's putting it, my learned friend may know that is not how the battle was fought in Rwanda.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know.  And we'll have to have, presumably, some degree of evidence about it.  But with this witness, if I can return to asking a question.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you're saying that the RPF Inkotanyi, were there in Rutongo on the 9th of April; is that your evidence?  
A.	People say that the Inkotanyi soldiers passed by there on the 9th.  That's what people said.  
Q.	I just want to ask one final thing, and it's this:  Were you with *****************************************, were you with him during this time?  And if not, why not?  
A.	We were not together.  We didn't find refuge in the same place.  We dispersed.  Some people were killed.  Others were able to survive, including myself.  Everyone went his or her own way.  Even my wife and children were not with me.  
Q.	And that wasn't because you were on the other side of the commune in Gikomero, was it?  
A.	I never left ******* to go to the other part of Gikomero commune.  Rather, I went towards Rutongo, and, actually, we lived in the Gikomero -- the border of Gikomero commune.  And that's where Gikomero commune borders Rutongo commune.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions.  And all I wish is that the statement, the investigator's report, and the will-say compiled by Mr. Morley of this witness's will-say, be exhibited.  I'm not sure if that requires being placed before the witness.  He's seen two of the documents.  I'm not sure he's been shown, formally, his statement, but unless the Prosecution have any objection, perhaps those could be exhibited in any event.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought Mr. Morley had requested that we address that issue after his re-examination.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we'll do it at that stage.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President.

Would it be possible to have a short break?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I was just -- I suppose, rather facetiously, I was going to ask Mr. Morley if we could finish in ten minutes. 
MR. HOOPER:
He indicated an hour yesterday, so he may have compressed himself overnight, but I doubt if he's done it to that extent. 
MR. MORLEY:
There is no way it will be ten minutes.  I'm sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then this might be an appropriate time to take a short break.  
(Court recessed from 1024H to 1052H)
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honour's leave. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've been asked questions for an hour on Thursday, all day yesterday, and for an hour-and-a-half this morning by my learned friend defending.  And if I may, I will go through some of what you said, seek some clarification and, broadly speaking, in the order in which you were questioned between Thursday, yesterday and today.  Do you understand?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor, I can understand you.  
Q.	The first area is your brother.  On Thursday and then again a little today, you were asked about what you have spoken to your brother about.  Do you remember being asked those questions?  
A.	I remember that such questions were put to me.  
Q.	In terms of the events which happened to you, did you discuss those with your brother?  
A.	I talked with my brother who is still alive about the problems we experienced during the genocide.  
Q.	As a result of talking to your brother, did you change any of what you recall happening?  
A.	I told him what I went through during the events, but I had nothing to change about what I knew of what events had taken place, especially as I had some information that he did not.  
Q.	If it were ever to be suggested that you have changed your recollection of events because you have spoken to your brother, what would you say about that?  
A.	My knowledge of the events has not changed much.  However, some of what the investigators wrote down did not, in my view, reflect the facts.  
Q.	We'll come to the investigators in a few moments.  To assist the Tribunal, as a result of talking with your brother, did you change any of your recollection of the events in 1994, as it were, to meet things that your brother was telling you?  
A.	I changed nothing.  I always repeated what I had said -- said in my statements.  
Q.	In your statement of 1998, did you sign that?  Can you remember?  
A.	Yes, I signed the statement of 1998, after re-reading and correcting it.  
Q.	When you signed the statement, was its contents, broadly speaking, true?  
A.	When I signed this statement, I asked the investigator why all I had said was not reflected in the statement.  The investigator said that he had only taken down the essential points and that I would have the opportunity to provide further detail in court.  
Q.	In terms of the essential details which had been recorded by the investigator and then read by yourself and corrected and then signed by you, was the content of that statement basically true?  
A.	The contents of the statement were correct.  However, some details were not reflected in the statement, and I thought that I would have the opportunity to explain this.  
Q.	Turning now to the investigator's note about which you have heard, which was created in your absence, in 2004, prior to yesterday, had you ever seen that document before?  
A.	It is here in Court that I saw the document for the first time.  I didn't know it before.  
Q.	Having considered its contents, is that document accurate or inaccurate?  
A.	I observed that in the document that was shown to me yesterday, some facts were not -- or some events were not correct.  I even corrected this document in some respects, but it's Defence counsel who has the document in question.  
Q.	One feature of the 2004 document was a note made in your absence, unseen by you until yesterday, that it may have been that you had remained *********** in Gikomero secteur during the months of April, May and June of 1994.  Is that note an accurate note?  
A.	This information is not correct.  No *********** in Gikomero went to work.  All ******** were closed.  
Q.	It may be that the reason for the extensive questioning, both yesterday and again this morning, on whether you remained ********** in Gikomero secteur during the months of April, May and June, is because on the part of those defending, they would wish the Tribunal to conclude that that is, in fact, where you were during those months.  Do you understand what I said?  
A.	I understand you perfectly.  
Q.	Please explain to Their Honours who sit before you, what do you think would have happened to you had you remained -- or had you gone to Gikomero secteur during the months of April, May and June in order to ********.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just make it plain, it's not suggested that he was there ***********, but that the reference in his statement might reflect the position that he was there and got caught there and was stuck in Gikomero.  
MR. MORLEY:
Does my learned friend then take the point that it is plain that the note suggesting he was ************* in Gikomero cannot be right?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, I don't accept that this Defendant hasn't said those words to an investigator on a previous occasion.  I think there's a presumption he has said those things to an investigator on a previous occasion.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Dealing with that, Mr. Witness, please explain to Their Honours, what do you think would have happened to you had you been **************** in Gikomero secteur during the months of April, May and June?  
A.	I never ********* in that secteur, which was far from my home.  And during the massacres, I was one of the people who was being sought.  So I had to hide.  I couldn't go far from my home.  What is more, I didn't go out.  I practically didn't go out.  I would have been killed with other members of my family who were killed if I had gone out.  
Q.	Dealing also with the investigator's note, my learned friend yesterday invited you at one stage to tell the Tribunal what you had been told by the wife of a man called Rutayisire.  Do you remember his asking about that?  
A.	Yes.  He put that question to me.  
Q.	And do you remember he didn't follow it up?  
A.	He asked me that, and I don't know why he reacted like that.  
Q.	Well, can you please tell us, as he has asked you, what is it that you learned from the wife of the man called Rutayisire about the events of the genocide between April and June of 1994?  
A.	At the end of the war, ********************************************************, and she told me of the route that she took in order to reach Gitarama where we found refuge.  She saw that she had met people who were coming from Gikomero and that they were fighting -- they were fleeing from the Inkotanyi, and she said she escaped.  She turned around to come back to our location, and that's how she survived.  
Q.	Did she say anything about André Rwamakuba?  
A.	I asked her whether she had managed not to make herself seen where she had lived.  She said that she saw the authorities coming to that place.  And when I spoke to her about Rwamakuba, she said that probably Rwamakuba came by there, but she didn't know him very well.  She went on to add that many figures of authorities were coming to the camp where she was.  She also told me that the former Gikomero bourgmestre was also there and that that bourgmestre would meet the authorities when they came to visit the camp.  Furthermore, she told me that the bourgmestre took a vehicle to go to Gitarama.  In her understanding, she had -- he had gone to ask for food stuff and to ask for assistance for the survivors and the refugees.  
Q.	And just to conclude this small chapter, that lady, was she Hutu or Tutsi?  
A.	She was Tutsi. 
     (Pages 12 to 18 by Wendy Molnar)














1115H
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Yesterday, there came a moment when my learned friend suggested that André Rwamakuba was not Hutu, but Muhundi.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Indeed, that's what Defence counsel said, but I didn't agree with him because I said I knew that André Rwamakuba was Hutu. 
Q.	Now, can you help us with André Rwamakuba's parents.  What were they; were they Hutu, or Twa, or Tutsi, or what? 
A.	According to the information that I had, these people were considered to be Hutu. 
Q.	Did you learn of anything which happened at André Rwamakuba's house -- I'm sorry, 
	André Rwamakuba's parents's house during the genocide which might help the Tribunal to establish -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I really reflect that this is a matter which could have been gone into in-chief, and this is re-examination.
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friend has called into question the ethnic origin of Rwamakuba.  On the face of it, it will be a Defence submission that he is not Hutu, that he is a different ethnic origin and, therefore, he had no role to play or interest in the terrify events of the genocide.  It is relevant for the Tribunal to know from this witness not simply what it is that Rwamakuba, from the witness's recollection, may have said and done, but it is relevant what his family, his origin, was also engaged in.  That will help the Tribunal to resolve the issue of whether or not Mr. Rwamakuba is, in fact, a Hutu.  
MR. HOOPER: 
First of all, that was all rather leading.  The Defence's position is André Rwamakuba's familial line on his father's side is Muhundi.  They've lived in this area for four or five generations, many generations.  There is no specific point actually being drawn along the lines that's being indicated by the Prosecution.  And, in any event, in answer to the question, this witness said that he didn't know.  
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friend's attention is invited to paragraph 19 of the will-say statement, which I think he has in mind in any event, which was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, I will allow the question that you ask, but I think you should pay attention to the point that you should not expand into new areas which you ought to have done in examination-in-chief.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The area that I'm about to investigate is not one in my lesser judgment than Your Honours that I felt was relevant to examination-in-chief because it concerns the activities of Rwamakuba's father during the genocide.  However, as my learned friend has called into question the ethnic origin of Rwamakuba, it is relevant to the Tribunal at this point what his family engaged in, in the local area.  That will assist the Tribunal to resolve what will become the Defence submission, as we've just been told, that Rwamakuba was Muhundi through his father.  Respectfully submitted, I can put before the Tribunal evidence which suggests that his father cannot have been Muhundi, as a consequence of what the Tribunal is about to hear.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I'd just asked Mr. Morley to reflect carefully on what he's about to do and whether he can honestly support what he is doing on that basis.  And, secondly, to also reflect on the Prosecution's view at this stage of the reliability of the witness.  And, thirdly, to reflect that what he is about to hope to introduce is not relevant to the issue that he says it goes to, and it is highly contentious, and I can assure him, will lead to a significant new path of investigation and questioning, as I know he probably is aware.  So I'd ask him to reflect on his position to the best assistance of the Chamber.  

It's also, may I say -- I'm reminded by Mr. O'Shea, generally accepted that not just Hutus participated in the genocide; there are some notable Tutsis who participated in it.  In short, the very slender point that Mr. Morley himself know he's seeking to hang this on, well, it hangs by a very tender -- slender thread indeed.  I'd ask him to reflect on it with care.  
MR. MORLEY: 
When a senior member of my bar makes that observation, I do reflect.  I make the observation.  The evidence is relevant but it is not pivotal.  Moreover, insofar as my learned friend invites me to reflect on the credibility of the witness, I do so and the evidence which may be led is credible.  The material which will take about four or five sentences to put before the Court, has become helpful to the Tribunal because it needs what will be a Defence submission, which goes to the heart of Rwamakuba's disposition; namely, the Defence will presumably submit that he cannot have been involved in the genocide because he was not ethnically interested in it, because he wasn't of the relevant ethnic origin.  This small piece of information may set that in context, but I am alive to the fact that it is not pivotal; it simply answers the question whether he was Hutu.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The observation I would make at this stage is that if the questions are allowed, it is new, and I would have to allow the Defence to examine the witness on this issue.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, that may be -- that may be absolutely correct.  And I stress again, the only reason the matter arises is because of the Muhundi point under cross-examination.  If I have Your Honour's leave, I will ask the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We grant leave to ask the questions.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you told anything about what André Rwamakuba's father did during the genocide? 
A.	Thank you.  I'm happy that such a question is being put to me regarding Rwamakuba's father.  During the genocide, he participated in the genocide, particularly with regard to the death of his son-in-law.  He had him killed, and it's the people whose names appeared on the list I drew up who killed him.  And that person was killed because he was a Tutsi.  Rwamakuba's father, after having done that, he learnt that the Inkotanyi were about to take the location where he was and he committed suicide by swallowing some chemical product.  Let me stop here.  
Q.	Now, if you could have -- I think its Prosecution Exhibit P. 32, which is under seal, it's the list of 11 names, I would like you, please to add a 12th name, if you can, and that is the name of the person who told you the unhappy events surrounding Rwamakuba's brother in-law.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Can I see what you've got?  Yes, can I see it.  Thank you.  

If I might just return to the document, can you bring it back to the witness?  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	You've written down a name at number 12.  Who -- who was -- who is that person? 
A.	This is the father of André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Yes, I thought so.  What I'm asking for -- in that case, can you just put beside that name, in brackets, the word "père", father, in French?  Do you have the name of the brother-in-law, the Tutsi, who died; and if you do, can you write that down?  And can you put beside --
A.	I'm done. 
Q.	-- that name -- forgive my French, just a moment -- the French, the word beau-frère - beau-frère.  Now -- now, if I can come to the question I originally asked you, what is the name of the person who told you the story of what happened to the brother-in-law? 
A.	I can also write the name of that person on this document without mentioning it out loud. 
Q.	Yes, I'm sorry.  You are entirely right, my question was clumsy.  Can you write down the name of the person who told you the story? 
A.	I have written the name of someone, but everyone who lived in that place told me about this. 
Q.	All right.  Well, can you put in brackets beside that third name, in French, the word "histoire", story.  And perhaps if I might see the document.  
MR. MORLEY: 
My learned friends and then Their Honours.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Now, how is it that the brother-in-law came to be killed? 
A.	He was killed because he was a Tutsi.  He had gone to hide in a banana groove not far from his house after having learnt that the family of his father-in-law was plotting against him.  One Sendekezi, whose name appears on the list, was made to come.  He was an Interahamwe leader.  He came with other Interahamwe, and they discovered the person in question in the banana groove and killed him on the spot.  But it was Rwamakuba's father who had sent them. 
Q.	And how did Rwamakuba's father know where his son-in-law was hiding? 
A.	Since their houses were close to one another, Rwamakuba's sister went to her father's house.  She was asked where her husband was and she said that her husband was still in the house, and when she understood what was afoot, she went to go and check if her husband was still at the house.  She also had a problem regarding the lives of her children.  The husband came to learn about what had happened, so he went to hide, and the Interahamwe found him in his hiding place. 
Q.	And what was the problem which Rwamakuba's sister had with her children? 
A.	Rwamakuba's sister was fearing for the lives of the child -- of the children that she had had with this Tutsi man because those children could be killed since children inherited the ethnicity of their father.  So she went to -- she took the children to their grandparents.  She asked her father to protect them and not kill them, and that is how the children were spared, they were not killed. 
Q.	How is it that the Interahamwe found Rwamakuba's brother-in-law? 
A.	They were very many in number, the Interahamwe, I mean.  And he was hiding among the people; he didn't have anywhere else to hide. 
Q.	I'm sorry my question was clumsy.  How did the Interahamwe know where to find the brother-in-law? 
A.	I have just told you that he didn't have much choice.  There were many houses in the neighbourhood; there were no bushes.  It's Rwamakuba's father who told them where his son-in-law was hiding. 
Q.	I will move on now to another matter.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Just before we move on, when my friend made his submission to the Chamber to be permitted to ask that question, the Chamber didn't know the question or where it was going to lead.  How is what we've just heard probative of whether or not André Rwamakuba is or is not descended from a line of people who are called Muhundi on his father's side?  How is it probative in the least way of that fact?  
MR. MORLEY: 
It is capable of being probative.  Whether it is, is a matter for the Tribunal.  What weight to attach to it is a matter for the Tribunal.  I have already indicated it's not pivotal in terms of the guilt or innocence of André Rwamakuba, but it assists on the question of Muhundi origins.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, the -- I think this being a -- another harsh policy with regard to exclusion of evidence, partly because we are not in a jury trial and this evidence will be considered by a judicial panel.  
MR. HOOPER: 
But it needs to have some probative value.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but as you have rightly said, at the time the question was asked we did not know where it was leading to.  It's there and we will deal with it in the way in which it deserves.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  But -- thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Despite that fact, I will, as I had indicated, give you an opportunity, if you wish, to just ask some questions on the subject if you think it is necessary to do so.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Very well.  Thank you, Mr. President, I will do so.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, it was suggested yesterday to you that you had a good knowledge of the history of the genocide, that you appear to be well read, and you indicated that you had made yourself well-informed about the events of April to June, July of 1994.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I'm aware of some events which took place before I fled from where I lived, but events which took place after my flight, I was informed of. 
Q.	Part of the history of events which my learned friend was inviting you to consider yesterday, included reference to dysentery, cholera, famine and 80,000 refugees in the local commune.  Do you remember that area of questioning? 
A.	Yes, I remember that he asked me questions on those issues, but when he spoke of 80,000 refugees, he was referring to refugees who had come from the north of the country who had come to our area. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, during the events of April to July of 1994, at one point my learned friend described how many Tutsi had died during those events.  It was a little earlier today; do you remember? 
A.	Yes.  During that period of time, many Tutsis were killed, but some managed to survive and were able to flee to other areas which had not been reached by the fighting. 
Q.	Of the many Tutsi who died, did they die largely because of cholera or dysentery or famine? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Not suggested.  
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm grateful for that.  There is no need to answer that question.  Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Of the many Tutsi who died, did they die largely at the hands of the refugees who'd come from the north? 
A.	No, most of the Tutsis who were killed in our area were killed by their Hutu neighbours.  Later, the refugees coming from the north of the country reached our area because they were fighting -- they were fleeing, I beg your pardon, they were fleeing from the Inkotanyi and they came to our area to help the Hutus who were killing their neighbours. 
Q.	Now, as you understood the events of April to July of 1994, did you understand the killings of the Tutsi to be an uncontrolled event arising out of upset on the part of Hutu that they were suffering famine, dysentery, cholera and displacement or was there something else behind the killings of the Tutsi, as you understood it? 
A.	No, no epidemic killed anyone.  The Hutus killed people because they had leaders who had given them instructions.  Most of the instructions would be on Radio Rwanda or Radio RTLM.  And the killings could have been stopped since there was a national army which was everywhere.  The authorities could have put an end to the killings, and they were aware, but instead of telling the people to put an end to these killings, they encouraged them to hunt down the Tutsis, find them wherever they were hiding and kill them. 
Q.	Can I turn now to the radio.  You were asked questions about some speeches, which the Prosecution have managed to get their hands on, broadcast in April of 1994.  Do you remember? 
A.	Yes, I remember that.  I remember that he asked me many questions on that. 
Q.	Just bear with me for a moment, I'm looking for something.  At one point you indicated, in answer to questions from my learned friend, who, if you remember, was reading you soothing words of peace and prosperity being uttered by the speech makers.  You indicated that some things were said indirectly.  What I would like your help with is the nature of indirectness of speech as you listened to what's being said on the radio.  Now, do you understand what I'm asking about? 
A.	Yes, I have understood your question, and I think that I have explained this to the other counsel, by the way. 
Q.	Well, if you will forgive me, can you help us in a little bit more detail by what you mean by indirectness where it is the case that what is being said at face value is not necessarily -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
Please, can you refer us to that part of his evidence where he refers to this and please do not lead the witness in any way.  
MR. MORLEY: 
It's the part where there were questions being asked about the MDR congress, the creation of MDR-Power in July 1993.  And I have a note that the witness answered, "At Kabusunzu, things were said indirectly."  
MR. HOOPER: 
Have you got the page, the transcript reference number?  
MR. MORLEY: 
No, I'm working from my notes.  If my learned friend will give me a moment we'll see if we can find it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I recall the witness saying that --
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but I take your point about the leading question.  
And, Mr. Morley, you should not lead on this issue. 
MR. MORLEY: 
I'm sorry, if I appear to be leading.  I was leading the witness to the word so that he might then explain what it meant.  I'm sorry if that was inappropriate.  As it were, the damage is done, but the reality is that what is of assistance to the Tribunal at this stage, the words Your Honour recalls having been uttered, is what is meant by it.  And that is what I don't seek to lead upon.  I seek to simply ask the witness, "What do you mean by things were said indirectly?"  With Your Honour's leave, I will ask that of the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Leave granted.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, can you assist us, what does that mean when you say, "Things were said indirectly?" 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President.  Actually, the word -- words that were used in official speeches or speeches I would call official, did not reveal the actual plans.  They spoke indirectly.  They said that if the Inkotanyis were to continue the fighting, we would defend the country.  But what they were actually saying was that they were going to exterminate all the accomplices of the Inkotanyi, that is, the Tutsis.  At other times they said they must get rid of the enemy so that the international community would take it that it was -- it concerned taking -- getting rid of the invaders once and for all, but actually what they meant was getting rid of the Tutsis, to exterminate the Tutsis.  So actually they did not explain their real plan so that it would not be known that genocide was being planned, whereas they wanted to tell the people to act differently. 
Q.	When -- when my learned friend read to you this morning sections of the speech of Kambanda on the 9th of April 1994, in which Kambanda speaks of wanting negotiations and a resolution to the armed conflict, racial harmony, the absence of ethnic division, did you as -- in hearing what my learned friend was putting to you, although you say you didn't hear that speech, did you understand Kambanda to be seeking racial harmony, the absence of ethnic division and so on?  I ask the question -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
With respect, I merely ask my friend to reflect how, even in the way he has laid that question, this witness can't possibly answer that question.  His evidence is he didn't hear the speech.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, he has now, because my learned friend has put sections of it to him, and the witness has answered, as Your Honour recalls, that the speech has to be understood in the context of Kambanda's plea before this Tribunal to the crime of genocide.  So I'm simply asking for the witness's comment now that he has heard sections of the speech read to him, does he accept what was being said by Kambanda at face value, and if not, why not?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness can answer that question.  
THE WITNESS: 
Regarding the contents of this speech, I think that he wanted the international community to hear this beautiful speech, but that was not his real intention.  I am telling you that when he was talking on the radio, he was inciting or encouraging civilian youths to go to the war front, whereas they were not soldiers.  So, what I mean is that what he was saying to the international community was contrary to what he told the people within the country 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you.  You were asked some questions a little earlier on about hearing artillery and mortar fire.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I heard the sound of bombs and mortars -- and shelling. 
Q.	Maybe a small point but for clarity, is it your understanding that of the many Tutsis who died between April and July of 1994, they were killed by indiscriminate artillery or mortar fire? 
A.	Yes.  When I heard the sound of bombing and shelling, this was in the places where there was fighting.  As to the Tutsis who were killed here and there, they were killed by civilians.  They were killed neither by the bombing nor by the shelling. 
Q.	Now, if I may, I will ask the question which my learned friend sought to ask towards the end of his cross-examination.  Maybe you cannot help us, but maybe context is important.  We know that Hutu died during the period April to July of 1994, and we know that Tutsi died during that period.  Can you help the Tribunal, within your commune, and if you can't please say so, with the approximate number of Tutsi who died and the approximate number of Hutu who died? 
A.	I think government published figures.  As I have said before, I was a representative of genocide survivors.  I think we found that in Gikomero over 10,000 Tutsis were killed in Gikomero commune.  This includes people who came from outside the commune and who had sought refuge there.  I cannot, therefore, give an estimate of the number of Hutus who were killed in our commune because no census was conducted to this end.  I know that some of them were killed in the fighting when they were supporting soldiers on the warfront.  I cannot tell the exact figure of the number of Hutus who were killed because no census was ever conducted. 
Q.	Is it your understanding -- and if you don't know please say so -- that the number of Hutu dead may have been as many as the Tutsi dead, may have been more than the Tutsi dead, or may have been less than the Tutsi dead?  Now, if you don't know, please then say so.  
A.	If I look at the way Tutsis were killed en mass, because there was an extermination plan.  The Hutus -- the number of Tutsis which -- that were killed is higher than the number of Hutus who were killed. 
Q.	And do you have any idea, and, again, if you have no idea, please say so, of the -- of the relative difference, perhaps expressed as a percentage?  If one imagines one takes -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
With respect, he said that he doesn't know the number of Hutus who were killed.  

MR. MORLEY: 
The reason I ask is because it may well be that the thrust of the Defence's submissions would be that there was a general war, a lot of people got killed, and it was pretty much similar for both sides.  And if this witness can assist us --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, the issue is not whether the question is relevant, but whether the witness could answer in light of his previous answer.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Very well, Your Honour, I won't pursue it.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Finally, you may remember yesterday that there may have been a small amount of excitement in the court about the MDR conference in July of 1993, and you were asked questions about the MDR split.  Do you remember? 
A.	Yes, I remember that questions were put to me about that. 
Q.	You will remember that although you were not given the documents to look at, you were asked questions about a congress which had produced some high-minded thinking of the MDR on the 23rd and 24th of July of 1993.  Do you remember? 
A.	He put questions to me regarding a meeting which took place at -- on a given date, and I did not agree with him.  I know of a congress that occurred on the 26th of July 1993, and this congress is in connection with my testimony -- is related to my testimony.  He was referring to another congress that was not made -- brought to my knowledge. 
Q.	Yes.  So that it's clear, the paperwork, which you were not shown, which was read in sections to you, if that paperwork referred to a meeting of the MDR on the 23rd and 24th of July, is that the meeting at which the split was proclaimed? 
A.	As I explained to Defence counsel yesterday, the MDR organised a meeting.  During that meeting, it was not possible to get -- come to an agreement.  I can't explain the details.  That is why afterwards, some members of the party, who felt that their ideology was different, called a second meeting.  So, this is the meeting that was called on the 26th of July, and which was referred to as the MDR-Power congress.  But concerning the first meeting, this was taken when the MDR had not yet been split. 
Q.	One of the resolutions which was read to you by my learned friend in respect of the first meeting, not the later split meeting, was to suggest that the first meeting was in favour of signing the Arusha Accords.  Do you remember my learned friend reading to you that resolution in respect of the first meeting? 
A.	I remember that the resolution was read to me, yes. 
Q.	And help Their Honours with what is it that was part of your understanding as to why the split occurred within the MDR. 
A.	As a person who monitored the situation closely, that is the situation that obtained in the country at the time, I know that the prime minister of the transitional -- broad-based transitional government had to be appointed, and this prime minister had to come from the MDR party.  It so happened that they had to agree on a person who would be appointed, and whose name would be included in the Arusha Peace Agreements.  And the name that was chosen was Faustin Twagiramungu.  However, some MDR members were against this choice, and at the end of the meeting, even if a resolution were taken, some members did not agree -- had not agreed.  However, his name was presented as the person who would follow the negotiations for both parties in Arusha.  Those who disagreed called another meeting on the 26th to choose another candidate, that is someone other than Twagiramungu.  So it is the MDR-Power wing which suggested the name of Jean Kambanda.  This was the bone of contention between the members -- the various members of the MDR party.  You know that the MDR was generally -- normally an opposition party, and it was fighting the CDR and the MDR, along with the other opposition parties -- together with the other opposition parties.  This means that this party worked closely with the PSD and the PR -- PL.  And there were Tutsis in this party.  That is why the Twagiramungu wing of the MDR was collaborating with the Inkotanyi.  That is how the power wing of the MDR was born.  And it was called MDR Hutu Power, and it advocated fighting the Inkotanyi.  That is what I can say as someone who kept an eye on events in the country. 
Q.	And, finally, was MDR Hutu Power, when the split occurred led by Kambanda, in favour of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Those who supported Kambanda did not agree with some of the clauses of the Arusha Peace Agreement, especially power sharing, and they were against candidacy of Mr. Twagiramungu as prime minister of the broad-based transitional government. 
Q.	They were against power sharing with who? 
A.	As it was said at the time, some positions were to go to the MRND party, and others to the PSD, PL, PDC and MDR parties.  Thus, both in government and in parliament, these people were reluctant to leave many positions to the Tutsis, if one -- which would have happened if the clauses of the agreement had been followed. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you, Mr. Witness, that concludes my re-examination which I note was an hour and 16 minutes.  My apologies.  I'm in Your Honour's hands.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You would like me to accept your apologies?  
MR. MORLEY: 
Always, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's all right, and I don't think the re-examination was excessive anyway.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I just ask questions arising out of that particular area?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
FURTHER CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	The person who told you about -- or you say told you about the death of Michel Ngirumpatse, the brother-in-law of André Rwamakuba, is that person living in Sha -- or, rather, in Nduba? 
A.	I wrote down the name of this person on a piece of paper to maintain the confidentiality of this information. 
Q.	That's why I'm not asking you about the name, I'm just asking you where does that person live.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Mr. President -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Kinyarwanda interpreter is complaining that he didn't finish what the witness said because Defence counsel interrupted him.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  Would you like to continue or can you continue from where I interrupted and I'll repose my question?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda interpreter says that the witness should be asked to repeat his answer because they both spoke at the same time and the Kinyarwanda interpreter heard nothing of all that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Witness, do you recall what your last answer was?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  I was saying that if I were to answer the question regarding this name, my identity might be revealed.  I said also that everyone took part in the burial ceremony for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Everything was said at this ceremony.  Everyone is aware of this event.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me ask my question again.  The name of the person who told you, I'm not asking you to name the name, where does that person live?  Is -- does that person live in Nduba? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, to deal with the specific concern raised by the witness, could you get him to write the location on the paper?  

BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, can you do that, can you write it down so that it's secret from everyone but the people immediately in this Court? 
A.	I thought a while ago -- I think this is common knowledge, everybody knows this.  This person lives in Nduba.  I do not think that this is a problem.  It is in ************** cellule where Rwamakuba's father also lived.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
**************.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Thank you.  When André Rwamakuba's father died, he was a man of about 84.  Do you agree? 
A.	I do know how old he was, but I thought that he was still in good health. 
Q.	But does 84 sound about right to you? 
A.	From the way he looked, I wouldn't have said that he was that old.  He could still go to the farm and perform other activities that require some physical strength.  I wouldn't say that he was that old. 
Q.	And I suggest that, in fact, a thoroughly descent man who lived in good relations with his Tutsi neighbours, to the extent of giving his daughter in marriage as a wife to a Tutsi, Michel Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Before the genocide, Rwandans lived together in peace.  He was not the only one to have done so, you know.  Nobody would have thought that everyone would attack their neighbours; nobody would have thought that ever. 
Q.	Now, you know the family and you told of how you'd often gone to the house.  Since these events have you spoken to Pascasie Mukarwego, the widow of Pascal Ntambara? 
A.	As I told you, I went there twice, but it was not during the period of unrest.  This was an old lady.  I used to say hello to her but we never chatted about important matters. 
Q.	My question was, have you spoken to her since the events, since the death of her husband? 
A.	After her husband died, I used to see her when I went past -- or near their house.  But I never spoke with her about that. 
Q.	Anasthase Nyiramakuba is the sister of André Rwamakuba, who was married to Michel Ngirumpatse.  Have you spoken to her about those events since the death of her husband, Michel? 
A.	I meet this person regularly.  I even visited with her even before the events.  Her husband was a personal friend.  I used to meet her.  I used to visit her, and I even used to meet the children. 
Q.	Since the death of Michel, have you spoken to her about these events? 
A.	Since I visited her and I was present at the burial of the late Michel, we spoke about many things, but obviously, there is a matter that we did not discuss for matters -- for reasons that concerned her. 
Q.	So you didn't discuss the circumstances of the death of Michel with his wife, the sister of Rwamakuba.  That's your evidence, is it? 
A.	No, that is not true.  That's not it.  I told you that we talked about it -- and that we talked about it, and that she even told me the names of people who killed him.  But there are some aspects that we did not discuss for reasons that are best known to her. 
Q.	She never told you that her father had played a part in Michel's death, did she? 
A.	Right.  That is one of things that we did not discuss, but she told me everything else.  That is what I wished to indicate a while ago. 
Q.	Athanase is the daughter of Michel and Anastasie, a mature woman now living in Kigali, but she is closed to her mother and a regular visitor to Nduba.  Have you ever discussed the death of her father, Michel, with that woman? 
A.	This daughter of Michel was not in Nduba when the genocide broke out, so we do not discuss these events.  What is more, I do not meet her very often because she lives in Kigali. 
Q.	Have you heard of someone called Nyumbakumi?  I will spell that:  N-Y-U-M-B-A-K-U-M-I, as I have it.  Do you know someone by that name? 
A.	In Rwanda there is an administrative unit referred to as Nyumba Kumi.  This is not a name, the name of a person.  Actually, in the entire country there are people who run homes that are referred to as Nyumba Kumi.  I think that's what it is. 
Q.	It wasn't someone that Anasthase told you had played a part in the killing of her husband? 
A.	They did not -- he did not tell me about Nyumba -- she did not tell me about Nyumba Kumi.  She instead talked about Interahamwe who came to kill her husband and she also told me about who was leading the killers.  Amongst the killers, some are in custody and have confessed to the crime. 
Q.	Did she tell you, in fact, that one of the leaders of those who came and found and killed Michel was Sendekezi, S-E-N-D-E-K-E-Z-I? 
A.	She is not the only one to told me that this was the man who was the ring leader.  Everyone told me about it. 
Q.	And after Michel was killed, much later, he was buried by the side of the house there in Nduba.  That's right, isn't it? 
A.	Each time a Tutsi was killed, he was not buried, as such, they were -- the bodies were strewn here and there.  Afterwards, there came a time when people were buried in a more dignified manner.  This was the case for the remains of this gentleman. 
Q.	And he is buried next -- right outside her house by the side of the house, isn't he, in a flower-tended grave there? 
A.	Yes, I know the place very well, that is it.  That is where he is buried. 
Q.	And he left, was it four children? 
A.	Yes, I think there are about four children.  I do not know the exact number of children. 
Q.	And they were protected to his last breath by Pascal, André Rwamakuba's father.  That's the truth of it, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, it is their mother who pleaded for them that the children should not be killed along with their father.  I do -- I have not spoken to Pascal to ask him to confirm this, but it is, I know, their mother who pleaded that the children not be killed. 
Q.	What you have said against André Rwamakuba's father is a slur and is untrue, and I suggest you know it, don't you? 
A.	I gave the information that the Prosecutor asked of me and I am sure of that information.  I have no interest in slandering this old man.  I know that this man, this old man, played a role -- had a hand in his son-in-law's death and, in fact, all the neighbours accuse him of the death of Ngirumpatse.  So I did not come here to this Court to slander anyone. 
Q.	And is that as true as the rest of the evidence you've given us, is it? 
A.	Yes.  All I have said is true. 
Q.	That old man's body -- 
A.	I think that you have a lot of information about that yourself. 
Q.	Yes, I may have.  Do you agree with this:  That old man's body was found hanging from a beam in his bedroom, hanging by a rope around his neck in his bedroom.  Is that right? 
A.	That is what I was told, I wasn't present. 
Q.	So where does the chemical portion that he took come into your story? 
A.	I told you that these -- this is what other people told me.  I did not witness the event.  I did not expect such a question.  All I know is that people told me that this man had killed himself. 
Q.	A moment ago, you were telling us that he had taken a chemical portion.  Now you are saying you were told that he was indeed hanging from a beam in his bedroom.  Well, which is it, sir, which truth do you want to tell us? 
A.	What I know is that everyone agrees that he killed himself; the rest is that people will recount it differently.  I know -- I understand that you know Nyumbakumi, and if you ask her she will tell you -- give you more detail about it. 
Q.	And when do you say he killed himself?  What was the approximate date as you understand it to be? 
A.	I do not know the date, Counsel, but what I know is that during -- it was during the months when the genocide was perpetrated.  This is information that came to me after the war.  That is all I know of the matter, but if you want more accurate information -- more precise information, you might contact family members.  And there are family members. 
Q.	Was it, in fact, after the RPF had taken over that area? 
A.	Since I started giving testimony, you've used the RPF term -- the term RPF, but we know that these are the Inkotanyi fighters.  When they overrun part of a country, some people would flee.  But the information in my possession indicates that he was -- that he killed himself at the approach of Inkotanyi fighters -- as the Inkotanyi fighters approached that area. 
Q.	I suggest in fact that poor man was harassed by both Interahamwe to give up Michel's children to them to kill, and also by the RPF when they arrived.  Does that fit in with the story you've heard? 
A.	No, that's not how it was.  That is not how it happened because the Inkotanyi were not yet in that area.  He had not yet seen the Inkotanyi.  He had never seen the Inkotanyi, and he had not yet seen them in the area. 
Q.	You don't know that, do you? 
A.	I told you that I knew the area.  Since yesterday, you have tried to put questions to me to suggest that I do not know the place well.  That is not the case.  I heard that he killed himself before the arrival of the Inkotanyi in the area. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I have no other questions, thank you.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Just one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You should put it through me.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes, simply, my learned friend has suggested to the witness that Mr. Rwamakuba senior decided to kill himself because he had been harassed by the Interahamwe, and subsequently, the RPF.  Through Your Honour, I'd invite -- 
MR. HOOPER: 
No, I didn't say he killed himself for those reasons.  I merely put it that he has been harassed by both sides.  I haven't indicated the circumstances of his death yet.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, the question I would like to ask the witness, arising out of the question of harassment was, what does the witness understand was the reason why Mr. Rwamakuba senior killed himself.  It's a matter for Your Honour whether he should be asked that.  And the answer, potentially, is relevant to the Muhundi question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I thought it was relevant for another reason, because I wasn't trying to go to ask questions.  

Mr. Witness, what was your understanding of the reason why Mr. Rwamakuba's father had take -- took his own life?  
THE WITNESS: 
From what I heard, Rwamakuba's father allegedly called the Interahamwe who were around, and the Interahamwe went and killed his son-in-law who was a Tutsi.  But it is true that Michel's wife had begged for her husband's life.  And afterwards, it was decided that only the children would be spared and the father was killed.  When it was known that the Inkotanyi were going to -- would soon arrive -- would soon arrive in the area and when people began to flee and the soldiers were withdrawing 
gradually, this is what I heard, when this began to happen, the wife of Michel began to threaten this old man and said that she was going to go and see the Inkotanyi and she would condemn or speak out against all those who had killed her husband, including her father-in-law (sic).  So when the father realised that this was happening, he decided to kill himself.  Otherwise, the Interahamwe had not harassed Rwamakuba's father.  They didn't attack him before that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hooper, anything arising?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, it wasn't the father-in-law, it was the father.  I heard it translation as the father in-law, it was the father.  The wife of Michel is the daughter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Indeed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you.  

Now, it's now twenty to one.  I think we should take the break now and address the issue of the exhibits on our resumption.  
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes, Your Honour.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We resume at ten past two.
MR. MORLEY:
May I advise whether the -- Your Honour had excused the witness and the Court is content that he has completed his testimony?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Subject to the exhibits that we are seeking to put in.  
MR. MORLEY: 
On the subject of the exhibits, that is the statement, which the witness has said is true; the investigator's notes, because the witness has said they are inaccurate; and the will-say statement, which the witness has not seen at all.  The Crown has no objection -- I'm sorry, the Prosecution has no objection to those exhibits being exhibited.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, in that case, we'll provide, during the adjournment, I hope, clean copies of those, and in due course they will become Defence exhibit --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we can do that right after the luncheon break.

MR. HOOPER:
Very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
To answer Mr. Morley's question, there would be no need for the witness to be present after lunch.  

Mr. Witness, I thank you for being here for giving testimony, and it's over now and you are excused from the Court.  Thank you, very much.  
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President for giving me the opportunity to give testimony before this Trial Chamber, and I am very grateful that a witness is allowed to explain events as he sees them.  We hope that justice will be rendered because we do need justice.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court recessed at 1244H) 
(Pages 19 to 35 by Gifty C. Harding)























(Court resumed at 1430H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  We can resume our proceedings this afternoon. I think the first order on the business is to formally admit into evidence the three Defence exhibits.  And, Mr. Registrar -- do you have the documents that we are putting in, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER: 
Well, I have my share, as it were.  And as much as I think Mr. Morley, he was hopeful of producing a clean, note d'enquêteur and a clean Morley will-say statement, but I think Mr. Morley has left us.  Perhaps we can address that a little later.  But I do have a copy of the statements in French and in English of the 11th of February '98, which has been copied and which bear no additional marks to the original. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Unfortunately, we don't presently have any clean copies without any marks on them.  We will try to make such available before the end of this session -- this afternoon session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we will defer this activity until later this afternoon. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, then, we had the documents that were -- and the other exhibits from the testimony of the investigator, Mr. --  sorry, Mr. Hooper, was there something else?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Would Your Honour like -- sorry, there is a lot of interference.  Would Your Honour like me to indicate what is still contentious before we move on, or to proceed in another way?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That would be all right, I think. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  If I go according to -- we received various lists in the course this process -- we have received various lists during the course of this process from the Prosecution.  I have also received from the registry a draft list of exhibits.  It might be helpful if I work from that list, if the Court is agreeable to that, because that has the IP numbers on it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, may I take this opportunity to ask if a copy would be available for the booth?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honours, I didn't make enough copies for the interpreters' booth, but I can make copies now if you want. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
At this juncture the interpreters may not need it because I'm simply going to refer to the numbers and describe the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  The first exhibit marked for identification to which we object, is Exhibit IP. 1C, which is a video clip and is given the K number KV0068, and the description, "Interim Government Documentary, Narrating Crimes of Abatabazi Government." 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you mentioned the contentious matters to the Prosecutor?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, I have.  I indicated which matters are in contention. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And after discussions with them, they remain in contention?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, Your Honour, there are not many.  

The second item is exhibit marked for identification IP. 22, an audio recording K number KT001092, "Visit of Pauline Niramasuhuko and André Rwamakuba to Ngarara, Gisenyi, as part of Pacification Campaign."  Those are, I believe, the only two audio tapes, as it were, that are in contention.  There is one more, but I will come back to that because it is not on the -- not on the exhibit list at the moment, as far as I know.

Then there are two documents which were flagged up last time we discussed this matter.  The first is Exhibit I P. 3A, which is on page 3 of the draft list of exhibits, and is described as "Document on Civil Self-Defence."  Then the next document --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well -- 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Has Your Honour found that?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but IP -- the same objection would apply to IP. 3B. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, yes, that would be correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It seems to be just a translation. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Translation, yes.  There were four media reports that we flagged up on the last occasion.  We have kicked three out of the equation.  And the only contentious one now is IP -- Exhibit IP. 6, "Amnesty International Report, Rwanda Mass Murder by Government Supporters and Troops in April and May 1994."

And then there is just one other matter which arises from the latest document we received from the Prosecution on the 16th of June, and I'm not entirely sure to what extent that was brought out on the last occasion but I think it wasn't, because I can't find it on the exhibit list.  But that is KT000890, and it is described as, "The Speech of President Sindikubwabo in Butare on the 19th of April 1994."

As far as I know, that is not on our draft exhibit list, but I may stand corrected.  And those are all of the objections.  And I would just like to draw one other matter to the Court's attention which I noticed but, which is not a matter of objection but just for the sake of tidiness; I notice on the latest exhibit list which we received from the Prosecution on the 16th, there is reference to KT001067, "Swearing-in Ceremony of the Interim Government."  And I just noticed that on our previous list it was referred to as an RTLM broadcast, and on this it is referring to Radio Rwanda tape.  I'll just indicate in either case we don't object, but just for the sack of tidiness, I draw that to whoever's attention.  So, those are all of the matters of contention, Your Honour.  

I think that Mr. Webster wishes to proceed on the following basis, that he will go through the exhibits which are non-contentious first, and then we deal with the legal arguments on the contentious issues afterward.  I do not object to that course, but we are, of course, in Your Honour's hands as to how we proceed.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  

Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you, Your Honour, and good afternoon.  When we left off some time last week, there were one or two issues that remained outstanding even though there was no opposition from the Defence, and it had to do with matters of translations for certain documents.  I believe the Court had not received a copy of a document that was identified as protocole d'entente, it was the one that was dated April 1993, and it appeared in a newspaper and the Defence was also going to go back to that one and see if they had any objection to it.  And after my conversation this morning with Mr. O'Shea, he has none, so I would like to move forward with that and place that in evidence.  I believe that we had reserved a number for it; if I am not mistaken it is 212, and it had not been entered into evidence the last time we added these issues.  So, if the registry can confirm that, we can simply move that document into evidence as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I see that it is on the list reserved for Prosecution Exhibit Number 20(E); is that right? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Number what, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Exhibit P. 12. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's noted as reserved for Prosecution Exhibit Number 20E.  Okay, would that be correct?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is correct. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence as P. 12. 
(Exhibit No. P. 12 admitted)	
MR. WEBSTER: 
The next matter of a similar nature had to do with the original Kinyarwanda text of a memo from      Jean Kambanda.  I believe it was the memo of the 27th of April on restoring security, and the witness had one document with one K number, but on the list that I had submitted, there was another K number.  And the Defence had raised some concern about that, but I'm assuming that it is in evidence and that there is no further problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
What number do you have?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It was number, Number 30 on the exhibit list and it was P. 22 when we discussed it during the witness's testimony.  I believe it is already in evidence, but just to confirm that, maybe the registry could help us. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have three P. 22 documents.  I suppose there is a French document "Directive to the Préfet." 

MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
English translation. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Right. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Kinyarwanda original. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour, we had --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, were  --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Those were the documents and there was a question about the Kinyarwanda original, because I referred to it with one K number, and the witness had the same document, same content, with another K number.  And the Defence wanted an opportunity to look into that, and I believe they have.  So I would simply like the record to reflect -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, is that okay?  
MR. O`SHEA:
Your Honour, there is no objection to that document.  And it is my recollection that it was, in fact, admitted as P. 22. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I think that is clarified. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
There was a similar issue of the correspondence between the K number in the document as regards   P. 24.  May I inquire of the registry if that document is in evidence?  If it is not, then I can provide the K number -- well, the document with the K number that is most appropriate, but I think it has also gone in, but it was an issue the last time, so I would like to clarify it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, we have marked as an exhibit already P. 24(A), "Implementation of Prime Minister's Directives," and P. 24B, the English translation of that document.  And both were formally the Prosecution Exhibit Number 31, so I think they are already in evidence, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
With respect to the memo on civil defence that Mr. O'Shea objects to, we are willing to abandon that document.  It is the document that we have referred to as (French spoken). 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which document?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That is Number 28 on our exhibit list, and we have given it ID number 3.  So we don't have to discuss that document in our discussions. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is IP. 3A and B?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  I believe the other matters are going to be contentious because the video clip that Mr. O'Shea  objects to is now on a new CD-ROM,  but if his objection obtains, and I have not removed that particular clip because it was not in contention -- that clip itself was not in contention the last time, so we will have to look at that again.  And then with the audio clips, as well, we were not aware that there was a specific objection to the Sindikubwabo speech.  So that CD-ROM, as well, remains as it is.  

What we can move forward with now, before the argument, are photographs of Butare hospital when the exhumations were conducted.  I served copies of those on the Defence.  I have another copy for the Court.  I understand that there is no objection to them, so that can go in.  I think the next number would be P. 29, if I'm not mistaken. 

The Defence has already received a copy, and I have copies for the Court and for CMS.  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, the next Prosecution exhibit number would be P. 33. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, we admit this as a bundle?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How many photographs?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
There are 24 photographs that are scanned on to six pages.  I can state for the record that the first photograph is identified as K0047084A, and it goes on A, B, C, D, E, F, for those six photographs.  The next set is identified as K0047085A, and it goes 85A to 85F.  And the next set are K0047086A, and it goes through to 86F.  And another six photographs, and then K0047087A and that goes on A through F; for 24 photographs.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We also have a collection of transcripts. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as P. 34. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
33, I think. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 33, sorry.
(Exhibit No. P. 33 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER: 
We have a set of transcripts which I should identify for the record.  These are transcriptions of the audio broadcast that are recorded on the CD-ROM, the relevant portions that the Prosecution would rely on.  And of those, the broadcast themselves were listed on a document that was circulated to the Defence, I have a copy for CMS.  I can read them into the record, or we can simply identify this listing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I have just one issue, just one question.  These include the transcripts of the two contentious matters?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, they do. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Shouldn't we get that out of the way, first?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
The contentious matters or the non-contentious?
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no.  We can't admit this as a bundle unless we deal with the issue of the parts of it that are contentious. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I agree.

The contentious issue was -- we will have to play it, Your Honour.  It is the audio portion of Radio Rwanda tape number 951.  It is identified as --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, the ID number, just for my notes?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me.  It is IP number 2-2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. 

MR. WEBSTER: 
May I --  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Sorry, I didn't hear that, what was it, IP?
MR. WEBSTER: 
IP. 2-2.  This is the radio broadcast in reference to Pauline Niramasuhuko.  If you give me one moment -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, if you can, I suppose for clarification, just identify the nature of your objection.  I'm not asking you to argue it now, but just identify the nature of your objection to this. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes, the nature of the objection, Your Honour, is relevance and estoppel.  May I just indicate, and to assist the Court, that it would facilitate time if I deal with objections collectively, because I think in a discussion of the law, it will go much faster if I deal with the objection to all of those items to which we object to, collectively. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All of the objections, they are roughly --  
MR. O'SHEA: 
They all intertwine quite closely, yes. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
On the one hand, if I may, it would be productive to take the argument, but the Court would be deprived of the opportunity to see what is being discussed, what the substance of the objection is, without seeing the video itself.  Normally, the witness would introduce the video, we lay the foundation for it.  I think the Court has to actually see, or to hear the broadcast and/or review the transcript before we can have argument on it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I ask, how long is this going to take?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
This portion of the audio may be around five minutes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, I'm talking about the whole exercise. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
These things usually take longer than we anticipate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but what is your estimate?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would think at least a half an hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, what is your estimate?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
What I can speak to is the legal argument.  For my part, I would need about 15 to 20 minutes on the legal argument in relation to all of the exhibits collectively to which we object.  So, I would leave half an hour for legal argument, and whatever time it takes to show you the two audio tapes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Just as an inquiry as to how much time this examination-in-chief for the next witness is going to take.
MR. WEBSTER: 
Excuse me. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think that if we go as expected, we may need two and a half hours, three hours maximum. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will continue. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
With the Court's permission, I will ask the case manager to play the clip in question.  It is in French.  There is no English translation, or no English transcription; the transcription itself is also in French, so we will have to depend on the interpreters. 
(Audio tape played)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
That is much too fast. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, didn't you indicate that there was a transcript of that?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We have a French transcription that I have asked to be taken up to the booth, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your Honours, could we suggest that we hear the tape at least once through.  It is extremely fast, but it might be of some help if we were to approach it that way, if possible. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster is it possible to play the tape again? 
(Audio tape played) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I think the interpreters would need to play the tape one more time in order to interpret it. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
(Audio tape played) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Still local news in connection with the war: Rwandan government is continuing its cause around the country.  Yesterday it was the turn of Gisenyi, where Minister Pauline Niramasuhuko met with her colleague, Rwamakuba.  This is a report of this day with our colleague Yacinthe Bicamumpaka.  The awareness raising campaign of the population on the return of peace and security which have been disturbed in the past days by the return to hostilities of the RPF, it is going on all though the country.  

In Gisenyi, these awareness raising campaign and the evolution of the call made by the government, the interim government, to the whole -- to all Rwandan people without distinction, took place in Ngororero sous-préfecture where some people -- some members of government went to discuss with préfetural and sub-préfectural authorities, strategies to adopt in order to put an end to the unrest which has shaken the country.  And this unrest is ethnic in nature and is worsened by the continuing attacks by the RPF.

During the meeting chaired by the sous-préfet of Ngororero (phonetic) sous-préfecture which was attended by Niramasuhuko, Pauline and Dr. Rwamakuba, André, in addition to other senior administrative officials and other political authorities of national -- at the national and préfetural level, Mr. Kalimanzira Callixte, director of cabinet in the ministry of the interior and 
Mr. Shyingiro Mbonyimutwa, who was the delegate of the political parties participated in government.  The cornerstone of this meeting was the security -- was security and reconciliation between inhabitants of the sous préfecture in particular, but also the security of Gisenyi préfecture in general.

It is good to note that safety -- security has returned to Gisenyi since the instructions issued on security to all préfectural authority.  These government directives eased the job of authorities in concrete action undertaken to restore order.  The speakers were all in agreement that the end -- an end must be put to the hunt for suspects who have worked with the RPF, or who have joined forces with the RPF.  However, this action must be bilateral, otherwise, RPF attacks, which are decimating the population of Rwanda, most of whom -- or the people of Rwanda, most of whom are Hutus, might further inflame the situation because this genocide will force the population to take revenge for their victims, their compatriots who are victims of massacres which the RPF is continually perpetrating.  "The Rwandans do not like war" said Minister Rwamakuba.  "The RPF must be convinced of that and favour negotiations instead of being stubborn in seeking to seize power by all means."

Indeed, the RPF has never been sincere in it enthusiastic statements, and in the deceptive ceasefire it has adopted.  "Rwandans should not allow themselves to be tricked," said some of the participants, who, instead, emphasised the need for civil defence.  

Amongst recommendations made to government, we shall cite the recruitment of able-bodied young people to buttress our army, the planning of contributions to support the army, and assistance to civilians who are requesting to be provide with -- who are requesting to join military service.  

End of text.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have heard that now.  What next, where do we go to from here?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Perhaps we should take this item by item then, Your Honour.  Mr. O'Shea had an objection to this particular portion.  We see it as a contemporaneous radio report, it is the same type of evidence that didn't raise an objection with the other clips, so perhaps he can clarify the nature of his objection, and then we can respond to it.  

But in principle, when we adjourned some time last week, the objection was that the clips needed to focus specifically on the portions of the larger take that dealt with André Rwamakuba.  So we went and redid the clips and limited it narrowly to the portion that specifically addressed André Rwamakuba.  I did not expect a substantive objection to this particular clip.  It is on this CD-ROM, but if Mr. O'Shea can clarify why it is objectionable, I can respond to that and the Court can rule and we can move onto the next one. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea?  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, as I have already indicated, it would be much more expeditious in terms of court time if I put the legal arguments collectively in relation to the contentious matters.  I would request that we play the other audio tape, and then I will deal with all of the exhibits together.  It will save a lot of time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think we can follow that procedure.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the next one was the audio tape -- there is only one other audio that Mr. Hooper objected to, which was the speech of Sindikubwabo, I believe, on the 19th of April, in Butare.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that is identified as?
MR. WEBSTER: 
It is identified as -- it is exhibit list number 38.  It is identified as KT000890, "Radio Rwanda Tape 0049."
We do have English transcriptions and French transcription for this particular broadcast.  Perhaps we could, depending on the Defence position, forego the playing of the audio tape since it is at least ten minutes long in Kinyarwanda, and the Court can be aware of its contents by relying on the transcript, since we do have the English transcription.   
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's in your bundle?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How is it identified?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It is identified under Tab number 38.  The actual text is approximately a page and a half long.  It will be clear on the record simply by identifying it.  So if the Defence is willing to accept the arrangement of simply referring to it as -- giving it an ID number, then we can dispense with playing the audio tape. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you gave us just a couple of minutes, we will look at it. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Mr. Webster, did you refer to page 8; is that what you were referring to?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, in the English it is page number 8 at the bottom, but it has a K number.  The K number is K0275075 and it runs on to K0275077.

The next matter -- may I proceed?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the next matter in contention was a video clip.  Mr. O'Shea made reference to what is on our exhibit list as number 53.  It is KV0068; it is IP. 1C.  This also has been transcribed to the very end of the bundle, it is the last section in the bundle.  The tab is identified as KV67/68.  And this refers to a video that the Court has already seen.  This is the video -- this is the video of Jean Kambanda speaking, when he was dressed in a military jacket and speaking to a crowd and raising a gun in the air at one point.  So it is something that the Court saw last week, but the transcripts have been provided now.  Last week the objection was that there was commentary of the journalist interspersed with        Mr. Kambanda's speech.  And what we have done is removed all of the journalistic commentary so that the video clip and this transcript only contain what Mr. Kambanda himself actually said.  

Since the Court has already seen it, and I believe it was translated - interpreted, when it was played with the witness on the stand, we shouldn't need to do that now.  And I think that`s as far as it goes in terms of the audio and video materials that raised the Defence objection.

The other matter is the Amnesty International report, which has been identified as IP -- I think it was -- one second, IP. 6.  The witness had already laid the foundation for that particular item when he testified last week.  And if my recollection is accurate, I think that is the sum of all of the contentious issues that the Defence had raised.  

There was one other item that we didn't discuss and that was the video recording of the exhumation at Butare University Hospital.  I understand that the Defence objects to that exhibit as well.  We can play that video, but essentially, it simply -- it repeats the images that are on the photos.  I would be content to argue it without playing it for the Court, but I remain at the Court's discretion.  Essentially, it is a videotape that runs on for around ten minutes, but the images are simply what we see in the photographs that have already been admitted into evidence.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, I would agree that it is not necessary to play that videotape because it goes on quite long, and that is part of the objection, in fact.  We can discuss it in arguments.  And if my learned friend has any difficulty with the way in which I describe it, he can interject or say in his response.  But it is -- we can describe to the Court what is there, because it is quite long.  It goes on for about 20 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, I think the time has come for you to present your argument. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Yes.  Thank you, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, yes, I will attempt, insofar as I can, to present these arguments collectively.  I hope  Your Honours have been provided with two authorities, and if not -- I think, yes.  The first authority is an excerpt from the judgement of the Appeals Chamber in the case of Prosecutor versus Musema.  And the second is a decision dealing with exclusion of evidence in the case of Prosecutor versus Kordic in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (sic).  And I trust Your Honours have both of those decisions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think so.  Yes, we have. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
Thank you.  Your Honour, let me say right at the outset that we accept entirely the distinction which Your Honours have already drawn between admissibility and weight.  We are, as a Defence team, in fact, in favour of the free admissibility of evidence.  We are fairly confident that the Prosecution does not hold a golden bullet.  And we agree, in principle, evidence can be freely evaluated.  And I note  Your Honour's comments this morning about there not being a jury here.  However, there are limits, in my respectful submission.  And there are two specific concerns that we have which underpin this legal submission.  The first concern is delay in this trial.  We are concerned that the Prosecution is bringing in issues which are not directly pertinent to the indictment, and risk substantially broadening the scope of the evidence in this trial.  It may be the thin edge of the wedge as to what type of evidence the Prosecution attempt to elicit through other witnesses in this case.  But, moreover, that it will lead to a situation where the Defence itself will have to counter issues which, in our submission, are not directly pertinent to this indictment and this case.  And we will have to deal with them if they are deemed to be relative and probative, but we submit that they are not.

The second problem is that of fairness.  And the procedural history in this case is such, in our submission, that in order to assure a fair trial it is important to place limits on the admissibility of certain pieces of evidence.  

If I may turn to the law, Your Honour, I provided Your Honours with an excerpt from the appeal judgement in Musema.  I refer Your Honours to paragraph 46, where Rule 89(C) is discussed.  And the Chamber --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. O'Shea, I'm sorry, I didn't get the paragraph. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
It is paragraph 46, Your Honour.  It is on page 21 of the document which I have given you.  I haven't given you the full judgement because it is quite a lot, you would appreciate, but this is essentially the part of the judgement where the Appeals Chamber discusses the general issue of the admissibility of documentary evidence.  Does Your Honour have that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. O'SHEA: 
So, if I could just read that paragraph:  "Rule 89(C) provides that the Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value" -- repetition of the Rule.  "This means that for evidence to be admissibility, each party must demonstrate its relevance and probative value."  

There are two things that one can draw from that statement, Your Honour.  The first is that the burden on establishing the relevance and probative value of a piece of evidence is on the party seeking to adduce that evidence.  And we say that the Prosecution, in relation to these items, which have been highlighted, has not discharged that burden.  The second thing that one can draw from that statement of the Appeals Chamber, in my submission, is that a Trial Chamber may not admit evidence which is not relevant and probative. So, in other words, while we fully accept that there is a clear distinction between admissibility and weight, in our submission, it must be established by the party adducing the evidence that there is some relevance, and some probative value.  

With regard to relevance, there has to be, in my submission, a clear connection between the evidence adduced and the crime in the indictment with which the Accused is charged.

There is then, in my submission, a separate requirement which is that of probative value.  Once it is established that there is a connection between the indictment and the said evidence, there must further be the ability to be able to say that this piece of evidence tends to prove the crime with which the Accused is charged.  That does not mean that the Trial Chamber has to go into an exact determination of probative value, but it does mean that there must be the capacity in that piece of evidence to go towards showing the guilt of the Accused on one of the counts in the indictment.

Now this indictment, if I may refer to it, has four counts.  
(Pages 36 to 50 by Donna M. Lewis)























1530H
MR. O'SHEA:
And following the procedural history of which Your Honour is aware, and I refer here to severance, each of the counts refers specifically to Andre Rwamakuba's responsibility in Gikomero commune and at Butare University Hospital.  

So, that is the frame of reference of this case.  All the paragraphs in the indictment refer back to those basic counts, and all the evidence in this trial must ultimately go to those counts.  

The consequence of this, Your Honour, is that insofar as evidence is being produced for the purpose of showing some government plan or grand scheme for genocide -- or whatever the case may be, that issue, in our submission, is not an issue in this trial.  

If I may turn to fairness and just simply remind Your Honours of certain specific points in the procedure of this case.  Your Honours may be aware of the general principle of law that no one may contradict their own deed.  And Rule 89(B) permits Your Honours to apply rules of evidence which most best favour the fair determination of the process.  

In the Yugoslav tribunal rules, it is an additional paragraph, 89(D), and I'd like to just -- although it's not our rule, I would like to draw it to Your Honours' attention, because in my submission, it does have a bearing on Rule 89(B) of our rules because it is a rule which, in my submission, is eminently sensible.  

89(D) states:  "The Chamber may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed for the need to ensure a fair trial."  

Now, in this case, in Your Honour's decision on severance, Your Honours summarised the position of the parties with regard to severance and cited the Prosecution's submission that they were going to deal with direct participation at two locations; that is to be found on paragraph 8, line 2, of the severance decision of Your Honours.  

Your Honours also noted that, and I quote:  "The Defence, it changed its position in the light of the Prosecution's declared intention to base its case only on specific acts allegedly admitted by 
André Rwamakuba in Gikomero and Butare." 

In our motion, which led to that decision, we made it very clear that it was our understanding that the Prosecution, in severing us in this trial, meant to focus a trial which would work solely, through evidence of events in those two locations -- and we said at paragraph 4 of our motion, "We cannot stress more strongly the significance of that understanding in determining our advice to the Accused, and his subsequent consent not to oppose severance." 

Therefore, Your Honours, in my respectful submission, the two -- the three audio tapes or the video clip -- and the video clip (sic), which is described as "Documentary narrating crimes of Atabazi government" and the two audio tapes could only be conceivable as evidence which is relevant and probative -- if those terms are properly to be understood as terms relating directly to the indictment -- they are only relative and probative in the sense that they perhaps go towards the issue of government plan, grand scheme of genocide and so on and so forth.  

It should be noted that we, the Defence, have not contested the issue of genocide.  That is clear in our statement of admissions.  It is not the Defence position that there were not killings; that there was not genocide; that there was not massacres.  And in my submission, this has to be looked at, and the issue of relevance has to be looked at in this context.  

If my learned friend is seeking to bring in the issue of a government plan, that is first, in our submission, not probative to these counts; and secondly, in our submission, applying Rule 89(B), there is a form of estoppel which applies.  Your Honour will note that the rule gives the Court a discretion; it uses the word "may," not "must".  

In our respectful submission, in order to ensure a fair trial, in order to ensure that the understandings and promises which have been made in order to lead us into this fast and furious trial are kept, and it is within Your Honours' prerogative to exercise the discretion not to admit evidence which is designed to bring in exactly what the Prosecution made it clear they would not -- the government plan.  So that is the -- the thrust of our -- our submission on these particular items.  

With regard to the Amnesty International report, the objection is similar but I would like to refine it.  There's another decision before Your Honours that of Prosecutor versus Kordic, decision on the prosecution application to admit the Tulica report and dossier into evidence.  That is a decision of the 29th of July 1999, Trial Chamber, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  

Your Honour, if I could refer Your Honours to, first of all, paragraph 29, which is on page 7 of that decision.  There is there stated to be an objection to an on-site report of an investigating judge in Sarajevo Cantonal Court.  And the objection of the defence is contained in paragraph 30.  "The Kordic defence objects to the on-site report, including photographic evidence, on the basis of the report constitutes expert testimony of persons who are not going to testify in this case and who are not available for cross-examination." 
The decision of the Trial Chamber is then contained in paragraph 32, with regard to that item of evidence, and it is stated, "The onsite report and accompanying material" -- and it tabs 19 and 41 of the dossier -- "are purely documentary evidence of fact about what happened as part of the judicial investigative process undertaken by the Sarajevo Cantonal Court and will be admitted pursuant to 
Rule 89(C), as evidence which the Trial Chamber deems to have probative value."  So in other words, the factual accounting.  

"Any assumptions or conclusions which are expressed in this material, such as highlighted by the Cerkez defence, will be disregarded by the Trial Chamber and will not form part of the record of evidence which it will consider in determining the innocence or guilt of the accused."  

I refer Your Honours to this because I wish to invite Your Honours to take a similar course with regard to the Amnesty International report which the Prosecution seeks to admit.  Virtually everything which is said in that report, from our point of view, is non contentious.  We do not, for example, dispute that there were people removed from the Butare University Hospital and killed.  It's not necessary for our case to -- to contest that particular fact.  

All of the rest of the Amnesty International report is of fairly general nature in relation to the Rwanda conflict.  What we take objection to is in the summary to the report, which is at the front of the report, on page 2, where it is said:  "Amnesty International is gravely concerned that the Rwandese Armed Forces and government appear to be responsible for inciting, encouraging, perpetrating or condoning mass killings, particularly of members of the Tutsi ethnic group." 

And then a little further down:  "Statements made by the government and other officials since October 1990, were evidently meant to incite the Hutu and to kill all the Tutsi."

Now, we object to these sentences in the report, first of all, on the grounds which I've already outlined in relation to the other items of evidence.  But, secondly, following the Kordic decision, this is essentially a comment or conclusion drawn by officials.  We don't know who they are of a non-governmental organisation called Amnesty International.  We don't know what care they took in their research methods; we don't know what resources they relied upon.  But these conclusions are drawn.  

And so, in that sense, the prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighs its probative value and it is opinion evidence.  It is a kind of expert conclusion on an issue which we say, is, first, not relevant, and second, should not be allowed to be aired because of the estoppel issue that I raised. 

And what I would invite Your Honours to do would be to admit the Amnesty International report, if the Prosecution still insists upon it, but to excise those prejudicial conclusions which are drawn.  

I remind Your Honours of Rule 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, which states that, in principle, witnesses should give evidence before this Tribunal.  This kind of conclusion -- expert conclusion on an issue which we say is not even relevant, is a matter which needs to be dealt with properly if it's going to be dealt with.  

We believe that the result of Your Honours' severance decision is that the Prosecution cannot expand the scope of this trial.  So just to -- to emphasise the point here, Your Honours, we say that there must be some probative value to each of these items of evidence.  Unless that probative value directs itself to André Rwamakuba's alleged crimes at Butare University Hospital and in Gikomero, it is submitted that the test has not been fulfilled.  And the burden of showing that is on the Prosecution.  Thus far that has not been discharged.  

In the alternative, if Your Honours are against me and believe that there is requisite probative value for the purpose of admission, in my submission, Your Honours, can apply, first of all, your discretion under 89(C), by virtue of the word "may"; and secondly, by virtue of 89(B), applying the general principle of law that no man may contradict his own deed, the deed here being the Prosecution promise not to expand the scope of the evidence in this trial to the grand plan.  

So, unless I may be of further assistance, those are the submissions on these exhibits. I don't know if I need to go specifically into the exhibits.  I think that I've done so sufficiently.  If I haven't, Your Honours can direct me, but it may be, through the response of my learned friend, I may be able to come back on some of the substance of the exhibits.  But, again, the burden of proof is on -- on the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If I can assist, I think that is enough.  But we will hear Mr. Webster now.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you, Your Honours.  

Let me begin a bit by agreeing with Mr. O'Shea that the Prosecutor did undertake to narrow the scope of this trial in our application to sever.  But in doing so, we didn't change our theory of the case with respect to the interim government.  It is still the theory of the Prosecution that the interim government organised genocide on a national scale.  What has changed is the evidence that we intend to bring before this Court in relation to André Rwamakuba.  It is not that we do not believe we have evidence to convict André Rwamakuba of genocide on a national scale, but as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, we have decided to restrict the case to events of -- in Gikomero and Butare.  But those events did not take place in a vacuum.  They took place in a context.  
Now, if we look at the witness list for this case, you will notice that all of the witnesses that will be called to testify before this Court are going to address events in Gikomero and Butare, which is what assured this Court when we made our application for severance. 

What we would like to do through these exhibits is place those events in context, and it's our submission that this Court cannot consider those events without looking at the context.  

I would venture to say that Mr. O'Shea's submission is a bit contradictory because if we look at the exhibit list itself, you will notice that the Defence did not seem to have a problem admitting 
Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diary in which she lists all the meetings of the interim government that she attended, where she made notations of André Rwamakuba's presence in those meetings.  That did not raise a Defence objection.  Yet we have an objection to a radio broadcast where André Rwamakuba is described as being in the company of Pauline Nyiramasuko.  To me, there is some incongruence there.  

Similarly, although we appreciate the Defence efforts to expedite this trial with a statement of uncontested facts, so I don't want to discourage that, but you will notice in the statement of uncontested facts there is a reference to the speech by Sindikubwabo on the 19th -- and we had discussed that as a means of establishing a reliable chronology of events.  

Now, if the speech itself was not a problem, when we agreed to them as a matter of procedure, it seems inconsistent now that we -- the Court should not look at that speech in the context of this trial.  

As a practical matter, these items are going to be discussed by Dr. Alison Des Forges when she takes the stand in this case, and her opinions can be put to the test by looking at the documentary evidence that she, herself, studies and reviews in order to deliver an expert opinion.  

So I would think that the Defence would actually appreciate those exhibits so that they can place them before the expert and have the expert put them in a context rather than simply providing an opinion with nothing to rely on.  

So my submission, Your Honour, is that all of these exhibits -- the ones that we have discussed -- including the exhibit of Jean Kambanda, placed the events in Gikomero and Butare in the context that they need to be considered in order for this Court to weigh the evidence.  

This is not simply a case of murder; this is a case of genocide.  André Rwamakuba is not simply accused of the assaults that led to the deaths of these people in Gikomero and in Butare.  He is accused of using those killings to achieve the larger crime or the most fundamental crime of destroying the Tutsi as a group.  And this Court would be in a much better position to weigh that evidence -- to weigh the evidence of those murders as part of an intention to destroy the Tutsi, if it can consider them in context.  

The Prosecution should have a right to look at the policies of the interim government as an element of the intent that we would need to prove to convict André Rwamakuba of genocide for the killings that the witnesses that testify before the Court will establish.  

So that basically is our submission.  I didn't notice in any of the Defence arguments that they challenged the authenticity of any of these exhibits.  Their objection was based -- was anchored entirely on matters of relevance, and these exhibits are relevant.  They will assist the Court in evaluating the expert-opinion evidence that Dr. Alison Des Forges will give, and it will assist the Court in appreciating the context of the times in the context of the conflict for the specific killings that are attributed to 
André Rwamakuba in Gikomero and in Butare.  

Furthermore, just as a footnote, I would add that it's a bit odd to cite the ICTY Rule 89(D), when if we look at the ICTR procedure and the whole -- excuse me -- ICTY regime of Rule 89, it also includes 
Rule 89(F) that allows submission of documentary evidence from witnesses.  

So, on the one hand, we want to look at how, if Mr. O'Shea wants to direct the Court to 89(F), the Court should consider the whole schema of Rule 89 as it is applied in the ICTY, which is a much broader evidential regime than we have here in the ICTR.  

I think I can conclude on that basis, Your Honour.  It's ultimately in the Court's discretion.  When Dr. Des Forges testifies, she's going to refer to these issues regardless of whether these exhibits come in now or not.  And she, herself, will refer to them as elements that she used to write her expert report.  

So my submission is that the Court would be in a much stronger position to make its assessment of the testimony and to assess the evidence if these items were admitted at this stage.  I think I will conclude there.  Thank you. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, thank you.  

First of all, as to incongruence.  Your Honour, a decision on the part of Defence counsel to object to a piece of evidence or not to object to it, is based on a number of considerations.  A very important consideration in our mind is the expeditiousness of these proceedings.  It would not be in the interests of the expeditiousness of these proceedings if we were to take every point that we felt that we had.  The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the scope of this trial is kept within proper boundaries.

We'd be quite happy for some of these documents to float around in the sense that they're fairly harmless, but what we don't want is the government plan to become a central issue in this case.  And I have to say that I'm, in a sense, slightly shocked that Mr. Webster frankly admits that the government plan is an issue in this case as far as he's concerned, given all we've gone through in the severance proceedings.  

I may come back to that and refer Your Honours to paragraph 11, I think it is, line 2, of the motion of the Prosecution when they were seeking severance in this trial.  "Rather than prove a huge government conspiracy of state-sponsored genocide, the Prosecution now seeks to focus this case against the accused by narrowing the trial in size and scope.  Extracting Rwamakuba from the joint trial will allow the Prosecutor to limit his proof at trial to Rwamakuba's direct participation at two crime sites." 

And then, at another point in the Prosecution's motion it is said:  "In the present case, the Prosecutor intends to provide greater specificity to the charges against Rwamakuba but not to expand the scope of the trial."

If we are going to hear evidence from Alison Des Forges, or whoever it may be, about a government plan, that is exactly what the Prosecution is doing.  And it will be an expansion that we will have to respond to.  The whole issue of whether there is a government plan is an enormously complicated issue, Your Honours, and it is not going to be in the interests of everything we've been fighting for in this case if we go down that avenue.  And that is why I invite Your Honours to exercise discretion, as 89(C) gives Your Honours, in order to give expression to the promises of the Prosecution, ensure that the Defence has not been misled when they agreed to severance in this trial and ensure that we actually focus on what the indictment says.  

If one goes down the road of relevance and probative value, potentially, theoretically, one can go on and on and on.  We know how large this conflict is.  We know how many victims are involved; we know how many parties are involved; how many individuals in the government are involved.  It's an enormous historical document, but that is not what we are here for. So context is not the issue here.  These are direct allegations against André Rwamakuba at two specific locations, and all of these witnesses, except for Alison Des Forges, will give evidence of that.  

The issue of intention of André Rwamakuba is being dealt with through this whole issue of his membership of the so-called MDR Power.  We haven't stood in the way of that.  But to go one step further and start producing evidence of a government plan puts this trial in a totally different category, in my submission, and would be most -- in the light of the promises made in this case -- would be most unfair on this Accused.  So I urge Your Honours to exercise discretion in order to narrow the issues, and this is an opportunity to do so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, if that concludes the argument, I think it would be an appropriate time to take an adjournment.  Is there anything else?  So the argument is concluded now?  
MR. O'SHEA:
That's right, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Okay, we will take our adjournment now. 
(Court recessed at 1555H)
(Pages 51 to 58 by Jean Baigent)
























(Court resumed at 1620H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We'll resume our sitting.  We have decided to take some time to consider a decision on this matter, and we expect to be in a position to give our ruling on Thursday, Thursday morning.  

Mr. Webster, before we finally -- put a final, full stop, I just wanted to ask you, you did not comment on one issue which Mr. O'Shea had raised concerning the redaction of those two sentences from the Amnesty International report.  Do you have a position on that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I have no problem with Mr. O'Shea's application, Your Honour.  For us, the essence of the report is what it says about the events at the hospital, not its conclusions.  

But I would like to raise another matter with the Court if I may, and that is to give some IP numbers to the items that we discussed just so the record is clear.  If we're not going to have a discussion -- if we're not going to have a decision now, perhaps we should identify the three CD-ROMs -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
-- that we're trying to move forward with and the bundle of transcripts.  What we had done since our last discussion of this issue last week is recopy excerpts of the video clips onto a new CD-ROM.  At that time, the objection was that -- I believe it was, one clip was objectionable, and another clip was too long and needed to be shortened, and we've done that.  So I'd like to offer a revised CD-ROM of video clips as the next IP, which I believe is IP. 9, and I've written on it "Revision of 16 June '05," and it's also entitled "Video clips."  So if I could give that to Mr. Fry -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification the revised CD of video clips.  You said you gave it a date?  
MR. WEBSTER:
On it, I've written "Revision of the 16th of June."  That's when it was done.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Right.  So we can put that --
MR. WEBSTER:
We can use that.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- "Revised CD of video clips of 16 June," IP. 9.
(Exhibit No. IP. 9 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
I also have a -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
One copy?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I had prepared -- we only have one copy of the revised video clips, but for the other two CD-ROMs, I had proposed copies for -- actually, the Defence has this, and I had provided it to the Court, but I noticed they were given back to me by the (inaudible).  So I do have copies for the Court for the other two CD-ROMs that I'll move forward with now.  The second one is a revised CD-ROM of audio clips.  There are 17 clips on this.  We can also call this the revision of the 16th of June 2005.  This is the CD-ROM that we used to play the clip that we heard just moments ago, and this would be IP. 10.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
IP. 10.  
(Exhibit No. IP. 10 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
And the last of the CD-ROMs, I'd like to have it identified as IP. 11.  It will be the videotape of the exhumation at Butare Hospital.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And that would be IP. 11? 
(Exhibit No. IP. 11 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  The last item that I propose we mark for identification is the bundle of transcripts.  These transcripts relate to the audio clips and to two of the video clips.  There is an index in the first section of the bundle.  It lists items 1 to 13.  I won't read it into the record now because it would take another ten minutes to do that, but I think we can agree that the whole bundle be identified as IP. 12, and if the Court decides that aspects of the bundle should be removed, I propose that we revisit that issue in the wake of the Court's decision.  Otherwise, we're going to have to go through item by item and list them.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We can mark the bundle IP. 12, and on Thursday, we will deal with the specific admission, depending on our decision in this matter.  
(Exhibit No. IP. 12 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER: 
I believe the registry already has a copy of the bundle.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think the registry got more than one copy.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I've concluded.  Thank you.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, I apologise, there was one exhibit that I omitted to comment on.  I can do so very briefly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Mr. Webster made the objection to it.  That's the video of the Butare exhumation?
MR. O'SHEA:
Yes.  I -- I can just --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to adopt Mr. Webster's argument?  
MR. O'SHEA:
That's right.  He -- he dealt with it.  Had he not dealt with it, I would have forgotten it.  But it's simply this.  When one looks at that -- that clip, it basically involves about ten minutes showing some gentlemen digging around a mass grave and pictures of skulls and bones, followed by removal, you know, formal removal of the bodies, as it were, and then about three or four minutes of a funeral ceremony of some kind, and then a sort of very typically African moment of gentlemen taking spades and putting some mud back into the grave.  Now, all we say about that is that its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.  We say it doesn't have any probative value.  An exhumation report would be enough.  But we don't feel particularly strongly about this, because we have confidence that Your Honours won't be, in any way, swayed by pictures of that nature.  It's just that they go on for such a long time, and they don't seem to really establish anything of an evidenciary nature.  So we oppose it, but not strongly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

So then thank you very much.  Well, that closes this issue for now.  Can we -- we have, I think, one hour.  Is your next witness available?  
MS. FALL:
The witness is ready, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Are you waiting on -- I suppose before the witness is sworn in, I should just say once again we are sitting under 15 bis, in the absence of Judge Hökborg who is away on official business.  And to confirm that the proceedings are being videotaped so that she will have an opportunity to see and hear the witness, as well as study the transcripts of what transpired during her absence.  Mr. Registrar, earlier this week, I had asked you to confirm the video, but I don't think that you have put your answer on the record.  

MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  I checked again earlier today to make sure, and everything is being recorded as you ordered, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Could the witness now be sworn in?
(Declaration made by Witness GIT in Kinyarwanda)  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, in order to proceed with the identification of this witness, I will use the normal method, in other words, give him the identification sheet which I would like to have handed to the witness by the registry, please.  
 WITNESS GIT,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good day, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	As I explained, you are a protected witness, so I shall identify you by asking you whether you can recognise your name on the document that has been placed before you.

Q.	Do you have your family name on it?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Your date of birth as well?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Your region of origin?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.  The interpreter corrects.  It's "religion of origin."  Witness says he does not see the religion.  Counsel apologises and says that she is looking at another sheet of paper. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Can you see your nationality? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Your ethnic origin?
A.	Yes.  
Q.	The job you had in April 1994?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Your current job?  
A.	The profession that is indicated on the identification sheet is not my current occupation.  
Q.	Could you provide any corrections by -- provide a correction by indicating your current occupation?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter would like to remind Counsel that she should leave a space between the witness's answer and her next question as the interpreter is having trouble following her.  
MR. O'SHEA:
While the witness is doing that, can I just indicate that I'm listening to the French channel, and so is our legal assistant.  We've got this high-pitched, whining sound.  I don't know if the technical staff could try and help us with that, because I can imagine we're going to have a very big headache at the end of the day, a big headache. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I must confess that there is a sound in the English headphone, too.  Maybe not as bad as yours.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Okay.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, how about your -- the information indicating your place of birth, your cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture of origin, is this information correct?  
A.	Yes, it is.  
Q.	Would the same apply to the location where you were in April of 1994?  
A.	Yes, it is.  Yes, it would.  
Q.	How about your current address?  
A.	It is correct.  
Q.	Witness, please indicate the date which is the 21st of June, if I'm -- if I remember, and please sign the document.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I would like to tender this document into evidence, and I would like that it be placed under seal in view of the confidential information it contains.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence and placed under seal.  Next exhibit number, Mr. Registry?  
MR. FRY:
P. 34, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 34.  Thank you.
(Exhibit No. P. 34 admitted, under seal)
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GIT, I'm going to begin your examination-in-chief, and I would like you to address the Trial Chamber when answering questions.  Witness GIT, have you ever given testimony before this Court in Arusha?  
A.	Yes, I have given testimony beforehand in this Tribunal.  
Q.	If you are able, can you tell us when this occurred?  
A.	I came to give testimony here on the ********** 2004.  
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, in what trial you gave testimony?  
A.	I gave testimony in the André Rwamakuba trial.  
Q.	Have you ever given testimony to a Rwandan court?  
A.	Yes, I have.  
Q.	Can you tell us when that was?  
A.	I gave testimony in Rwanda in 2003.  It was in a military trial.  
Q.	Have you ever been prosecuted?  
A.	No, I have never been prosecuted.

1645H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Have you met investigators of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, I have. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you met with them? 
A.	They came for the first time, they prepared a statement, they came back to see me three times or so to discuss this statement with me. 
Q.	Can you tell us the date on which you met them for the very first statement? 
A.	I remember that it was in 1997. 
Q.	Have you had occasion to re-read that statement? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you make any changes to this statement? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you sign that statement? 
A.	Yes, I signed the statement. 
Q.	You told us that they came to see you to discuss this statement, when they returned did they prepare another statement? 
A.	No.  They did not take another statement.  They used the first one. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that you came to give testimony last year in the André Rwamakuba trial; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	Did you know André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I knew him. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you got to know him? 
A.	I go to know André Rwamakuba when I was a secondary school student. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you got to know him when you were a secondary school student? 
A.	When I was in secondary school, I met Rwamakuba during students' meetings.  During holidays, I was at these meetings so was he, and that is how I met him and that is how he also met me. 
Q.	Can you tell us the dates of these meetings? 
A.	This is between 1977 and 1979.  That is when I used to meet him at the meetings that I have mentioned. 
Q.	Can you be more precise as to the type of meetings these were? 
A.	These were student and pupil meetings during the holidays.  This was an opportunity for students and pupils to meet, to talk, exchange views and play games such as football.  These were opportunities provided to students to occupy them during the holidays. 
Q.	During that time, did you have occasion to speak to André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I was still very young at the time.  He was older than I was, so I could only talk to people of my age.  He was older.  I did not have the opportunity to speak with him person to person. 
Q.	I take it then, that you saw him but you did not have the opportunity to speak with him.  How many times did you see him? 
A.	These meetings were organised during the holidays, so if you do a calculation I would say that I saw him 10 or 15 times. 
Q.	How did you know that it was -- that it was André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I knew because when we met at these meetings, there were pupils and students from various schools in various regions in Rwanda.  Each person had to introduce himself or herself, give the school and the names.  And that is how I got to know who Rwamakuba was. 
Q.	Apart from these circumstances, did you have an opportunity to meet with -- to see André Rwamakuba again? 
A.	I finished secondary school in 1979.  I became a ***************************.  I began to *****************, and when I left home to go **********, I used to go passed the entrance to Rwamakuba's courtyard.  As a ***********, since I used to pass in front of their house and I used to *********************** secteur of residence, I got to know his parents.  When he came to visit his parents, I would meet him, I would chat with him, exchange opinions.  Sometimes we would agree, this happened when I visited his parents and I found him there. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	This is why -- generally a ********* is known in the region where he **********.  And amongst *************, there were the grandchildren of Rwamakuba's parents.  Since I gave -- I ******** children who came from that home, that caused Rwamakuba's parents to consider me as someone who was accessible, which means that when there was a celebration or when they had made some banana wine they would invite me to stop by and say hello in their home. 
Q.	Did André Rwamakuba live with his parents? 
A.	At that time he wasn't living with his parents.  More often, he was in Kigali where he worked. 
Q.	Can you tell us then at what time you used to meet André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I could meet him -- I met him when he visited his parents on festive occasions.  You know that on festive occasions many people meet, and when there were problems, when there were general sad events, he would leave Kigali and come to visit his parents, and I would meet him when he was visiting his parents at those times. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you saw him at his parents' home? 
A.	I met him there many times, but if I were to give an estimate, I would say 20 times. 
Q.	During these meetings, did you have occasion to speak with André Rwamakuba? 
A.	When I met him on those occasions, I was able to speak with him.  Since he came from Kigali and he came to visit his parents, he would talk with the people he met at his parents's home.  The subject of our conversations were general or any particular -- or the particular event -- or concerned the particular event that was occurring at his family home.  So I had opportunity -- the opportunity to speak with him at those times. 
Q.	Witness, would you be able to describe the exact location of the home of André Rwamakuba's parents if you were asked to do so? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you know whether André Rwamakuba's parents still live in the same place? 
A.	Yes, they do. 
Q.	Witness, would you recognise André Rwamakuba if he was introduced to you -- if he was pointed out to you? 
A.	I think I might be able to recognise him if he was introduced to me. 
Q.	Witness, you are telling us that you know André Rwamakuba well.  Do you know whether André Rwamakuba was a member of any political party? 
A.	André Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR party.  He was a member, as other citizens were, especially in my commune.  Members of this party, the notable members of this party were, first, Anasthase Gasana.  It is he and people like that who represented the party in the commune.  Subsequently, they came into conflict.  Anasthase Gasana joined the MDR moderate wing, whereas Rwamakuba joined the MDR-Power wing. 
Q.	Can you tell us what MDR moderate and MDR-Power mean? 
A.	In my view, the moderate MDR was the party which called on all Rwandans to unite and build their country, without distinction, whereas MDR-Power exhorted -- incited the Hutus, the Hutu ethnic group to unite, to fight what they referred to as the enemy and they said that the enemy was the Tutsis.  They said in general that Tutsis supported the RPF-Inkotanyi and, consequently, MDR-Power encouraged, fostered the idea that all Tutsis should be exterminated so that these -- the Tutsis could no longer continue to support the RPF. 
Q.	We'll take it in stages, if you don't mind, Witness.  You said that the moderate MDR wished that -- wanted the union of all Rwandans.  What do you mean "union of all Rwandans"? 
A.	The "union of Rwandans" meant that all ethnic groups in Rwanda and those who -- which were outside the country should unite so that they can live in peace without segregation. 
Q.	And during this period of time, what were the ethnic groups existing in Rwanda? 
A.	During that period of time, there were Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you've already told us that -- please can you repeat this -- we would like to hear what was the ideology of the MDR-Power party.  
A.	As I have just said, the MDR-Power was a party which was in -- was calling on the Hutus to unite so that they could be able to fight the enemy, and it said that the enemy was the Tutsi.  This party was claiming that the Tutsis supported the RPF-Inkotanyi, and during that time, there was fighting between the forces of the RPF and the Rwandan government forces, and the MDR-Power was therefore saying that it was necessary to eliminate Tutsis because the latter were supporting the RPF-Inkotanyi which was attacking the country; it was therefore necessary to exterminate all the Tutsis.
Q.	Also mentioned this split which came about within the MDR.  Are you able to inform us on what date that split occurred? 
A.	I obtained this information from Radio Rwanda.  The split occurred in 1993, July of that year, 1993.  That is when MDR-Power came to be and there were, therefore, two factions, the moderate wing and the power wing. 
Q.	You gave us the approximate time that the split occurred.  Can you please be a little more specific and tell us during what occasion that split occurred? 
A.	As I have already said, the news was passed on -- was broadcast on Radio Rwanda.  The split took place during the congress of the MDR party which took place in Kabusunzu. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, without going into details which may reveal your identity, I wish to ask you whether you yourself were a member of any political party? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of a political party.  I do not know whether you want me to mention the name of that party, Mr. President. 
MS. FALL: 
I'm sorry, the question was put to the president.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but it's really you who should answer at this stage, Madam Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think giving the name of the party wouldn't be a problem.  The only thing is that he should not make any reference to any position he held within that party.  So, I am asking him whether he was a member of any political party, and I have taken the trouble to tell him to remain very general about what he says.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, I think that you could answer the question in the way that it has been put to you.
THE WITNESS: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I was a member of the Liberal Party, Parti Libèrale whose initials were PL.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Was there any split that occurred in that party, the PL? 
A.	Yes, the Parti Libèral was split into two.  There was the ordinary Partie Liberal and there was the hardline wing was known as the Parti Libèral Power. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us -- we are coming back to Mr. André Rwamakuba -- that the conflict that he had with another member of the MDR party and Anasthase Gasana was because André Rwamakuba was affiliating himself with the MDR-Power wing; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can I therefore ask you on what you rely to be able to say that André Rwamakuba was a member of the MDR-Power party? 
A.	I am saying that he belonged to the MDR-Power party given that he organised rallies within the commune, and also relying on what was said during those rallies. 
Q.	You are saying that meetings -- or rallies were organised in the commune.  Could you tell us exactly where, at what locations such meetings were held or organised? 
A.	These rallies took place -- as far as I know, the rallies were held in Sha, Kayanga secteur, and Nduba secteur also. 
Q.	Can you tell us at what times or when these rallies were held? 
A.	These rallies were held between August 1993 and March 1994. 
Q.	You told us that you knew that André Rwamakuba belonged to this MDR-Power wing because he organised meetings.  What I want to know from you is whether he organised those rallies alone? 
A.	The organisation of these rallies did not involve only André Rwamakuba.  As I have said, it involved other people.  And he lived in Kigali.  He came, accompanied by other people, with whom he had prepared the meeting and he would come with these meetings -- with these people on board vehicles in order to hold those rallies. 
Q.	Witness, you've just told us that you -- that he came on board certain vehicles with other people.  Did you yourself see him do such? 
A.	Yes, I saw him. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you saw him come on these vehicles? 
A.	I recall that I saw him maybe five times.  I think I saw him come to rallies on five occasions. 
Q.	Can you please tell us exactly where you were when André Rwamakuba passed by on these vehicles?  Obviously without giving any details which might reveal your identity.  
A.	I would see him often when I was at home because I lived close by the road.  When he was going to the venue of the rallies, vehicles would go up towards the place where the rallies were going to be held and they would pass right by my house. 
Q.	Could you tell us what road that was? 
A.	This was the road coming from Kigali and going in the direction of the venue of the rallies. 
Q.	Can you help us by telling us in which direction the road went? 
A.	As I have said, this road came from Kigali.  When you come from the city of Kigali, you take the tarmac road and at one point in time you would see the tarred road, you would get on to a road which was not tarred and you would come into our commune, which was at ***************. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Could you please tell us approximately what was the distance between your house and that road? 
A.	Between my house and the road, I believe is a distance of ***********. 
Q.	When you saw the vehicle, were you able to see André Rwamakuba in the vehicle? 
A.	Yes, I would see him.  In fact, he was the one driving the vehicle. 
Q.	Would you be able to describe that vehicle for us today? 
A.	It was a red pick-up. 
Q.	Was Rwamakuba alone in that vehicle? 
A.	No, he wasn't alone.  I think I have already told you, he was in the company of others.  And amongst those other people with him, were those who were in the cabin of the pick-up truck and the others were in the back part of the pick-up.

1745H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	If you can, could you describe the people who were in the vehicle? 
A.	I wasn't able to know the names of those people, apart from André Rwamakuba, whom I knew well before.  But these people were wearing the emblem of the MDR Power party.  They were wearing caps and they would wear -- they would wear small flags, which were red and black in colour for their party -- party colours.  And there were others who wore clothing of different colours.  Some wore the Interahamwe uniform of the MRND.  They were singing and they were shouting slogans in praise of their party. 
Q.	I'm going to ask you for some more details, Mr. Witness.  You told us that you recognised some of the people because of the emblems.  From where you were, were you able to see those emblems or, indeed, what is it that you are calling emblems? 
A.	During that period of time, each party had its own flag.  That is what I was able to tell.  Now, as for the MDR party itself, when you see a red and black flag, especially when people were going to attend rallies, this meant that those people were members of the MDR, nobody else wore those colours except the members of the MDR party.  So, in order to show that these people belonged to the MDR party, they needed to wear specific clothing so that others could recognise them by their clothing. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that these people who were on the pickup were members of the MDR Power, and they were Interahamwe.  You said that they were singing and shouting slogans.  Did you yourself hear those songs and those slogans? 
A.	Yes, I heard the songs and the slogans.  I didn't -- I don't remember everything, obviously, but I can remember some of the lyrics of the songs and the words said in the slogans.  
Q.	Today, Witness, would you be able to tell us exactly what you heard in terms of the songs and the slogans? 
A.	I can say words such as Tuba Tsembe Tsembe.  They were saying that some people were sitting on fire, they were saying X, Y, Z, they were sitting on fire because they refused to come and follow the correct paths, and so on and so forth. 
Q.	Witness --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Mr. President, there was a switch and we didn't catch the beginning of Counsel's question. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you mind repeating the question again, please.  We got a message, a help message from the interpretation booth.  They did not hear the beginning of your question. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I had a problem too because I was hearing Kinyarwanda in my ears.  Yes, thank you.  Thank you, sir. 

	I was saying to the witness that he saw André Rwamakuba go by several times, in a vehicle as he was on his way to the rallies organised in Sha, Kayanga and Nduba.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	What I want to know, Witness, did you personally attend these meetings, these rallies? 
A.	I never attended any of those rallies which he organised. 
Q.	How, therefore, can you be affirmative by saying today that André Rwamakuba organised rallies in Sha, Kayanga and Nduba? 
A.	I am saying this categorically because when these rallies were held, many people would go and attend them.  Among those who attended them, there were some who passed by the road close by my house.  Others, I had the opportunity to meet following those rallies, and during our discussions with these people who had come from the rallies, I had the opportunity of getting to know what had happened during the rallies.  
Q.	Would you be able to give us names of those who informed you of the holding of those meetings and what was said during those rallies? 
A.	Yes, I can mention in particular Arcade Kirenga, James Punga (phonetic). 
Q.	Are you able to tell us where these two people are today? 
A.	Arcade Kirenga is in the same place as he was in 1993, he lives in ******************.  As for Punga (phonetic), he is presently in detention at the Kigali prison.  He is being prosecuted for genocide. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, we are at 5:30, I don't know if you can find a convenient time to wind up so we can take the adjournment. 
MS. FALL: 
Very well, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now is convenient, or do you want to wrap up this?  
MS. FALL: 
Allow me please to wrap up with this point, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  (No interpretation) 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I shall put a couple of other questions and I think I shall be able to continue tomorrow morning.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, did the persons who informed you -- who informed you, tell you where the Sha, Nduba and Kayanga meetings or rallies had taken place? 
A.	Yes, these people told me the exact location where the rallies took place.  In Sha secteur, the rallies took place in the centre of the secteur, that is where the secteur office was.  Nduba, the rallies were organised on the secteur football field.  As to Kayanga -- as for Kayanga, rallies took place in the square near the Kayanga school. 
Q.	Did the persons who informed you tell you -- confirm the presence of André Rwamakuba at these rallies? 
A.	They did.  And I took and confirmed this because when the vehicles were going passed and I saw him, these persons themselves also confirmed that Rwamakuba had taken part in these various rallies.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think I can stop here to continue tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.  Shall we take the adjournment now?

Mr. Witness, you are sworn in to give evidence, and you -- and while you are under oath giving testimony in this case, you are not to discuss the case with anybody during the adjournment.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I understand. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much.

We will take the adjournment now -- sorry, Mr. Witness, do you wish to say something else?  Yes you may say what you wish to say.  
THE WITNESS:
What I would like to say is that I came to give testimony today before the Trial Chamber and I do not feel well.  Actually I had an appointment with the doctor today, but I did not meet the doctor in question.  I needed to do some test before treatment was prescribed.  First, I would like to ask the Trial Chamber's authority -- request the Trial Chamber's authority so that I can go and see a doctor tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Tribunal will assist you to get the medical attention that you need.  My question has to do with the question of timing of that request.  It would be preferable if you are able to give your testimony as well as get the medical attention.  So I don't know how the issue of timing will work.

Mr. Registrar, is there any inquiry that we need to make?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I will ask WVSS if they can arrange an appointment with the doctor, either early in the morning or at lunch. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I think the registrar of the Tribunal will take steps to assist you in getting the medical attention that you need.  Now, we will continue with your testimony, unless there is an emergency which makes it too difficult for you to function. 
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, with all due respect, if this medical care is provided to me before court is in session I shall be able to give testimony as expected.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.  Thank you for that assurance.  I'm quite certain that the relevant authority will take all reasonable steps to assist you to get the medical attention that you need as soon as possible.  There is a section of the Tribunal which is especially mandated to take care of these issues.  And the registrar has indicated that he will address your request to them, and that arrangements, I'm sure, will be.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, I'm sorry to interrupt your thoughts.  Can I raise a matter in the absence of this witness, very briefly, if the witness could remove himself from the Court; it doesn't directly concern him. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, could you allow the witness to leave.
(Witness excused)

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
There are two matters.  The first is this: I hope it will be appropriate for me, in the course of questioning this witness, to refer to evidence given by *************** without in any way breaching the protected witness status or identification of the witness or previous witnesses.  That is the first matter.  

And, secondly, the general rule, as I understand it, perhaps the Prosecution are in a position to confirm this, is that when witnesses come here; the witness support scheme here is such that witnesses are kept separate and apart one from the other.  And that I understand quite separate arrangements, housing arrangements are made, and there is no contact between witnesses.  Here we have a situation where the last witness and this witness are *******.  And I need -- I hope to be assured that there has been no contact between these witnesses since they arrived here in Arusha to give evidence, or, in particular, since they started giving evidence, or the brother did on Thursday, was it -- when did we start?   It was Thursday, I think, of last week, yes.  I rather lost the days of time.  I think from last week.  Can I be given that assurance that they have been kept separate and apart, no communication between the two of them?  And I ask that because, of course, being brothers, I'm not entirely sure that that has been the situation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Register is it possible to give a response to that?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I know that WVSS has several safehouses, but I'm not sure exactly where each of the witnesses are placed, so I will have to look into that and then get back to you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you, very much. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Madam Prosecutor, did you want to make a comment?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I have no comment, no particular comment about what Mr. Hooper has said.  I think the WVSS people are professionals and they know on what conditions witnesses come to testimony before this Tribunal.  So I have no concerns on that level.  

The second thing is that I see that Mr. Hooper is insisting on the fact that ******************************* (sic),*************************************.  But I would like to say that we did not call ************* of Witness GLM, we called a witness who experienced events, and who is giving testimony about those events.  So I think that the fact that one is a witness's ********** does not prevent one from given testimony.

Mr. Hooper may go on and on about these peoples are **********, but it will not change the fact that he went through -- he lived through events, and it is about those events that he is testifying to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Fall.  I would just make a comment that I made earlier today, that you have the benefit of a trial where you are dealing now with a professional judicial bench, not a jury.  So matters of this nature, I think, you can be certain that the proper weight will be applied to them at the relevant time.  I think we should take the adjournment now.
