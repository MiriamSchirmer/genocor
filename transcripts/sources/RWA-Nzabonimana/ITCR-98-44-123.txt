MR. PRESIDENT:
	Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.
MR. FRY:
     Yes, Your Honour.

Trial Chamber III, the International Criminal Trial for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, Presiding Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam is now sitting in open session, today Friday the 10th of June 2005 for the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case Number ICTR-98-44C-T. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I take it that the appearances are the same as yesterday, on both sides?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning, Your Honour, that's correct.  
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed, for the Defence too. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Webster. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Thank you once again.
UPENDRA SINGH BAGHEL,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Good morning.  I would like to begin by trying to clarify from where we left off yesterday.  My understanding, and perhaps the Court and Defence can correct me, is that so far we have in evidence  P. 1 which is the CV Baghel, Upendra; P. 2, which is a booklet of photos and maps and sketches;       P. 2A, B, C, and D, which are sketches that were handed up by Mr. Baghel and then there's a pending  application to move into evidence a CD-ROM of video clips.  

At this time, I'd like to formally offer the CD-ROM of audio clips in evidence.  I understand the Court will reserve its decision until Wednesday in that regard, and that we have other matters to address between now and Wednesday, but at that time we'll resolve the issue of the admissibility of the CD-ROM of audio clips and the CD-ROM of video clips.  

What I am going to attempt to do today is move documents into evidence through this witness, and I will begin with a document identified on our exhibit list as number 16.  We've captioned it André Rwamakuba's passport.  

So Mr. Baghel, could you locate that document and tell us where it comes from, please.  
A.	Good morning to all of you.  This document which is a passport copy of André Rwamakuba, vide serial number 16, was received by me from the evidence unit.  And the evidence unit got it from the investigation.  During the process of investigation, these photo -- many photographs and documents were collected in the year '98 and '99.  Subsequently, they were compiled and sent to evidence unit.
Q.	Tell me, how many pages the document consists of and the K number that identifies it, please.  
A.	This document is vide K number 011-0687 and this is of one page, which is folded in two sides, so it looks like a small booklet type of two pages only and both have come on one page, here.  This is -- in this document, the name is written, Rwamakuba, Andre.  There's a photograph and his place of birth, occupation, date of birth, address and other personal details.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If there's no objection, I'd like to move this item into evidence.  
MR. HOOPER:
There's no objection, and there's no objection to any of the items that have been (unintelligible).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Admitted into evidence -- Mr. Registrar, what is the exhibit number?  Could you speak so it can go onto the record. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. The next Prosecution exhibit is P. 3.
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 3.  
(Exhibit No. P. 3 admitted)
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I don't know -- would it be a practical idea to have the exhibit numbers the same as the reference numbers on the exhibit list?  So, for example, this item is -- if I can find it, I found it a moment ago, I think it's under audios.  Give me one moment, if Mr. Webster could help me; he found it once already a moment ago.  16 is it?  Yes, 16.  Yes, I have got it. 16, on our list.  I don't know if it's a reasonable suggestion.  It just means that if we're going to have one list -- I appreciate there may have been some things put in yesterday.  Perhaps we can consider that, but it would mean not having a duplicate list.  I've already got one.  As I understand, all these matters more or less are going to go in, subject to all the transcripts.  But as they go in, perhaps we can refer to them with that number.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, the registry prefers to go by sequential order 1, 2, 3 for the official record.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I think there would be practical difficulties in your suggestion because the registry would -- I -- I don't see how they would be able to keep a record of the exhibits if they don't give them sequential numbers based on the time on which it was admitted into testimony. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I see that.  You have far more experience than I, so I must defer to that -- to you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, I would like to turn your attention to the next item.  It's number 21 on our exhibit list.  Tell us what it is, where it came from.  
A.	Item number 21, which is the statute of MDR party and Kabunsunzu congress held on 23rd of July 1993 published in "Urumuli Rwa Demokrasi"  MDR newspaper, vide, K0268158 to 8174.  And it's French and English translations are also there.  
Q.	What was the original language of the -- the -- the original document -- the language of the original document?  
A.	The original document is in Kinyarwanda.  And I have a photocopy of a document which is -- which is in the evidence unit.  And the evidence unit received it in the year of 2003 and it's classified as newspaper clipping of publication document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, I'd simply like to clarify that the Kinyarwanda original begins on page number K0268158.  The French translation begins on page K0271397 and the English translation begins on 
page K2 - excuse me, K0272099.  I'd like to move this item into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  

Mr. Registrar, what's the exhibit number? 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, the next exhibit number is P. 4.  
(Exhibit No. P. 4A, P. 4B and P. 4C admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item I'd like to address is number 22 on the exhibit list.  
A.	The item number 22 in the list which is titled "Interahamwe za Muvoma or the MRND Party Hardliners, 'Attempt to root out the evil''" -- working document, MDR Steering Committee 14 May 1992.  
This document is a part of a letter written by the minister of interior of Rwanda to the Office of High Commissioners of Human Rights on 6 October 1994.  And later on, this correspondence was sent to ICTR and it came into possession of the evidence unit and I got the copy from the evidence unit here.  
Q.	Can you tell us the K number of the original language?  What the original language was and then the 
	K number of the translation, please.  
A.	The original language used in this letter is French and it's vide K0016555 to 6566.  And the French translation starts from K0241099 1115.  
Q.	The English translation starts from that number.  
A.	Yeah, sorry. The English translation starts from K0241099 to 1115.  The original language is French.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May we move this item into evidence, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  

Mr. Registrar.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, P. 5 is the number. 
(Exhibit No. P. 5A and P. 5B admitted)  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item I'd like us to look at is number 24 and 24A on our exhibit list.  
A.	Item number 24, which is titled in the list as MDR documents number 110, Extraordinary National Congress MDR party dated 24 July 1993.  The original language used in this document is French and it's vide K0504045 to 4054 and came into possession of ICTR during that documentary search, which was done in Kigali.  This search was carried out by ICTR investigators and the documents which were found to be delivered were taken under custody and sent to the evidence unit.  The search was carried out last year, in 2004.  It's English translation is not available yet and this document vide number 24, is also listed in a document which I said just now, number 21.  
Q.	Would you describe exhibit -- what is identified on our exhibit list as 24A.  Tell us what 24A is, please?  
A.	Item number 24A, which is the list of participants from Extraordinary National Congress, MDR party, dated 24 July 1993.  This document came into possession of ICTR during the search which was carried out by ICTR investigators last year in Kigali.  And, this document contains names of the people and their signatures.  In that, the name of André Rwamakuba is also there.  
Q.	Mr. Baghel, the search that led to the handwritten document, was it the same search that led to the typewritten document that you mentioned as item number 24?  
A.	Yes.  Item number 24 and 24A, both were found during the same search last year.  

MR. WEBSTER:
Let me simply clarify for the record, that item number 24 is typewritten and item number 24A, which is the list of participants, is simply handwritten signatures and names of the participants in that MDR congress.  And my submission is that they go into evidence as one item.  But, I'll leave that to the discretion of the registry, so I would like to move this into evidence.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we move from that last document, the bundle that we have, is that complete?  It doesn't show Kigali rural on it, and I don't know if Rwamakuba's name would appear in the list of names otherwise.  We accept his name might well be there, but can you assist us to where it is before we pass on.  
THE WITNESS:
This is on page number 2 of item number 24A vide K0504032, serial number 1919, where it is written Dr. Rwamakuba, André, Gikomero, and his signature is there.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't see it.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe, Mr. Court Officer, could you show the exhibit to the Defence, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
24A, I'm sorry, I think we've found it, yes.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
We found it, thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  

This is admitted into evidence, Mr. Registrar.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, the next number is P. 6. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are both documents to have the same number or are they to be P. 6 and P. 6A?
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, P. 6 and P. 6A. 
(Exhibit No. P. 6, P. 6A and P. 6B admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'd like to move on to item number 20A and I read it as Compte-redu de la reunion Directeur de Cabinet,
A.	Item number 20A is titled as Compte-redu de la reunion Directeur de Cabinet, 0080681 to 0682.  It's in French and the English translation is vide K0235632 to 5633.  This document came in possession of ICTR evidence unit from Belgium authorities.  Some of the Belgium files were transferred from Belgium to ICTR and this document was there in those papers.  
MR. WEBSTER:
May we move this into evidence, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, as document P. 7.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 7 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item I would like us to address is identified on our exhibit list as 20B, Communique emanant du Ministére de la Defense.
A.	The item number 20B, titled as Communique emanant du Ministére de la Defense, vide K0080683 is in French and it English translation is K0235634.  This document also came into possession of ICTR through the Belgium authorities, and it was part of the files which were transferred from Belgium to ICTR.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I request that this be moved into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, Mr. Registrar.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, document P. 8. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 8 admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	I'd like to direct your attention to what has been listed on our exhibit list as item 20G, Communiqué des Forces Armées Rwandaises of 7 April 1994.  
A.	This item number 20G titled as Communiqué des Forces Armées Rwandaises, vide K0233372, is in French language, and English translation is not available.  This document I received from the evidence unit, and when I did background research, I found that this -- that this document came into custody of evidence unit through OTP of ICTR in 2002.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I request that this item be moved into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. FRY:
P. 9.  Your Honour.  
(Exhibit No. P. 9 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item we are going to look at is 20D, the Protocol Additionel au Protocol d'Entente entre les partis politiques.  It's an item dated or signed on the 8th of April 1994.  
A.	Item number 20D, the reference number KA010686 to 0687.  It's in French language and this document came into possession through the (unintelligible) of Mr. Froduald Karamira when he was arrested.  This document is signed by different persons who were the party leaders in 1994.  Similar document, typewritten, not signed, was defence exhibit in one of the Prosecutor -- one of the cases of the ICTR and that came into Chamber on 28th May 1998, in the case ICTR-95-1-T.  
MR. WEBSTER:
For the record, the last document that was identified by the witness is also in the upper right-hand corner.  It seems to say DX which, I take it to mean defence exhibit 33D, and that was the English translation of the original document which is the protocol d'Entente.  They should both go in under the same number, which is P. 10 and I would like to move it into evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, Mr. Registrar.  
MR. FRY:
The next number would be P. 10, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, what I understand here, is that they have two different documents, a French document and an English document.  Would you identify them as -- one as P. 10A and one as P. 10B?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, it's also possible to do P. 10E and P. 10F, Your Honour; it's up to you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I leave it at the discretion of the registry. 

Your Honour, we haven't been making a distinction between the language of the documents so far.  We have admitted things under one number for three languages for some of the previous exhibits. I suggest that we continue to do the same thing, but it's at the Court's discretion and the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
In that case P. 10A and P. 10B, Your Honour.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I take it that the French original is P. 10A and the English translation is P. 10B. 
(Exhibit No. P. 10A and P. 10B admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item we're going to look at is item 20F as it is identified in our exhibit list.  It's also a protocol D'Entente.  It's entitled Deuxieme Protocol Additionel au Protocol d'Entente entre les partis politiques -- it's a very long title, I haven't said the whole thing. But it is signed on the 16th of July 1993.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Your Honour. 
MR. WEBSTER:
On our listing. 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	This document is only available in its original, French.  
A.	The document 20F, K0349196 9198, which is in French language signed by defence, leaders of political parties on 16 July 1993 and this document came into possession of ICTR in the month of May 2005, when ICTR staff member received this document from Philip Reyntejen in Belgium.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I request this be moved into evidence; the next number will be P. 11.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence as P. 11.  
(Exhibit No. P. 11 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next document we are going to look at is identified at 20E on our exhibit list.  20E is actually two pages of a Kinyarwanda publication; it seems to be a newspaper or a journal.  The first page, the title page of that journal, on the top of the word -- is the word "Impamo", I-M-P-A-M-O.  There's a year underneath it, 1993.  The K number for the first page is K0012995 and then the text that interests us is further into that journal.  I've only copied the page that interests us.  It's identified as K0013005 and on that page is a reproduction of another protocol d'Entente; that protocol d'Entente is dated and signed the 13th of April 1993.  So, Mr. Baghel, can you give us some background information to this particular document.  
A.	This document vide K00130005 is in French and this is the part of one magazine, a publication dated 
	6 April 1993, titled (unintelligible) Impano, number 6.  And it seems by looking at the document that the document was copied in this magazine or journal directly; that's why this document is also having signatures of different political party leaders, dated 13 April 1993.  This document came into possession of ICTR in 1998.  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry to interrupt, this is E, is it?  
MR. WEBSTER:
This is 20E on our list. 
MR. HOOPER:
And, is it in the bundle?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it should be.  
MR. HOOPER:
Because I got 20D and then it goes to F.  I think that's the same for the Judges as well.  It may have been missed out or it may be it's on another page.  But, would it be possible to pass over that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It's not Isibo, it's another application.  I'm not sure exactly what it is.  I'd like to offer Mr. Baghel -- I put it myself and it was said on the record a moment ago.  It's not dated the 6th of May.  It's number 6 and then the next word is Mata, which may be "May" in Kinyarwanda.  But it's not the 6th of May, it's simply number 6 and then Mata and then 1993.  And you can keep that copy; we can provide it to you again. But it's basically a Kinyarwanda publication where the protocol D'Entente that was signed in 199 -- on the 13th of April 1993 is reproduced.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You said it's a Kinyarwanda publication. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it is. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The witness says it's French.  
MR. WEBSTER:
The publication is a Kinyarwanda publication.  It is a Kinyarwanda newspaper.  In the Kinyarwanda newspaper there is a duplication of a French language document; the document that interests us is in French but it is contained in a magazine that was published in Kinyarwanda.  So the first page of the magazine is entirely in Kinyarwanda; the second page of the magazine has a Kinyarwanda notation at the top. The document has been reproduced in its French text.  You can have the court officer show it to the Court and to the Defence, please.  

Would you also provide the cover page.    
MR. HOOPER:
Can this one be marked for identification to give us time to look at it because it's not all translated, for a start, and we are not sure - 

MR. PRESIDENT:
To identify where we are.  This document is marked 0013005. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the -- in your list, it's stated to be 3004.  Is it the same document?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We are referring to the same document.  What you have in your hands, Your Honour, is a (unintelligible), so it should be 3005.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the documents I have electronically as -- under 3004, is a Kinyarwanda document.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Hooper would be so kind to pass me back my original and I will have it handed back to the Court.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And Judge Hökborg does not seem to have it in her bundle.  
THE WITNESS:
This document -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Give them all back -- give them all back and let them identify what it is.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Give this to the Judge.  

Let me begin again, Your Honour, just to clarify matters for the record.  What interests the Prosecution and, I assume the Defence, is the document that is reproduced on the page identified by K0013005; that page is taken from a Kinyarwanda language publication.  You see at the top of the page words and paragraphs in Kinyarwanda language.  But on the second half of the page at the bottom is a reproduction of a French document and that French document is what interests us.  And it is entitled:  Protocol Additionel au protocol D'Entente entre les partis politiques qui participant au Gouvernement de Transition mis en place le 16 avril 1992.  

It's basically an additional protocol to the original protocol, and this particular protocol is signed on the 16th -- excuse me, on the 13th of April 1993.  It refers to the government that was put in place on the 16th of April 1992.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WESBTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What -- there's a problem that we are trying to address -- is this:  A bundle of -- was distributed to 
Judge Hökborg in her copy.  And this document does not seem to be in it.  Now, a bundle was distributed electronically to myself and to Judge Kam and this document does not seem to be in our electronic file.  And Mr. Hooper is saying that the bundle which was given to him doesn't contain this particular document.  That's where we are.  The question is:  Where is this document among the disclosures that were made to the Bench and to the Defence?  We have not been able to find it. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if it's not in the bundle you have physically received, apparently there is an error in reproduction and you do not have it.  But what the witness referred to and what he has and what he's handed up to the court officer is the document we would like to introduce. 

If the Court and the Defence is uncomfortable in moving forward with the introduction of that document now, we can revisit this issue on Wednesday.  But it doesn't seem -- my suggestion is it should not pose a problem.  In fact, it is not this document that is an issue in the case; it's the protocol that was signed in 1994.  We are producing for the Court and for the parties the previous protocols so that it can be considered in context.  The only thing that would be probative is the protocol that was signed in 1994.  But, we can address this on Wednesday.  We can provide the Court with the copies that were missing from your bundles.  But as a matter of law and to address the issue of admissibility, what the witness has handed up to the court officer and showed to the Defence should be sufficient for us to move and admit it into evidence.  But we can reserve until next week, if that's preferable.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't need to take up time.  I've got one document that's got number 6 on it -- publication number 6.  I have another document that has got a cut and paste at the top, number 41.  We don't quiet know what we're looking at.  Can we just leave this until Wednesday, as you suggested, we need it translated by someone.  
MR. WEBSTER:
That is fine.  Simply again, to clarify matters, this was a magazine and in order to provide whoever is looking at it with some context, we photocopied the front page of the magazine and then turned into the magazine, on the page that interests us in terms of its substance.  So we provided the copy of the magazine and the page that the document it appeared on.  Mr. Hooper can come and look at the original, if he cares to do so. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, we'll do that by Wednesday.  
MR. WEBSTER:
(Inaudible)

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, it's not a problem, you know.  The point is there is nothing -- no value in putting matters into evidence if we don't have access to be able to read it.  So it's really a question of an administrative arrangement to make it accessible to us and to the Defence counsel.  
MR. WEBSTER.
Can we move on to item 20C on our exhibit list; that also is entitled Protocole d'Entente entre les Partis Politiques appellé à Participer au Gouvernement de Transition; this item 20C is dated 7 April 1992.  This is the original protocol d'Entente.  
THE WITNESS:
	Item number 20C. (Microphone not activated)...
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
Witness's microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
9155 -- this item number 20C vide K0349188 to 9195 is in French language, and it's signed by different political leaders on the 7th of April 1992.  This document came into possession of ICTR in 2005, May when it was received by ICTR staff member -- from Philip Reyntjen in Belgium.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I request that it be moved into evidence.

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Your Honour.  The President's microphone, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

Has it been admitted now?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I requested that it be moved into evidence, Mr. Fry indicated that the number will be 12.  I requested that it be moved into evidence.  Mr. Fry indicated that the number would be P. 12.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I was wondering, Mr. Fry, was there -- did you have a particular sequence in mind?  So would it be in order, Mr. Fry, if we could reserve P. 12 for the other document and make this P. 13?  

MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  In that case, the exhibit -- it was 20E.  We'll reserve P. 12 for that document and 20C will be then P. 13.  
(Exhibit No. P. 13 admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And we move on to item 20 on the exhibit list.  It is a communiqué that was issued by the MRND, MDR, PSD and PL after their meeting on the 10th of April 1994.  Would you find that, Mr. Baghel and then identify it -- tell us where it came from?  
A.	This document vide item number 20, I got it from the evidence unit.  And this document is in French, vide K0196121 and it's English translation is K0248340 to 8341.  Date on the -- date on the document is mentioned as 10th April 1994.  There are no signatures on this document, but same contained -- but also, I've seen on the Radio Rwanda transcript, tape number 220, which is digitised by reference number KT000941.  And, the tape has already been transcribed into its original language Kinyarwanda and translated into French.  The same content of this document is in the tape.  
MR. WEBSTER:
With regard to the transcription of the audio recording, we'll deal with that on Wednesday.  It's in an item that is included on the CD-ROM of audio clips and we'll deal with the transcription and the translation on Wednesday when we address the CD-ROMs.  But it contains the same content.  Can I have this entered into evidence, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:

A.	This item, number 55, vide K0034182 to 4195 is in French language and the English translation is available, vide K0237414 to 7428.  This document was also noticed in the files which came from Belgium authorities to ICTR OTP.  And this copy, I got it from evidence unit.
MR. WEBSTER:  
I request that it be moved into evidence.  I believe the next number will be 15.  
MR. HOOPER:
If you could just give us one moment to catch up with you, it's gone astray here.  So -- can you just help us, Mr. -- sorry, Mr. Webster, which bundle that might be in?  In bundle 4?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Bundle 4.  
MR. HOOPER:
I think we go up to 3.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand that it's in bundle 4.  
MR. HOOPER:

Yes, thank you, we found it.  Mr. O'Shea had it.  
MR. O'SHEA:
What is the K-number, Mr. Webster?  
(Pages 1 to 14 by Jean Baigent)
























0945H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted as P. 15?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, because there's an English translation, it could be P. 15A for the French original and 
P. 15B for the English translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  P. 15A and P. 15B.  
(Exhibit No. P. 15A and P. 15B admitted) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, would you do that automatically for our future?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, no problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You will give the French translation as A and the English translation B.  If it's in Kinyarwanda, that would be C.
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item is number 27 on our exhibit list.  It's a letter written by Anatole Nsengiyumva.  It's dated the 14th of December 1993.  
A.	This item number 27, vide number L0010420 to 0423, this document is in French, and its English translation is available L0016447 to 6449 -- sorry, 6450.  This document came into possession of ICTR from the archives of Linda Melvern known as the Linda Melvern Rwanda genocide archive, and this document was received from that archive in ICTR evidence unit.  I got a copy from the evidence unit.  It's dated 14 December 1993 signed by Nsengiyumva, Anatole. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence, Registry?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour, as P. 16A and B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. P. 16A and P. 16B admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item I'd like us to address is item 28 on our witness list -- excuse me, on our exhibit list.  The original document bears the title (French spoken).  
A.	Document number 28, vide K0114151 to 4152 and English translation K0258856 to 8857.  The original document is in French, and this document, I got it from evidence unit, and the evidence unit received from ICTR investigator in 1999. 
MR. WEBSTER:
May we move this into evidence as P. 17, then?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence.
MR. WEBSTER:
The next item I'd like us to address is number 28A on our list.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we leave the last document, exhibit 28, page 2, in the original there's a day there that doesn't appear on the English translation.  Can the witness identify the date of the document, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Excuse me, can the registry give me the document?  

If I see on page 2 of the document in French, the date appears to me as 21/11/1999, and this is after the signature.  Is that so?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, that's what I see, too.  29th -- what is the origin -- what is the provenance of this document?  Because the others have been, to some extent, spoken for themselves, but this one doesn't. 
THE WITNESS:
This document, from the evidence unit, I tried to find out the origin of the document, and as per the records available in the evidence unit, this document was received in the evidence unit 20 November 1999.  And this document was handed over to one ICTR investigator by name Legros, Jack, who received the document in the interview of Ruggiu, Georges, on 21/11/1999. 
MR. HOOPER:
We object, then, to the admission of this document as an exhibit.  It appears to be no more than a -- than an unsworn recollection or statement of an unknown party, and we fear at this stage that there must be sufficient concerns about such a document for it not to fall within the general category of documents that we're looking at now.  I hadn't appreciated the date until I saw it in the original.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If there's an objection to this, my suggestion is that we put it aside.  When a witness is testifying, one of the factual witnesses or the expert, can lay additional foundation for the document and we can offer it into evidence at that time.  So the Court has the option of marking it for identification with the collection of civil defence documents or simply pushing it to the side, and we can deal with it at a later time.  I'm not going to argue in favour of the document at this point if the Defence is opposed to it, but it will reappear at some point during the trial, and at that point we can decide whether it should be admitted or not.  But my understanding is that it came from Georges Ruggiu, and he can explain its background.  And the expert is familiar with the document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The document is marked for identification. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we indicate what the number is for identification?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I would mark it as Exhibit IP.  3. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not admitted as an exhibit.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Mr. President. 
MR. FRY:
Identification.
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's not an -- it's not an exhibit as yet.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Its identification number is?  
MR. FRY:
Number 3, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
IP. 3.  Yes, thank you.  
(Exhibit No. IP. 3A and IP. 3B, for identification)

Can we move this document into evidence?  It will be P.  21.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence as P. 21. 
(Exhibit No. P. 21A and P. 21B admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next document that interests us is number 30 on our exhibit list.  It's entitled "Directives to all préfets asking for the restoration of security in the country."  It's signed by Prime Minister Kambanda on the 27th of April 1994.  We have it in the Kinyarwanda original with a French translation and an English translation. 

Mr. Baghel, can you tell us where this document originated?  
A.	Document number 30, this document was received from the Belgian authorities and it was among the files which were sent to OTP from Belgium.  There are multiple copies in the evidence unit for this document.  And its English translation and French, both are available.  French translation is vide K0033070 to 3073, and the English translation is K0033066 to 3069.  The Kinyarwanda one, which I have here, is vide K0314998 to 5001.  And I got this document from the evidence unit.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we move this in evidence as P. 22, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, just while we're on this.  Can you help me where the original in Kinyarwanda is on this document in the bundle?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry, could you repeat your question?  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm looking at exhibit 30, unless I've lagged behind, and I'm told there's an original in Kinyarwanda, but we don't have it.  Can we just make a note of that and pass on, but if we can be furnished with a copy of it, we'd be grateful.  Thank you.
MR. WEBSTER:
We'll do that this afternoon.  
THE WITNESS:
I have the original here, which is K0314998 to 5001, which is different from the list which is mentioned in this as K0200507 to 0510.  Because in the evidence unit we have multiple copies, and I found this document has come from the files which were received from Belgian authorities, Kinyarwanda one, which I have here.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we move on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But the witness was suggesting that if there's a problem finding the other Kinyarwandan copy -- I don't know if there's one -- but he is willing to tender in evidence the document that he has.  I don't know if that would solve the problem.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe the witness identified his document.  I don't recall the K number, but the one I have before me is a different K number.  It's the K number that's indicated on my list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But you have the original document?  
MR. WEBSTER:
They're all originals, Your Honour, but they come from several different sources.  The quality -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but -- but you have it?  The one that's being tendered in evidence -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- you have?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I personally do not have it in front of me.  The witness has it in front of him.  It's the exact same document, but it bears several different K numbers.  The quality of the reproduction differs, but the document is exactly the same.  We can put all of them before the Court, but the text is exactly the same.  It's just the quality of the -- of the reproduction that differs from one to the next.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have the original Kinyarwanda -- you have -- does the registry have the Kinyarwanda document?  I don't need to see it.  I just wonder if you have what's been tendered into evidence now.  I beg your pardon?  Yeah, I understand what the Defence said, but I did not understand whether there was being tendered into evidence the three documents, the Kinyarwanda, English, and French, or if you are tendering only the English and French. 
MR. WEBSTER:
We're tendering what the witness has put on the record.  He has the documents.  He's identified the English and the French translations and the Kinyarwanda original.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEBSTER:
He hands those documents to the court officer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's what I thought.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was what my question was originally.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was what my original question was.  So they're admitted into evidence under the P. 22 number.  
(Exhibit No. P. 22A, P. 22B and P. 22C admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next document that interests us is identified as item number 31 on our list.  It's the implementation of the prime minister's directives on the self-organisation of civilian defence.  

On our exhibit list for item number 31 there are actually two documents.  So I'm going to enter into -- I'm going to put them before the Court separately and give them separate numbers for our purposes today.  

The first document that we're going to look is signed -- or has the name of Faustin Munyaseza at the bottom of it.  It's not signed, but it bears his name.  And that document is identified in the French original on the first page K0043895.  And the corresponding English translation for that document begins at page number K0236134.  

So with respect to that document, Mr. Baghel, can you give us some background? 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, I've got lost on this one.  Which document are we looking at?  Is it number 31 on the list of exhibits?  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, it's number 31.  The text is essentially the same. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah. 
MR. WEBSTER:
One is unsigned and was issued under the name of Faustin Munyaseza, who was the minister of interior at the beginning of April.  And the other is signed.  Basically the text is the same, if not identical, but it is signed by Edouard Karemera.  So they're actually two separate documents.  They're both listed on the exhibit list, but one is distinguished from the other, but the contents is the same.  So I'm putting them into evidence as two separate documents.  The one that is unsigned issued under the name of Faustin Munyaseza is what we are discussing now, and then I'll move on to the document that was actually signed by Edouard Karemera.  
MR. HOOPER:
I've got English and French, French original and an English translation, but no names appear on either document on my exhibit 31 page 1 and page 3.  And it looks as if page 2 must be missing, in that case.  So could we have page 2, which I dare say has the other details on it.  And, indeed, I then go to P. 5.  So I'm missing page 2 and 4 of my exhibit 31 in the bundle.  
THE WITNESS:
This document which is listed in 31, and there are multiple copies -- and there are multiple copies in the evidence unit for this copy -- for this document.  The document which I have with me is in French vide K0008118 to 8119, which is signed by Karemera, Edouard, dated 25 May 1994, and its English translation vide K0033063 to 3065.  The document which is signed by Mr. Faustin -- not signed, name was there of Mr. Faustin, I don't have a copy now, but I remember I have seen the document earlier.  
MR. WEBSTER:
What I suggest, Your Honour, is that we simply address ourselves to the document that Mr. Baghel signed -- has identified signed Edouard Karemera, and we can come back to the unsigned document by Faustin Munyaseza at a later time if it's necessary to do so, but we can move ahead. 
MR. HOOPER:
It's page 2 and 4, I think, of our bundles that are missing, and if we could have those.  Someone make a note, 2 and 4.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Hökborg has the same problem that Mr. Hooper has spoken about.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In other words, a page of the document is missing from the bundle. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, yeah, from her bundle.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We can provide a copy.  What I suggest that we do is have the document that Mr. Baghel has presented to the Court and present it to the Defence, and they can examine it and we can move on, or we can put the issue aside until Wednesday.  It's at the discretion of the Court.  Our concern is the content of the document.  What I had mentioned earlier with an unsigned document, but we have several in the evidence unit.  The way our investigations proceed allows us to get several copies of the same document from time to time, and that's what happened in this case.  What interests us is the document that Mr. Baghel has just identified that ends with K number -- or begins on K number K0008118.  The court officer can take that document and show it to the parties and we can admit it, or we can hold off until Wednesday and present copies of all available documents and the Court can decide at that time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What I would suggest is that we admit the document on your undertaking to provide copies to -- additional copies for the Defence and to the Court. 
MR. WEBSTER:
So this would be P.  23. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you -- would that procedure be followed in both cases?  So one would be P. 23 and one would be P.  -- the document with Munyaseza's name would be P. 23, and the one signed by Karemera would be P. 24. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes. 
(Exhibit No. P. 23A and P. 23B admitted)
(Exhibit No. P. 24A and P. 24B admitted) 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Can we move on to item number 33 on our exhibit list, which is the diary of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  The spelling for Nyiramasuhuko is N-Y-I-R-A-M-A-S-U-H-U-K-O.  

Mr. Baghel, can you provide us with background information on the diary of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko?  
A.	It's item number 33, which is listed a diary of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.  This diary is in the evidence unit, and I got a copy of that diary from the evidence unit, vide K number K0043686 to 3686io.  This diary is handwritten, and this diary was seized when she was arrested and was a part of the seizures.  This diary has been analysed by André Guichaoua in Butare case, and I have gone through the contents of the diary.  There are few differences in the diaries where it is noted either MINIPRISEC or Rwamakuba.  When I was reviewing the diary, I found at least six references to the name Rwamakuba or as MINIPRISEC. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have this item admitted into evidence, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
Before we move on, would it be possible for the witness, having said he's identified that in this -- at a glance, difficult to read the document -- six references, can he specify how many to Rwamakuba and how many to MINIPRISEC, as far as he can recall?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can recall diary page number K0043686bt, which is 26 February, because I have a version which is more enlarged in the binder which has been put -- by photocopying it has been produce reduced.  So if I go -- 
MR. HOOPER:
We needn't go through them all because it will take some time, and I can ask you later, but can you just indicate how many of MINIPRISEC and how many of Rwamakuba.  Is it three and three?  What's the number?  And perhaps you could provide me with those helpful references at another time or after we rise today.  That would be very helpful.  Thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We can do that after the court session.  We'll direct you to the specific pages.  
THE WITNESS:
If Chamber allows, can I go?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Baghel, I think that it would be sufficient if you identified how many times the term MINIPRISEC was written and how many times Rwamakuba was written.  
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  Rwamakuba is mentioned as only once.  And MINIPRISEC is mentioned on four times, and once it is mentioned as minister of primary and secondary education.  So this make total times.  But I have found at least these six references.  My search may not be exhaustive.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we move this in evidence as P. 25?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, would this be an appropriate time to take a break?  

We could admit this document into evidence as P. 25. 
(Exhibit No. P. 25A, P. 25B and P. 25C admitted)  
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes.  It's at the Court's -- we only have four more items to go through, and that would be the conclusion of the direct examination.  We can continue and finish the admission of these four additional documents and then take cross-examination directly thereafter, or I can stop now, Your Honour.  It's at the Court's discretion. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  There's a problem with the sound which the English court reporters need to rectify, so I think it would be better to stop now. 
(Court recessed at 1030H)
(Pages 15 to 25 by Sherri Knox)


























(Court resumed at 1050H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, has the technical problem been resolved?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, we've managed to organise it so that it works for the time being.  We'll fix it for Monday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
All right.  Thank you, Your Honour.  I believe we left off with P. 25, which was the diary of            Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, and I believe it was already entered into evidence.  If that's the case, we'll move on to the next item which is number 33A on our exhibit list.  This is Andre Guichaoua's analysis  of Pauline Nyiramasuhuko's diary.  
THE WITNESS:
This item number, 33A, this is the analysis of Guichaoua, Andre, and he was expert witness in Butare case.  He analysed this diary extensively, and gave a report or a document to the evidence unit.  I got a copy from the evidence unit.  This analysis was done in the year 2004, last year, and this is vide K-number K0288029 to 8116.  Its English translation is vide K0291816 to 1911.  In his analysis, he has put some excerpts which are the translation of the diary.  Diary is written in Kinyarwanda or French or mixed language, and it has been translated so that one can read and which is an excerpt of this report.  By looking at an excerpt of the report, there are sentences in the diary to Rwamakuba or his ministry, MINIPRISEC.  All those are there in this also.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we move this into evidence as P. 26, please?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence is P. 26.
(Exhibit No. P. 26A and P. 26B admitted)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	The next item I'd like us to look at is identified as 33B on our exhibit list.  It's the diary of                   Jean Kambanda.  We have a copy of the original.  There are no translations or analysis for this diary.  It's identified as KA000209 
A.	This item vide 33B, and reference number in the evidence unit is KA000209.  It's the diary.  On the top is written like "agenda 1994 Banque de Kigali" and it's by the date.  The original diary was seized when Mr. Kambanda was arrested, and it's a part of the seizures of Kambanda.  The copies -- the diary is available in the evidence unit, and the copy of which I got it from evidence unit.  This is in Kinyarwanda in the handwriting -- handwritten notes.  

I have seen the diary.  I perused and tried to find out if I can make out the meaning of few words.  I found the reference to MINIPRISEC in the diary at least two times, which on a page of the diary which is mentioned at 13th April where it is noted MINIPRISEC twice on the same page.
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.  We'll move this in evidence as P. 27, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  Can we have a hold on this one?  Can we deal with this on Wednesday?  I haven't seen an English translation of this.  Is there -- I don't know.  Is there one?  
MR. WEBSTER:
We have no translation or analysis of this.  We're looking at the original. 
MR. HOOPER:
So I'm being asked to admit into evidence a document in a language which I don't understand, and I don't feel I can do that until -- at least until I've seen what its contents are.  So can we leave this until Wednesday?  I don't -- maybe the witness speaks Kinyarwanda or maybe he scanned it for the word "MINIPRISEC" which I think is the position.  So it's not a Kinyarwanda investigator here or Kinyarwanda-speaking investigator there.  So I'm not in a position even to examine it as to context or the rest or it.  I'm not surprised a government department is mentioned in this diary, but if the whole diary goes in, I've got no idea what else is going in with it and what its relevance is.  So perhaps we can put that on hold, and it's a matter that we can look at and deal with on Wednesday.  Having said that, I don't know how we will be able to translate it or be in a better position than we are today, and maybe we'll have to delay the Kambanda diary to a later time when we've had an opportunity for someone to look at it and read it.  Appreciate also my current difficulty that I can't necessarily hand it to                 Dr. Rwamakuba who may, in fact, be willing to read it.  Although, again, he may not.  I don't know.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the -- what did you say was the reference, the K-number for this document?  
MR. WEBSTER:
The reference number is KA000209.  It only has one reference number.  The KA is an indication that it's a seizure -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
My electronic document under that title, it comes under (inaudible) sheet, and it's just one page which has on it "description of item, Agenda 1994 Kambanda."  I don't have the diary.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If it's not on the electronic -- that may be an indication from the evidence where we have a page in the (unintelligible) that identifies a physical object that has not been scanned in.  And that may be the case with this, but hard copies were provided in -- printed-out copies were provided in the bundle that was provided to the parties and to the Defence and to the Court in hard copy.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Judge Hökborg has a copy, but it's not readable.  
MR. WEBSTER:
We can leave this until a later time, Your Honour, and we'll provide a better quality reproduction, but that is all we have at this time.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So in light of Mr. Hooper's objection to this particular item, we'll move on.  I don't think his -- his concerns will be addressed by Wednesday.  We can address it at a later point in the trial if we need to.  

I'd like to address our attention to the last series of documents.  It begins at item number 62.  It's a  copy of a newspaper article that was -- that was published in the Atlanta Journal and Constitution on the 25th of April 1994.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, if you could turn your attention to that item.  
A.	This item number 62, which I got it from the evidence unit, vide K0018569 to 8571.  This is a part of a publication on (unintelligible) material by a group, LexisNexis, and this is dated April 25, 1994.  It's in English.  The title is Atlanta Constitution -- the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.  In the contents, it refers to Butare town and Butare Hospital.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have this moved into evidence, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
Can we ask, please, that these foreign media reports be deferred until Wednesday?  
MR. WEBSTER:
If we could know the nature of your -- the Defence objection, perhaps we could address it now or be able to resolve it by Wednesday.  What -- what is the concern with this particular item?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, essentially, I mean, it's very helpful having these bundles, but they've come at the last moment.  And so amongst the five or six gigabytes of material that we've had, we're only now focusing on particular issues.  And there's an issue here both as to relevance and -- and appropriate weight or admissibiIity, and we'd like to consider it at a little more length than we have before we do not stand in the way or stand in the way of its admissibility as an exhibit.  This again falls into a different category of evidence -- to the evidence that we've been seeing so far, and we'd like to review it.  

I mean, we assume it's being tendered in some way to represent the truth of its contents, so we're concerned as to the extent to which that can be claimed.  But perhaps we can better formulate our arguments on Wednesday.  We may not stand in the way of this document on Wednesday, but we just want to have time to think about our position.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll rely on the Court's discretion.  I think we're prepared to argue the issue now, but if Wednesday is a more convenient time, I'll rely on the Court's instruction.  But there are three other additional items that fall into the same category, which are journalistic reports on events, that were contemporaneously generated.  So for the most part, these are documents from 1994.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, in a theoretical sense, your concern about time for consideration would be something to which the Court is sympathetic, but why would time be an issue now?  I mean, this matter -- hasn't this information been in your possession for a very long time?  
MR. HOOPER:
I haven't seen this report or the next one, no. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone for Counsel, please.  
MR. HOOPER:
I haven't read this report or the next one.  I'm not saying it's not necessarily amongst contents of documents, but I've received five or six gigabytes of documents, and I haven't had -- I can't remember reading this article or the next one.  It doesn't come to mind.  Let me put it like that.  

And so I'm really, as I turn this page, I'm looking at this, I think, for the first time.  And I'm supported -- I support myself in my own mind as to that because there are names mentioned here.  Normally one would look at a name, for example, the name of someone in the Red Cross and think, "Well, there's a potential witness we could go and contact or see," and these are not names I've noticed.  

There may be as well a basis for legal objection to newspaper reports, and we'd also need to better appreciate perhaps the reason that those particular documents are being put forward.  Well, we understand they're being put forward for the truth of the contents.  Otherwise, I don't see that they'd be relevant.  

And there's an Amnesty International report which is a summary of a 15-page document, and I don't think I've seen the 15-page document from which it's extracted, except that then follows, as I'm on my feet, I see the -- what I take to be the continued document in full.  And, again, I'd say this, that maybe we won't stand in the way of this, but can we just have an opportunity to draw back and consider our position?  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I may comment, once again, I would rely on the Court's discretion, but I'd just like to note that these items were listed on an exhibit list that was filed on the 23rd of May.  So from the 23rd of May, the Defence has been on notice of everything that we wanted to introduce today.  We had a status conference last week, and I thought that the purpose of that status conference was to address issues like this.  So had it been an issue, the receipt of these particular reports or the legibility of these reports, my understanding was that was the type of thing we were going to address during the status conference.  We are prepared to address this on Wednesday.  I rely on the Court's discretion, but we see no -- we see no problem with going forward.  

Twice earlier this week by e-mail I contacted the Defence with a list of things that I specifically wanted to introduce through this witness, to ask their consent or to get some sense of whether they had objections or not.  And I think I did the same thing when I started yesterday morning.  So I'm simply clarifying that all the parties have been on notice of what we wanted to introduce in evidence.  And we can put this off until Wednesday, but it's also something that can be addressed right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would suggest that we follow the procedures we'd agreed on or as we discussed yesterday, that you lay the foundation for them through Mr. Baghel's evidence now, and the legal issue as to admissibility we will discuss on Wednesday.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe we've completed number 62, which I take now will be marked for identification as ID. 4 (sic).
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEBSTER:
And let's continue to number 63 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
IP. 4. 
(Exhibit No. IP. 4, for identification)
MR. WEBSTER:
IP. 4.  
THE WITNESS:
The item number 63, vide K0032381 to 2383, this I got it from the evidence unit, and I learned           that evidence unit received this document among many documents which were received from            US Department of State.  This is also one of the newspaper clipping or publication, referring to         New York Times company in which it is mentioned that on a particular day massacres took place in Butare Hospital.  
MR. WEBSTER:
So can we have this marked for identification as IP. 5 and move on to the next item which is item number 64 on our exhibit list, the Amnesty International report. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification IP. 5. 
(Exhibit No. IP. 5, for identification) 
THE WITNESS:
This item number 64, which is the Amnesty International report, vide K0019357 to 9373, the copy of this report I got from the evidence unit.  It's in English, and the evidence unit received from -- from sources and from the investigation where all these documents were collected from different sources like publications, burnt media and magazines.  In this report also, on page 10, there's a reference to    Butare Hospital and MSF.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we identify this as IP. 6 and then move on to the last journalistic item which is number 65 on our list. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification IP. 6.  
	(Exhibit No. IP. 6, for identification)
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Number 65 is a publication from Doctors Without Borders.  Mr. Baghel, can you give us some background information on that document, please.  
A.	This document which is in item number 65, vide K0003483 to 3540.  A copy of this I received from the evidence unit.  And when I see the document, this is -- this document was prepared in July 1994, by MSF, title, "Genocide in Rwanda, Witness Accounts."  This is in French.  There's no English translation available till now.  In the report on page 37, there's a reference to Butare Hôpital (unintelligible) and page 39 to Butare le Hôpital.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we have this marked for identification as IP. 7?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification IP. 7. 
(Exhibit No. IP. 7, for identification)
BY MR. WEBSTER.
Q.	The last among the documents that I'd like us to look at is number 17 on our list of exhibits, samples of a Rwandan identity card.  This was previously an exhibit in the Akayesu trial.  Mr. Baghel, can you give us any other background information concerning this document?  
A.	This document, item number 71, vide K1019871 to 9875, the copy of it I got from the evidence unit, and I found that this document was used during the -- during the ICTR trial.  The trial prosecutor works as Akayesu -- known as Akayesu case, and this was exhibit number 8, which are produced in the court on     10 January 1997, by Witness pseudonym K.  

And when I see the document, this is in Kinyarwanda and French.  On the last page is typewritten separately to understand each column of the identity cards.  The names and details to which the identity card belong -- to whom this identity card belong, have been suppressed by black ink.  So from this sample, only we can know what are the columns in the identity card which the -- which people used to have in 1994 in Rwanda -- names, secteur, commune, ethnic background, date of birth, names of children and other personal details.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Can we move this into evidence as P. 27?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted in evidence is P. 27.  
(Exhibit No. P. 27 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
That concludes my presentation of evidence for this witness.  We've admitted the documents that -- or I've placed before the Court the documents that we're trying to admit.  I assume that we'll take up the arguments on Wednesday, and I'll -- I conclude here.  Perhaps we can pass to cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Webster.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Baghel, I'm not going to ask you many questions about the last matters that we've been dealt with because we'll be dealing with that on Wednesday if we deal with it at all.  Just some passing matters.  First of all, in respect of the passport, were there any entry or exit stamps on that passport that you examined?  
A.	The passport copy which has been tendered here, I've not examined the whole passport as I have gone through the content which is produced here only. 
(Pages 26 to 32 by Wendy Molnar)












1120H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	It is our Number 16 in the bundle.  It is now P. 4, P. 3, was it? 
MR. HOOPER: 
Excuse me, one moment. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I wasn't clear what was produced on that exhibit.  Was it the passport itself? 
A.	This is the copy of the INT card as mentioned in this thing, identity card. 
Q.	I think page 1 is the passport, is it not? 
A.	The reference number which is K0110687. 
Q.	I'm just unclear what is being produced.  Is it an identity card that's being produced or is it a passport? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Maybe I can be of some assistance.  On our exhibit list, I believe the caption is -- on the original exhibit list -- it is actually a page that was copied from the passport and that is all we have in our evidence unit.  We do not have Mr. Rwamakuba's passport, but in the course of our investigations, I believe it was from the Belgium -- I don't know exactly where, we would have to go back into Mr. Baghel's testimony, but all we have is the page that was reproduced and provided to the Defence and to the Court.  So, it is a page from the passport. 
BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Very well.  But I understand on Dr. Rwamakuba's arrest he had two or three passports, current and extended, UN passport, a passport to be provided for anyone who is representing their country abroad, for example, that kind of passport; the family passport, with pictures of children on it.  Have you ever seen anything like that?  
A.	No, I have not seen during my investigation. 
Q.	And I think those are currently in possession of the commandant of the UNDF here, you are not aware of that? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Very well.  The document P. 5 at 22, which is being produced, page 3 of the list, are you familiar with that document?  It was produced this morning, and again, I'm not going to go through all of these documents, just touching on this while we have it in mind.   In our list it is headed, "Interahamwes on Muvum (phonetic) - Muvuma (phonetic) or the MRND party hardliners attempts to root out the evil, working document, MDR steering committee 14th of May 1992; was the author of that Anathase Gasana? 
A.	Yeah, when you read the whole document, the author seems to be Anathase Gasana. 
Q.	And just to encapsulate it, what it is about is a concern, a deep concern expressed by MDR politician about the MRND`s youth wing, the Interahamwe.  Does that fairly encapsulate, having read the document, basically, what that document is about? 
A.	As well as I can recall, because I have gone through the document a few times, his concerns were about the MRND hardliners and MDR party hardliners also. 
Q.	MRND hardliners? 
A.	Yes, like when the caption says, "Interahamwe on Muvum (phonetic), Interahamwe was an organisation of MRND, the youth wing. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	But in the document he expresses that MDR -- certain fractions of MDR is also going into that direction. 
Q.	All right.  Well, we will have to look at that document in a bit more detail in due course.  There is a document at 24, P. 6, just so at this stage, very briefly, a birds-eye view, really, of the road ahead.  We have a document there that is dealing with the political divisions within the MDR party, is that right, as of July of 1993, the end of July '93; is that correct? 
A.	This document, Item 23 --  
Q.	24.  
A.	Sorry, 24 which is in French; and this document is linked to document Number 21 or 24A, because all of these documents are about the same extraordinary national congress by MDR party on 23 or 24 July 1993. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	The contents of the documents I have not analysed in detail, but I have seen a few things, like            Dr.  André Rwamakuba was present in this meeting.  And then I tried to find the name of Anathase Gasana in a list -- in the list of members, but I could not find his name. 
Q.	But it is like, from what you've seen, the end of that meeting, the meeting endorsed a firm intention to embrace the Arusha Accords; is that correct? 
A.	I cannot comment on the conclusion of the meeting because I have not analysed the meeting content, what was discussed in detail, and why a conclusion came in that context or in other context. 
Q.	All right.  The government documents, or the -- the documents that relate to the formation of the government, meetings that were held prior to the swearing in of the government, is it right that there is no documentary evidence, or any document that indicates that André Rwamakuba in any way participated in the setting up of that government prior to his swearing in as a minister on the 9th of April? 
A.	I do not know about -- 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, if I may interrupt.  I mean I appreciate that during the course of this trial we are going to have to go into all of these areas, but this is not an appropriate line of questioning for this witness.  He was brought to Court to introduce the documents; we have not addressed the contents of the documents with this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, I think your comment is premature.  The witness is answering the question. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Sorry, Mr. Baghel, if you still have your train of thought? 
A.	I do not know about this fact as on this question, I have not investigated the matter in detail.  This has not been raised to me as part of the investigation. 
Q.	Very well.  The MFS reports, which have been identified but not yet exhibited, contain a sequence of statements relating to events in Rwanda in April of 1994.  Do you know how long those statements have been available to the Prosecutor? 
A.	In this respect, whether the statements or the report of MSF, because here I produced the report from MFS, not the statements.  And I have not searched whether the statements are available with the evidence unit which were made, reportedly, to MFS or not. 
Q.	You don't know where they have come from? 
A.	The MFS report, I can comment on that, but not the statements.  And these are the part of the MFS report which are sent here. 
Q.	All right.  
A.	So, these are not signed, so cannot be called a statement, it is a part his MFS report. 
Q.	All right. 
A.	And it came as a part as -- in ICTR and OTP we keep collecting documents from different sources, including publications, newspapers or any kind of report.  So this report also has come from one of the source. 
Q.	A document that you haven't produced that I want to ask you if you have any awareness of it, have you in your examination of material ever come across a statement or telegram made by the then director of Butare hospital, Dr. Jotham, who appears on the list, J-O-T-H-A-M, denying that there had been a massacre at the hospital?  Have you come across such a document? 
A.	I have not come across such a document so I do not know whether this document existed in the evidence unit or not. 
Q.	I should stress, perhaps, falsely denying that a massacre had occurred; but you don't know of it.  But can I come -- leave the documents, please, and go to the hospital.  And can we turn, please, to your very helpful diagrams and sketches that you have prepared.  And I will go through it, but I doubt I'll - 
MR. HOOPER:
	I certainly won't be able to finish this witness by 12 o'clock.  I doubt if I can finish this witness by            1 o'clock, but perhaps.  But I will -- I'll just mention that I have quite a number of questions to put to him.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Very well. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Dealing with Butare hospital, going back to your evidence just very generally on that.  The hospital sketches that appear at page 61 in the final clippings of your indexed portfolio of photographs and maps, has at page 47, bottom right-hand corner, the layout of the hospital as was indicated to you when you went there in 2003.  And you have confirmed, I think, already that those buildings represented in your plan, and their function.  The function was indicated to you by a member of the administration of the hospital.  And that all of the references we have, are references to the hospital's functions in April -- excuse me, April of 1994; is that correct? 
A.	On this issue because the staff of the administration that was with me, and he identified those buildings or blocks about their functions.  I did not ask him specifically what was the function in 1994 of a particular building.  So at that moment, my understanding was that he might be referencing the functions of those buildings in 2003 when I was there.  I recall that I asked him, which building was not existing in 1994.  For that, he referred one building, which is Number 13, and told that that building was constructed in 1999. 
Q.	Yes.  That is only a new building, isn't it, Number 13?  We can put a cross through that.  And the rest of the functions, I hoped, related to 1994; but we don't know from what you are saying, probably, but we don't know.  
A.	Personally, I do not know, but probably the functions would have been the same. 
Q.	The hospitalisation wards that appear there, do you know if they were gender assigned, were they separate men's and women's wards; and do you know where they were? 
A.	I do not know about this fact.  And I think I referred in my testimony that I did not enter at that moment in any of the buildings inside. 
Q.	Did you ever enter into any of the buildings inside? 
A.	In the complex, I did not enter any of the buildings except building Number 1, administrative block where I met this person who had bid me, and I met the administration, other officials. 
Q.	Have any of your colleagues, to your knowledge, been inside of these buildings and would be in a position to help us as to a particular building? 
A.	I do not know because in investigations, different investigators keep traveling in connection with the files assigned to them, so I do not know if any of them have been inside of the buildings. 
Q.	Would you have access, for instance, to any matrix or database of collected and collated information in respect to any of this evidence? 
A.	Yes, it can be done if it's in the reports of those investigators, somebody in the investigation management. 
Q.	The hospital is -- was then the national teaching hospital for Rwanda; is that correct, in 1994?
A.	I do not know about this fact, but if can you rephrase the question like, national teaching.
Q.	It was the national hospital, the national referral hospital and teaching hospital for Rwanda? 
A.	I do not know whether this was the hospital, but I heard that in Rwanda the best hospital was this hospital. 
Q.	Very well.  It is fairly small, nevertheless, with about, what, 350 beds? 
A.	I do not know the number of beds in the hospital and I did not inquire also. 
Q.	All right.  Can I ask you -- well maybe from your answers you are not going to be able to take me further on this, but if we look at the photograph of the maternity block, which is on our page 54 of your bundle, showing the back of the maternity block, back in the sense that the front is -- if you go into the front of the hospital and walk down the corridor, you come to the front of the maternity, this is the other side, the backside of the maternity block.  You have taken a photograph of that as we can see.  But you can't help me as to what goes on inside of there.  We know it is maternity, you can't help me as to whether there is a basement there or not? 
A.	At that moment, I did not enter into the building, maternity. 
Q.	Very well.  
A.	So I cannot say whether the basement is there or not.  But if you see the photographs, photograph Number 8 on page Number 54, you can see there are windows at the bottom also, but I do not know whether these are for basement or for the same floor. 
Q.	Yes, but if you look at the windows on the first floor, or in French the second floor, they have got those apertures too, don't they? 
A.	Yes, on both floors, seems to be similar types of windows. 
Q.	Well, maybe they are not windows, but this is a building built on split level, is it not; so that if you enter at the front you then have to descend a ramp or stairs to get to the floor below from which you step out on to the ground of the back of the maternity wing; do you follow what I am trying to put forth? 
A.	Yes, I could make out something like that because the whole complex ground is not level, it is a little bit unevenness, but I'm not sure how much is split in this building. 
Q.	Very well.  Looking at your sketch at page 47, you had indicated to the mass grave, bottom right, and you were told that it had been investigated and some 40 skulls had been recovered from it; is that right? 
A.	About this information, around 40 skulls.  Again, I am basing my information which I received from the officer of the hospital who was with me at that time. 
Q.	Have you sought any exhumation report dealing with any mass grave at or near the hospital? 
A.	I did not ask specifically at that time.  And I suppose that some kind of reports should have been there, either in the administration or at some other place. 
Q.	All right.  Was any other burial or mass grave site indicated to you by that person who was helping you that day? 
A.	He did not indicate any other place and, if I remember correctly, I did not ask whether any other burial place was there in or around the complex except this place. 
Q.	With reference to your sketch, at the bottom we have the parking area, and we have seen from the photographs and video that if you are standing on the arrow there that is indicating, facing the direction of the arrow that is indicated, you will be looking, of course, at the administration block.  And in that position behind you runs a road back along the crest of that ridge towards Butare town; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And going along that road, not very many hundreds of metres, you come to the entrance to the Ecole des Sous Officiers, ESO; is that right? 
A.	Yes, if you go from there towards Butare town, the parking area, maybe 50 metres or even less, that comes. 
Q.	So that mass grave that we can see is really just outside of the perimeters, not only of the hospital but of the ESO as well? 
A.	I do not know to what point the premises of hospital continues, but if you take some of the houses of the hospital complex -- were located a little beyond the mass grave location -- supposed to be mass grave location.  So I cannot comment whether this location will come in ESO compound or hospital compound. 
Q.	Yes, yes.  I'm not suggesting that it is in either, but it is close to both? 
A.	I recall it is close to both, but it is more close to the hospital, because when I take photographs from the road to the mass grave location, the ESO buildings have not come in the photographs.  So this location is more close to the hospital. 
Q.	In your research, you have produced now various documents from various sources relating to -- that refer to killings at the hospital; is that right, is that correct?  You have looked into that, you have looked into what is available to you to bring to this case; is that correct? 
A.	Yeah, that is correct.  I have done some research or searched to find those secondary documents. 
Q.	And is it right that in none of these secondary documents is it suggested that André Rwamakuba participated in killings at the hospital? 
A.	In these secondary documents, I did not see his name, the documents which I have gone through and which I could understand.  
Q.	Now, in your photograph -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone please, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry.  Thank you. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your photographs, you have produced an additional document to explain their position, and I better take this up with you now or I may be criticised for not doing it later, but I suggest that maybe some of the positions you have shown are not strictly right.  I tried to draw your attention to one yesterday through Mr. Webster; I don't know if you have had a chance to deal with it.  If we look at your sketch of photographed positions, for photograph 4 you indicated a position by the administration block as the camera position, looking down towards maternity, whereas I suggest, and I would like your corroboration, that that in fact -- would that, in fact, be a photograph taken rather from position 5, looking up with the open space on the cameraman's right, where the trees are?  And I appreciate you haven't been to the hospital for two years and you are having to think back, but it seems more consistent, does it not, with position 5 or that way pointing the other way, then pointing down the corridor? 
A.	The locations in that scene may be differing a little bit but this photograph Number 4 was taken with the intention to show the corridor.  And I went to hospital around two years back, so I cannot place exactly the location of --  the location from where this photograph was taken.  If you take photograph from location 5 in the corridor, the photograph will be similar. 
Q.	Yes.  
A.	So I might have taken this photograph from Number 5 or from Number 4 for direction in the corridor.  "it looks like a corridor which is covered and goes straight connecting building Number 1 to building Number 12. 
Q.	Thank you for that, and I'm not going to take you through ponderously, but I also have made some observations, similar observations to photograph position 6, and photograph position 8, but I think that is self-evident when we look at the photograph and compare it to the position.  It is not quite exactly the position that you were in.  And I'm not going to dwell on that, I don't think it needs that.  

Now, we saw clippings from a CD of a hospital and the voice-over and had it translation of Mr. Guy Foy (phonetic) who referred to Burundians being in a particular area, the open area by -- between surgery and pediatrics.  And stating that they, the Burundians, had been trained by soldiers and had participated in killings.  Do you have access to any other information about that that you can help me with?  Do you have access to statements relating to that, for example, or anything like that?  
A.	I also saw in the video clipping, but I did not attempt to search the related other documents, if they are there, or any statements which are there. 
Q.	Can I come to distances.  You told us that for you to travel from Kigali to Butare it takes you two hours.  And to go from Kigali to Gitarama takes you 45 minutes, and following that is an hour and a quarter from Gitarama to Butare.  But this is in, presumably, a United Nations, four wheel jeep vehicle; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that is right because we have been traveling in those vehicles, and I covered those places by those vehicles.  But at a normal speed, it takes about two hours, a few minutes this way or that way. 
Q.	And those main roads in Rwanda are very good roads; aren't they? 
A.	Yes, they are good roads.  I have seen them. 
Q.	Their basic road structure was very good? 
A.	Yes, the main roads on which I traveled the roads are good, but it cannot be called an infrastructure.  The roads from Kigali to Butare are good, but I don't know about other places if you turn on those places outside of the infrastructure you -- 
Q.	Well, I'm just talking about direct roads.  If you go off of those roads it is a different thing entirely, isn't it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, that is two hours in good conditions, but it doesn't, obviously, taking into account driving along a road with what might be hundreds of thousands of refugees, killings, roadblocks and a war situation?  For example, can you help us, in '94 how many barriers there were, say, between central Kigali and Butare; how many roadblocks or barriers or checkpoints that one would have had to have passed through; is there any record of that? 
A.	I don't know this fact of how many barriers were there on the road from Kigali to Butare in 1994. 
Q.	But the United Nations was there in the form of UNAMIR, wouldn't there be appropriate records of that kind of information, and possible access to that kind of information? 
A.	I do not know if there is any record for that or not.  It is maybe some speculation or something, I do not know in that respect. 
Q.	I'm going to move to -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Counsel.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm going to move to Gikomero and I see the time.  
MR. HOOPER:
I can carry on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We did intend to stop at 12 noon, which it is now. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So if this is an appropriate break, we can take the adjournment now. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Can I just ask one brief series of question, without getting everyone fussed (phonetic) with me, and it will be a few questions.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just tell me this, Mr. Baghel, on this team, how many investigators -- let me rephrase the question.  How many United Nations investigators are there on the Karemera case, of which this is a schism, how many? 
A.	About this question, it would not be appropriate for me because I am not a part of investigation management, and second thing I can tell only on the basis of my experience, investigators are allotted to the teams.  But depending on the work, this is very flexible, assignment to assignment, specific request to request.  They can go from one case to another case also.  So, it is not a question of how many investigators are fixed to a case at a certain time.  So, it is for the investigation management to decide on the priority and required time frames. 
Q.	Well, you joined that investigatory side just three or four years ago, but the investigation has been going on since 1996, has it not? 
A.	I joined ICTR in February 2005, and I can comment only after that, that yes, investigation is going on, but it again depends on which case, which target, which team, which investigators.  It is for investigation management to decide. 
Q.	Well, you said 2005, I think that was a slip of the tongue.  We can see from your CV --  
A.	Sorry, year 2000. 
Q.	2000.  Let me ask you this, as an investigator do you -- or does one as an investigator investigating the case, do you go and look for the bone, as it were, or do you just go and fetch the bone?  If one shall  say, "Go and see Witness X," you go and see Witness X, or do you go out and look for witnesses -- let me ask you that.  How does it function? 
A.	The functions of both ways, it is the collected effort by the team or by the whole investigation.  If there is no witness on the file or the issue is such we don't have any clue or any kind of source, then we go and search for the witness.  If the witness is already located, searched by different team or accessed -- otherwise any kind of information then we go to search for particular Witness X.  So it is both ways. 
Q.	Now in Gikomero, there was another investigation to which you were part, the Kamahanda case, for example, is that right? 
A.	Yes, in that case I was also associated for the part of the case. 
Q.	Has there been any other case concerning Gikomero that you have been assigned to as an investigator, exploring facts in that relatively narrow region? 
A.	I did not deal any target of Gikomero, except Kamuhanda and part of Rwamakuba.  But if any target from Gikomero, maybe some of the members of investigations may be dealing, but no other target was assigned either in full or in part to me. 
Q.	You have referred to the Butare case, which is another case ongoing in this Tribunal at the moment, a substantial case that has been going in trial now for a year or so; also you have referred to it as the Muvunyi -- also you referred to the Muvunyi case which is a Butare-centered case.  Have you had any direct dealings with the investigations in respect to either one of those trials? 
A.	With respect to case -- Butare case or Muvunyi case, I did not have any direct dealings with that case; but in some parts, maybe a small fraction, I may have accompanied with some investigators, because this is decided by management that if sufficient investigator is not in that team they can ask any other person to accompany.  But I did not have direct dealings -- having had the case file or all the access to all of the documents. 
Q.	But both of those cases concern events at the Butare hospital in the exact week that we are dealing with in this trial; is that right? 
A.	No, I do not know about the case, of Butare case or Muvunyi case, about the facts in those cases and I have not gone through them.  So I cannot comment on this.   
Q.	So, as an investigator in this case concerned with Butare hospital, you have never investigated the many statements that had been made in either the Butare or the Muvunyi case concerning events at the hospital; is that your position? 
A.	Yes, I have not reviewed those files and I was not asked to do also, so I cannot comment on these things.  My part, only specific piecemeal approach, which was given to me as a specific assignment to assignment. 
Q.	So you can't confirm that André Rwamakuba's name doesn't feature in those statements, in the many statements taken in those cases? 
A.	I do not know whether his name is there in those statements or not, and which statements are being used in those times. 
Q.	Would it be possible by Monday, when I think you will now be coming back, to be able to provide me with a list of investigators that have investigated the Butare hospital killings?  
A.	I do not know whether it is an appropriate request to make, which is made by the honourable Defence to me to provide the name of the investigators.  I think this is the management issue.  The Honourable Chamber may decide about this issue with investigation management, or the OTP management. 
Q.	But it seems from what you have said that the only act of investigation that you have done in this case is to go to the hospital, but not enter any of the rooms in 2003 to take some photographs.  Is that it; is that the investigation level of this case? 
A.	I have done personally the investigation in which I was involved about, taken the photographs of this hospital in 2003.  And in that mission I reconciled a few statements from Butare.  That was my role at that time concerning Butare hospital. 
Q.	But doesn't an investigator necessarily have to look at both sides, both the good side and the bad side of a case?  Doesn't the investigator have to make avail himself of all of the sources of evidence that might sustain a Prosecution or assist the Defence?  Have you done none of that?   
A.	I just mentioned earlier that investigation is a  collective approach, so if I'm assigned at this case, or the Rwamakuba case for the last one year or two years, that does not mean that any other person has not worked on the file, or is not allotted by the investigation management to decide.  So, it is not like one person doing everything in the case. 
Q.	Yes.  But Mr. Baghel, I understand that and I'm suggesting that it seems from what you have told us, that you have played a very small part in this investigation from what you have told us.  And I want to question an investigator who knows something about the case, you see.  Now, can you provide me, please, through your investigation management, can you ask your investigation management to perhaps assist me, and perhaps the Chamber, with a list of those investigators who have been working on the Butare hospital case, not necessarily André Rwamakuba, but who have, in fact, investigated witnesses, facts, statements, reports exhumations, photographs, the history of events that we are concerned with in this trial between the 20th of April and the 30th of April 1994.  Is it possible for you to provide a list of what has gone on and who has done it? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, if I may, I will object to that question.  This is not a line of questioning -- or the Prosecution's submission is that this is not an appropriate line of questioning for this witness.  This witness was introduced simply to put before the Court certain exhibits.  It is not an opportunity for the Defence to conduct its Defence.  In fact, some of these same questions Mr. Hooper raised in motions or in requests for information that were directed to the Prosecutor years ago and we have addressed these and we have refused to provide certain information at times.  And that our refusal has been supported by Trial Chamber rulings on requests for discovery.  So it is not appropriate at this time to go into this matter with this witness.  He is not here to represent the entire investigative apparatus in our office and the history of investigations with respect to this case.  I made it quite explicit when I introduced him yesterday that his role here was simply to produce photos and documents.  So the   cross-examination should be confined to that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the photographs that he introduced about the buildings on Butare hospital, he has been unable to supply information about those buildings.  He said he has never gone inside of them.  And simple questions that are asked which would be necessary to explain the photographs, he cannot do it.  I don't see -- if he can't give information of that nature and somebody else has information which would necessarily support the photographs he has put into evidence, I think it is reasonable that the information should be available.  I -- you know, his inability to give supportive information is what prompted the question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the witness is being introduced to put in evidence the photographs.  The photographs speak for themselves.  The interior of the buildings are not an issue for the entire hospital; they are an issue for the corner of the building that will figure in the witness testimony in this trial.  And those witnesses can describe the interior of the building and so on and so forth.  But this witness and all of the video tapes and photographs that were shown were simply to give the Court an idea of what the entire hospital grounds looked like.  The entire hospital is not an issue in the case, and that will come to light through the testimony of the witnesses.  

But the photographs themselves speak for themselves.  If we have no photographs of the interior of the wards, it is because it was not an issue for the witnesses that will testify.  The photographs are simply an aid to the Court.  It is not an entrée to the entire history of investigations of the case.  The investigation is not at issue through  this witness.  
(Pages 33 to 43 by Donna M. Lewis)







1220H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, your few questions have made us go much longer than we intended to, so I don't think we're going to take a decision on this matter now.  We will take an adjournment until -- until Monday morning.  

But before doing that, Mr. Webster, I would just like a clarification of what you're -- of what you're saying.  Are you saying that as a matter of law it is inappropriate to ask an investigator the names of the other investigators on his team?  
MR. WEBSTER:
No, Your Honour, I'm not saying that Mr. Baghel should not mention the names of the other persons that he has been working with, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphones overlapping)...
MR. WEBSTER:
-- I'm suggesting it's inappropriate for Mr. Hooper to ask him how many investigators have been on this case for how long and so on and so forth because that's putting the entire investigation on trial, and it's not the investigation that needs to be investigated in court.  These are questions that Mr.  Hooper has raised earlier.  This case has a long history.  There were a whole series of motions that Mr. Hooper made.  I think there was a reference to a discovery where the same questions came up, and we responded to that motion and it generated a decision from the Trial Chamber at the time, and the issue had been dealt with then.  So what I'm suggesting to this Court is that it's inappropriate now to raise those issues simply because we have a witness on the stand that works for the OTP.  This witness was brought forward -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Mr. Webster, as far as I understand, the question to which you objected was an enquiry about the names of the -- an investigator who would have more information about this than him.  That is the question to which I understood you objected to. 
MR. WEBSTER:
That's it, but my understanding of what Mr. Hooper asked was for Mr. Baghel to produce all of the names of investigators that worked on this case.  That was my understanding of the question that was put to the witness.  And it follows from a series of questions.  The whole line of questioning is to investigate or to find out through this witness what the investigation of this case has entailed.  And this is not the appropriate witness to answer that, and the Office of the Prosecutor should not have to go into the history of its investigations.  We are putting forward evidence before the Court.  The evidence through this witness are the photographs and the documents.  If these photographs are not sufficient, then he can bring out those issues by cross-examination on the photographs themselves or on documents themselves, not on the entire history of the investigation, or the -- a history of the -- a listing of every investigator that's worked on the case.  It's not the investigation that's in issue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.
MR. WEBSTER:
It's the photographs.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, as a point of clarification, I had understood -- I did not understand that your question was as broad as that.  Could you explain exactly what your application was?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  First of all, may I say there has never been an application to ask previously for the names of investigators or the rest of it.  I'm dealing today with a witness who's been nominated as the investigator, not the photographer or the exhibitor, but the investigator.  And we all know the following witnesses that are to come in this case.  So, to whom am I to put general questions relating to the investigation, let's start with this, at the hospital?  To the interiors of the rooms or whatever it may be?  To the existence or not of exhumation reports and where they might be and what their contents may indicate?  To the numbers of witnesses, if not production of redacted witness statements relating to specific enquiries into events at the hospital over those seven or eight days?  Numbers of witnesses that have been seen.  Extent of the investigation that's gone on into this case because the greater the investigation and - and the less product that the Prosecution in fact have reaped from it, then the more my argument is sustained that the witnesses that you're about to hear are wrong -- I'll leave it at that at the moment -- are wrong about his presence. 

So it's that area that I'm -- I'm investigating, and the only person I can investigate it with is the investigator.  So there's a number of -- of issues, and he's limited himself to saying that his role has been very small, as we've heard.  So in that context, I asked him to produce lists of investigators who are, in fact, bone fide quasi-public officials, in any event, a list of investigators who have investigated this case.  It might be that he could also indicate whether any of those investigators have spent -- had more involvement in the investigation of this case than he, who cannot help on very basic questions.  And then we are in a position to address, well, the extent of the investigation, and the appropriateness of Mr. Baghel as a witness on Butare to assist the Chamber.  

So these are, I hope, legitimate inquiries in order to gauge the extent and nature of the investigation to assist the Chamber by answering what is hoped to be relevant questions in order to -- to assist it come to its final judgement.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could respond briefly.  The quality of the investigation has nothing to do with the credibility of witnesses that will be brought before the Court.  The Court will have an opportunity to hear the testimony of the witnesses.  If the witnesses are believable and are reliable for the facts that are elicited from them and those facts establish the culpability of the Accused, that's sufficient for a conviction, and the Court doesn't have to enquire how the OTP found these witness and how many investigators have been assigned to the case, and how good or extensive the investigations were.  

We are satisfied that if we put 20 witnesses before the Court and they make out the identity of the Accused and the crimes that he committed, there's a basis for this Court to find him responsible for the charges on the indictment.  That has nothing to do with the number of investigators that have worked on this case over the past six or seven years or whether we have photographs of the interior of the hospital.  

If the photographs that we placed before the Court are not helpful in terms of situating the witnesses and their testimony about the presence of the Accused, then we will live by that.  But you can't -- my submission is that it's inappropriate to use the presence of this witness to investigate the OTP's investigation, which is what Mr.  Hooper seems to be doing.  That's not an issue in the case.  The issue is will the witnesses establish the guilt or the lack of guilt of the Accused?  

If these photographs are not helpful, our case will simply rise and fall on the basis of what we put before the Court, and his function here today is simply to introduce these photographs.  We have not put this -- this witness forward as representing the sum of the investigative history and efforts in relation to this case.  That was -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't understand exactly what you are addressing by that last remark.  Are you saying that a witness can only be cross -- cross-examined on the purpose for which he is put forward?  
MR. WEBSTER:
As a general proposition, the cross-examination should stay within the confines of direct examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you -- do you have a rule which deals with that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I don't believe there's a -- excuse me, one second.  

As a general proposition, the cross-examination should confine itself to the substance of the witness's testimony and issues of credibility, and the history of the investigation of this case is not an issue for this witness's credibility.  So I'll stop there, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, as I had mentioned earlier, it's already 12:30.  I think this might be an appropriate time to take our adjournment. 
MR. HOOPER:
I'm not standing for a moment in the way of that.  It's a difficult issue.  May I just request as we come to the -- this juncture with this particular witness that now and in the future, as I understand it, once a witness has begun his testimony there should be no contact between the witness and the side that's called him or her without leave of the Court, without leave of the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 

Mr. Webster?  
MR. WEBSTER:
You know, the witness made it clear in his last response that he would have to consult with OTP management, or he raised the issue that the answers to Mr.  Hooper's question comes from the management.  It would be impossible for me to even raise this issue with a witness or with OTP management without speaking to the witness himself.  So I'll be guided by the Court as a general proposition that no, we do not have contact with the witnesses once they're sworn, but if Mr. Hooper wants follow-up to the issues that he's raised, then I'm going to have to speak to the witness.  So it's really at the Court's discretion on that point.  I have no intention of trying to coach the witness's testimony, but in order to follow up on issues that we've raised earlier today, it's going to require that I -- I speak to the witness.  
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I don't know if I can contribute just to say, I am, for my part, completely sure that Mr. Baghel will act appropriately.  And if there is to be that limited inquiry in order for the Prosecution to arm themselves for next week, then that would be appropriate.  I'm sure that's -- I don't stand in the way of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it seems unnecessary to make a ruling on this last issue.  And I think that we should do what we had intended to do and take our break for the weekend now and resume on Monday morning.  

I just remind you, Mr. Baghel, that you are sworn as a witness in this trial and your testimony will be continuing on Monday, and you'll be expected to act appropriately in the context of your status as a witness in the middle of your testimony. 
THE WITNESS:
Okay.  Thank you for your advice.
