P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.

Registrar, please introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber. 
MR. DIALLO:
Thank you, Madam President.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Solomy Bossa, presiding, Judge Bakhtiar Tuzmukhamedov and Judge Mparany Rajohnson is sitting today, 
Tuesday, 10 November 2009, for trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Callixte Nzabonimana, Case No. ICTR-98-44D-T.

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.

Yes, Prosecution, would you introduce your team, please; after which the Defence should do the same before the witness is brought in. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Greetings, Madam President, Your Honours.  

The Prosecution team comprises of Paul Ng'arua, senior trial attorney, myself, Memory Maposa, appeals counsel, and Marie Ka, case manager.  And also Diana Karanja, researcher.  We have 
Roy Kiarie, intern, Jonathan Flynn, intern, Ida Okoth, intern. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecution.

The Defence, please. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Defence is composed this morning -- this morning by 
Vincent Courcelle-Labrousse, Philippe Larochelle and our investigator. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  And the Accused continues to be absent.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Let's hope he'll have a change of heart.

Thank you. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
We shall try to convince him to change his mind. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

The parties are aware of a pending motion which was filed by the Defence for some relief.  We would like to know from the Prosecution when they would be ready with their response and if it is possible to file this response today or, latest, tomorrow. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Your Lords, we will file our response tomorrow, latest. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  We'll hold you to your word.

Can we now have the witness?  

Are you ready with your witness, Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, we're ready to proceed. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If we could just, Your Honour --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Just a short matter, Your Honour.  There are pending motions regarding CNAO, and this is an important witness for us to meet before certain witnesses of the Prosecutor arrive because they relate to the same allegations, and we -- we would be really grateful for the Chamber to obtain a ruling in that matter to allow us to know how to dance in that matter because we're not quite sure how to deal with this matter.  

We thank you for your -- we're sure you'll deal with this matter shortly, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  We regret the delay in rendering that decision, but as you'll appreciate, we have had our plate full with more urgent issues.  We will attend to that motion before the end of this week.  
Thank you. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, can the witness be brought in please.
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, could you swear the witness.
(Declaration made by Witness CNAP in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, we have produced a protected information sheet.  We believe that you have one in front of you.  And we'd request if you could probably lead the witness through the protected information. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could one of the interpreters come for that.  

Maybe we could request the witness to tell us whether she's -- the form is in English, is it?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
The form is in English and she may need assistance with that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Could we have a Kinyarwanda interpreter come forward to lead the witness through the form, please? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, the information in this personal information sheet is accurate. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Interpreter, you may return to your seat.

Prosecution, after what you need to do about that form we have a small instruction to give to the witness before you proceed.

You could finish with the form first, if you need to do anything about it. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, we need to hand it in as Prosecution Exhibit 1.  May it be marked as P. 1?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The personal identification form of Witness CNAP is given Exhibit Number P. 1 and should be placed under seal because it contains the personal identification information of this witness.

Registry, is that okay?  
MR. DIALLO:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Exhibit P. 1 admitted, under seal) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, before you begin your testimony, we want to apprise you of the procedures that are in this Tribunal.  

The lawyers who will lead your evidence come from the Prosecution side, and they are seated on this side of the courtroom, which should be your right.  They will lead you -- they will elicit from you the evidence which you're going to give in this Court.  After they have finished asking you questions, the Defence team will in turn ask you questions.  The Judges may also put some questions to you if they feel that they need to do so.  

If you have not understood a question put to you, you can ask for that question to be clarified or repeated and listen carefully to questions put before -- put to you, answer them directly and briefly and take note that all the answers you give are for the benefit of the Trial Chamber which is trying to establish the truth in this matter.  The questions -- the answers you give are not for the benefit of either the Prosecution or for the Defence.  So we'll urge you to strictly follow these instructions so we can quickly come to the end of your testimony.

Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I've understood you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, and when you have finished speaking, please switch off your microphone and don't hesitate to approach the Chamber if you have any problem. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.

Now, Your Honours, to expedite proceedings we have distributed to the transcribers a spelling list of certain names that the witness may mention.  However, I've not given one to the Bench, so I'll request registry, please, to give this document to the Judges.  This is a spelling list.  And --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, could the interpreters also have copies of the spelling list.  Thank you, madam.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, could you provide a copy to the interpreters?  They have requested you to do so. 

MR. NG'ARUA:
Will do. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If that may be of any assistance, since we have two extra spelling lists that could be distributed to the interpreters' booth. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lords, you'll notice that there are two lists; one will be for a brief closed session and the longer list, bearing about 18 names, will be for the open session.

I'll proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And where do you want to begin?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
With the open session. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I apologise.  We -- we had many versions of the small list but we have no copies of the 18-names list.  If we could get copies, that would be appreciated. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
He might have just given his to the interpreter.  Well, we'll try to facilitate that in due course. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We can share one for now. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, I'll appreciate that.  

I'm sure the transcriber -- English transcriber has two?  No.  All right.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Please return our -- I mean give us another copy so we can all have a copy to ourselves later. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Later, yes.




WITNESS CNAP,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, sorry to interrupt you.  Maybe we need to warn the witness that we're in open session so that she does not disclose any information which might lead to her identification.

Witness, do not mention names of people and places who may identify you. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And switch off your microphone and await the question.  When the Prosecutor has put the question to you then you can switch it on, then when you finish please switch it off. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in 1994, April, did you know a certain gentleman by the name of Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I knew him.  I knew him because Callixte Nzabonimana was **************************, and I know that he was the *********************************** which invited us to the child's baptism.  Callixte Nzabonimana had a lot of property near that family.  He had cattle farms where they farmed potatoes.  So he's someone that I knew quite well. 
Q.	Did you know his position in society? 
A.	I know that he was a minister. 
Q.	Yes.  And how was he regarded by the population in your area? 
A.	In our area the people considered him as someone who was good up to when the war started.  But prior to that, as far as we're concerned, he was someone good. 
Q.	Now, did you see Callixte Nzabonimana after the death of the president on the 6th April 1994?  After that date, did you see him? 
A.	I saw him.  He found me in Gasenyi one evening.  I think that it was between the 8th and the 9th.  So he met me in Gasenyi.  He held a small meeting for people who had come from Mugusu commune which bordered our commune.  I had gone to Gasenyi to buy provisions one evening.  It must have been between 3:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon.  And I left Gasenyi at around 5:30.  

During that meeting there were other people from Mugusu, as well as other people whose names I no longer remember.  Callixte had a short meeting for them and he told them that the enemy was the Tutsi. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, I'm sorry to interrupt your testimony.  Could you please slow down a bit to enable the interpreters and the recorders to record your testimony faithfully.  You were -- you're a bit fast. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
The spelling of Gasenyi appears as number 1 on the list, as the Court pleases. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Please proceed, Witness.  
A.	You have just given the -- have you just given the spelling of Gasenyi?  Well, I was saying that there were people from Ndusu which is a commune bordering our commune, that is, Nyabikenke commune. 
Q.	About how many people were there? 
A.	There were about 100 people.  There were people from Ndusu as well as people from 
	Nyabikenke commune. 
Q.	Tell the Court, Witness, how did the gentleman you describe as Callixte Nzabonimana arrive at that meeting? 
A.	He came there in a white vehicle.  He was accompanied by gendarmes. 
Q.	How many gendarmes accompanied him, do you know? 
A.	Five or more gendarmes were with him. 
Q.	And how did the meeting proceed? 
A.	In the back part of the vehicle there were machetes.  There was a trader in that area who was a friend of Callixte.  Callixte asked people to unload the machetes and store them at the trader's house. 
Q.	Yes.  And where was the trader's house? 
A.	The trader's house was located on the lower side of the market, on the left-hand side, so the vehicle parked near the market.  It did not park near the trader's house. 
Q.	Now how far was the car parked from the trader's house? 
A.	I'd say 4 or 5 metres. 
Q.	Can you describe what you mean to the Court with respect to the dimensions in this room where you're sitting.  How far was the trader's house from where the vehicle was parked?  Can you describe it in terms of the positions in this room? 
A.	Let's say that the vehicle was parked at the place where you can see the wall on my left-hand side and the trader's house was where the Judges' Bench is, in other words, where you see the three people sitting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, could you clarify the wall?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, are you referring to the wall where is the glass? 
A.	Yes, yes, yes.  You see the wall here with glass windows where you can see people sitting behind the wall, and you can see on the other side there were -- there are three people.  So the vehicle was on the lower side.  And it parked on the side of the road. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecution, there still appears to be confusion about the three people. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, I'll clarify about that. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	So you say that the vehicle was parked where the interpreters are.  And which three people are you speaking about?  The Judges?  The Judges are sitting in front of you.  Yes, and --
A.	There, over there.  I told you that there is a path leading to the house.  The vehicle stopped along the road and then there was a path leading to the trader's house. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, would you switch off your microphone, please.

Prosecution -- 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The witness seems to be talking about the interpreters' booth -- the distance between the 
interpreters' booth and the bench where the Defence counsel are seated. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
I agree.  I don't think my friends have a dispute with that; otherwise, we'll record it as the distance described. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, no objection?  Okay.

Could we have the registry take those measurements and at a later time today have the exact distance. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  Could we approximate it as about 20 metres.  If the Defence does not object to that, 20 metres between the -- 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
We will wait for the measures that have just been ordered by the Bench. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, could you give the Court the name of the trader? 
A.	Mathias Barajiginywa is the name. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
That appears as number 5 on the spelling list.  And previously she had mentioned the name Ndusu, number 6, and Nyabikenke was number 3. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness, can you describe Mathias' house?  What type of house was it?  Was it a dwelling house or a business house? 
A.	It was a business house.  His residence was somewhere else close to Gasenyi. 
Q.	Now we're still at this Gasenyi place.  How long did it take to offload the machetes from 
	Callixte Nzabonimana's car to the business house of Mathias that you've described; how long did it take? 
A.	There were many people involved, so it was easy for them to offload the machetes quickly. 
Q.	Was anything else offloaded from Nzabonimana's vehicle? 
A.	Only the machetes.  However, the gendarmes had some grenades on them -- on themselves. 
Q.	How many grenades did you see? 
A.	Gendarmes were carrying some grenades. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, from the Kinyarwanda booth there is a technical problem with the interpretation services. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do we -- the interpreters say they have a problem, a technical problem.  

Interpreters, do we need to adjourn or can it be attended to?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I think it's just a switch of channels, Madam President.  It might take a second or two.  The other Kinyarwanda colleague will proceed working from the lone console that seems to work.  

So we can proceed, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.  

The problem has been rectified so we can proceed. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Now, Witness, when - sorry.  When Callixte Nzabonimana -- 

MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
We did not get the last translation of the witness's testimony. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth it might be best for the witness to repeat the answer because when the answer was being provided the Kinyarwanda booth was not in a position to interpret at that time, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The answer to which question?  Because what we have here is:  How many grenades did you see?  And then she says:  Gendarmes were carrying some grenades.

Was there any other question to which you didn't receive an answer?  

Witness, what were you saying before we were interrupted by the technical fault in the 
interpretation booth?
THE WITNESS:
Do you want me to repeat the answer that I gave to the questions on grenades and machetes?  Should I talk about the grenades and the machetes at the same time or should I talk about them separately?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Prosecutor, maybe you could take it up. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes, as the Court pleases. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, how many grenades did you see? 
A.	This is what I said:  About 50.  Those who carried the machetes to Barajiginywa's house were in the company of gendarmes who were bearing grenades.  As for us, we remained at the location where the meeting was taking place. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, I want you to tell the Judges exactly how the meeting started.  
	How -- did anybody say anything before Callixte Nzabonimana spoke? 
A.	Yes, Mathias Barajiginywa was the first to take the floor.  He said that a guest had just arrived and that the guest had something to say to those who had gathered at that location. 
Q.	Yes, proceed.  
A.	After stating that the guest was going to say something, the said guest stood up, raised his arms in the air, waved at us greeting us.  We didn't shake anybody's hand.  He simply said:  "Good day and be courageous."  
Q.	Yes.  After greeting you, what happened?  What did he say?  
A.	He then spoke to the crowd saying that the enemy was the Tutsi and that the Tutsi had to be eliminated.  He started by asking a question:  "Do you know the enemy?"  Then he answered the question himself saying:  "The enemy is the Tutsi, and we don't want to have any more to do with the Tutsis."  
Q.	Yes.  Did he say anything else?  Can you remember if he said anything else? 
A.	Yes, he said that people should not hasten to beat the cows, but that the first thing to do was to eliminate the owners of the cows.  He said that he would be returning in a few days to check whether they had done the job. 
Q.	What did you understand by those words, madam? 
A.	How could it be that I did not understand those words?  My husband was from a family that was being referred to as the enemy.  So you can understand that it was easy for me to understand what those words meant. 
Q.	Tell the Judges what they meant.  
A.	You see, I was able to understand what those words meant because it was being said that the enemy was the Tutsi and that the Tutsi had to be eliminated.  So I knew that my husband was a member of a family that was being referred to as the enemy.  So I understood there was a problem.  You see, you know what happened subsequently. 
Q.	Witness, please tell us what happened subsequently.  
A.	That very night some youths began to disturb members of the population.  After hearing those words, I had to go into hiding, to go to my home, but we were not able to sleep during that night.  But even before we dispersed, the young men had already began to gather jerry cans of banana beer at Mathias's house.  

So when I got back home I told my husband that things were getting critical.  So we had to go sleep in the bushes.  People were being tracked down, while others were hiding in the bushes and others still went to seek refuge in various parishes. 
Q.	Witness, how did the youths you've talked about disturb members of the population, can you tell the Judges? 
A.	Yes, I can.  They made a lot of noise everywhere in the village.  They told everybody that they were going to kill some people, and they even said:  "We are going to kill you."  They were shouting across the village and inhabitants began to seek refuge at the parish.  But the attackers came to the parish to attack them.  They broke down the parish doors and attacked the refugees who were gathered at the parish.  I had six children, and they took my children away.  They also took their paternal aunt away. 
Q.	And tell us, how were your children taken away? 
A.	We had sought refuge at the parish.  Some people were killed at the parish, while others had also sought refuge at the communal office.  Some people were killed and their bodies dropped in the Nyabarongo river.  So, as I was saying, some people sought refuge at the parish and others at the communal office.  Those who were at the parish came under attack.  And the assailants often arriving at the ********************************************************************************************** 
Q.	And what happened to your children? 
A.	They took my children away.  They killed my children.  A few days after some attackers were at a drinking spot and were bragging about what they had done, and even went on to say that they would kill even the survivors. 
Q.	Now, Witness, the attackers who killed your children, had you seen them before?  We know this is a very difficult thing to talk about.  But had you seen those attackers before they killed your children? 
A.	Yes, I knew them.  They were people who had attended the same meeting at Gasenyi.  Some of them are in prison.  Others are doing community labour or community service.  And some were found to be not guilty and have returned to their homes. 
Q.	Now the people, the 100 people who were addressed by Callixte Nzabonimana at the Gasenyi centre, can you describe them? 
A.	Yes, but let me say when I talked about 100 persons, it was only an approximation. 
Q.	Please describe them.  
A.	How do you want me to describe them?  These were persons like yourself and myself.  These were inhabitants of my area, whilst others were from Ndusu.  They were dressed like the rest of us.  I knew some of them, but some I did not know.  So they were just ordinary persons like you and I. 
Q.	Did they come from a specific ethnicity or not? 
A.	No, they were ordinary persons like us, like ourselves.  Mathias had brought in those people from Ndusu.  He had brought them in from Ndusu into our area.  They were ordinary people like ourselves. 
Q.	Now, please tell the Court, in relation to the meeting of Callixte Nzabonimana, when did the attack of the parish occur? 
A.	The night of the meeting, during that night people started seeking refuge at the parish.  I think I have referred to the period from the 8th to the 9th because I know that from the 10th to the 11th the refugees were at the Ntarabana parish.  The attackers attacked that parish and hurled stones at the refugees who attempted to defend themselves.  But they were much weaker the day after, and some of them even began to die.  I'm referring here to the refugees.  

So it was within those time frames.  I don't have a clear recollection of the exact dates, but I know that on the 10th and the 11th the refugees were already at the parish.  Some actually left the parish and went on to the communal office at around that time. 
Q.	And when was the attack on the parish done, are you able to approximate? 
A.	I have just told you that it was around the 10th or the 11th because I know that the refugees went to the communal office on the 12th.  In any event, the attack took place before the 12th because 
	on the 12th the refugees had moved to the communal office. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, which month are we talking about when you say the 10th, 11th, the 8th and 9th?  

THE WITNESS:
The month of April 1994, Madam President. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court, who were the refugees that were being targeted at this time?  What was their ethnicity? 
A.	They were Tutsi. 
Q.	Now after these disturbances, and particularly after the meeting after the 9th or 8th April 1994, did you see Callixte Nzabonimana again? 
A.	No, I did not see him again after those disturbances.  We were wanted persons at the time.  I was also being tracked down and so I had to go to Nyabugogo in Kigali to be with ***********************, so I did not see him again.  I never saw him again after the meeting. 
Q.	Before you left for Nyabugogo can you tell us whether you heard of Callixte Nzabonimana in your area?  Did you hear of him? 
A.	It was being said that he was in Zaire.  Refugees who had returned from Zaire told us that he was in the Congo. 
Q.	Yes.  Tell the Court, when did you leave your home area and go to Nyabugogo?  In which month? 
A.	It was in the month of May, on the ************* to be more specific.  I left my area for Nyabugogo on the 20th May.  But that was in Shurongi commune, Nyabugogo on the Shurongi side of the commune.  I left Nyabugogo when the infiltrators attacked. 
Q.	Now listen to my question carefully, Witness.  Between the date when you attended the meeting, when Callixte Nzabonimana addressed the meeting, between the 8th and the 9th, and the time you left for Nyabugogo on the 5th -- on the 20th of May 1994, did you hear of other meetings or activities of 
	Callixte Nzabonimana in your area? 
A.	People talked.  People talked even before he came to Kigina saying that he had held a meeting at Kavumu.  And it was being said that he had distributed weapons in Kavumu and that he had given drinks to the inhabitants.  People were talking about those things. 
Q.	Did you hear of any other meetings at Kavumu between the 9th and the 20th of May 1994? 
A.	Some meetings took place.  One day he came to Kavumu and said that he had just attended a meeting of the Atabazi government. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
(Microphone not activated) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we did not hear what you said because you were speaking at the same time as the witness.  

Witness, could you switch off your microphone please.

Yes, Counsel.
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Your Honour, I mean just on a opening note, we let the witness expand a bit on her statement, although we were wondering whether to object or not.  But the latest part of a further meeting and of things that allegedly have been said in a different meeting, we are sorry but the Defence has absolutely no notice of that.  

I would kindly ask the Prosecutor to tell us where it is alleged in the statement of 1998, or in his will-say, that the witness heard or saw Callixte talk of the interim government or the Atabazi government, as she said.  There's absolutely no notice of that allegation and we object to it being put this morning by the witness.

Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. NG'ARUA:
Your Honours, I'll address that matter.  That objection is -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do you want to address it in the presence of the witness?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I don't think that it will disclose or guide her in any way.  I'll show him from the statement of the witness, which is before him, exactly the place that we're talking about.  

Now, please turn to your binder at tab B.  At tab B, My Lords, you also have a binder containing 
witness statements.  At tab B you will find the witness statement with K number:  K0097499.  That's the statement of 26th August 1998, and particularly at the third page where the main body of the testimony appears, that is, K0097501 on the English version.  There are four paragraphs there.  

And the last paragraph you'll notice relates to the question that I asked the witness.  And the question was whether she had heard of other meetings that were held by Callixte Nzabonimana in that area.  And the answer is right there.  

So unless my learned friend simply wants to object for the sake of objecting and wasting the 
Court's time, it is quite clear that the witness is not expanding on her statement but actually saying what she actually said in 1998.  So may the objection be overruled, My Lord. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we need assistance because we were looking for the statement as you were talking.  Which particular paragraph are you referring to?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I don't know if you have the binder.  You have the binder before you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have the statement with the K number K0097501. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes.  Now the paragraph I'm talking about, My Lords, is the last paragraph, the last of the 
	four paragraphs, short paragraphs of three lines.  That's a statement that was disclosed to the Defence.  And that is the question that I've asked the witness and I'm sure that it does not embarrass or prejudice the Defence of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana in any way, contrary to what my learned friend is saying.  

It's talking about the same issue.  I don't want to expand very much because I don't want to give the witness a hint.  But the objection is clearly out of place and should be overruled for the reason that it is baseless. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Briefly, Madam President.  There is indeed mention in the last paragraph.  She heard that there were further meetings to incite and that she did not attend any of these meetings.  I'm not -- we're not objecting to the fact that she mentions that.  The objection was brought up by the fact that she was reporting things that Mr. Nzabonimana allegedly said during these meetings and I raised (sic) when she mentioned the government.  

First, there is no longer allegations concerning the government.  And, second, there's certainly no mention of a speech by Mr. Nzabonimana involving the interim government.  So this is new allegations which the Defence absolutely never received notice of.  We are -- I'm sorry to -- I'm not agreeing with my colleague, Mr. Ng'arua, here.  We are expanding on the statement that we have received and, therefore, we object to that evidence being led before Your Honours.  

Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, the question was this:  Did you hear of any other meetings at Kavumu between the 
8th and 9th of May 1994?  And the answer of the witness -- the witness was answering when counsel started to object.  We feel that the question was proper because it's about hearing about other meetings.  

As to the answer which the witness gave spontaneously, we cannot erase it from the record.  We can allow her to complete the answer, but this matter should not be developed further.  And Counsel for the Prosecution should be careful to limit it within the purview of the will-say, or rather the statement. 

MR. NG'ARUA:
As the Court pleases.  

So may the witness be requested to continue with her answer. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, can you tell us of the meetings that you heard about, not necessarily the ones that you attended, the ones you heard about, between the first meeting and the time you left for Nyambugogo?  Thank you.  
A.	He held meetings in various places in the secteur.  I was in my secteur, which was not far.  People said that he held meetings in Kivumu, in Gitovu, everywhere in the secteur.  And whenever he held meetings he provided the members of the public with drinks publicly, and people talked about those things without feeling ashamed.  I think that that is what happened. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, Witness, you had requested for a brief closed session.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
My Lord, may I request now that for the witness to complete her testimony, she requested a brief 
	closed session to be able to discuss more explicitly some of the things that she has talked about, as the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, please switch off your microphone.

We will now go into a brief closed session.  We request members of the public to leave at this particular time as the matters to be testified upon might reveal the identity of the witness and she's a protected witness.

Registry, please indicate when we are ready for the closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 17  to 23] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 1 to 16 by Melissa Hook)










MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If the registry could assist, I have a document I'd like to have distributed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
So what Your Honours have before their eyes is a document which was provided to the Defence Sunday, late afternoon, just prior to the famous interviews which were finally happening with the Prosecutor's witnesses.

As you can see, this is a statement signed by the witness which is currently on the stand in which she states that she testified in 2003 at *********************************

The statement was signed on ***************************.  Nevertheless, we received it on *********************** though every one of these days is precious, Your Honours.  As I said earlier, yesterday, we have investigators on the ground who are attempting everything to procure that material.

We don't have that material now so that we cannot use it to cross-examine that witness.  And if I may add, the witness expanded now in her testimony on traumatic and horrific events on which she lived.

But she also mentioned that her attackers made confessions on certain dates, and this is all events that occurred before a judicial body, whether it is a Gacaca or a regular court.  We shall explore that in cross-examination.  

But the end result, anyway, is at this stage we do not have the prior statement of the witness and we are not in a position to begin the cross-examination.  I thank you, Your Honours.   
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, we do not see much merit in what my learned friend has told this Court.  And we shall be asking you to dismiss his application and to proceed with the cross-examination of this witness on what she has said before you today.  And in the event that anything comes out of the Rongi secteur Gacaca records that is relevant, then a motion should be made by the Defence at that time.

And indeed, if there are serious matters, we shall be the first to accept that the witness be recalled.  Now let us look at the body of what my learned friend has said and look at it in the context of his previous conduct.
First and foremost, this declaration that is the basis for his request for postponement of cross-examination was filed by the Prosecutor within the time limit given by the Court.  So the Prosecutor is not at fault.

Secondly, the request for this declaration came very late in the day.  And, therefore, when the Court gave their position, there was hardly one week.  It was about nine days before the 
trial started.  

And that is why our investigator could not even be called as the first witness, because he had to go down to the cellule and get this declaration from the witness.  And that is why it is dated 3rd of November 2009.

And the earliest we could get this document was on Friday.  The Defence counsels did not come to Arusha and we did not meet with them until Sunday, the 8th of November.  And that's when we gave them this document.

Therefore, there's no negligence or obstruction or animus conduct with regard to this document.  Now, furthermore, My Lords, the Defence for Callixte Nzabonimana seems to be blowing hot and cold in the same breath.  In their opening statement, they indicated that Callixte Nzabonimana was not in Gitarama.  He was in Kigali.  That was their Defence.

Then one wonders how, then, does the Gacaca record, with respect to this witness, become relevant here.  We don't see how, because the defence of alibi means that the person was not there.

Now, that aside, our primary thrust is this:  Defence counsels are at fault for the delay.  They knew that those records may be necessary.  They requested for them very late in the day, indeed in our first pre-trial conference -- I think it was the 1st of October -- they tried to blame the Prosecutor, because it appears to be very fashionable to blame the Prosecutor, for failure to facilitate their interview with this witness prior to that date, the 1st of October.  

And the Judge, President, in his wisdom, said that the ball was in their court, they had failed to pursue the matter on time, and they were sitting on their laurels somewhere.  And, therefore, it was upon them to do something urgently.  They had not even contacted WVSS.  They were waiting for the Prosecutor to do that for them.

Now, this document came at the right time.  But, however, the fault is with the Defence for the delay.  They knew that they needed it.  It is their responsibility to look for those records, and they have failed to look for those records because they took too long to realise that it might be important for the Defence of Callixte Nzabonimana.

So really, when you look at the negligence that has been displayed by the Defence in this matter, there is absolutely no merit in granting the application.

Finally, My Lords, the witness has spoken about matters that can be cross-examined by the Defence counsel.  She has spoken of her specific experience and the meeting that was held by Callixte Nzabonimana at Gasenyi centre.  So there is nothing absolutely that they require that has not been given to them for them to cross-examine this witness about that event.

They can, for instance, say that she is mistaken; that that was not Callixte Nzabonimana because Callixte Nzabonimana was at the French embassy on that day; and that everything she is making is false.  Now, that is possible.

Now, further to that, the Trial Chamber, in their decision of 29th of October 2009, held that the Defence did not exercise due diligence to obtain those documents -- they did not -- because they waited too long, and they thought, since the Prosecutor is in Arusha, it is his job to do it, ignoring the decisions of the Court of appeal and the rulings of this Court that it is not the business of the Prosecutor to collect these documents.

Indeed, now they may go to **************** and find out that this is a testimony, for instance, the witness gave on how her children were taken from the house.  Now, really, if we look at that very carefully, that could be an issue for further cross-examination if it contradicts what she has already said here.

But if it turns out to be exactly what she has said here, then recall of the witness may be necessary, but not before that.  And to delay this trial further by saying that they cannot cross-examine is not fair, and it's not in the interest of justice.

We, therefore, request this Court to ask the Defence to cross-examine this witness.  And if they are able to get these documents in the future and something arises, then a substantive motion should be filed.  And we shall be the first to accept if there is cogent material in that document that needs to be put to this witness.

My Lords, I rest my submission. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honours, when I hear the Prosecutor stating that prior statements of witnesses are not relevant, not relevant, when in fact, if you read Article 68, you must disclose, as soon as practicable, any material which is susceptible of affecting the credibility of its own witnesses.

So that he argues on the outset that he doesn't appreciate the relevance of his own 
witness's prior statement cannot be taken seriously.  I'm actually -- I think it's bone chilling to hear stuff like that.

The Prosecutor knows since 3 November that this witness has made a prior statement in a court in Rwanda.  So the statement is signed 3 November.  We receive it 8 November.  If you read -- 

If I may read the record that Your Honours rendered on 29th October 2008 in their decision concerning the Gacaca material, "Number 2, order the Prosecution to order that the following Prosecution witnesses respond to the questionnaire in its motion by 9th November.

"Order number 3, order the Prosecution to transmit the responses to the Defence --" 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, if counsel would slow down, it would facilitate the interpretation.  Thank you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I apologise.

Order number 3 of the decision of 29th October, "Order the Prosecution to transmit the responses to the Defence as it receives them."  

Why five days later?  Because they don't want us to get that material.  They don't want us to confront their witnesses with the prior statements they made in Rwanda.

Why is that, Your Honour?  Because systematically they differ from what they are saying here.  There is no reason.  The Prosecutor is not candid when he suggests after that that we have not acted diligently.

And he relies on the finding of Your Honours in this decision which says at paragraph 27 that we have done nothing up to the 15th October to get the interviews of the witnesses.

Your Honours, in the response to their certification that we will file later today, we will submit, along with that response, the four letters which were exchanged with the WVSS which was responsible for implementing the order to meet with the Prosecutor witnesses, not the Prosecutor as is stated in your decision, and which demonstrate that we were running after WVSS to obtain the forms stating whether a witness was willing to meet with us or not.

So I will not accept that we say that the Defence has not been diligent in obtaining that material or in trying to interview the Prosecutor's witnesses to get what is contained in the questionnaire which was received on the eve of the trial.  This is not putting the situation correctly, and we 
strongly refute that.

And, therefore, at the minimum, now that this witness specifically has put emphasis on what happened, this brings the Gacaca material -- this gives more importance to the Gacaca material that we need before embarking on the cross-examination of the witness.

Once the cross-examination is finished, then it will be burdensome for the Defence to file systematically motions, to be entitled to recall the witnesses.  It will create a mess, and it will just stretch the little resources that we have to an extent that we cannot bear.  

So this is why I request that the cross-examination of that witness be postponed to the next session, in order for us to obtain all the Gacaca materials relating to all the Prosecution witnesses.  

If the Prosecutor cannot appreciate the importance of that material, Your Honour, I'm at a loss here.  I cannot -- when I hear the Prosecutor -- I repeat that -- stating that he does not appreciate the relevance of his own witness's prior statements because there is an alibi.

You have an alibi.  Why would you want to show that the witness is making false accusations anyway?  The alibi is just one means to demonstrate that the witnesses are making 
false accusations against Nzabonimana.  Why do we have to content ourselves with that?  

If there is an alibi and if we can also demonstrate that the witness has said something different before the Gacaca courts, why are we not entitled to bring in all that evidence before Your Honours?  

It is simply unfair to be forced to proceed when we are not ready, when we know -- everybody now knows that there is material which needs to be disclosed and which is highly relevant to the cross-examination of this case.
These are the submissions, Your Honour, in support of our request, of our motion.  This is a formal motion that the cross-examination of that witness be postponed.  I thank you for 
Your Honours' attention.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, I'm entitled to a response, and I will say this -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Briefly.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Two sentences. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
That this material he's now talking about is not material that is in the possession of the Prosecutor.  Now, with respect to the document of declaration, this document was requested for by the Defence late in the day, and we did not transmit it to the Defence because on the date shown as the date of declaration, this was somewhere inside Kivumu, not in Arusha.  And we only got that document on the eve of Friday.  

That's the time I saw this document myself.  And immediately, immediately, we read from the emails that the Defence is not willing to come here on Saturday because we wanted them to be here on Saturday, and they said that they would only be here on Sunday.  And at the 
first opportunity, we gave them all those documents.

So it does not go down well with us that the Defence is misstating the case so badly.  These are not documents that were in the possession of the Prosecutor.  And I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

This is the short ruling of the Chamber on this matter.  The Chamber recalls all its prior decisions relating to Gacaca records and, particularly, the decision of 29th October 2009.  The Trial Chamber would like to remind the parties of this decision and of any obligations that may flow from that decision.

Now, having listened carefully to the parties, we are of the view that the testimony of this witness can proceed for cross-examination by the Defence on the matters which have been testified upon by this witness.

Should the Defence -- should the Gacaca record subsequently surface or become available and it is demonstrated that this record raises an issue which justifies the recall of this witness, this matter can be raised with the Trial Chamber, and the Trial Chamber will make appropriate decisions.

We are of the view that the unknown quantity of the Gacaca record at this stage of the proceedings does not justify the postponement of the cross-examination of this witness.  And, therefore, the cross-examination will proceed on the basis of the testimony of the witness as it stands at the moment.

That is the decision of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will take the break -- 

Yes.  Maybe before we take the break, we would like to remind the parties that the Trial Chamber presumes that both parties are acting in good faith and the imputations of bad faith should be made very, very sparingly by both parties.

Now, having said that, we will adjourn these proceedings, and we will resume -- the break will be for 20 minutes because we have some catching up to do, and we will resume these proceedings at 20 to 12, 20 to 12.  These proceedings stand adjourned.  
(Court recessed from 1115H to 1150H)  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The hearing is resumed.  We are in open session, Counsel.  You could indicate to the Trial Chamber whether we need to be in open or closed session.

And, Registry, could you assist with the CaseView.  My computer is off.  I can't follow the proceedings.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I too have a small technical problem because I wanted to project on your computer screen a fraction of the map that we have before you.  By the time you came into court, that matter had not been sorted out by the technicians.  I believe that it would be useful for the Bench to be able to see the map of the area we will be dealing with in our cross-examination, specifically on that area.

I, therefore, seek assistance from the technical services to sort out that issue, maybe in five minutes, if possible. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
While the registry attends to that matter, you can start on another area, and then we can come back to it.

Would that be acceptable?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Very well.  It would make things slightly less easy, but we can proceed. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And should we be in open or closed session?  Because you know the questions you are going to ask and we don't know.  So you can advise us.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I think we can begin in open session, and during the cross-examination, if the Prosecutor were to feel that my questions might affect the anonymity of his client, I think he should be at liberty to raise that point.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, the Prosecution can raise that point, but I think you should be mindful of that fact.   

Witness, we are now in open session.  So be careful not to give answers that might give away your identity.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Madam Witness, when you met the investigators of the OTP in 1998, you signed a statement; is that correct? 
A.	Please, Counsel, repeat your question. 
Q.	My question was very clear.  When you met investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor in 1998 -- 
A.	Yes.  I met them. 
Q.	-- did you sign a statement? 
A.	I believe that I made a written statement to the investigators in 1998.  
Q.	Since 1998 is that the only written statement you have made to the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	After that first statement, I met them again on a number of occasions and made other statements.  I met the investigators on a regular basis until they asked me to come to Arusha. 
Q.	So from 1998 you signed other statements; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  Those statements do exist. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court where you met the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor since 1998.
A.	I met them first in Kigali, then in Gitarama and elsewhere. 
Q.	After 1998, when you met investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor, did they take any notes when they interviewed you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	It is on the basis of those notes that you signed the statements that you made.  Is that so? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct.  
Q.	Very well.  When you met the Prosecutor's investigators for the first time, can you tell the Court -- can you tell me who established the contact between yourself and the investigators.  
A.	Are you asking me how they got to meet me?  Well, there were a number of authorities who facilitated the contact. 
Q.	Can you tell us who these authorities were specifically.
A.	People contacted the authorities and asked them how they could contact us.  And we also, from time to time, could ask the authorities how it was possible for us to contact the investigators.  But please don't ask me for the names of those authorities because I don't remember them. 
Q.	I have not asked you for their names, but I am going to ask you for their names now.

Were these communal authorities from Nyabikenke?  
A.	Well, you can understand that one does not leave Nyabikenke commune to go to Kigali without having the appropriate information.  So we got information from the authorities in Nyabikenke who told us that we should go to Kigali, and that is how we ended up in Kigali. 
Q.	Madam Witness, I would like assistance from the Court on this matter.  Whenever I put a question to you and there is a possibility of answering yes or no, I would prefer that you answer with a 
	yes or no to the extent possible.  Now, let me put the question to you again.  Answer yes or no.

Was it the Nyabikenke communal authorities who established the contact between yourself and the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor?  Yes or no?   
A.	Yes.  It was, first of all, the Nyabikenke authorities whom we met and asked them how it was possible for us to contact the investigators.  Then the authorities would guide you.   
Q.	You knew about the existence of investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor independent of the communal authorities.  Isn't that so?
A.	We had learned that the trials had begun and that other trials could take place subsequently.  And it was within that context that we sought to obtain information. 
Q.	From your 1998 statement, I can see that your contact was the ********************************.  Was he the one who established the contact between yourself and the investigators? 
A.	Yes.  It was he. 
Q.	Did he tell you that you would be questioned or interviewed by Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	I answered the questions that were put to me. 
Q.	That was not my question.  My question was whether the ************************* told you that you would be interviewed about or on Callixte Nzabonimana.
A.	Yes, he did.  He told us because he himself had asked us some questions about how events had unfolded here and there. 
Q.	Would it be correct to say that the ****************************** was a former officer of the PR?
A.	I do not know.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, what was your question?  Because we are also at a loss.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I asked the witness -- I asked the witness whether it was correct that the bourgmestre of Nyabikenke in 1998 was a former officer of the patriotic Rwandan army, of the APR. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, what would be your answer to that question?  Have you understood the question? 
THE WITNESS:
I do not think I have fully understood the question.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	I will put the question again for the third time.

Would it be correct to say that in 1998 the bourgmestre of Nyabikenke was an officer of the Rwandan patriotic army?  
A.	I do not have a clear recollection of that. 
Q.	Was he an Inkotanyi? 
A.	I think he was. 
Q.	Do you think he was, or are you sure he was? 
A.	That was my understanding, but I am not able to confirm it, although I think that such was the case. 
Q.	So he is the one who told you that you would go to Kigali to testify about Callixte.  Is that so? 
A.	Well, at that time we were all grieving, and we wanted to find ways and means of contacting the investigators.  And anyone who wanted to help us helped us.  
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, I want to be very clear and to urge you to make an attempt to answer my questions as directly as possible.

Now, let me put the question to you again.  Did the bourgmestre of Nyabikenke tell you that you would go to Kigali to meet investigators of the Prosecutor's office to be interviewed about 
Callixte Nzabonimana?  A simple yes-or-no answer would suffice.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court how you travelled to Kigali to meet the investigator.
A.	We travelled in a vehicle because the distance was too long to be covered on foot. 
Q.	Did that vehicle come specifically to fetch you and take you to Kigali?
A.	This is what I have already told you.  You see, one could hike a lift with a guide, but -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From the Kinyarwanda booth, the witness spoke too far away from the microphone and could not be heard distinctly. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you move closer to the microphone and speak up because sometimes you will not be heard.

Registry, if you would assist the witness.

Do you want her to repeat her answer, or do you want to repeat your question?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, I will repeat my question.  I didn't ask her whether she was hitchhiking any rides.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, I want to put the question to you again, and I would be happy if your answer were a yes or a no.

Now, when you went to Kigali on the 10th of September 1998, was a vehicle or a lorry specifically assigned to you to pick you up from your home or from Gasenyi and take you to Kigali?
A.	No.  I went to Remera to get a vehicle to travel to Kigali.  There were others with whom I travelled as well within the context of a programme that had been established previously.  So we wanted to go and raise our problems. 
Q.	So, madam, do you mean that on that day you left with other people from Nyabikenke in order to go and meet the investigators of the Prosecutor's office? 
A.	Yes.  That is correct. 
Q.	When you went to Remera, did you board a car which was waiting for you, or did you take -- did you travel by public transport? 
A.	We travelled by public transport.  However, there was a guide who showed us where we had to go.  
Q.	Now, that guide -- was he or she Rwandan?
A.	Yes.  He was a Rwandan. 
Q.	Was he a Rwandan civil servant? 
A.	Look.  I don't understand you.  I don't understand why you're asking me those questions.  How could I know whether that person was a civil servant?  That's a detail which I don't know.  I was a passenger.  So I could not have asked someone, "Who are you?  What are you doing?" 
In what capacity would I have done that?  
Q.	Madam Witness, was he an authority of the Tribunal?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry to interrupt, Counsel.  

Witness, if you understand a question, try to answer it.  If the question is not proper, the Chamber will alert you to that eventuality.  If the Chamber okays the question, please try to answer it.  And try to answer it as briefly as you can. 
THE WITNESS:
I've understood you.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	The guide who was waiting for you -- was he someone who was working for the Office of the Prosecutor of the Tribunal?  Yes or no?
A.	Listen.  I said that the bourgmestre told me that if I had anything to say, then I could travel.  He said that there would be a vehicle which would come to get other people and that if I was ready, I could board the same vehicle.

Therefore, I could not -- I did not know whether that person was a civil servant or worked for another company.  It was the bourgmestre who gave me the necessary information, and I travelled.  But I cannot give you the name of the person who guided us.  
Q.	The vehicle took you directly to the premises of the Tribunal in Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Madam Witness, in order to travel from Gasenyi, in any event, from your home, up to Kigali on that day, how long did it take you to get to Kigali from Gasenyi or from your home? 
A.	I did not leave from Gasenyi.  We were in Nyabikenke, the place where we had sought refuge.  In 1998 we had to flee from the attacks carried out by infiltrators and went to Nyabikenke.  So we travelled to Nyabikenke.  As a matter of fact, the vehicle was in Remera, which is very near Nyabikenke.  I think that all these details are in my statement. 
Q.	Madam Witness, for the last time, please answer my questions.

From Remera to Kigali -- how long did it take you to travel from Remera to Kigali on that day?  
A.	What should I say?  My goodness gracious me.  Four hours?  Five hours?  Let's just say four hours.  Okay.  Let's say three to four hours.  But that's just an estimate because I don't have a notion of time in that respect.   

Therefore, I cannot give you the estimate of the time it took to cover the distance in a vehicle because this is a detail that can be known by someone who often travels in a vehicle or someone who owns a car.  But I don't know how I can further explain this.  
Q.	Would you agree with me, Madam Witness, that the distance between Remera and Kigali is long? 
A.	Yes.  It is long. 
Q.	Would you agree with me, madam, that the road from Nyabikenke to Gitarama is a bad road?
A.	Yes.  The road is, indeed, bad. 
Q.	In 1998, when you were interviewed by the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor, did they ask you questions specifically in respect of Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	They asked me questions on Callixte, and I answered -- I gave them answers which are similar to the ones that I'm giving you here. 
Q.	When you gave this statement, that was four years after the 1994 events; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So you agree with me that at that time you remembered the 1994 events clearly because the time -- those events had occurred not long ago? 
A.	Yes.  I was in a position to remember some details, but I told you that I went through 
	major problems.  So I'm talking about things that I remember. 
Q.	When you signed your statement at that time, the statement was read back to you.
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You agreed with what had been written down by the investigators?
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Were there any points on which you did not agree with them? 
A.	I think that the investigators had faithfully noted what I had told them.  I think that they wrote down faithfully what I told them.  I don't know whether other things were added later. 
Q.	On that day did the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor ask you whether you knew people who had taken part or witnessed the events which you talked about in your statement? 
A.	Did you say people I knew?  
Q.	Did the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor -- when you told them about the 
	Gasenyi meeting, did they ask you whether you knew other people who were, of course, still alive who had attended that meeting? 
A.	I gave them the names which I remembered. 
Q.	You gave them names? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Names of people who were simply onlookers at the meeting? 
A.	Yes.  I remembered some names which I gave them, but there were other people's names who I no longer remembered.  You see, the people's names I gave are the names which I -- okay.  I gave you names today, but I did not remember -- I did not remember those names at that time. 
Q.	Madam Witness, today you gave us names of people who were active -- actively involved in that meeting.  You gave us the name of --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, please don't mention them in open session.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, the names are neutral, but if you think that out of an abundance of caution and the witness's safety, then we can move into a closed session.  But I don't think that these are names which could have any bearing if they are mentioned in public.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, if I may, those names particularly worry this witness.  And I would request that if those names are to be mentioned, except one name, then we need to go into closed session.

However, if counsel has the name, he can show us.  And we'll probably be able to assess the impact.  Because she had requested that certain names not be mentioned or relayed to her because her identity would become known.   
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I just want to say that we are not really going to go into closed session every time we mention an inhabitant of Nyabikenke.  That's not a real problem.  Otherwise, but I'd rather have 
	open session proceedings. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we should be mindful of the safety of the witness.  And these names, as I recall, were mentioned in closed session.  And we will continue to mention them in closed session.

So we will go into closed session at this time of the proceedings.  We request members of the public to leave.  We hope it will be short.
