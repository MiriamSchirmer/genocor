MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 26th of October 2010, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

What is the status of this witness?  
MR. WEYL:
Good morning, Mr. President.  Good morning, everyone in the courtroom.  

Mr. President, the witness did not seek any special protection.  Nevertheless, he was covered by the decision that the Chamber kindly made to prohibit the parties from revealing the identity of the witness.  I think the Chamber can obtain confirmation from the witness, who intends to testify as an unprotected witness and without using a synonym -- sorry, pseudonym.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, the Chamber had made an order for your protection, which included that your identity would not be revealed to the public.  We understand that that order is not necessary, that there is no issue of security which concerns you in this regard, and that you would like your pseudonym to be -- the order for protection to be revoked.  

Could you let us know what your position is, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Indeed, I pointed out that I did not need the protection.  I have accepted to testify as an unprotected witness because I do not see any reason for being protected.  My identity can be revealed, and I take responsibility for whatever I will say before this Court.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you testified in any other cases before?  
THE WITNESS:
No, this is the first time I am appearing before this Tribunal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
Merci. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We make the order revoking the protection order we made in favour of this witness.  

Before you testify you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Jonas Maniliho in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

Mr. Weyl, you may proceed.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
JONAS MANILIHO,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, first of all, I'm going to -- start by greeting you.  Good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	I will ask you to tell the Court what your name is, your family name and your first name.  And, if possible, spell the name.  
A.	My first name is Jonas.  My family name is Maniliho, M-A-N-I-L-I-H-O.  Maniliho, Jonas. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, can you please look at the identification sheet before you.  It has some information:  Your name, your date of birth, your place of birth.  Can you please check the information, make sure that it doesn't contain any error.  If it contains any error, please kindly correct such errors and point them out.  

If the information sheet does not contain any errors, I would request you to date this document of 26 October 2010, and then to sign it at the appropriate place.  Thereafter, I will ask the Chamber to admit it into evidence.  
A.	I have read the document; I have reviewed it.  Apparently all the information therein is correct.  I therefore date and sign it.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would request the Chamber to kindly admit into evidence this document as Exhibit D. NG146.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG146 admitted) 
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, whilst the registry is showing the document to the parties, I would like to make some recommendations.  

You are French speaking; I am French speaking as well.  My answers and answers will have to your questions -- my questions and your answers will have to be translated by those who -- for those who, 
in this court, are English speaking.  Therefore you should allow time for translation.  In other words, you will have to pause after my questions before giving an answer.  

I would request that you speak at a slow pace to facilitate the work of the interpreters and courtroom reporters who have to record your evidence.  Furthermore, I would also request you to spell out the proper nouns when we come across them for the first time, and especially when they are not well known.  

Have you understood my recommendations?  If yes, can you kindly confirm that.  
A.	I have understood all the recommendations you made.  I will endeavour to comply with them, but I would like to advise that regarding the pace of speaking, I have an inherent -- I have an inherent disadvantage.  I was practically a stammerer, but I'm not -- so please do not hesitate if I do not comply with your recommendation regarding the pace of delivery.  I have that defect from birth.  So do not exist if you notice -- do not hesitate to draw my attention if I speak too fast.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Maniliho, for those clarifications.  Obviously I will not fail to draw your attention to the need to comply with these rules of the game.  The other parties will also do so.  If the pace of delivery becomes too fast, of course we will let you know. 

Mr. Maniliho, are you a Swiss national of Rwandan origin; am I correct?  
A.	Yes, you are.  
Q.	Can you tell this Court which part of Rwanda you hail from. 
A.	I hail from what at the time was referred to or known as the Cyeru commune.  Today it's called Burera district, but in the past it was C-Y-E-R-U, Cyeru commune.  It was in the Ruhengeri préfecture in the north of the country.  
Q.	I thank you.  Can you tell the Court in brief, please, what your academic background is, educational background, what certificates you obtained in Rwanda.  
A.	You talked of my educational background.  I will begin with -- well, I will begin right from the beginning.  I went to the minor seminary in Rwesero from 1974 to 1981.  I entered the national university of Rwanda from 1981 to 1986, and I graduated from that university with a degree in management sciences.  

As a professional, at the end of my studies at the university -- the national university of Rwanda, I was employed as a finance officer at that (inaudible) institute in Rwanda in November 1986.  I remained there until 1989, and thereafter I went to work at the chamber of commerce and industries of Rwanda.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, perhaps you may have to slow down a little bit.  
A.	Thank you. 
Q.	You may continue, Mr. Maniliho, but at a much more -- slower pace.  
A.	After the chamber of commerce and industry of Rwanda, the -- Rwanda engaged -- or, undertook a project for which it obtained financing from the World Bank to -- the project was a complete structural adjustment programme which was under way.  The project was called national project for social action.  I applied for employment and I was employed as a financial director at that project, in one aspect of the project which was called the labour-intensive aspect of the project.  Until April 1994 I was still working in that component of the project.  
Q.	Can you describe to us the purpose of that project and how it was managed.  
A.	As I said in my outline, Rwanda received financing from the World Bank.  This was not only in Rwanda; you had the same thing in other countries.  So the World Bank had conceived what it called structural adjustment programmes.  The programme, by its very nature, caused a lot of harm among the population, and even for the economy of the country.  So much so that to survive in Rwanda it became very difficult.  So, very often, the bank would have an accompanying programme which is known -- in Rwanda this was known as social action, in a (inaudible) to mitigate the harmful effects of the structural adjustment programme.  It is in this context that this project was put under way.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, who administered -- or, who managed the programme?  Was it Rwandan authorities; was it managed by other institutions, other people?  Who was in charge of implementing the programme?  
A.	In fact, the project had three partners.  Rwanda, as the country that negotiated for the project, was supposed to be the beneficiary -- in fact, it was the beneficiary of the project.  The donor was the World Bank, but the management was entrusted to institutions that were -- had experience in the area, like UNDP, the FAO, and so on.  So it was managed by three parties, but it was the responsibility of Rwanda to negotiate for the funds.  

I do not know whether I have adequately answered your question or if you need further clarifications.  If so, I am ready to provide them.  
Q.	No, I thank you; further clarifications are not necessary.  

Mr. Maniliho, can you tell the Court where your offices were located, where the headquarters of PNAS -- that is national programme for social action, in French abbreviated as PNAS.  
A.	The PNAS, the branch in which I was working was labour intensive and it had its headquarters in the building belonging to Mr. Kabuga, Félicien, on the third and fourth floors on the road to Muhima around the southern end -- exit from Kigali town.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, you therefore carried out your professional activities in that building which is said to belong to Kabuga, located in Muhima; am I correct? 
A.	You are correct.  It is not because it is referred to as the Kabuga building; it is indeed the Kabuga property.  That property, that building, belonged to Kabuga.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, for the benefit of the Bench, can you describe that building and its surroundings; was it a small building?  Was it away from the public?  Can you describe the building and specify its surroundings.  
A.	It was a building which could not go unnoticed.  It was an immense building erected on a large piece of land.  It was surrounded by two main roads, two main access roads to the country.  On one -- or, rather, on the south you had the road going to Kigali town for the transportation of -- or, rather, for heavy vehicles.  On the other side you had the main road going to Kigali from all the regions of the country, except the eastern regions of Kibungo.  

So the building -- I believe all those who know Kigali also know that building.  It was gigantic, I must say.  It was high; I believe it had more than five levels, five floors.  It was a building which could not go unnoticed.  In fact, it was huge.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, apart from the two roads -- two major roads surrounding the building, were there other buildings or institutions from which one could have a view of the Kabuga building?  
A.	The building was overlooking all that was in the vicinity.  For example, it was opposite the Kigali public market, a market which is highly used by many people.  It was near a primary school in Muriba (sic), in the secteur office of Muhima.  It was near the park for vehicles, the second public park of Rwanda.  Because there was another one, Nyabugongo (sic), so it was near Nyabugongo.  I do not know what else I should specify.  In any case, the building was overlooking everything in the neighbourhood where it was built.  From everywhere in the neighbourhood you could see the building, even from the ministry of plan you could see the building, even though the ministry of plan was at the much higher level.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, the PNAS, was it the only institution in that building, or were there -- were there other tenants sharing that building?  
A.	No, I pointed out that the building was huge.  Apart from the PNAS project in which I was working, the ground floor was occupied by Mr. Kabuga himself where he did business.  I know that next to us there was a project by the ministry of health.  There you had what was referred to as the PPF, it was a project for studying the possibility of creating a project in the ministry of health, the World Bank was pre-financing that project, they were working next to us.  

I know that behind, if you went around the windows, you could see, I believe, a building which could be considered -- or, rather, which was rented by the United Nations Mission for -- UNAMIR, united -- the UNAMIR.  It was rented as a depot for its equipment, UNAMIR equipment.  

Was there any other tenant in the Kabuga building?  As far as I can remember -- well, these are the people I remember.  If there were other tenants it is possible, but I do not remember them.  But these are the tenants of the building that I remember.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  When you were present, when you were in the premises of your employer, did you see an assembly of the youth wing of the MRND in Kabuga's building?  
A.	I did not see them in that building.  I'm categoric on this, that I did not see them in that building.  We had to organise some meetings of entrepreneurs who came to negotiate contact -- contracts with us, but they were not young, they were not MRND members; they were just businesspersons who came to negotiate contracts with us.  I did not see any MRND member in that building. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, were you regularly present in that building, or did you have to work outside?  
A.	As financial director, my duties kept me in the office.  We were not yet at that phase where I had to go to monitor work on the field to verify if what I was being told corresponds to what is on the field.  So all the time that I spent was in the office.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, according to Prosecution witnesses, military training sessions took place in the Kabuga building.  Did you witness any such military training sessions?  
A.	I have told you that the building was rented by several companies, including our own.  The only soldiers that I was able to see were soldiers of UNAMIR who came either to warehouse their equipment or to recover their equipment which had been stocked in the building -- the building below.  I did not see any sign to indicate that there was military training.  I would have thought that such training would involve gunshots, but I did not hear any.  So I did not witness any military training in the vicinity of the building in which I worked.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, did any other occupant of the building tell you that they saw -- they witnessed military training in the building?  
A.	To tell you quite honestly, to give you a definitive answer to your question, this is the first time that I am hearing about military training within that building.  So I did not hear any such thing.  I am hearing -- you are telling me for the first time today.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I am done with that question.  

Now, on account of the layout of the building, on account of its location, and on account of the surroundings, was it possible to hold any military gathering without drawing attention of occupants of the buildings and the neighbours?  
A.	I have described to you the location of the building.  To get there -- you get there in full view of everybody.  We were there and I did not see anything.  Even though -- I'm not saying that if I did not see it, it did not exist.  But, looking at the building, it is impossible for any discreet or secret activity to have been -- to be carried out.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, up to what point did you work in the Kabuga building? 
A.	This was up until when no one had access to that building in Kigali, that is 7th April 1994.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, thank you.  

Mr. Maniliho, did you -- were you engaged in any political activities in Rwanda?  And, if yes, tell the Court what these activities were.  
A.	Like all Rwandans, up until the advent of multiparty system, I was a member of the MRND.  We were told that everybody was a member.  You did not have to apply.  

When multiparty system came, I played a modest role because I was a member of 70 Rwandans who started a process of reflection on a multiparty system to see if we could force the -- put pressure on the government to accept this democratic view of things.  At that time I initiated, and freely joined, the movement for -- the MDR, which was accepted later on as a party when multiparty system was accepted in Rwanda.  But, on account of my activities, I think I was just a member.  I did not hold any position of responsibility.  I was a member; I joined freely.  And that from its very inception.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, am I to understand that you were a member of the MDR?  
A.	That precisely is what I'm saying.  
Q.	Were you an ordinary member or did you hold any positions of responsibility?  
A.	I told you that I did not hold any known position; I was an ordinary member.  My time did not allow me to hold any position of responsibility.  
Q.	Tell the Court:  Under what circumstances did you decide to join, and how did you proceed to get to the state of membership?  
A.	I will try to summarise.  As an intellectual I was interested in the development of my country.  The movement of democratisation of a country through several parties concerned us.  La Baule conference came to support our ideas, and a small group of Rwandans -- a small group of 70 Rwandans, including myself, decided to put pressure on the Rwandan government to accept the world trend, so that the country is not governed by a single party.  I joined that movement as a result of the existing -- prevailing circumstances, that is, at the conference of La Baule, and that led us to accept the principle.  

If I should digress a bit -- I think what I said should be enough, because I might be too lengthy in my explanations.  
Q.	Did you envisage... (no interpretation).  
A.	When we started this group of reflection to see how to bring the multi-system -- the multiparty system, we thought about a name, we thought about Inkotanyi.  Inkotanyi is democracy -- democracy, or anything that struggles for democracy.  That reflection started earlier.  We were attacked in 1990, and the force that attacked Rwanda at the time was -- had the same name.  So because of that we took another name.  The meaning is as democracy, it is about the same meaning but it is a name that we took from our history which reflected the thinking that we had in our party. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, let me ask you to speak more slowly and to spell the names that you have -- the Kinyarwanda words that you have used so that they can be transcribed.  
A.	Thank you, once again, for your indulgence.  

I used two Rwanda words, Kinyarwanda words.  Inkotanyi:  I-N-K -- I-N-K-O-T-A-N-Y-I.  That is the name we took initially.  But we had to discard that name because our country was attacked by an armed force that had the same name.  So we took the name Imirimbanyi -- I-M-I-R-I-M-B-A-N-Y-I, Imirimbanyi za democracy.  It is the historical name for our movement, the MDR. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  You did say that you were an ordinary member of the party and that you did not have the time to undertake other, more time-consuming activities within the party.  But did you, all the same, attend rallies?  Did you attend public rallies that your movement organised?  
A.	That was the least -- that was the very least for members of the party.  I did not have the time to hold a position of responsibility but, as much as possible, I attended important public rallies of the movement, particularly rallies organised within my native region.  Because the party, like everywhere else, had regional bases.  So we, first of all, start from a region.  There were members of the party at the regional level.  And then, at a point in time, we met at the national level.  So in my own region I never missed any public rally of the MDR -- to the point that at the professional level I stood the risk of having a problem, because I attended a rally which was held on a working day.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, as a member of the MDR, were you also interested in the political activities of other parties in this proliferation of political parties?  Did you seek to know the positions of other political parties? 
A.	Well, obviously we were not indifferent to what was happening within the country.  But when you said "political expression" of the parties, I did not know what you mean.  Can you further explain that?  
Q.	I'm thinking about public statements of the various party leaders, publications, radio statements.  Did you keep abreast with such developments?  
A.	I was more interested in the statements that were made in our own movement, MDR rallies.  When rallies of other political parties was covered by radio I could follow them, just like anyone else, if I had time to do so.  

Now, talking about analysis, that was not -- it was not for me to carry out such analysis.  That was a task best done by the leaders of the party.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  You did say that you joined the MDR freely.  Will that mean that others may have joined the MDR in a less free -- in a less freer manner, or under duress?  And if yes, can you explain that to the Chamber.  
A.	Well, in any event, I joined the MDR freely.  I wanted to and I had the will.  But probably just as all mistake -- just as mistakes happen in the beginning, happen everywhere, I know that our party was launched in Gitarama in the centre of the country, and that was the main region of the party.  And anyone -- the MDR -- or, that region was the fief of the MDR.  And anybody who was not in the MDR was not accepted.  

So we wanted people to join our party and we were going to -- the objective was for each party to have as many members as possible before we go to the elections.  The case that I know, more specifically my own party, I know that members of the MDR, PSD who were in the Gitarama region were normally -- normally isolated themselves to join the MDR, which was the biggest party in that region.  I spoke about the case that I know, but probably this happens elsewhere and in the opposite direction.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, this practice, did this have any specific name?  
A.	In the MDR it was called Kumoza (sic).  But Kubohoza could have other meanings.  Kubohoza is what I have just described.  But it could also be a kind of looting -- looting in the sense that you are trying to convince somebody to join your party so as to get him to -- if -- in cases where people were hesitant, one way was to take their belongings, or to threaten them in one way or the other, or to say, for example, "You will have not have this or that contract," if you are a businessman.  But, in any case, it was referred to as Kubohoza.  
Q.	So it was a widespread practice which targeted more specifically, if that is the case -- which political party was more specifically targeted, to your knowledge?  
A.	I have told you that the purpose of this exercise is that each party wanted to have as many members as possible before the elections were held.  For that reason, each party, wherever it had influence, forced the others to join its own party.  

In the specific case of Rwanda, the parties had their own bases.  I know that I -- I made reference to the MDR, which had a base in Gitarama; there was PSD, which had a base in Butare; there was the MRND, on account of its history, had members everywhere.  So you will understand that they had less in Gitarama, and you will understand that they had less in Butare.  But each party, where it felt it had its influence, could carry out this practice to draw its -- to draw minimum members from other parties.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  As a member of the MDR and as an observer of the political life of your party, did you observe the changes in the political situation in Rwanda in the course of the years 1992-1993?  And, more specifically, did you observe any changes within your political party?  
A.	Obviously I monitored the changes within the political movement in Rwanda, particularly in my own party.  Multiparty system came at the wrong time, at a time that we were involved in an external war from a neighbouring country, and that was another reason -- I think that it would have been difficult for anyone to carry out a war on two fronts.  

Of course, I'm not saying that the advent of democracy is a war, but it was a time that a country is -- in a way, I can refer to the advent of democracy and multiparty system as a war, in quotes.  It was difficult to manage because we were at the same time fighting a military war from the outside.  This was -- these were Rwandans -- Rwandans who were outside.  Their name was RPF.  For somebody who wanted to take power, such a pressure was an advantage that anyone could take advantage of to put more pressure on the person in power.  There was an opposition -- there were opposition parties, 
like -- like mine who saw this thing -- who saw things in the same manner, they saw the RPF as a factor that could help them to get rid of the party in power, that is, the MRND.  

But this perception of things was not the same for everybody.  Let me state that for those of us that came from the north of the country where the war -- the RPF war started, we realised that this war had nothing good for the country.  So we considered the RPF that was attacking the country as a partner to bring democracy.  But we saw that that was an error.  But there were other members of the MDR who had a different perception of things.  They thought that they should align themselves with the RPF to dislodge the government in power.  

This brought a split within our party.  Some considered that they could collaborate with the RPF to dislodge the government; others thought that to align themselves with the RPF was a wrong perception of things and that might aggravate things.  And that is what brought a split within the MDR, and that split came to the fore -- happened in other opposition parties at varying degrees.  But the PSD and other parties had the same.  

I have been very lengthy in my explanation, but I believe I have been clear.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, you have been very clear.  But, listening to you, I face a problem.  In April 1992, who was the prime minister in Rwanda?  In April 1992?  
A.	You have to -- you have to understand me, because I do not have the dates accurately.  I think if there was a prime minister there must have been -- it must have been Dismas Nsengumera (sic) of the MDR.  But there was another prime minister of the MDR.  But if you are referring to 1992 it was Dismas Nsengumere (sic) who was prime minister. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, you did say that he was a member of the MDR? 
A.	Yes, at the top level.  
Q.	And this minister was a member of which party?  
A.	It is clear that it is the government party.  When you say "these ministers", this was a minister -- this was government involving all the political parties.  The MDR was there, MRND was involved, PSD was involved.  But the prime minister also had his group from the same party as he himself within the government.  That is obvious.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I'm sorry, but I was telling you that -- when -- it was when I was listening to you that this came to my mind.  Because you are talking about "opposition", but the opposition was in government at the time.  
A.	I can explain that that can be referred to as a transitional government.  In fact, it was not to govern the country.  The govern was -- the country was governed solely by the MRND.  The MRND had a lot of influence, and we needed to give time to the people to prepare themselves for the existence of the other parties.  And the best way to do it was to form a government which included all political parties, so that we can have a time to prepare the people to accept the existence of several parties.  

That is how we saw things.  And that is how come we referred to these parties as opposition parties.  That is not to be compared with what obtains in the western countries where the party -- a party wins elections, they are in government -- only its members are in government.  We were not yet at that stage.  It was a stage prior to elections.  
Q.	If I understand you correctly, what was referred to as "opposition political parties" were parties opposed to the MRND, but opposition parties were sitting in the government.  
A.	I would like to point out once more, even if I have to repeat myself:  Yes, there were opposition parties opposed to the MRND.  Why?  Because when they were created, it was only the MRND that was in power.  The fact that these opposition parties were in government did not mean that they had given up their opposition views.  It was simply a transitional phase so that -- so that elections could be prepared, and therefore to come to a situation where a party which won the elections would govern according to its programme.  But we were not yet at that stage.  And the running of the matters of state were entrusted to all important parties.  This -- but you still felt that there was some opposition, even in the exercise of power jointly.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  Do you remember what happened in June 1992?  I have in mind the manner in which the parties you referred to as opposition parties were able to strike alliances, negotiate alliances.  
A.	I think I have made reference to that matter.  I have even elaborated on it when I was talking about 
	a --- schisms in parties, or splits within parties.  And it is -- that is when you had some opposition parties that sought to align with the RPF, the RPF having the advantage of having weapons and therefore exerting power -- or, pressure on the -- on the government.  Or -- to -- those of us who had the experience of the RPF having attacked the country, we thought that it was not good to align with the RPF.  

Some went to the very end.  They elicited meetings with the RPF.  You talked about a meeting in June, but there were two meetings, in fact:  One in Brussels, where our country had the misfortune of having representatives -- that is my personal view; there was another meeting with Twagira (sic), Faustin; there was yet another meeting in Bujumbura.  This was a manner of showing that opposition parties wanted to align with the RPF so as to evict the existing regime. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, to your knowledge, and as far as you can remember, what happened, from a military standpoint, during the period that followed these alliances -- alliances between the RPF and some opposition parties -- some opposition parties that had members in government?  Do you remember what happened, from a purely military point of view, after the signing of the Brussels accords? 
A.	I -- please stop me if you have the impression that I did not understand your question.  But I told you the entire process of restoring democracy which we launched took place when the country was at war.  I am not informing you, giving you any new information if I tell you that it was guerrilla warfare which prevailed during that time.  There were negotiations in an attempt to find solutions to that war.  

As you referred to the military aspect, since we were in war there were sporadic attacks.  But immediately after one of those meetings the RPF started hostilities in an intensive manner.  In fact, they even penetrated deeper into the country in Ruhengeri and in part of Byumba.  I -- that is an historical event, an event recorded in history.  

I do not know whether I have answered your question properly, because I was not able to establish a direct link.  But this happened concomitantly.  This attack followed the meeting, rather.  I do not know whether I understood your question.  If you think I did not understand it...  
Q.	Yes, yes, Mr. Maniliho, I think you understood your (sic) question, and your explanations are clear.  But they refer me to other questions, they lead to other questions.  

From June 1992 there was a government comprising ministers from various political parties.  Those parties signed agreements with the RPF.  The RPF attacked Rwanda.  How did the Rwandans feel in that situation?  Did they ask themselves questions on the patriotism, loyalty of political parties which, on the one hand, signed agreements with the RPF and, on the other hand, were sitting in the government?  
A.	Your question is very relevant.  I myself asked myself that question, and it sort of revolted me in my political life.  As a matter of fact, it shows the Rwandan paradox, and the limitations as to what we wanted to do, the limitations of transition parties or the exercise of power by opposition parties.  One had the impression that you had a government which did not pursue the same goal, a common goal.  Normally that was not my idea of managing the affairs of state.  You should all be working for the interests of the country, or you withdraw.  

In our case, it was clear that the government was making efforts to obtain peace.  But we also had the impression that there were traitors amongst them who were telling the RPF, "attack".  Perhaps that is what we want.  This was not at all patriotic; in any case, that is my point of view.  And, of course, we can see where that double attitude, that duplicity led us.  

Before you continue, perhaps to shed more light on my thinking, I know that the transition government was led by the MDR, but I heard the president of the MDR, after those negotiations, saying, "Even if one of the préfectures of the country falls into the hands of RPF fighters, where is the problem?  What is abnormal with that?"  So he -- that -- he said, "Even if the RPF took the préfectures of Ruhengeri and Byumba, where is the problem?"  For someone who likes his country, this embarrassed the people. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I thank you.  You talked about the attack of Rwanda by the RPF.  Did that attack last forever, or did it stop at any point in time?  
A.	When there is an attack -- when there is a war there are always belligerents.  The RPF, as I have pointed out, was carrying out guerrilla warfare.  It attacked wherever it had the possibility of doing so, or where it thought it was favourable, it was in a favourable position that on the ground it came across resistance, relative resistance.  

The -- at some point in time the war stopped, but even when it stopped they knew that they could attack at another moment.  So I cannot tell you whether the attack stopped because the RPF stopped, or whether it was because they were compelled to retreat.  

I pointed out that they were not on conquered land; there was, nevertheless, the armed forces of the government, of the country.  And when the RPF attacked, they didn't just walk through.  I do not know whether they decided to stop, whether -- because it was -- they did so out of their will or because they met resistance on the ground.  

In any case, the -- they attacked later on, on other occasions.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, do you remember what happened in February 1993?  
A.	February 1993, I think there was another attack, I would imagine.  I think there was yet another RPF attack -- no, unless I'm making a mistake.  But it is not a mistake.  I do not know whether you want me to mention that event.  
Q.	Indeed, Mr. Maniliho, it was an attack which occurred on the 8th of February 1993 -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl -- Mr. Weyl, you cannot lead the witness.  He has virtually said he doesn't know, that he imagines something happened.  You cannot put it in his mouth now.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, perhaps you could clarify what you yourself mentioned in February 1993.  
A.	In February 1993, the RPF, as usual, attacked.  The RPF, I believe, attacked in the Ruhengeri area.  They destroyed infrastructure, particularly the power plant that provided electricity to the country.  They killed civilians in Ruhengeri.  They opened a big prison, an important prison.  They killed many civilians.  I personally lost members of my extended family.  Not my wife or child, but members of my extended family.  

I think I could stop there.  You would understand the nature of the attack.

1015H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, how did the officials of your party react to those events, if you remember?  What was 
	their stance? 
A.	As a matter of fact, on that occasion everyone -- well, I believe many people in the country had understood this well before, but we started getting some reactions from certain people, particularly from the leaders of our party.  

The then prime minister, Nsengiyaremye, Dismas, in a public statement made during a rally, he warned the RPF.  He said -- well, he didn't say.  He officially said, as far as I can remember, that if the RPF continues attempting to take power by force, the country was capable of mobilising one million 
young people who are ready to take up arms against the RPF.  This was a way of perhaps warning the RPF that the country had felt that their intentions were not as democratic as they claim because 
in spite of the accords, they continued destroying the property and the infrastructure of the country, but that warning was made by the then prime minister as a member of the party because it was during a party rally.  But, in any case, he was the sitting prime minister.  He was addressing the RPF.  And he said the country -- he didn't say the MDR -- he said the country was capable of mobilising one million young people ready to take up arms against the RPF.  This statement was -- brought some unity amongst the population, the people who were among the population which was thinking that the country had been betrayed or sold.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, do you think that by making that utterance or statement, Mr. Nsengiyaremye was making an appeal for hatred, extermination, or was he expressing something else? 
A.	In was not a matter of hatred.  As I heard, I did not need any translator.  In fact, he spoke in my 
	national language.  I believe what he said -- and there was no hind thought to what he said.  He said, "We are capable of mobilising one million young people.  This means that RPF, if you think that you can take over the country by force, you will not be able to do that."  In fact, it was a dissuasive measure.  It was a matter of telling them, let us continue working together for the development of the country.  But now you are showing that this is not your intention because after you have -- we have signed the accords you are attacking the country.  And if you continue along those lines, you remember that you will not succeed.  I imagine that this is the message that he was giving out.  In any case, that was the perception of the country, that the country heard of it.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, should this be taken as an indication that the country would defend itself against an attack? 
A.	In fact, in very clear terms, that is what the prime minister wanted to say.  It was as if he was saying that -- well, if the moment was appropriate, it was as if he was saying, "Young people of this country, you have been attacked.  Be ready to defend yourself if the RPF continues attacking the country."  As far as I am concerned, this is another way -- not of interpreting, but of giving the message.  In fact, he gave this message officially.  The message was aired over the radio.  It was intended for the RPF.  

Now, those who understood it, they understood it as meaning that young people, you have been attacked and be ready to defend yourselves against the attack.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, do you know whether during the time referred to, there was talk of putting in place a 
	civil defence programme in Rwanda -- a civil defence programme against the RPF attack?  
A.	The message was clear, as far as I am concerned.  It was not a matter of -- well, I will use 
	your language -- it was not a matter of creating a civil defence programme, but in all armies of the world old people are not recruited.  You don't recruit children.  You recruit young people.  He referred to the young people of the country, not of a specific party, the young people of the entire country of all 
	political parties.  Therefore, this was an appeal for hatred.  It may be an appeal to young people because they are the ones who are capable of fighting.  I have not seen any army in the world that recruits old people.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I thank you.  

Mr. Maniliho, a while ago you talked about acts of violence perpetrated by the RPF in the areas they penetrated, in the areas under their control.  Can you shed more light on this, on what you have in mind, and perhaps maybe give some examples.  
A.	Yes.  Yes, I can do that.  Unfortunately -- I told you that I hail from the north of the country.  The RPF attack came from Uganda in the north of the country.  We had the misfortune in our area of being in that area.  Therefore, if I go back to the background or the history, they attacked believing that they were going to take over the country in a few days.  So they launched a conventional war.  They entered via Gitumba.  
	
	When they were compelled to retreat, they engaged in guerilla warfare.  This consisted of 
	sporadic attacks, occasional attacks where they were not expected, where the army was not expecting them.  And during such attacks, they did a lot of damage on their passage.  They killed civilians, defenceless civilians, men, women and children, all the people.  Those who were not killed were constrained to go into exile.  Barely one year after the attack, there were many miserable people inside the country.  That did not dissuade them from carrying out subsequent attacks.  They still operated in the same manner.  The peculiarity of guerilla warfare is that you attack where people are not expecting you and where there were only civilians.  In spite of everything, we saw dead people.  This means that they killed civilians knowing that they were not armed.  The war continued.  It lasted four years.  

At the time the Arusha negotiations started -- unless I am mistaken -- at some point in time there was a point regarding which it was said that -- well, since we have started negotiations everybody should keep the positions they are holding at present.  Unfortunately, our area was under the RPF because the RPF had occupied it for some time.  So they remained in our area for six -- for more than six months.  And we said that we were not going to abandon that area.  We said that, nevertheless, we were going to put up some administrative facilities or structures. 

The RPF had the opportunity of being known in that area because they occupied it, even if they occupied it as an empty area because they had driven a good part of the population.  That area already had witnessed the existence of former parties that had been created inside the country.  So we carried out the experiment to see whether the RPF-- if they finally signed a peace agreement in Arusha, whether their leaders could be elected.  They put up candidates like any other party in that area.  I am referring to Kinihira and Karambo area, in my area of origin.  The RPF put up candidates for elections of the commune.  The RPF presented candidates and the MRND also.  

Now, what happened?  What was the outcome of the voting?  In my area of origin, in Kihiru, it is an MDR bourgmestre who was elected.  In Nyamugali, next door, it was an MRND bourgmestre who was elected and no RPF member had even a single vote.  So they said, "Well, whatever we do, we will not be listened to in this country."  

Two or three days after the elections, at night, there was an RPF attack which was -- which targeted the newly elected persons.  The newly elected -- the bourgmestre of Nyamugali commune was killed.  
The bourgmestre of Cyeru commune was attacked in his house, but, fortunately, he was not there and the person who lived in his house on that day was killed.  Other authorities who had been elected during the same elections were killed.  

And the following day it was general panic.  UNAMIR, which was in charge of security in the area said:  "We are going to carry out an investigation that will reveal the perpetrators of the killings."  But to date we are still waiting for the findings of the investigation.  However, the identity of the perpetrators of the attacks is not subject to doubt.  It was known that the area was under the military control of the RPF.  The Rwandan government intervened because this was the outcome of the Arusha Accords.  So the only -- rather, the RPF-- the government could not intervene.  So the only persons that could move about in that area was the RPF, and people had been killed with firearms, without any investigation -- well, some institutions required investigations.  But for those of us who hailed from the region, who had interests there, who knew people there, we know who perpetrated the killings.  This is just one example among others, but it is the one that struck me most.  It took place in my area and we were not able to do anything.  No one was able to do anything about it.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I thank you.  

Mr. Maniliho, during the period referred to, are you aware of who -- of those who criticised the 
RPF position, and do you know what happened to them? 
A.	We -- you talked about the Ruhengeri attack.  Among the damages caused by that attack, I talked about the destruction of the electricity plant in Nyaruka.  At the time referred to, in fact, that plant was part of the public works ministry led by the PSD, an opposition party.  The secretary general was Felicién Gatabazi, G-A-T-A-B-A-Z-I.  

Since he was minister of infrastructure, in other words, of public works -- in other words, he was in charge of the electricity plant, he was horrified by that attack.  He visited the plant to see the damage done.  And during his visit, he made a speech.  In the speech, he said, "I do not understand the conduct of the RPF.  On the one hand, they tell us they are coming to help us to ensure -- to introduce democracy in the country, but what they are doing is to destroy the things that we acquired with great difficulty.  This conduct is incomprehensible and we appeal to RPF to stop such activities."  

Since he made that speech -- well, normally, he was well perceived by the RPF.  They could be heard over Radio Muhabura.  But from the following day, Radio Muhabura started demonising him, started putting him in the category of people referred to as Power, in other words, people who were radical, who belonged to radical wings of various parties.  Of course, what happened to Gatabazi is well known, but we think that whatever happed to him is linked to the stance he took.  What happened to him, we know it.  He died.  He was murdered.  We think that was one of the direct consequences of the stance he took.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Maniliho.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, perhaps the time has come for us to take the morning recess.  I am in your hands, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take our mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1030H to 1104H)
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I thank you.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, we are going to resume.  

During the recess I was told that in spite of my recommendations that you are still going a little bit too fast in your explanations.  So I reiterate our wish, namely, that you should slow down so as to facilitate the work of the interpreters and courtroom reporters.  

Mr. Maniliho, earlier on we mentioned the actions of the RPF.  To your knowledge, what was the situation of displaced persons? 
A.	First of all, regarding the recommendations as to the pace of delivery, I would try to make an effort so as to be understood as clearly as possible.  

As regard displaced persons, I am aware of their situation because there were displaced persons in 
my area.  In fact, when the RPF attacked the country, I pointed out that on its itinerary, they either killed civilians or forced them into exile.  And exile meant that they went further into the country.  When the RPF attacked, they launched their attack from Uganda.  So Uganda would have been a place for the exiles to go to, but that was not possible because the attack came from there.  So the civilians were pushed further into the hinterland.  

Since the attack against the country was heading for Kigali and for understandable reasons because quite often when the population heard this they felt that the security is where the government authorities are.  So displaced persons moved to Kigali.  They moved towards the capital city.  

The situation became quite serious when there was a shameful camp in the vicinity or in the neighbourhoods of a town.  That camp was located at Nyacyonga -- N-Y-A-C-Y-O-N-G-A.  

The Nyacyonga camp was a centre which should have been a shame to the whole world.  There you saw people dying from hunger.  You saw those who were fleeing, but no one made any effort whatsoever.  The country did not have enough means.  But I have also -- I also believe that the international community did not mobilise to come to the aid of these displaced persons in 
Nyacyonga camp.  This type of camp -- well, the most well-known camp was the Nyacyonga camp, but there were similar camps on the passages or the itinerary of the RPF.  

What else can I say about the displaced persons?  Well, they were miserable.  No one came to their aid.  They no longer felt as if they were in their own country even though they had the same rights as others.  What repulsed me personally is that even fellow compatriots, Rwandans in Kigali, could not help them.  But they could not even express their sympathy, but they didn't do that.  In any case, I did not notice that.  We were looking for power, but we did not know who the power should be -- in favour of whom the power should be exercised.
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  

This crowd of displaced persons, did it have any consequences on the security situation, as far as you know? 
A.	Obviously, yes.  Obviously, yes.  Why?  Because these people famished.  They invaded the capital city to engage in begging, a phenomenon that the country had never experienced.  
	Furthermore, I told you that when the RPF started this, they started with a conventional war.  When things didn't turn up well for them they engaged in guerilla warfare.  And guerilla warfare technics include, as it is said, it is the war of the weak.  In guerilla warfare you use tricks and these tricks include camouflage, hiding, disguising yourself.  

So moving about was -- well, as I -- this was an ideal occasion for the RPF to disguise themselves to come to the capital city as if they were displaced persons in order to invade the capital and facilitate conquest of the city without weapons.  They took up positions without making any noise, without any agitation.  

While the number of displaced camps increased, insecurity increased.  We started hearing explosions of grenades here and there, as some people attributed these explosions to thieves.  But, in fact, they were not caused by thieves.  We did not witness armed robbery in my country.  It was clear that all of this was the consequence of this phenomenon, that is a phenomenon of displaced persons who were infiltrated by the RPF. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I thank you.  Did the security situation evolve favourably with the signing of 
	Arusha Accords?  
A.	Not at all.  Not at all.  In fact, with the signing of the Arusha Accords, I believe I did not read anywhere, but as an intellectual, I was following up what -- the comments that were made.  It would appear that during the negotiations, since it had been agreed to put in place a transition government which was also comprised of the RPF, the RPF laid down conditions, conditions which, moreover, could be understood; namely, that for it to be part of the transitional government, it was necessary for it to be assured that its members would be protected.  And the best protection they could expect was their own protection or the interposition of an international force.  Otherwise, they proposed -- since they were occupying part of the territory, particularly Kinihira, they proposed, I believe, to amuse the public that the government should go and work in Kinihira where there were no facilities, neither houses nor anything else.  It was clear that this was a way of suspending the negotiations.
Q.	What happened thereafter?  
A.	I told you that they had demanded that the government go and work in Kinihira, or if they had to come to Kigali, that they be given the possibility of bringing in a battalion of 600 troops in Kigali to protect its members or else failing the 600 troops, the UNAMIR troops should come in as a force separating the belligerents.  For unknown reasons, perhaps for some other reasons, they had both the battalion and the presence of the UNAMIR, whereas in the agreements, it was either one or the other, not both at the same time.  

The RPF troops in Kigali -- their presence in Kigali had unexpected consequences.  They started -- or they became capricious.  They said they cannot eat food available in Kigali, that they did not know 
the source of the food, that they were going to get food from their place.  Their place was where? 
(This was Mulindi where they had set up their headquarters).  They said they were going to look for firewood from their place in Mulindi.  They said they were going to look for water to drink from their place, Mulindi.  

And since the security of the town was ensured by UNAMIR, it is UNAMIR that was in a position to know where these people were.  When they took lorries to go and fetch wood -- I told you we were in Kabuga building which overlooks the road going to Mulindi --.we used to see lorries going empty and we would see the vehicles or lorries returning with wood and soldiers.  The lorries would go empty and come back with soldiers.  I did not have access to the place where they were based, but I am sure that at the end of one or two months, their numbers doubled.  Was the contraband on to the extent that they could not witness that or be aware of that phenomenon?  I do not know.  But for a population that didn't have weapons, who were very worried, the situation bothered us.  But we had a feeling that the authorities were not worried -- were not bothered because they would have been able to do something had they been concerned by the situation. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, what do you have to say about the action of UNAMIR -- regarding the attitude of UNAMIR regarding these convoys of soldiers coming in, the security issue, what were you able to observe? 
A.	Well, in summary, I must say that their attitude was a total failure.  UNAMIR was in charge of the security of the town.  The town had moved from a relative situation of safety to total unsafety or insecurity.  I could also say that their attitude was one of complacency.  I have just told you that we 
	saw UNAMIR lorries escorting RPF.  The lorries would go empty and return full of people, troops.  I was not the one in charge of implementing the -- or carrying out the negotiations here, but we had heard that in the negotiations they were limited to one battalion.  But the number of RPF troops had become uncontrollable and UNAMIR, obviously, was aware of this because it was UNAMIR that sent those lorries.  They saw the vehicles go and return.  They saw the vehicles go empty and return full.  So one may wonder where those troops came from and why did UNAMIR allow them to come in.  What else can I say?  

I have mentioned what happened in our area when the RPF killed authorities elected in the 
buffer areas.  In fact, UNAMIR in Kigali was also responsible for ensuring transition between the RPF which occupied the buffer zone and the authorities, in any case, the few authorities that were left.  

When we were told that investigations were going to be carried out to identify the perpetrators of the killings that took place in our area, we had this declaration from the representative of the UNAMIR, but to date that report of the investigation has not come out and nobody has sought to know what happened.  And this shows some complacency or even complicity.  This is what I can say regarding the conduct of UNAMIR in Rwanda at the time referred to.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  

Mr. Maniliho, I would like to ask you where you were on the 6th of April 1994 and what 
your recollections are, what you remember of that date, that is, the 6th of April 1994.  
A.	On the 6th April 1994, I was in Gikondo.  In fact, I was in Kigali in my house.  I was in my house in Kigali, Gikondo.  The day before I was in a bar with a younger brother who was in Europe and who had to leave the day after.  We spent the evening together.  It was a quiet evening.  We returned at about 
	8 p.m. to my house, and we stayed in my house until the morning when the radio broadcast the bad news regarding the attack against the president's plane, the plane of President Habyarimana.  
Q.	What happened in Gikondo in the days that followed the attack against the plane of President Habyarimana? 
A.	In fact, when we were informed of the attack against the plane of President Habyarimana, we were told that we should all remain at home.  I told you the last time I went to office was on that day because of that event.  We were all ordered to remain home.  In the moments that followed, that is, on the 7th and the 8th, I -- Gikondo and other neighbourhoods were affected until the 8th -- until the 8th.  There were casualties in Gikondo neighbourhood, for those of you who know Gikondo, this neighbourhood is near -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if he could spell some of those names which we are not familiar with.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the interpreters are not familiar with all of these names and they requested that some of them be spelt.  
MR. WEYL:
That was also my request to the witness.  I asked him to slow down and to make sure that he spelt the proper nouns he was pronouncing.
THE WITNESS:
So as I was saying, I was in my house in Gikondo, G-I-K-O-N-D-O.  

Around the 6th -- or, rather, the 8th, in Gikondo -- in Gikondo north, there were people killed.  They were killed in their homes.  Dead bodies, corpses were found on the following day in the residences of those killed.  They were killed -- they had been killed at night.  So the entire population in the neighbourhood panicked.  In an event to reduce or mitigate the panic, an authority of Kigali-ville préfecture -- in fact, a sous-préfet of Kigali-ville préfecture -- that was Butera, Jean-Baptiste, came to hold a meeting in Gikondo to tell the population that they should not panic.  I think it is difficult to manage people who are -- who panic.  In essence, he told us:  "We are aware of what happened.  We have seen -- you also have seen what happened.  We should note one thing, our country is at war.  The country does not have enough forces to ensure everyone's security.  You all know what the forces are busy doing.  So assume your responsibilities; help the authorities to help you.  Therefore, try to carry out patrols in the various neighbourhoods, patrols comprising people that know one another, patrols conducted by people who live together in an attempt to see whether -- or, rather, to avoid a situation where unknown persons come into the neighbourhood to undermine your security.  

"Your mission consists of identifying people you do not know, people who do not live in 
your neighbourhood, people who could be brought there to carry out subversive activities like those 
that have just been noticed.  Where necessary, report those persons to the closest or nearest authorities."  This is what happened in Gikondo on - or, during the days that followed the 6th, the 
7th of April 1994.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, can you spell the name of the person who came to that meeting, please.  
A.	Once more, I have forgotten the name.  Or, rather, I forgot to spell it.  His name was Butera, B-U-T-E-R-A.  Butera, Jean-Baptiste.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho -- 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may continue.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, did Mr. Butera distribute weapons to you? 
A.	I would like to point out that he asked us to carry out patrols, patrol groups comprising people who know one another, people who live together so that ultimately, they should be able to identify unknown persons who may seek to come and undermine our security.  He did not give us weapons.  We did not need the weapons.  He added in essence:  "If you identify someone whom you suspect of not being one of you, you refer or report that person to the nearest authorities."  So we didn't need weapons to do that.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, according to the sous-préfet who came to ask you to organise yourselves in order to carry out patrols, where were those who may have been in a position to protect the population? 
A.	The sous-préfet told us where they are.  I believe I said that, but I can repeat it for better understanding.  The sous-préfet told us:  "Our country is at war.  You know where the forces of law and order are.  We cannot find other forces to protect -- enough forces to protect all of you because our forces are busy doing other things."  He did not need to tire himself out.  He said we knew where the forces of law and order were.  
Q.	And perhaps could -- it may be wise for you to tell the Court where the forces of law and order were.  
A.	The country was at war.  The forces of law and order in our country were soldiers and gendarmes.  So they were at the war front.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Maniliho.

Mr. Maniliho, who were those who took part in the patrols?  
A.	I am going to repeat that maybe for better understanding.  The sous-préfet clearly told us that the patrols were intended to ultimately identify unknown persons in the neighbourhood, persons seeking to come and undermine the security to come and attack people, as what had happened before in Gikondo.  The role of these patrols was to know who was - or, comprised people in the same neighbourhood, people who knew one another very well.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, were the patrol groups set up on the basis of membership of given political parties, political affiliations?  
A.	As you would understand, no.  When you live together, you don't necessarily -- you don't choose 
	your neighbours.  You did not choose to live where you lived because of political reasons.  
	For example, where I lived was my property which I had bought in 1988, well before the political events occurred.  There I met people who had been living there, people from all origins.  In my neighbour, there were people from various political parties, but we carried out the patrols together.  We came from various political parties, but we patrolled together.  So the only criterion was being in the same neighbourhood and knowing one another.  
Q.	Witness -- Mr. Maniliho, you said -- or, rather, you anticipated a question in my mind, and the question is:  Did the members of the patrols -- were chosen on the basis of their political belonging?
A.	Well, you would understand that I had already answered that question.  We lived together.  We came from all ethnic groups, from all political parties.  We live together.  We came from various backgrounds.  The only criterion was that we lived in the same neighbourhood, we came from different 
	geographical areas, ethnic groups and political parties.  The only criterion was that we lived in the 
	same neighbourhood and knew one another.  
Q.	Those who participated in the patrols, did they equip themselves with weapons to ensure their 
	own security, their personal safety?  
A.	We did not have weapons.  The only weapon we had was our eyes.  We, therefore, had to identify through watching whether we knew the person or not.  We did not have weapons.  We did not even express the need for weapons.  We did not need weapons.  Our mandate was not to fight anyone whosoever.  It was simply to denounce, if necessary, to report to the authorities anyone who may have infiltrated a group of people who knew one another in order to perpetrate acts of subversion to attack people as we had had the experience a day or the night earlier.

1130H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  You can see that I am pausing after your answer, because, once again, I think your pace of delivery is rather fast, at least, judging, I wouldn't say the reactions, but rather, the signs of signals coming from the courtroom reporter.  I know your difficulty, but please try to go more slowly.  
A.	Well, I think my problem is more serious than I thought.  Nevertheless, I'm going to make some 
	effort -- greater effort. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  If you had to report about any intruders, who did you have to report to? 
A.	The sous-préfet had told us the closest authority -- the nearest authority, and the nearest authority was the conseiller de secteur.  By chance, in our place in Gikondo, it was the conseiller de secteur, but the commune office wasn't far either. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, during the patrols, did you ever have to report to the authorities any case of intrusion or any incident whatsoever? 
A.	Whilst I was in Kigali, that is, from the instructions of the sous-préfet right up until my departure from Kigali, when I felt that the security situation was worsening, we did not have any case -- we did not have any intruder.  We, therefore, did not have any opportunity to make any such reports to the authorities. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  Until when did you remain in Kigali? 
A.	I remained in Kigali, if my memory doesn't fail me, until the 18th of April.  So I remained there until the 18th of April.  In other words, I remained in Kigali for about ten days. 
Q.	What are the circumstances that led you to leave and where did you go to when you left? 
A.	The circumstances are obvious, and they are that the security situation in Kigali town was worsening.  Initially, you had these killings which occurred at night in Gikondo, but as time went on, the town was bombarded almost everywhere.  Long range bullets, which were referred to as "Katioucha" fell everywhere in town and they became more and more numerous.  I felt that security in Kigali was unbearable.  I decided to save my life.  I went to Gitarama.  I would like to point out that Kigali had 
	two possible exits -- or, rather, to go out of Kigali, you either had to go to the east in Kibungo, that was not possible because that area was occupied by the RPF, or you had to go through another exit towards Byumba, Butare, Nyabugogo, that exit was also -- could not be accessed easily because the RPF, which already was occupying Mount Jingy -- J-I-N-G-Y -- that area was occupied by the RPF, which was bombarding a place called Giticyinyoni -- G-I-T-I-C-Y-I-N-Y-O-N-I.  So the bombarding took place at that place and it was -- could not be easily accessed.  So I had to take another road that goes towards the south, but on this occasion, I went via Mount Kigali.  I do not know whether I should also spell Kigali.  
Q.	It's not necessary.
A.	I went via that place to join the main road on the Nyabarongo river.  I spell Nyabarongo, N-Y-A-B-A-R-O-N-G-O.  And, subsequently, I found myself in Gitarama. 
Q.	Where were you received in Gitarama?  Where did you settle?  Where did you stay? 
A.	When I went to Gitarama, I remember that the bishop at that place, 
	Monseigneur Thaddée Nsengiyumva -- N-S-E-N-G-I-Y-U-M-V-A -- I remember that 
	Monseigneur Nsengiyumva, Thaddée, was an acquaintance, because he had been my rector whilst I was at the minor seminary.  While I was looking for a place to stay in Gitarama, I contacted the bishop who was kind enough to host me in one of the buildings of the major seminary at that location. 
Q.	Whilst you took refuge in Gitarama, did you have the opportunity of returning to Kigali?  If yes, perhaps you could elaborate on the circumstances under which you were able to return to Kigali? 
A.	As a matter of fact, when I arrived in Gitarama, where I had gone in a hurry, in a hurry because when the situation of the security situation worsened and when it became necessary for me to seek protection, in fact, in such circumstances there are things you do not think of, especially when you do not have means to transport whatever you have.  So I took whatever I could, that is, my wife and 
	two children.  I have the luck of having a vehicle and we left.  In Gitarama, I realised that we did not have enough clothes.  Therefore, I had to return in order to look for clothes in my house in Kigali.  

	A few days thereafter, two or three days after that, we no longer had food -- we ran out of food, yet I had left in my house a bag of rice,  as I usually did.  So, once more I returned to Kigali to look for some provisions, for some food.  At some point in time -- well, in Kigali, there were some services still functioning, in particular, the Banque du Kigali, the Kigali Bank, our project has its account in that bank.  Since the people were famished, I came across in that bank my director.  He asked me to do whatever we could in an attempt to pay the salaries for two months to our staff.  I did not have with me the pay list.  I went to look for that list in Kigali. These are the occasions when I was compelled to return to Kigali.  Apart from that, I did not go to Kigali at any other time.  So I went to Kigali on three occasions, to get clothes, for food and to look for the pay list for our staff.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, these returns to Kigali occurred at what time? 
A.	I left Kigali for Gitarama around the 18th of April, and I know that to -- I went towards the end of the month, beginning of May for the payroll.  For the clothes, it was a bit later, and for the rice, it was a bit later.  This is just an approximation, because the only indication I have for the salary is that it was at the end of the month.  For the clothes, I observed it was a bit earlier, before the 25th, in any case, after the 20th.  And for the provisions, it was within that period as well, and I remained in Kigali until the end of May, to go back to that general area, including Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, you said that when you left Kigali for Gitarama, you went through -- you took a road that went through Mount Kigali.  And on that occasion that you went to Kigali and came back to Gitarama, did you use the same route? 
A.	Exactly, I used the same route, because when I left Kigali around the 18th, I stated that the route -- the itinerary we normally used was unusable, because it was regularly shelled by the RPF troops who were positioned on Mount Jali.  The situation had not changed in the interim, or, in any case, if it had changed, I was not aware, and I didn't want to take the risk of that itinerary that I had abandoned from the beginning.  I always used the same itinerary, Mount Kigali. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, when you had to shuttle between Gitarama and Kigali, did you have to go through roadblocks? 
A.	Yes, on the Kigali-Gitarama road, after Nyabarongo, I had to go through roadblocks each time I used that itinerary. 
Q.	And those roadblocks, who manned them? 
A.	On the roadblocks, there were groups of youths.  On all the roadblocks, there were groups of youths; they manned the roadblocks, at least, those roadblocks that I used.  But on two roadblocks, there were displaced persons' camps, and I understood on one of the roadblocks, these were people who had left Nyacyonga in search of shelter who were manning that roadblock.  But all the roadblocks that I went through, there were groups of youths, and one of them was located -- one was located near the displaced persons' camps where there were people of all ages. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, these people who were at the roadblocks, were they civilians or soldiers, 
	to your knowledge, and from the indications that you saw? 
A.	It was difficult to say, but -- because they had no military uniform.  A soldier and a civilian in civilian clothes look alike.  But in any event, I didn't see any military uniform at the roadblock. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, on these roadblocks, the persons who were present, did they have any insignia indicating they belong to any political party? 
A.	No.  The roadblocks that I went through -- at the roadblocks that I went through, I did not see any insignia of any political party.  But in Kigali there were some, the MRND, PSD had their colours, but at the roadblocks, I did not see any. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, if I were to mention the word "Interahamwe", what would that mean for you? 
A.	Here you are talking to a Rwandan to whom the word "Interahamwe" cannot evoke difficult memories.  Historically, I know that the word "Interahamwe" came with the youth movement of the MRND.  Subsequently, it took on a connotation which had nothing to do with its etymological sense.  Since its utilisation in a more general sense, it referred to the youth wing of the MRND. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, the persons you saw at the roadblock during your trip from Gitarama to Kigali, or Kigali to Gitarama, these persons, according to you, were they Interahamwes? 
A.	In my first answer, I did say that these youths had no distinctive insignia belonging to a political party. But since I am talking about a country that I know, I know that those roadblocks that I went through belonged -- or, was a stronghold of our party, MDR.  It was a stronghold of the MDR.  It would have been suicidal to exhibit that you were a member of the MRND.  And, in any case, the word "Kubohoza" had been mentioned.  People would have known if they had shown that they were members of the MRND.  It does not mean that there were none, but they maintained a low profile.  So, on my knowledge of the country, I can say that there were no Interahamwes at the roadblocks in Gitarama.  They may have been elsewhere.  What was visible was that the youths -- what was visible were the youths.  That is what I can say.  They had no insignia of any party, but it is inconceivable to have youths from the MRND operating in an area that I will not call an enemy zone, but an area in which they were not wanted. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, you told the Chamber what the meaning of Interahamwe was at its inception.  But today, for a Rwandan or somebody who is not a Rwandan, what is the meaning of Interahamwe? 
A.	The meaning of Interahamwe, if I should pronounce it in a Kinyarwandan way, Interahamwe, even in my neighbourhood in Switzerland, when I tell somebody I am Rwandan, they ask me if I am Interahamwe.

	Now when they ask the question, they don't want to know whether I belong to the youth wing of the MRND, but they want to know my position in relation to the events that occurred in Rwanda.  They want to know whether I was on the side of the victims or on the side of the killers.  This is the division that was made at the international level, indicating that the attackers were the Hutus and the victims were the Tutsis.  This is in the minds of people I meet everyday.  And for them, Interahamwe, henceforth, that is in the minds of these people, Interahamwe means a killer who played a role of a killer in the events that occurred in Rwanda.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  Mr. Maniliho, what happened at the roadblocks when you went through -- you went through, how were you treated when you got there? 
A.	I told you that when I was going to Kigali, I was still using my vehicle.  When I got to the roadblock, which was made with tree trunks, I got close to them.  They asked me for my identity card, some would ask me if I had something to give them, money.  I told them I did not have any because I, myself, was looking for some.  When I said I did not have any, they would check my identity card and let me go through. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, on the roadblocks -- the roadblocks that you went through, did you see dead bodies at these roadblocks? 
A.	The route that I used on three occasions, on that route I did not see any dead body.  But during the events that occurred in our country, I saw -- I had the opportunity to see dead bodies in Kigali.  I was there from the 7th to the 18th, and during that period, I saw roadblocks -- I saw dead bodies when I was going to visit a friend.  That was the only occasion, but I did not see any dead bodies on the route that I used between Gitarama and Kigali. 
Q.	Thank you.  Up until when did you remain in Gitarama -- or, rather, let me put this -- let me say Kabgayi? 
A.	I remained in Kabgayi until the end of May 1994.  I left Kabgayi for reasons that pushed me to leave one area for another.  It was security.  There was -- there was crisis in Kabgayi.  RPF had taken the southern region.  And at any point in time, we could be encircled in Gitarama.  That was the -- I cannot say the rumour at the time, but it was ascertained to be true.  Like the rest, I left that region and went to Gisenyi, and this was towards the end of May 1994. 
Q.	In Gitarama, what was the security situation during that period? 
A.	When I got there around the 18th of April, it was quite okay.  As you said, I was living in Kabgayi, for me, Kabgayi is Gitarama, it was about two-three kilometres from the centre of town.  I could go to the centre of town without any problem.  I used to go to mass every morning, meaning that there were priests who moved around to come and say mass at the major seminary everyday.  So, moving around was still possible.  I had the opportunity to meet people in the streets and discuss without any fear.  But with time when there were rumours about taking over the Kabgayi camp, there was panic, just as it was in Kigali when I left.  
Q.	During your stay in Kabgayi and Gitarama, did you have the impression that there was still an 
	authority -- security forces who could ensure peace and order in Rwanda? 
A.	Since the statement of Butera -- Sous-Préfet Butera in Kigali, when he said, "The country is at war, and you know that the security forces are engaged in the war effort, don't come to them to come and protect you."  I had no illusion, whether it was in Kigali, Gitarama or elsewhere.  I had the opportunity to see movement of military vehicles in Gitarama, but I understood that they were engaged in the war effort to protect the country.  I had no illusion that they could be there.  And, in any event, I did not see them stop.  When I say I saw them, I mean I saw the movement of their vehicle.  So they did not come for us.  They probably were going where they needed them most. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, at Kabgayi, during your stay or where you had taken refuge, were there only Hutus or Rwandans from the Tutsi ethnic groups -- ethnic group as well? 
A.	At Kabgayi, where I was, we had all the ethnic groups.  I stated that I was -- I had taken refuge at the Kabgayi major seminary.  And there, I was with Tutsis that I knew, and there were other Tutsis I did not know, but who were identified as such, because they, themselves said so.   To just mention a name, the president of canton court, Mr. Kamanzi.  He studied law with me.  He was Tutsi and he was with me, together with his entire family.  We remained together at the major seminary.  And nearby, there were Tutsis from Cyangugu, who came to Kabgayi for medical training, who were not able to go back because of the war and stayed with us at the major seminary.  All that period that I stayed at the 
	major seminary a month and a few days, we were together, and when I left they were still there.  Today, we were -- we had Hutus and Tutsis together in that accommodation.  I would imagine that next in our neighbourhood, that would be the same situation. 
Q.	And these people that you stayed with were not sought after, they were not being tracked down and exterminated? 
A.	I stated that these people who were with me in the major seminary in Kabgayi were with me together.  We stayed together while I was there, and they stayed when I left.  It is true that in that group when we were in Kabgayi, there were people who came.  They were looking for one 
	Kalinda, K-A-L-I-N-D-I -- D-A -- Kalinda, Viteur.  I remember him.  He is a Rwandan sports journalist, and I know him also as a Tutsi.  But when these people came, they were three, including soldiers.  So they came looking for that person in particular.  They asked if Mr. Kalinda was here with us.  We said yes.  We called him, they left with him.  But when they came to look for him, they did not tell him -- what I am telling you about his ethnicity is what I am telling you because I know.  But when they came to fetch him, it was -- they would look for him by name, Mr. Kalinda, Viateur.  I don't know if I can refer to that as people who came looking for Tutsis.  I wouldn't know.  It is for you to tell.  They came looking for him by name, Viateur Kalinda.  And let me add that we did not see him again.  When he left, he did not come back to our group where we were living. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  Mr. Maniliho, in 1992, 1993, 1994, did you know Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Yes, even before -- well before then.  I got to know the name, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, before getting to know the person.  I got to know Mathieu Ngirumpatse when I was young at the major seminary.  I was with his nephew who was with me and who used to speak about his uncle.  And then, at the 
	minor seminary, I was gifted in playing musical instruments, and I was the seminarian -- I was the organist of the minor seminary.  And there is no organist in Rwanda who wouldn't know 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse, because you open the hymn books and you see his name.  So I got to know the name before I got to know the person.

	Subsequently, I mean, at the university level, when I started thinking about what I could do for my country instead of what my country could do for me, I got to know Mr. Ngirumpatse as a public person in the functions that he carried out for the country. 
Q.	A little slower.  
A.	Once again, I am extremely sorry that I am not able to control it.  Let me make another attempt.  I got to know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse well before 1992.  I got to know him in '76, '77.  I got to know him through his nephew who was in school with me, and through his talents, his art, which I share with him and here I have to say that his talent is unequal.  So I got to know him by name and I was eager to know him as a person.  And when I got to know him as a public person, I got to know him when he was the managing director of SONARWA.  I got to know -- I knew him when he was adviser, I believe, for legal affairs in the president's office.  I knew him later on in the democratic movement in Rwanda when he was elected chairman of the MRND.  He was the first chairperson of the MRND who was not the president of the republic, as it was -- when it was a one-party state.  I also used to see him from time to time when I went to church at Saint Michael's Parish.  He used to come to church like me.  But I must say that we did not get to know each other physically through any personal contact.  I know him; he doesn't know me. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, as a member of the MDR, without any particular affinity to the MDR, what were your perceptions of the person of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Now to react to your first assertion, without any particular sympathy for the MRND, I must say I never had  -- I never had that sympathy, but the person that I got to know, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the person I got to know, I've told you the circumstances under which I got to know him, I've told you what I knew of him.  But as a public figure, as a public figure, he was well known by political analysts of his country.  I know that Mathieu was a very Christian person.  It was not difficult to tell.  You just need to open the hymn books of Rwanda and you see his compositions.  A person who sets -- who accords so much time to God is probably not by -- is not incidental.  I happened to know the virtue of Christianity, and I have seen of him all the virtues that one would want to see about a Christian.  I see him as a very humble person through the positions that he held.   He remained in his corner, which is not something everybody -- which is not very common.  I told you that I had to play organs to hymns that he composed.  There are hymns that he composed, the music and the lyrics as well.  And when you go through them, you feel that he is a person who fears God.  I have -- I even have songs that he sang himself, and you know that he is a person who fears God and who seeks peace everywhere.  So I can only assess him on the basis of the elements of what I know of him, and I must say that I find him humble, peaceful and with everything that goes with being a Christian. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, you gave me a document before you appeared before this Court, and I am disappointed, I did not -- I apologise to my colleagues.  I did not have the time to make photocopies.  

If the Bench would authorise me, I would request Mr. Issa, to kindly give you the documents disclosed to me.  I would point out to you that this document comes from Ngirumpatse.  I will give you the document so that you make your own comments on it.  

Mr. Maniliho, is this, indeed, the document that you gave me?  And if yes, can you tell us what it is about?  
A.	It is true that I am the one who gave you this document.  It is a song, as you can see, a handwritten song.  I do not know the personal handwriting of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, but I presume that he is
	 the -- his music, because I heard him.  I even heard him sing with his voice.  I became aware of this song recently when someone who had a wedding of his daughter to celebrate, asked our choir group in Switzerland to sing this song.  Since the person was aware of this song, he was impressed by the words, the lyrics of the song.  In fact, these are very peaceful lyrics or words.  I am going to quote the words, some of them.  It says that most people should seek peace, spend most of their time seeking peace and to preserve peace.  In fact, that is how I became aware of this song, which I must say, is a masterpiece.  I do not know what else I can say.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, perhaps you could say more precisely the words that you are referring to, maybe you could say them in Kinyarwanda and they will be interpreted by the interpreters and you should mention the passage in the text so that the Chamber would be aware of what you are referring to.  I believe you were referring to page 3, but you are better placed to say so.  I do not have a good mastery of Kinyarwanda.  
A.	It is frame number 4, where he says, I believe this would be interpreted into Kinyarwanda.  "Child of God or children of God, listen to me.  I would like to teach you the fear of God.  If you want to live happily, seek peace and continue seeking peace."  When these words are sung, when these lyrics are sung, they are even better.  In fact, when they are sung by Mathieu, the situation becomes indescribable.  It was unfortunate that I was not able to make you listen to the tape, as I can't find the tape.  When a composer sings his own song, you feel what he is saying.  I was personally struck on listening to the song and that is why I wanted to talk about it.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, is Mathieu Ngirumpatse known as a composer of songs -- war songs, that is, alongside these other songs of peace?  
A.	I think when someone is known, everything he has done is known.  His songs do not comprise any war songs.  I pointed out that he composes religious songs, choir songs, but I know that there are also circumstances where he could compose a song to appreciate what somebody has done, to send a signal to a friend.  One of the songs - the most famous song is the song titled given in Kinyarwanda.  For those who like music, it is worthwhile listening to that song.  It is not a religious song at all.  It is a song relating to daily events.  And in that song, Ngirumpatse shows someone that he appreciates that person.  I think he composed that song when he was in the minor seminary.  Perhaps he composed it for a Tutsi bishop.  When you make a tape like that one, it's worth gold.  Unfortunately, the bishop is not here to give evidence, but I am thinking of the feeling the bishop had when he heard that song.  Well, I never heard any war song composed by Ngirumpatse, knowing who Ngirumpatse is, I will be surprised that he composed any war song.  I will be disappointed if he did one, if he did compose one, but I'm sure he did not. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, in view of what you have just said, would it be an exaggeration to say that 
	Mathieu Ngirumpatse is well known in Rwanda as someone who defends peace?  
A.	That is what I have been seeking to say, the most known characteristic of Ngirumpatse is his quest for peace.  He is someone who seeks peace, peace with others.  And this is what we all wish for.  
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, I thank you.  
MR. WEYL: 
I have no further questions for this witness, Mr. President.  I would simply like the Chamber to admit into evidence, D. NG147, that is, the document that was referred to by Mr. Maniliho.  Perhaps a last word, Mr. President, still on the issue of translation.  
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, can you, please spell for the purposes of the record, the terms that you used Umushyumba Ushagawe, please? 
A.	U-M-U-S-H-Y -- perhaps I may make a correction later on, U-M-B-A -- Umushyumba Ushagawe -- U-S-H-A-G-A-W-E.  I said I would make a correction because I come from the northern region.  In our language, this was a peculiarity.  We have a way of spelling S-Y -- S-H-Y -- there are two versions, maybe those of you who are specialists.  We have a different way of spelling of words with S-H-Y - - so, S-H-Y, or S-H, in short.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  

MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The document is admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG147 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Diagne-Mbaye, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

The Prosecutor will now have the opportunity to cross-examine you and you will then respond to the questions.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you.  
MS. WILSON: 
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, members of the Defence team, Mr. Witness, members of the public.  

If I may indicate, I do have a few documents which I intend to use in cross-examination, but I do not have these documents with me right now.  With the leave of the Bench, I would start a topic for which I do not need these documents, Mr. President.  I anticipated that my learned friend would have completed -- completed direct by 12:30, as he indicated.  

So, if that is okay with you, Mr. President, I will begin with another topic. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can start. 
MS. WILSION: 
Thank you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good morning, again -- or, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	You indicated in your evidence that you knew the Accused, Ngirumpatse through his nephew.  What was the name of that nephew? 
A.	His nephew was called Minega -- M-I-N-E-G-A -- Minega, Charles Édouard.  
	M-I-N-E-G-A, Charles Édouard. 
Q.	And you indicated that you never physically met the Accused, but you knew him through that nephew, was that your evidence?  
A.	I would like -- what I meant by physically, is that I never sat next to him to talk to him.  I never went to his place, neither did he come to my place.  I never shook his hands.  But I also pointed out that I had the opportunity, for example, of attending the same mass with him.  Therefore, I know physically the person, but we never spoke to one another.  We've never had a personal or direct conversation or discussion.  
Q.	So I take that to mean that you were never even introduced to the Accused by his nephew or anyone else.  
A.	No, I am telling you that I said in my testimony that I know the name, Mathieu Ngirumpatse even before I knew the person.  I knew the name before I knew the person.  I knew the person later on.  I knew the person as a public figure, and on that occasion I could put the name to the person.  I could put the name to the physical person of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, but I knew the name before I ever knew the person by sight before I ever saw him. 
Q.	Thank you.  So on what basis could you come to the conclusion that the Accused is a humble and peaceful person?  Was that merely by seeing him at church and listening to his music? 
A.	I think the answer is in your question.  I did underscore that it was for that reason that we tendered into evidence his song showing his words.  Moreover, that song is handwritten, and evidence is not just hearsay, but tangible evidence which you can read yourself in the document that you have, the document that has just been admitted into evidence.

	Now, regarding the humility of someone, I told you that he was a public figure, a public figure who had occupied senior positions in the country.  He was not the first; he is not the last.  I know what I am talking about because I lived in Rwanda.  People of his standing has a way of showing that they were important, but that was not the case with Ngirumpatse.  
Q.	Do you agree that it is difficult to make a proper assessment of an individual whom you simply know from a distance, whom you simply know from his public image? 
A.	I would like to clarify that I did not know the person from a distance.  Even though, as I pointed out, I did not have special physical contact or friendly contact with the person, I know that when you make an assessment of somebody without specific interest, you are better placed to have a fair opinion of that person.  I was not asking for anything from him.  He did not know me.  I knew him on the basis of his position or duties he carried out.  So without pretending, I can say that the opinion I formed of the person from whom I expected nothing, would not be as poor as you seemed to have indicated. 
Q.	And you indicated that you knew him as a person of peace, that too, is your perception of him as a public official.  
A.	No, it was on the basis of what he did in 1985.  If you look at the song carefully, it is dated 1985.  Well before 1985, he had occupied other positions, and they did not hide his determination to seek peace.  You would have the opportunity of analysing the evidence, you would see the person.  In 1985 -- 1985 was 25 years ago, 25 years ago, that means that it was his conviction.  It is not my opinion.  It is something that he himself professed, because he wrote.  What is in writing remains.
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you please give just very concise answers.  From all that you had said very clearly, that you know the Accused because of his public role, you saw him in church, you never met him personally, all of that is correct; is it not? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said. 
Q.	Okay.  And when did you -- did you volunteer to give evidence on his behalf or were you asked? 
A.	I volunteered.  Why do you wanted it to be otherwise?  I volunteered.  Can you clarify your question?  Who may have asked me?  I was contacted by people who knew very well that I am Rwandan, that I am aware of what happened in Rwanda, because I was there, I lived there, and that I had an interest in making a contribution by testifying to what happened in Rwanda.  It is in that context that I was contacted.  You even saw in my testimony and you have seen that most of my testimony is not focused on Mathieu, but rather what happened.  But I was not contacted because I had any vested interest in testifying for Mathieu. 
Q.	Very well, Mr. Witness.  That's the reason you answered the question.  Most of the evidence is not about Mathieu Ngirumpatse, because you don't know him.  It's about other things.  Thank you very much for that.  There is this song that's put into evidence, is that the only song that you know of that was written by Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I do not know whether you were present during my testimony since morning.  I clarified that if you look at the hymn now of the Rwandan choir book, it is only Rwanda songs -- it is only Ngirumpatse's songs, quite often they are songs taken from the Catholic liturgy, and it is on that basis that I said he was somebody who is profoundly Christian, because I believe that he has written more than 300 religious songs, choir songs in Rwanda.  So, it is through his -- well, it is not only through his songs that I know him, but most of his songs are classical songs. 
Q.	You've answered my question.  Please keep your answers concise.  Are you still in communication with his nephew, with Mathieu Ngirumpatse's nephew?  
A.	No, I lost contact with him since I left Rwanda. 
Q.	Are you in contact with any members of his family, that's the Accused's family?  
A.	I don't know them.  I don't know any other member of his family. 
Q.	Thank you.  
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, Your Honours, I see it's now twelve -- I can't see the clock from here, but it is now 12:29.  Now it's 12:30 on my watch.  Is this a good time?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can take the luncheon break now. 
MS. WILSON: 
Very well, I am much obliged.

(Pages 25 to 36 by Haruna Farage)


































	(Court resumed at 1400H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon.  

Ms. Wilson, you may continue. 
MS. WILSON: 
Good afternoon, everyone.  

I wonder if Mr. Issa could assist me in distributing some documents, please.  

Okay.  If I may proceed.  What I have done with all the exhibits, I have put both English and French together.  So for both the French and speakers, where there are both languages available, it should be in that bundle.  I might not, however, use most of these exhibits.  

Good afternoon, everyone.  
BY MS. WILSON: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon.  
Q.	Over what period did you, whilst working at PNAS, occupy the Kabuga building? 
A.	PNAS is the acronym.  We worked under that project, which was a recent project, and we occupied the Kabuga building from October 1993.  Prior to that time we -- our offices were located within the building of the ministry of the interior. 
Q.	I think that things will work more smoothly if you merely answer the questions I'm asking rather than giving other gratuitous information.  So what we need to know is over what period of time you occupied the Kabuga building?  And that would be from October 1993 to when? 
A.	I will answer directly but I know that you already know the answer because I have already provided it.  It was from the -- from October '93 to 6th of April 1994. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And during the time that you occupied that building what were your hours of work? 
A.	The usual working hours of the administrative staff, namely, from 7 a.m. and I had a break at noon.  I resumed at one and closed at five. 
Q.	And you describe that building as being a large building, "huge", is the word you used, with five floors; yes? 
A.	It was a huge and imposing building.  We did not have many such buildings in Kigali. 
Q.	And you named a few persons or businesses that occupied that building; you said Kabuga, the ministry of health, UNAMIR and, of course, the organisation you worked for.  But that would not have been the total number of occupants of this huge building; was it? 
A.	I believe as you do that they were not the only occupants.  But these are the ones I remember.  It was indeed a huge building and the other premises may obviously have been rented out to other premises -- to other organisations. 
Q.	And do you know where Ngirumpatse's office was located at that time? 
A.	I have already told you that at the time we had been working within that building from November 1993.  I do not think that Ngirumpatse had an office in that building.  It may have been possible, but I knew Ngirumpatse and I did not see him in that building. 
Q.	The evidence from one of our Prosecution witnesses is that Ngirumpatse had an office in that building; do you have any reason to deny that fact? 
A.	Let me repeat my testimony.  I started to work in that building in November '93.  And I told you that there were other services in that building.  And I, therefore, would simply say that it might have been possible, but I did not see Ngirumpatse.  I knew the man.  

If another witness has told you that he had an office there, then it might be better to put the question to him.  All I can testify to is what I saw for myself.  And what I am saying is that I did not see Ngirumpatse in that building. 
Q.	And do you know where the MRND headquarters was located at that time? 
A.	The truth is that I was not very interested in the MRND.  I know that its offices were situated at Kimihurura when it was a one-party system.  And those offices subsequently became the prime minister's offices.  The MRND moved out of that building subsequently.  If you were to ask me about the headquarters of the MDR I would give you an answer, but I am not in a position to tell you where the MRND moved its offices. 
Q.	Okay.  I will put it to you that the MRND's headquarters was located in that building.  
A.	Well, I am learning that from you.  From the time I worked at that building, I did not have any indications or any factors that could lead me to believe that the MRND had offices there.  But let us be clear.  I am not saying that I am denying that possibility.  It was a huge building but I did not have any indicia or any indications pointing to the fact that the MRND had offices in that building while I was there, that is, from November 1993.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Let me further put it to you that many MRND documents that were tendered during these proceedings they were, in fact, obtained from that MRND office located in the Kabug -- that building.  
A.	Once again, let me say that my testimony can only be about things that I saw or documents that I read or things that that -- or, information that I received from sure sources.  I do not have any documents that can assist me in this exercise.  I need us to be clear about dates, to cross-check dates.  Let me repeat for the fifth time:  I was working in that building from November 1993.  And I would like you to check your own sources to find out whether the dates you are dealing with are related to the same period. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, counsel was speaking while we were still interpreting the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Diagne, the interpreters did not hear you because your communication overlapped their interpretation of what the witness was saying. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Mr. President, I did not hear you either. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Let us start again.  

(Inaudible)  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
I'm very sorry about that, Mr. President.  I would like to -- I would like for you to ask the Prosecutor to clarify matters by providing the pseudonym of the witness who testified before this Trial Chamber that at that time the MRND headquarters was located in the building she is referring to.  I think that is important, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
(Microphone not activated)
MS. WILSON: 
In response to my learned friend, the witness is HH.  
BY MS. WILSON: 
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you were asked questions about military training, where they took place in that building.  What do you understand by "military training" when you were asked that question? 
A.	In Switzerland, we have mandatory military services and I was part of that when I became a citizen.  I know that military exercises -- or, military training includes physical exercise and weapons handling.  It also entails that one is able to shoot even in the midst of noises.  And so there is a lot of noise that is produced during military training that can be a nuisance.  And we worked in that office.  We never had any nuisance arising from noise; we never saw any soldiers providing any training whatsoever.  And that is from -- that is the premise from which I testified that I never saw nor heard mention of any military training in that building, because if such a thing had happened I would have seen it, I would have become aware of it.  Those types of incidents do not go unnoticed. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, if there were a small group of individuals who were being taught how to dismantle and reassemble firearms, you would not have known that such was taking place in a room in such a big building, would you? 
A.	Well, if you put the question to me about military training, then you must have been referring to military training.  But what you are referring to now is something that can take place in a room in your own home.  Now you are asking me whether working in a building I may have been aware of what was happening in a toilet somewhere.  Well, officially speaking, I did not see anything because nothing happened in a visible manner.  Now, if things happened in hiding within the building, that could have been possible, but I am not in a position to say so. 
Q.	Just to clarify.  The question about military training came from the Defence counsel.  So, I am simply clarifying what you understood that to mean, because the evidence of a Prosecution Witness HH was that the training involved use of firearms, dismantling and reassembling a firearm, and it took place in secret.  So you agree with me now, if the military training consisted merely of the use of firearms, it is very possible that that could have taken place without your knowledge in such a big building.  
A.	On that point, if you are referring to handling firearms my answer is categorical.  There was no such training while I was there, except we are talking about handling firearms with silencers which could also have been possible.  Now, if you're talking about dismantling and reassembling firearms, that can happen anywhere.  So I don't know whether it is fair to ask me whether I knew because such a transaction can take place even in your home, in your living room, in your bathroom and what have you.  So I may be aware or not aware of any such transaction. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  The evidence from HH, a Prosecution witness, was merely that individuals will be trained to use firearms.  There was no issue of it being -- of any bullets being shot or the gun actually being fired.  So you -- so agree with me that if such training took place in a room, in secret, there's no way you could have known about it.  You've answered the question before; you've said if it is in a toilet or wherever.  You have answered it.  But you agree? 
A.	It is not impossible for such a thing to happen in the toilet.  Even right here behind me if somebody is dismantling a weapon or assembling it I would not know what is happening. 
Q.	Exactly, Mr. Witness.  Thank you very much for your response.  That is all I wanted to know.  
A.	However, do not put words into my mouth.  What I said -- please do not put words into my mouth.  What I said was that such a transaction could even have taken place at your home unknown to you.  Now, if that is what you have understood then we are on the same wavelength. 
Q.	We are on the same wavelength, Mr. Witness.  So training could have taken place, in that limited sense, without you having known, in the building which you occupied; that's what you're saying, that's what I'm saying, correct? 
A.	Thank you for the information, but what I can tell you is that I was in that building for six months and the suggestion you're putting to me I hear it now for the very first time. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, on the 6th of April 1994, you said that you were in Gikondo, yes?  And that you stayed there for about ten days? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that. 
Q.	You said that on the -- was it on the 8th that people were killed in their homes; am I correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct, in their homes in Gikondo.
Q.	And do you know the ethnicity of those persons who were killed in their homes. 
A.	Not all of them, but I know for some cases.  In one case there was a doctor who was married to a woman who had studied with me, Mukabidere, Thérése -- M-U-K-A-B-I-D-E-R-E, Mukabidere -- who was married to a native of Kibuye who was a medical doctor and he was Hutu and he died in that incident.  I was not able to know about other cases but I was familiar with this case because I knew the person involved.  
Q.	Later on, did you come to know the ethnicities of those persons killed on that night apart from the doctor you referred to? 
A.	How would I have been aware of it?  I did not conduct any investigations.  The person I have talked to you about is because he was somebody I knew.  I did not conduct any investigation into their ethnicity.  As for the others, I did not conduct any investigation.  That was not my role, and so I do not know the ethnicity of the others. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  You could just give a simple answer.  Now, you said later on a patrol was set up involving citizens of that area; that's true? 
A.	Yes, correct.  
Q.	And at the time that patrol was set up you said forces -- the armed forces were at the war front; that's true, isn't it? 
A.	Just one clarification -- one small clarification.  When you say "institute", let me clarify that in my testimony I said it was the sous-préfet who came after those persons died to call -- to advise us to provide our own safety and security.  Now, if that is what you refer to as instituting, then I can say yes, this happened after the event within the neighbourhood.  So I can confirm that.  Now when you talk about instituting, it may have a different connotation from my earlier testimony.  I would rather we stay, or we maintain the context I referred to in my testimony.  
Q.	Yes.  And this patrol was conducted by, you said, persons from the area and they were not armed; is that true?  Is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Now, after the killings on that first night, the killings continue in the period that you remained in Kigali, in that area.  
A.	These were either -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I'm sorry; I didn't get the witness clearly.  
THE WITNESS: 
I heard you say "these latter"; are you referring to the killings or the patrols? 
BY MS. WILSON: 
Q.	Let me repeat my question.  
A.	Yes, please. 
Q.	You told us about the kills on the night of the 8th; you told us about patrols which the sous-préfet organised and I am simply asking if during the ten days you remained in Gikondo killings continued? 
A.	Yes, now you're clear.  The killings continued but not necessarily in our neighbourhood.  From what we were hearing there were killings here and there, but in our neighbourhood since we started the patrols there were no killings of a similar nature. 
Q.	But wasn't that the very reason you decided to leave Kigali because of the killings that took place, the place became insecure; wasn't that your evidence? 
A.	No, that was not my evidence.  I stated that the place had become insecure because of the shelling, the firing of the RPF, by Katusha, everywhere in the town.  I did not make reference to insecurity relating to the intensification of the killings.  It was the shelling of the town which had intensified.  I believe I'm a bit clearer now. 
Q.	And how did you know it was the RPF who were, in fact, carrying out those shootings?  Did you do any investigation? 
A.	Well, you do not need to be a refined strategist to know that.  We knew RPF positions from the Remera and the firing was coming from there.  I'm talking about these events because I experienced them; I was there.  We knew, more or less, the positions of each and every one.  And this was not a secret.  We knew the RPF positions.  We knew the government -- the Rwandan -- the positions of the Rwandan armed forces.  And you will agree with me that it would not be the government forces that would be firing at its own population indiscriminately.  
Q.	You referred to a doctor that was killed on the night of the 8th.  That was the only killing that you heard about.  Is it not true that he was killed at a roadblock, by a bomb, in Gikondo? 
A.	The doctor that I referred to, Mukabidere, Thérése's husband was not killed by the -- at Gikongoro (sic) by the patrol, but he was killed by firing.  If we are talking about the same person.  And then I am in a position to tell you that if you have any information to the contrary, that is wrong.  It happened in my neighbourhood.  I know the family because I stayed there with the wife.  So I know what happened in relation to this specific case. 
Q.	Thank you.  Mr. Witness, were you aware of any other killings that took place in the ten-day period that you were in Gikondo -- Gikondo?  Sorry. 
A.	I have told you that I saw killings in Kigali town and that is during the period that I was there.  If I saw -- I saw dead bodies on the road close to my house when I was on my way to Kiyovu.  These persons were killed so it means there were killings.  I did not witness the killings but I saw the dead bodies, which means there were killings. 
Q.	And these people, the dead bodies you saw, they were killed during the period the armed forces were at the front line, according to your evidence; is that not so? 
A.	Of course, since this was the same period, that brief period of about ten days when I remained in Kigali. 
Q.	And who -- who was the perpetrator of these killings that took place while the armed forces were at the front line? 
A.	I'm sorry, but I am not -- I don't know if you are expecting an answer from me.  I told you I saw dead bodies.  I did not witness the moment of killing.  How am I to know who killed who, when I did not witness the killing. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have indicated in evidence that in that period when the patrol was set up, in that period when you remained in Kigali, that the armed forces were at the front line.  Does it not follow that the killings were not, in fact, killings by those armed forces? 
A.	You can make that presumption, but I do not share that. 
Q.	So you do not -- you're saying that you do not know how these persons were killed; the dead bodies you saw in the Kigali area, you're saying you have no idea how they were killed? 
A.	Well, now you are changing the nuance of your question.  You are asking me of the killer; now you are asking me of the manner.  What is it you are referring to?  Regarding the perpetrator, I told you I do not know.  And the manner of the death, I did not carry out an autopsy. 
Q.	But you saw the bodies.  How did their bodies appear?  What sort of injuries did the bodies appear to have when you saw them? 
A.	I'm not even sure if I saw injuries.  I saw -- I did not see any sign that may have made me conclude that they died by firearm.  
Q.	You left Kigali for Gitarama and returned on three occasions.  And during that period you also saw dead bodies; is that not true? 
A.	I don't know if you're doing this deliberately, but I did say that the only occasions that I saw dead bodies was when I -- before I left Kigali.  I left Kigali on the 18th April and I came back on three occasions.  The question was put to me as to whether during that period, on the routes that I used, whether I saw dead bodies and I answered specifically that I did not see any.  
Q.	You said you went to visit a friend and whilst visiting your friend you saw dead bodies; when was that? 
A.	This was before I left Kigali.  And that would cover the period of about 10 days between the 7th and the 18th of April 1994. 
Q.	And what area was this in that you saw the dead bodies? 
A.	My friend lived in Kiyovu and I lived in Gikondo, close to Kiyovu.  It's a trip of less than one and a half kilometres from Gikondo to Kiyovu.  If you want another clarification, it is a place that is referred to as Rugunga, R-U-G-U-N-G-A, Rugunga, between Kiyovu and Gikondo. 
Q.	And were you able to determine the ethnicity of those dead bodies, the persons who you saw dead during that visit to your friend?  
A.	You would wish me to answer your question concisely and directly, but it is difficult.  It is difficult for us to even determine the ethnicity of living human beings; it's even more difficult when they are dead.  I wonder if you are able to tell my ethnicity even when I'm alive, here in front of you. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, then your simple response is that you are not able to determine the ethnicity.  That's very simple.  There's no mystery about it.  If you can't, you can't.  You just say that.  Do you understand that?  
A.	I clearly understand but I am beginning to get worried about the traps in your questions.  I don't want to be made to say something that I do not -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, let's work with these rules:  If you don't understand the question, you simply state that.  You are an intelligent man; there are no traps to be -- that you will fall into.  Do you understand?  So, if you don't know an answer or response just say you don't know.  Let's move on.  
A.	Thank you for your reassurance.  Thank you.  
Q.	Now let's go to the sport journalist.  You said that you were staying at a seminary and there was a sport journalist by the name of -- I don't know if I have the pronunciation correct -- Kalinda Viateur.  He is a sports journalist; is that the correct name? 
A.	Can you repeat your question?  The beginning especially.  I did not participate in a seminar; I lived in a seminary.  These are two separate things.  When I said "seminary", these are buildings.  
Q.	Sorry, there is probably a problem in the translation.  
A.	Okay.
Q.	I'm simply asking you that when you were staying at the seminary you spoke about someone by the name of Kalinda Viateur, a sports journalist.  Do I have the name correct? 
A.	Yes, you got the name right.  We lived together in that seminary up until when he was abducted. 
Q.	Right.  I'm interested to understand that situation better.  Who were the three persons who came looking for him? 
A.	These were three persons who were in military uniform and carrying weapons. 
Q.	And you said that they specifically asked for him by name.  
A.	Well, once again I don't know if it is a problem of translation, but can the question be repeated. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says the witness. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	No problem.  You said these three persons, the military who were armed, they came looking for Mr. Viateur.  I'm simply wanting you to confirm whether they asked for him by name. 
A.	I confirm that when they came they sought to know if one Kalinda Viateur was in that seminary and we answered yes.  They then sought to know where his room was located.  They then went to him and asked him to follow them.  In the same building there was a woman, she was an MRND member of parliament.  Lucie Maniraguha -- M-A-N-I-R-A-G-U-H-A, Maniraguha -- an MRND, a member of parliament, who probably felt that Kalinda was not safe so he (sic) wanted to prevent the abduction of Kalinda.  But the soldiers opposed, resisted, and the woman was not able to prevent them.  So they left with him.  But Lucie Maniraguha, MRND, the MP who was there with his -- with her nephew, Ntiyitura, N-T-I-Y-I-T-U-R-A, Rogatien, who was there also, was a witness.  That is somebody who wanted to prevent the soldiers from abducting Viateur.  But in spite of that, he was abducted.  Have I answered your question?  
Q.	You have been more extensive than I expected, Mr. Witness.  And what was the ethnicity of that journalist? 
A.	I told you that I knew Kalinda Viateur personally and that he was a Tutsi.  But when they came to look for him they looked for Mr. Kalinda Viateur; they did not look for a Tutsi.  Well, okay.  Thank you. 
Q.	And did you get the impression that these persons had a list of individuals that they were looking for? 
A.	Going by the example of that person, I can say yes.  But he was the only person who was abducted from where we were.  
Q.	When you returned to Kigali, I believe, you indicated that some persons -- some young people were wearing uniforms; do you recall? 
A.	Which episode are you talking about?  Because I do not know what you are talking about. 
Q.	Okay, I'll clarify for you.  You have been asked a question by Defence counsel and you, in fact, indicated that you returned to Kigali after two days because of the issue with food; yes? 
A.	Hmm.  
Q.	And if I could take you further along.
A.	Oui.
Q.	When Defence counsel was asking you in relation to roadblocks -- 
A.	Oui. 
Q.	-- you said the persons at the roadblocks did not have any insignia.  Then you said in Kigali MRND and PSD had their clothes.  Do you recall saying that? 
A.	Well, you have misunderstood what I said, clearly.  I did say that on the roadblocks -- at the roadblocks there were no uniforms.  However, prior to events that we were referring to, All these parties had their uniforms and their distinctive clothes, but that there was none at the roadblocks.  So when I made reference to uniforms, it was simply to say that those uniforms existed previously for the parties to distinguish them, but they did not -- they were not there when I was passing through the roadblock or at the time of the killings.  I believe I'm clearer now. 
Q.	Thank you so much.  In any event, Mr. Witness, you agree that during these events, between April and July, that mostly Tutsi individuals were, in fact, killed? 
A.	You're absolutely right.  There's probably one detail that we omitted.  When I said that I was going through the roadblocks, I used to show my identity card.  They would check, look at it -- some of the young persons were asking me for money, which I did not have -- and they would let me through.  But a detail we left out was I did not know what they were looking for.  Maybe they were checking the identity on the card.  I wouldn't know if I would have gone through the roadblock easily if I were a Tutsi.  It is possible and, in fact, I confirm that there were Tutsis who were killed simply because they were Tutsis.  But let me also say that there were Hutus who were killed because they were Hutus. 
Q.	They were moderate Hutus.  
A.	That is your inference.  A Hutu is a Hutu.  Moderate is a fabrication. 
Q.	Okay.  So Mr. Witness -- and you agree that the perpetrators of those killings of mostly Tutsi individuals were, in fact, civilians and soldiers? 
A.	The perpetrators of which killings?  The Tutsis who were killed?  
Q.	That's what I said.  You said you agreed that mostly Tutsi individuals were killed.  I'm now asking you about the perpetrators of those killings; do you agree that they were killed by civilians and members of the army? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
The French booth would like counsel to repeat the question. 
(Pages 36 to 46 by Eleanor Bastian)
































1500H
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Witness, can you please tell us who the perpetrators of the killing of these Tutsi persons were?  
A.	Once again, I think this Tribunal has been able to determine that I don't know who did.  I have told you what I know from the beginning.  I know there were Tutsis who were killed for being Tutsis.  I also know that there were Hutus who were killed for being Hutus.  

And I want this to be corrected.  You -- you used the word "mainly".  I did not say Tutsis were mainly killed.  The word "mainly" is your word, not mine.  

Now, regarding who killed them, the killers could come from any group.  It is obvious that there were Hutus who killed -- Hutus who killed Tutsis, Tutsis who killed Hutus, Hutus who killed Hutus.  Now, don't ask me to tell you who did what.  I am not in a position to give you an answer. 
Q.	Okay.  I want to go back.  In terms of ethnicity, most of the people killed were Tutsis, were they not?  I know you said other groups were killed as well, but do you at least agree with me that most of the civilians who were killed, they were, in fact, Tutsis?  If you're not in a position to answer, fine.  
A.	Well, I will answer you, but it's -- you will understand that it's just an opinion of a Rwandan intellectual.  If you say most of the people killed were Tutsis, it's an opinion that I do not share necessarily, but considering the proportion of Tutsis in the Rwandan population, they must have paid a higher price, because if you've killed one out of two, you've already killed half.  If you kill three out of eight, that is less than half.  

Now, when you do body counts, it's the one who lost three.  Proportionally talking, the Hutus would have -- the Hutus (sic) had many more victims.  There probably are not more than the Hutus who lost their lives.  

Once again, that is a personal opinion because I did not do a body count. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And in Gitarama, there were also civilians that were killed.  Do you agree?  
A.	It is obvious.  What happened was across the whole country.  But I was not an eyewitness to that, but I know that it happened across the whole country. 
Q.	And again, in that area, Tutsi were the main group that was, in fact, targeted; do you agree?  
A.	Let me revert to my previous statement as the opinion of a Rwandan intellectual.  I think the fact that they lost more was the fact that proportionally they were a minority such that to lose -- if they lost half, it does not mean they lost more persons.  The impression is that there were more victims from that side, but in truth that may not have -- that may not be the case. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And the roadblocks that you encountered, you said that you were stopped and you had to show your identification card.  Once you showed your identification card, you didn't have any problems passing that -- passing through that roadblock, did you?  
A.	Let me repeat.  I am the one who somehow suggested the question to you, because I told you that if the information I provided were used by letting me pass without checking my identity, then what I was suggesting was that maybe if I were a Tutsi, I would not have gone through that easily.  That was my thought.  And I want to say that this is exactly what I think.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now, you refer to a large number of refugees being displaced after one of the RPF attacks.  Do you recall saying this in your evidence?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping) ... Nyacyonga, yes?  
A.	Nyacyonga.  
Q.	Nyacyonga.  Sorry.
A.	Nyacyonga.  I understand you. 
Q.	And how many persons did you say inhabited that -- that camp? 
A.	It was a huge human crowd, and I believe that this can give you an idea.  It was full of people, so to speak.  
Q.	Okay.  There has been evidence in this trial D. NZ747 where UNAMIR refer to the fact that there were only 29,000 inhabitants in that camp.  Do you have any comments to make about that? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Please, can you repeat your question, Counsel, for the benefit of the interpreters.  
THE WITNESS:
Well, that is about correct.  By a simple approximation it was the entire commune of Nyacyonga plus other persons from other neighbouring communes in Byumba préfecture.  So by estimating that the population of a commune would be around 25,000, that must be quite realistic.  And so if we take 
ten communes bordering the border -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
THE WITNESS:
-- then we may also want to consider the fact that others may have fled.  And if we were to subtract the civilians who were killed and others, then the figure may be even higher than what you are suggesting.  So by my own quick calculation, it would be about twice the figure you have just suggested.  Once again, I don't have any material evidence to lead me to a specific figure. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And the stance you took previous when you didn't have precise evidence is that you couldn't say.  You didn't conduct any investigations.  So there's no proper basis for you to dispute the figure which I just indicated to you, is there? 
A.	Well, I have very, very good reasons to challenge your figures relying on the very simple explanation I have already provided. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...thank you, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Well, do you agree with my answer?  
Q.	I don't have to agree with it, but we have the answer that you've given -- 
A.	Very well. 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)...so there's no need to repeat it.  
A.	Very well.  Thank you.  
Q.	Did you hear of any other mass killings in the Gikondo area in the first ten days that you were there? 
A.	Once again, we are talking and dealing with an issue which I have already testified to.  
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)
A.	I did not see any other killings in person in Gikondo. 
Q.	Sorry.  I think you did not hear my question.  If you heard about any other mass killings in that area, not if you saw it.  I'm aware of your answer.  
A.	During the period I was there, the answer is no.  
Q.	Okay.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, Your Honours, these are all the questions I have for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Wilson.  

Mr. Weyl, do you have any redirect examination of this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  Thank you.  But simply just to seek some clarification. 
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness -- or, rather, Mr. Maniliho, I would like you to clarify a point following the cross-examination by the Prosecutor because we no longer quite understand.  Can you confirm that you never -- or maybe let me rephrase.  

Did you hear anybody talk about military training which allegedly took place in the Kabuga building?  
A.	I can confirm that I never heard mention of military training in the Kabuga building where I worked.  I can confirm that if by military training we refer to the common understanding of what military training would be, then such training would not have taken place in that location or known to me.  However, if we go by the Prosecutor's definition relating to dismantling and reassembling weapons, that can take place anywhere and everywhere and cannot be referred to as military training. 
Q.	Mr. Maniliho, did you hear any mention of a stray bullet that may have broken some windows in the Kabuga building? 
A.	I never heard anyone talk about it. 
Q.	Going, therefore, by this testimony of Witness HH, whereby there was a training session at Kabuga's building in secret but only became public subsequently because a stray bullet had broken a window during that military training, would you say categorically that you are unaware of any such stray bullet that may have broken some window glasses during a military training exercise?  
A.	Let me be specific.  If this period -- witness is referring to the period when I was there between October -- November '93 and April '94, there was no stray bullet in the Kabuga building.  There were many of us all grown up working on that project in the Kabuga building.  So a stray bullet and broken windows would never have gone unnoticed because everybody's life would have been in danger.  So if these things happened during the period when I was working there, let me repeat that I am not aware of any such incident. 
MR. WEYL: 
Apologies to the interpreters.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Are you confirming, therefore, Witness, that while you were at Kabuga's no one ever narrated such an incident to you?  Is that the case?  
A.	I can confirm that I have only learned of this incident for the first time here at this Tribunal.  Therefore, if any such thing had happened before, I would have been aware of it.  But I never learnt of such a thing.  

In my capacity as financial director of our project, the security of our property was of great concern to me and such an incident would have clearly come to my attention in order to determine whether our property was affected.  So I would have known.  And my testimony is that this never happened during the time we occupied the Kajuga (sic) building. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness.  I simply want to make the usual application for the witness to meet Mr. Ngirumpatse if that is Mr. Maniliho's desire.  

Thank you, Mr. Maniliho, for making the effort to come to Arusha to contribute to the emergence of the truth.  Thank you, Mr. Maniliho.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we note that your testimony has come to an end, and we thank you, as we do all witnesses, for assisting the Tribunal in its work.  You are now excused and you are free to go.  

The registrar will make arrangements to facilitate the request made by counsel for 
Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  

THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I am happy and satisfied.  Thank you.  
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you call the next witness, please.  
(Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, what is the status of this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I take it that WVSS has duly informed you that protective measures had been ordered in respect of this witness.  But he has decided to waive -- or, rather, to apply for those measures to be waived.  And I think you may want to cross-check that with him, Mr. President, because he has told us that he would rather testify in his own name.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

Mr. Witness, the Chamber made an order for your security -- a protective order for your security.  But we gather that that order has been unnecessary and that you don't wish any protective measures to be in place during your testimony.  These measures had included that your identity would not have been revealed to the public.  Can you kindly inform your position, please.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I want to solemnly confirm that this is my desire. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Have you testified in any previous -- in any previous trials at the Tribunal?  
THE WITNESS:
This is the first time I am appearing as a witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Then we revoke the protection order we made in your favour and you will now be testifying in your own identity.  

Before you give your testimony, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
(Declaration made by Albert Rukerantare in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
ALBERT RUKERANTARE 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Would you please kindly tell the Court your name and your first name.  Kindly spell out your name.  And, please, I will ask you also subsequently to spell out all proper nouns that may be referred to in your testimony.  Start with your name and your first name.  
A.	My name is Rukerantare, Albert.  Rukerantare is spelt R-U-K-E-R-A-N-T-A-R-E and Albert, A-L-B-E-R-T. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, thank you.  Would you please tell the Court your date of birth and your place of birth? 
A.	I was born in Kigombe in Ruhengeri préfecture in Rwanda -- in Rwanda on the 26th of November 1968. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, you have before you a personal identification sheet.  I would like you to read through that sheet carefully and make any corrections if you do find any mistakes on it.  If the information is inaccurate, please make the necessary corrections.  But if it is accurate, I would ask you to date the document at 26th November 19 -- 2010 and then please sign.  
A.	The identity is correct. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to produce into evidence the personal identification sheet signed by the witness under D. NG148.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG148 admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, while the registrar is showing the document to all parties in the Court, I would like to inform you of our rules, should I say, of engagement.  You are Francophone or French speaking like myself.  And I want you to know that your answers and my questions are interpreted from French into English, and there is need for a pause to be observed between my question and your answer to facilitate this process of interpretation and also the court reporting processes.  

Furthermore, I would ask you to spell out any proper nouns which you may use and which we are not familiar with.  I would urge you to spell those -- such names out.  

Mr. Rukerantare, would you please briefly tell the Court about your academic background, your educational and university background.  
A.	Thank you.  I went to primary school at age 7 at the Cyuve school.  C-Y-U-V-E for Cyuve.  I attended all my primary education at that school.  

After primary school, I was admitted into the humanities and pedagogy training at the Rambuka -- Rambura Groupe scolaire.  R-A-M-B-A -- rather, M-B-U-R-A for Rambura.  

From 1989, following my secondary education, which I completed and was awarded a diploma in humanities, thereafter, I waited for a few months and then went on to begin my professional career as a state functionary in the intelligence services. 
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, so you started work as an intelligence worker; was that towards the end of 1989? 
A.	Yes.  To be more specific, on the 29th of December 1989.  
Q.	Did you receive any special training to become an intelligence agent?  And if that were the case, what type of training did you receive and how was it provided? 
A.	Such training was mandatory and was provided within the service.  The training focussed on the techniques and principles and the culture of intelligence work.  
Q.	Mr. Rukerantare, from the time you were recruited, where were you posted?  What type of work were you doing?  And could you please give us an overview as briefly as possible, and if the need were to arise subsequently, we may revisit this point in relation to your testimony.  
MR. WEYL: 
But, Mr. President, I -- I am somewhat at a loss because we are really just beginning to delve into the crux of the examination, and I wonder whether I should do that at all, or is it time for the adjournment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But, Mr. Weyl, I would hate that you would use me as an excuse for not delving into the crux of your examination.  So, if you wish to do so, you're at liberty to go ahead.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you know very well that I am not using you as an excuse and that I am not trying to avoid the crux of the matter because the witness is here exactly for that purpose.  I'm in your hands, 
	Mr. President.  And as my lead counsel says, in the hands of the clock as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Actually, it is really time to take the adjournment.  We had, in fact, asked Mr. Hometowu, the registrar, to make arrangements for an informal conference immediately after we rise, so we'll take the adjournment now and proceed to that activity.  
Mr. Witness, I should tell you that during this or any adjournment while you are a witness in the trial, you are not to discuss this case or your testimony with anybody.  

So we adjourn now until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1532H)
