P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings?
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 6th of February 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  This is my witness, 9/29, returned for cross-examination this morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Madam Witness, good morning.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before I forget and lest I forget, I don't know whether this might not be the right time to enter certain documents in respect of Witness 7/14 as Prosecution exhibit -- exhibits, two documents, the first being the letter with Sylvestre Sabondika's (as interpreted) confession and Sande Benson, that would be P. 92, their joint confession.  And the second document would be the remainder of the Gacaca report of which we have spoken and which could be entered under P. 93.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
P. 93?  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I indicate that there's objection taken to the Gacaca report in its entirety?  And that objection will be taken by Mr. O'Shea.  He just requires a little more time in order to obtain some -- yes, some further document.  

In respect of the letter, our concern, as expressed by the witness, was that it demonstrates no proper provenance, and having gone into the matter a little more since the witness himself raised it, we are concerned that this letter, purporting to be addressed to the president of the Supreme Court, doesn't go to the Supreme Court but to quite another institution with quite another jurisdiction and is marked accordingly.  Nor do we know or understand who sent it, and if they sent it, why they sent it to the wrong body, and why that wrong body, in fact, received it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would prefer not to hear this argument or submissions on these matters now.  I think we prefer to complete the testimony.  And at that stage, we would fix a time where this matter could be gone into.  
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, we would defer the assessment of the application until a bit later.  We prefer to complete the witness's testimony, and then we will deal with these legal issues later.  

Madam Witness, your testimony is going to continue today, and you will have to respond to questions put to you by the Prosecutor.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began last week.  Do you understand me?  Madam Witness, did you hear me?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It appears, Mr. President, sorry, the Kinyarwanda booth is pointing out there seems to be a hiatus in communications between them and the witness, but it's being seen to.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you.  

Mr. Issa, the position of the screen in front of the witness is blocking the view of one of the Judges, if you could just adjust it a bit, please.  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I can bid you good morning again.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Your Honour.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
You may sit.  You may sit down.  I was just explaining to you that, as your evidence continues today, you'll remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your evidence began last week.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, the Prosecutor will now put questions to you, and you'll have to respond to them.  
WITNESS 9/29 (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, Ms. Cummings-John.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There was one scheduling matter that I should have addressed at the commencement of our sitting this morning.  It appears as though we will not sit tomorrow and that we will resume on Wednesday morning.  And I just wanted to get that confirmed now.  
MR. HOOPER:
You may recall on Friday I think we had all thought that we might probably get through two witnesses, and, in fact, we got through one and -- which provoked my comment that in those circumstances, we shouldn't relinquish our morning sittings.  And it may be that we're better placed to help what will by then be self-evident to the Chamber, but to help the Chamber, if we could reserve our -- that position until we rise today.  We'll then see where we are with the witnesses who are available, the two witnesses we have today.  In other words, if we don't get through them today, my cautioning would be to sit tomorrow morning.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I got the impression that you were not in a position -- that you requested to lead your -- the next witness on Wednesday.  
MR. HOOPER:
No.  We've got this witness and the male witness who is also up for cross-examination today.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that is the - 

MR. HOOPER:
So they're both available today.  He's here.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the cross-examination?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yep.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But then the witness whose testimony has to be led and will follow --
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- I was told that you had requested -- 
MR. HOOPER:
To do it Wednesday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- to do it Wednesday. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  To do it Wednesday, yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we've had some consultation with the Prosecutor --
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah.
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- and we think that there's no point in sitting tomorrow, even if the cross-examination of the second witness is not completed, which has every possibility that it would be.  Then the completion would not take very long.  So there's no point in sitting for half an hour or one hour tomorrow. 
MR. HOOPER:
No.  No, no -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was in that context that we thought --
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, in the context --
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- that it be done --
MR. HOOPER:
-- in the context of making substantial headway -

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HOOPER:
-- with the next witness, then it wouldn't be necessary to sit tomorrow, but if we don't do that, then it would, in my view, be necessary.  All right.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, do you accept that position?  
MS. FALL:
(Nods head)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  Ms. Cummings-John, you may continue with the witness.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, I'd like to commence by asking you, how many times have you met with members of the Defence team in this case?  
A.	I only met them once.  If you're talking of the Defence lawyers, yes, I only met them once.  
Q.	And what of the investigators?  
A.	I don't understand very well which investigators you're referring to.  I don't see any difference between Defence lawyers and investigators, unless you can be more explicit, Counsel.  
Q.	Okay.  From that, then, can I conclude rightly that you have only met with any member of the Defence team in this case at one time, on one occasion?  
A.	No.  I'd like you to be more explicit.  When you say "the Defence team," do you mean your side or the other side?  
Q.	I can assure you I definitely do not mean our side.  I don't believe we've ever met with you, but I meant the other side.  So the people who you talked to who asked you to come here to testify, whatever name you're comfortable referring to them as, those people, I'm referring to those people.  How many times have you met them?  
A.	Only once.  The second time I met them was here in Arusha.  
Q.	Thank you.  And when you met them in Rwanda, did you give a statement that was written down?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you sign the statement?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Madam Witness, can you read?  
A.	I have problems with my eyesight.  I cannot read.  
Q.	Are you able to recognise names that are written down?  If your name was written on a piece of paper, would you recognise it?  
A.	Yes, I can read names.  
Q.	Do you recall signing a declaration that was written in Kinyarwanda -- I believe it would have been read to you -- which would have said that you understood the contents of your statement and that you agreed with it?  
A.	Yes, I do remember.  I know I made a statement and it was read to me, and I confirmed that what I said was the truth and did match what I had said.  
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, do you recall talking about attacks that took place on Mpungwe hill?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I believe the name is spelled on the list.  For the benefit of the parties, it's M-P-U-N-G-W-E.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Do you recall talking about attacks that took place on this hill?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you recall for us the date that these attacks took place?  
A.	I cannot tell you the exact date.  I remember which day of the week it was, but I -- and we didn't have the heart -- we didn't have it in our hearts to remember dates.  
Q.	Can you tell the Court which day of the week you recall it being on?  
A.	It was a Monday.  
Q.	Can you recall how many weeks or how many days following the fall -- the shooting-down of the president's plane that these attacks took place?  
A.	I think it was two weeks after the presidential plane crash.  
Q.	And in relation, Madam Witness, to these attacks, can you recall when you went to Butare university hospital, in relation to the Mpungwe attacks?  
A.	I was wounded during the Mpungwe attack, injured.  And as I was wounded, I spent the night on the way, and it was on the Wednesday that I was taken to the hospital.  
Q.	Were you wounded on the day of the attacks?  That was on the Monday.  
A.	Yes.  I was among the first to be wounded -- I and my child, both of us.  
Q.	And on the Monday night, where did you spend that night?  What did you do?  
A.	We spent the night in some bushes, but we were wounded.  I couldn't walk.  
Q.	And on the Tuesday, Madam Witness, did you move, or did you stay in the bushes?  
A.	I tried to walk with great difficulty, but I couldn't get to Karama the same day.  That is how I spent the night on the way.  But I wasn't alone.  I -- my children were with me.  I was accompanied by my children.  
Q.	So would I be correct in concluding that you didn't arrive in Karama on the Tuesday, having started to make your way there?  And when did you arrive in Karama then?  
A.	I spent the night on Karama hill, but I couldn't get all the way to the church -- Karama church.  I couldn't reach that place the same day.  
Q.	And can you tell us when you reached that place, Karama church?  
A.	Wednesday morning.  
Q.	And you mentioned in your evidence in-chief that a certain priest by the name of Ngomirakiza -- this name again is listed, I believe, on the list provided by the Defence -- priest on -- you met with Father Ngomirakiza, who took you to the hospital; is that correct?  
A.	No, I think you're mistaken.  Father Ngomirakiza took me from Karama.  I found him at Karama mission, and he took me to the hospital.  But we were very numerous.  There were many of us wounded -- who were wounded, and he took us in his double-cabin pickup.  Otherwise, it was Jean Kayigi (phonetic) who helped me to get into the vehicle, on the vehicle.  There were many wounded gathered together at the mission because the attacks had not yet reached the church.  
Q.	Do you recall being shown a photograph of this Father Ngomirakiza?  
A.	Yes, I remember.  Moreover, it is I who brought the photograph.  
Q.	I see.  So the photograph was your property?  
A.	It is they who took the picture, but the bishop gave us the photo as a souvenir of Ngomirakiza, and that is how it came into my possession.  That is how I had that picture.  
Q.	So would I be correct in concluding, therefore, that it was not difficult for you to identify him when asked to do so in court?  
A.	No, I had no difficulty in identifying him because he was my parish priest.  He was -- he was from the mission.  He was our parish priest.  I had no difficulty in identifying him.  
Q.	Do you recall telling the Trial Chamber during your testimony that two of your children, a boy and a girl, died at the Butare university hospital, from lack of care?  Please don't mention their names, but do you remember telling us this?  
A.	Yes.  That is what I stated, and I narrated the events as they occurred at Butare teaching hospital.  No one treated my children.  
Q.	And for my benefit, could you assist again in telling us how the girl died?  Please don't mention her name, Madam Witness.  
A.	I explained that I was with her when we were slashed at -- her carotid artery was slashed with a bladed instrument.  
Q.	And at the hospital, what happened to her?  She was in the intensive-care unit; is that correct?  
A.	When we arrived at the hospital, we were separated.  Dr. Gatera took her, and another doctor treated me.  After he left, he was -- talked to me.  But when Dr. Gatera gave her anaesthetic, he (sic) couldn't talk.  I wasn't able to communicate with her.  
Q.	And so she died?  
A.	No, she didn't die when she was still in intensive care.  She died when we were taken to ward 7.  But after she was given the anaesthetic, she never spoke again.  
Q.	I understand this is a painful event to recount, but can you tell us, when she was in ward 7, did you just wake up one morning and find that she had died, or what happened?  
A.	She expired during the night, and in the morning, on the next day, nobody even came to take away the body.  Finally they did take away the body, but I was with her all morning, whereas she died the evening before in the night.  
Q.	Now, Madam Witness, you have already told us that you gave evidence in the trial against Dr. Gatera that was held in Rwanda.  Do you recall giving a statement or statements to the Rwandan prosecutor in relation to this case?  
A.	Yes.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
These statements have been served on all parties, including the interpreters.  They were actually served by e-mail, the translations, last Thursday.  And this morning both translation and original has been provided -- have been provided to the parties here.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	I'd like to refer, Madam Witness, to both your statements.  One was given on the 5th of March 1998, and the other on the 11th of May, either 1997 or 1998.  Do you recall these dates at all?  
A.	Yes, I remember having made those two statements.  
Q.	Do you recall telling the Rwandan Prosecutor in the Gatera trial that both your children, the boy and the girl, were taken away from ward 7 of the surgery and that the following day, the body of the girl was brought back to you?  Do you recall saying this?  
A.	Yes, I remember.  What I meant was that the person who took away the corpse brought it back, and I spent the night with that corpse.  
Q.	Do you recall telling the Rwandan prosecutor in your statement of the 5th of March 1998, that, in relation to Dr. Gatera, he killed people, that you saw him carry a little axe -- I'm translating from the word "hash."  I don't know if the interpreters can assist.  
A.	(Microphones overlapping)... I never used the word "hatchet" or "axe" in my statement.  I said that among all the patients he treated, no one ever recovered, but I didn't speak of any hatchet.  
Q.	Did you remember or do you remember speaking of -- saying of him, rather, of Dr. Gatera, that he killed people?  Do you recall saying this?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	And can you tell the Chamber which people he killed?  
A.	Beginning with the soldiers and the patients, I remember Dr. Mbarutso became very angry and said, "You cannot exterminate everyone in this country.  The country is made up of three ethnic groups."  And I remember that they quarrelled about that.  
Q.	I'd like to ask you to focus on Dr. Gatera.  Who did Dr. Gatera kill?  
A.	There were many of us who had sought refuge at the hospital.  I only know the members of my family.  I cannot name anyone else.  People came from Gikongoro and all parts of the country.  I can't give you the names of all the people who sought refuge at the hospital because we had sought refuge at the hospital because we thought we would be safe there.  
Q.	So is it your statement that Dr. Gatera killed members of your family?  
A.	I'm not the only one to complain about that.  Not only did he kill members of my family, he killed many other people too.  The people were taken away and nobody came back.  Dr. Gatera never helps anyone, and all the patients who were hospitalised, everyone admitted, nobody recovered.  Of all the people admitted, no one recovered.  
Q.	Do you recall talking about a certain Injabi who accompanied Dr. Gatera, spelt I-N-J-A-B-I, to my knowledge?  
A.	I do not know Injabi.  
Q.	When your two children were taken away, was Dr. Gatera alone -- when your son and daughter were taken away?  
A.	No, it was not Dr. Gatera who took away my two children.  Those two children were carried on a stretcher, and he left after those who took away my two children.  
Q.	Do you recall, though, telling the Rwandan prosecutor -- and I shall read in French in the unofficial translation:  "Whenever Dr. Gatera came in, he left behind him dead Tutsis.  He came in where I was, and when he went out, Injabi came in.  He took my two children."  You gave the name of the children.  "The following day he brought back to me the body of my daughter."  Do you recall saying this to the Rwandan prosecutor, Madam Witness?  
A.	Yes, I remember making that statement.  However, I did not mention the name of that man.  Besides, I didn't know him, and I had never heard that name.  
Q.	So did or did not Dr. Gatera take your two children and return one of them as a body?  
A.	Yes.  I have told you that since I was bedridden, I did not see the other.  I mean the boy.  
Q.	But why did you tell the Rwandan prosecutor that they came to the ward where you were and took your children, killed them, and returned the body of the girl?  
A.	I have just explained to you that I did not see my son again.  The body of the girl was brought back to me, but I never saw my son again.  
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping)... a line where she says he killed them in the statement, yet you're putting that she said that.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have read one of the relevant parts, Your Honours.  There's a second statement which I can read, and I believe the Chamber can appreciate the context of the witness's statement and what the witness is saying.  
MR. HOOPER:
No.  You're putting to the witness from a statement that she doesn't have in front of her and which she cannot, therefore, read and assess, that she says that he killed them.  And that's not, as far as my French goes, what's said here.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, with all due respect, the witness is in a position to accept or deny, which the witness has done.  The witness cannot read, as has been told to us.  She's able to recognise names; however, she cannot read.  If I am being unfair, I believe the Chamber will direct me.  At the close of this case, the Chamber will be able to assess the documents themselves and see whether true assessment or true representation was made by myself or not.  
MR. HOOPER:
Of course, that's right.  All I'm inviting you to do is to put the statement accurately.  And what you can't put to a witness is, "You said this," when she doesn't.  Because she thinks you're talking with the authority of the statement.  And if she hasn't said that in the statement, it's misleading, and you can cause a witness then to say something that she wouldn't otherwise say, because she's been misled.  And I'm not suggesting you're doing it deliberately, but if you're going to put a part of a statement to the witness, just read it.  We can see the context, and the witness can better appreciate it.  Thank you.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I defer to Mr. President.  I believe that I have read the statement.  This is my interpretation of what the part that I read said.  If two people are taken away by someone, the following day the body of one person is brought back, the presumption -- the logical conclusion is that they have been killed, especially in the context of the fact that the witness has said that in relation to Dr. Gatera, he killed people, that he took her two children.  She said that her two children were killed at the hospital.  We can read the entire statement for ourselves.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Cummings-John, where are you reading from?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Your Honour, I am summarising because there are different parts from the statement, but we can -- I'll simply put the statement and then you can appreciate the context.  I'm more than happy to read the entire paragraph that I'm referring to.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, in your statement of the 5th of March 1998, do you recall telling the Rwandan prosecutor, again, I repeat:  "What I said regarding Dr. Gatera is that he killed people.  I saw him carrying a small axe.  Another thing is that he took my last child.  He and an intern, called Inyas (phonetic), who was working at the surgery ward, they took my two children, a boy and a girl" -- the names mentioned -- "they took them from room 7 of the surgery ward, and the following day they brought back to me the body of the girl."  

I can continue, but I think we can read the rest of it for ourselves in relation to what the witness says that was said afterwards.  Madam Witness, do you recall saying this to the Rwandan prosecutor?  
A.	I gave that statement, but if we return to the issue regarding Dr. Gatera, that issue of Dr. Gatera caused a stir.  People were angry.  I have told you that there was an association at the hospital, and I was a member thereof.  I cannot explain to you all the circumstances under which we tried to give evidence against Dr. Gatera.  It is true that we testified against him, but we gave false evidence because we did so under the auspices of our organisation, of our association.  But, subsequently, we placed our trust in God.  
Q.	So, Madam Witness, are you saying before this Chamber that you have given a false statement, a false testimony to the Rwandan prosecutor?  Is that what you're saying?  
A.	No, it was not false testimony.  Things were added to our statements.  We related the events we had witnessed, but we added some.  I remained at the hospital for two months.  As you can see, that was a long period.  
Q.	And the things that were added, from what I understand, the things that were added to your statement by you were false.  
A.	Listen, we held Gatera responsible for all those who died at the hospital, even on days when he was not working.  
Q.	So would it be fair for me to conclude that you are in the habit of giving false testimony before judges and prosecutors?  
A.	No, I did not lie.  I did not give false evidence.  I can repeat all I stated.  Furthermore, I was not alone when I gave that statement.  Those who were with me may challenge what I said in case of need.  They can tell you what I may have forgotten to mention.  
Q.	I shall move on.  Madam Witness, is it true that you were chased away from the cell, from the ward where you were, to the tents, after your children were taken away and killed?  
A.	No.  I have never told you that I lived in a tent.  Furthermore, when I came out of the room, those tents had been destroyed.  When we arrived at the hospital, there were tents.  Those tents had been set up to house the refugees.  We did not live in those tents.  Besides, those tents were destroyed while we were at the hospital.  
Q.	Again, Madam Witness, I refer to your statement given to the Rwandan prosecutor, in the case against Dr. Gatera of the 5th of March 1998, in which I read the French unofficial translation, in the same paragraph where you talk about what happened to your children, halfway down, it starts:  "After meeting them, they immediately took me out of the bed.  They took me outside, telling me their bed was not for the Tutsi.  They drove me out of the ward, and I went into the tents."  Do you recall telling the Rwandan prosecutor this?  
A.	No, that is not what I stated.  It is possible that they took down what I did not state.  I said I was driven out by Dr. Sostène, and I went out.  In the evening he came back to drive me out again.  I decided to go and spend the night at the maternity.  I never spent the night in tents.  What is stated in the statement is not true.  I went to spend the night -- I never spent the night in the tents.  
Q.	In your testimony before this Trial Chamber, do you recall talking about two people by the names of Mutabazi and Kazasomaho?  
A.	Yes.  And Kagina as well.  
Q.	Can you tell us again where you were when you saw them being taken away?  
A.	They were taken away while I was in room 7.  I knew Kagina.  ************************************.  I knew the others.  They were my neighbours.  Those children told me goodbye.  Next to my bed was a girl from Gikongoro, who had crutches.  When I heard the child say goodbye, I was afraid because it meant that -- I told myself they were not going to come back.  I went out, and I stood on the threshold of a door opposite the maternity, and I saw him being taken away below the maternity.  That was in the evening.  I never saw him again.  
Q.	And did you also have crutches when you went out to look for them -- or to see where they were going?  
A.	No.  I did not go up to where they were taken away.  I stood on the threshold of the door, and I tried to look in the direction which they were being taken.  I was in the corridor.  I did not follow them.  Everyone was saying that if he was lucky to survive, he wouldn't survive the next day.  
Q.	And did you see where they were taken to?  
A.	I have explained to you that I saw them being taken away below the maternity.  They were taken into a wooded area.  I did not follow them.  I saw them when they were being taken away.  It was in the afternoon at about 3 p.m. 
Q.	And were there other people observing the same events as you, Madam Witness?  
A.	There were many of us at the hospital.  We did not know one another.  I am sure the other people witnessed that event.  
Q.	I would like to show you a name on a piece of paper, the name of a Rwandan person, and I would like you to tell me if you know this person and if this person was there when you witnessed these two people, Mutabazi, Kazasomaho, and others, being taken away.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
If the registrar can assist.  Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if she can read that, because I'm led to believe that (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and filed under seal), she has difficulty in reading, in absorbing reading.  So it might be -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I would like to redact reference to her injury.  You remember we did a lot of work on that the last time around.  
MR. HOOPER:
That's an identifying feature.  All right.  As a result of her injury.  But I've no objection if Mr. Issa were to whisper the name in her ear, so that she'd hear it.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Can we first refer to the witness and find out whether she does have difficulty reading or not before making any suggestions.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have read that name.  I know that person.  She was with me.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	And were there any doctors present when these people were being taken away, Madam Witness?  
A.	There was Sostène.  By the way, he followed him.  I do not know whether he followed him up to the place where they were killed.  Kagina worked at the hospital.  And when he was put on board the vehicle with the others, he was not with Gatera.  
Q.	Can you tell us who followed who?  You said, "He followed him" -- or this is how the translation came out.  Who followed who?  
A.	I have just told you that it is Sostène who followed him.  But I do not know whether he followed them into the woods when they were taken away.  There were also other workers at the hospital, and Dr. Gatera was also there when they were taken away, but he did not leave with them.  When someone's name was called and that person -- when someone's name was called, that person knew that he or she was on the list of persons who had to be killed.  
Q.	And who would be responsible for calling out the name of someone who was on a list?  
A.	I have explained to you that there were a lot of people.  There were young Interahamwes, as well as soldiers.  Those who were there could take away victims.  I am, therefore, not in a position to tell you who read out those names on the list.  There was chaos in Butare at the time.  I, therefore, cannot remember those names.  
Q.	Do you know, Madam Witness, who wrote these lists of people who were to be killed?  
A.	Every day people were taken away to be killed.  I, therefore, wouldn't be able to tell you who drew up those lists.  You would be making life difficult for me by asking me such questions.  
Q.	Now, I'd like to turn to your statement that was given to the Defence investigator, Mr. Célestin Buhuru, on the 25th of June 2005.  You've already acknowledged signing this statement and having it read back to you.  So I'd like to ask you a few questions in relation to the statement.  Firstly, do you recall having a discussion or talking about discussions with members of Médecins Sans Frontières?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you tell us when these discussions took place?  
A.	It was members of Médecins Sans Frontières who stitched me up.  Let me explain further.  They came and found me there.  They stitched me up.  I never saw them again.  They were accustomed to coming and treating casualties.  At a point in time, those white persons left, and they never came back.  
Q.	But you refer in your statement to discussions taking place between them and other doctors -- and other people.  There were many people you said.  Can you tell us which discussions you were referring to?  
A.	We spoke about the war and the circumstances under which people were killed, as well as circumstances under which victims were taken away.  Anyone who knew a victim talked about it.  For instance, I could not give names of people from Gikongoro or Kigali I did not know.  As you know, there were people who had come from Kigali as well.  
Q.	I'd like to read the particular sentence that I'm trying to get -- elicit more information out of you for.  It starts:  "During the discussions with Médecins Sans Frontières, there were many people.  Dr. Gatera was there.  Dr. Mbarutso challenged that decision."  Does that refresh your memory?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	What decision did Dr. Mbarutso contest, Madam Witness?  
A.	I have told you that when Mbarutso came, he saw people scattered outside the hospital.  He also saw that the tents had been dismantled.  He passed the middle of the crowd, and he said that everyone could not be exterminated because the country will always have the three ethnic groups.  He said that when he realised that those tents, in which the refugees had been housed, had been dismantled.  
Q.	And so was he talking to the members of Médecins Sans Frontières about the dismantling of the tents?  
A.	Yes.  When he found everyone on their feet, he said he was going to find out whether members of his family had not been killed.  That was when he said, "Rwanda will always be inhabited by three ethnic groups."  When he came, he was afraid.  He was afraid that members of his family had also been killed.  
Q.	Was Dr. Mbarutso a Tutsi?  
A.	No.  He was a Hutu.  
Q.	And is it correct that he has never been accused of participating in the genocide in Butare university hospital?  
A.	No.  There have been allegations against him.  And, moreover, as of that time the allegations were levelled against him, he fell sick and died from it.  
Q.	And when he was talking to the members of Médecins Sans Frontières, you mentioned that Dr. Gatera was also present; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, he was present.  He was leaning against a pillar.  I remember the people even mocked him.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just -- I'm sorry.  We can't find the reference to Médecins Sans Frontières in the statement that you refer to.  Can you help us where it is, please?  We've just been scanning it.  If it's there, thanks.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Have you found it?  It's the second -- it's the last page of the statement. 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry, which statement is it?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
The Defence --  the statement given to the Defence investigator on the 26th -- 25th of June 2005. 
MR. HOOPER:
Sorry.  We thought you were talking about yours.  All right.  Thank you.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, other than Dr. Gatera and Dr. Mbarutso, were there other doctors present talking to Médecins Sans Frontières?  
A.	I named the doctors that I knew, but I know that they were all present.  Dr. Pascal was also present, but I did not know all the doctors.  I didn't go very often to Butare university hospital, so I didn't get to know all the doctors that worked there.  
Q.	Did you recognise Pauline Nyiramasuhuko amongst those who were discussing with Médecins Sans Frontières?  
A.	I must say that I did not know Pauline very well.  Whenever she came, the people would say, "She's coming," and we'd run and hide.  I know that she was against the Tutsi.  It was like a disease with her.  Anything she said, it was always anti-Tutsi.  It was some sort of disease with her.  
Q.	Do you recall telling us in your evidence in-chief that you did see her at the hospital whilst you were there during the genocide?  
A.	I would see her but only furtively.  Her younger sister was at the hospital, and she'd bring her food.  I would furtively look.  And everyone was afraid of her.  I couldn't describe her today.  
Q.	Did you see her committing any acts of genocide, any atrocious acts?  
A.	Yes, I saw her.  I saw her with the buses that took people away.  They took the people from the préfecture in the buses, and then they came at the hospital to take people from the hospital, and they went to Nyaruhengeri.  And I know that they were all killed at Nyaruhengeri, and only the people in one bus were able to come back to Butare.  
Q.	Do you recall also telling us about Colonel Tharcisse Muvunyi?  Do you recall seeing him at the hospital?  
A.	I saw all the soldiers at the hospital, but I didn't know their names.  I heard him mentioned.  I heard his name mentioned.  
Q.	And when did you hear his name mentioned?  
A.	During the war, and before fleeing to the hospital, I saw him in our home area with the prefect.  But I don't -- didn't have any more information about him.  
Q.	So you didn't see him and recognise that this is Colonel Muvunyi while you were at the hospital?  
A.	I would hear him mentioned, but I did not see him at the hospital.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President, I think I perhaps have another 15 minutes' worth of questions.  I don't know if you would like to take the break or shall I continue?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, I think it would be better to take the break now.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Madam Witness, we take our mid-morning recess now, and we'll resume in a few minutes' time. 
(Court recessed at 1041H) 
(Pages 1 to 15 by Wendy Molnar) 



(Court resumed at 1109H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can continue now.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Madam Witness, can you tell the Court how many places you were while seeking refuge or whilst being treated at the hospital?  During your time at hospital, how many places were you? 
A.	I lived everywhere, practically everywhere, except at the paediatric ward. 
Q.	After arriving at the hospital in two weeks or so, two weeks or so after the president's death, during the month of April, where were you?  
A.	I was first at the intensive care unit, and from there I was transferred to room 7.  
Q.	And when did you leave room 7?  This is room 7 of the maternity ward; is that correct? 
A.	No, it was room 7 of the surgery ward. 
Q.	When did you leave room 7 of the surgery ward, and where did you go to?  
A.	I went to the maternity ward, but I should point out that, during the day, I wasn't at the maternity ward.  I only went there to sleep. 
Q.	And, during the day, where were you?  
A.	I hid here and there, outside.  
Q.	Do you know how many wards there are at the Butare university hospital? 
A.	I do not know the exact number of wards at the Butare university hospital. 
Q.	So when you say that you lived everywhere, are you speaking literally or -- 
A.	Yes, I hid practically everywhere, up to the point when Sostène hid me.  On one occasion I sought refuge in the room reserved for people with dysentery.  Besides, I contracted dysentery while hiding in that room.  By the time I left that room, I had already contracted dysentery.  And I was treated.  
Q.	Am I right in understanding that Dr. Sostène hid you at one point? 
A.	No.  He instead drove me away.  He did not hide me.  He said that it was safe outside and that we had to leave the hospital.  
Q.	Can you recall when this was? 
A.	I am unable to give you the date. 
Q.	Now, do you recall in your evidence-in-chief referring to people from Arusha who had come and given you and other people money?  Do you recall talking about this?  
A.	Yes, I remember giving that statement.  I said that people came to visit our association and that one of them came into the office, in the room where we were, and related all the experiences we had experienced.  When they understood that we all had the same problems, they promised to send us financial assistance.  Our leader said that they sent 4 million Rwandan francs, but we realised that the head of our association embezzled the funds, and that was why members of the association were angry, and some of us left the association.  I should point out that that team did not give the money on the same day.  They said that money would be used for providing medical care.  We asked our leaders to give us the money so that we could use it for someone -- something else, because the fund for genocide survivors provided for our health care.  We went to see the person called Marius and we explained the problem to him.  Marius was the Prosecutor of Butare.  And since he did nothing to solve the problem, some members of the association left the association.  I was one of those who left the association.  
Q.	Do you know who the people were who had come from Arusha?  
A.	In fact, that was the only occasion when I saw those people.  Besides, when they came, they sat in an office and we only saw them briefly.  I met them very briefly in that room. 
Q.	Did they tell you who they were?  
A.	Although they introduced themselves, I believe they introduced themselves only to our leader.  I don't think they introduced themselves to us. 
Q.	Do you know if they were from this Tribunal?  
A.	When I say that they did not introduce themselves, I am referring to their names.  I mean that they did not give us their names.  Otherwise, they specified that they came from this Tribunal. 
Q.	Did they specify which section they came from? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And you received confirmation that following their visit, they sent 4 million Rwandan francs to you, to your association?  
A.	Yes.  That information was given to us by the reverend sister. 
Q.	And do you know if this sum was sent by an individual or by a group?  
A.	In fact, when the team arrived -- and it was a team of two people -- since they did not speak our language, the reverend sister interpreted for us.  So there were three of them in the office.  When they spoke to us, the reverend sister interpreted. 
Q.	So when they spoke to you, they didn't say to you that they wanted you to come and testify against anyone here at the Tribunal?  
A.	No, we did not broach that judicial issue during our interview.  They only asked us to relate our respective experiences, what each of us had experienced, and each one related the problems they had had during the war. 
Q.	And they did not say that they were going to send you money so that you could go and testify against Dr. Gatera?  
A.	No.  At the time the Gatera trial had already started.  They arrived while the Gatera trial was in process.  I remember we went to the Gatera trial on a daily basis.  Because the people who went to give evidence against Gatera were more than 20 in number. 
Q.	And these people, were they white or black? 
A.	They were white -- or, rather, they were black.  I beg your pardon. 
Q.	Were they Africans, do you know?  
A.	No.  I am unable to say whether they were Africans or not.  As far as I am concerned, all dark-skinned persons are considered as Rwandans by myself.  
Q.	So you have no further information that you can provide in relation to these people who sent you 4 million Rwandan francs?  You know nothing else about them, apart from that they were black and from the Tribunal, and they were two in number? 
A.	No, I have never said that they came from the Tribunal.  What I said was that they told us that they were from Arusha. 
Q.	My final line of questioning:  I'm going to submit to you, Madam Witness, the list of names, six in total, and next to each name is a number, and I would like to ask that you refer to the people by the number written next to them, not by their names.  I'm going to put certain questions to you in relation to these people, and I'd like you to answer the questions and refer to the number that is written next to the name.  Do you understand me?  
A.	Yes, I do.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
If Mr. Issa -- thank you.  
THE WITNESS:
I truly am unable to read.  I cannot read the names.  I have problems with my sight, and it is difficult for me to read these names.  
BY MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Q.	Would it help you if, as I did when you recognised that first name written on the piece of paper, if I wrote down the names one by one and then we discuss them that way?  Would that assist you at all?  
A.	I have problems with my sight.  I am unable to read what is written on this sheet of paper. 
Q.	Okay, let's start with one name and then you can tell me if you can read from what I've written.  It's written in the same size as the name that you were able to identify? 
MR. HOOPER:
Unless it's inconvenient, couldn't we go into closed session for five minutes and deal with it, deal with the names in that way, as a suggestion?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
(Microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, Counsel.
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Sorry, I have no objection to us going into closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We go into closed session now.

(Pages 16 to 19 by Karen Holm)




































BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, the one name that hasn't been put to you at all this morning is the name of André Rwamakuba.  And can you confirm that at no time did you hear of such a man, at any time, either then or in the years since, being involved in the genocide at the hospital?  Are you in a position to confirm that, please?  
A.	I have told you that I did not hear that name mentioned, and that the first person -- the only person I know is called Joseph Rwamakuba, and he had been a member of parliament.
Q.	Those are all the questions, Madam Witness.  And it only really leaves me to say, obviously on behalf of the Defence and, in particular, on behalf of Dr. Rwamakuba, to thank you for coming here and the effort that that's taken.  I have no idea whether you want to meet Dr. Rwamakuba or not.  Maybe you don't.  But if the opportunity arises for you to do so, well, can I invite the President to, should this witness wish to see him at all, to grant her that facility?
A.	Do you want me to meet him so as to identify him?  I don't know him.  I told you, the only person I know bearing the name Rwamakuba was that member of parliament.  So this Rwamakuba you're talking of, I don't know him.  Do you want me to meet him to identify him?
Q.	Well, madam, he's not here.  He's in the prison here, but I know he'd be honoured to meet you.  Whether you want to meet him is a matter for you, but it assists any meeting that might take place if a request of mine to the Court here is allowed; in other words, if you wish to avail yourself of a meeting, then I ask or request the President's permission for WVSS to facilitate it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, your testimony has come to an end now.  The Tribunal thanks you for giving testimony before it.  So you are now free to leave.  In accordance with the request made by Mr. Hooper, you have permission to visit the Accused if you wish to do so.  There's no requirement for you to do it and you don't have to go and visit him if you don't want to.  
MR. HOOPER:
May I please -- 
THE WITNESS:
But, Mr. President, I should like to go home as soon as possible because I left the children alone at home.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I ask, please, WVSS -- excuse me, please.  WVSS, can I please ask that this witness is not taken from the court until myself and Mr. O'Shea have had a chance to speak with her before she goes?  Not taken back to the safe house.  Thank you very much.  She can stay here for the half hour or so.  

And can I call the next witness, please?  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Cummings-John. 
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Would this be a good time to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I have just three documents:  one, the Defence statement summary that was served on all parties, and the other two are the two Rwandan statements given in the case of -- the Rwandan Prosecutor versus Dr. Geoffrey Gatera. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Will you put them in separately or as one document, one exhibit?  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
I'd be happy to put the two Rwandan statements as one document.  They also contain the unofficial translations.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry.  

Yes, admitted in that way.  
MS. CUMMINGS-JOHN:
Thank you.  And they should both be under seal, as they contain the witness's name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal.  The numbers are 94 and 95.  P. 94 and 95; is that right, Mr. Fry?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, P. 92 and P. 93; is that correct?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry.  Thank you.  
(Exhibit No. P. 92 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. P. 93 admitted, under seal) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, the two matters that are still not yet decided, does it matter if they come out of sequence?  
MR. HOOPER:
This is my Witness 9/31 who returns for cross-examination.  Thank you.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, sir. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We thank you for coming back to court this morning.  Your testimony will continue.  You will be questioned by the Prosecutor.  I remind you that you are under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began last week.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I shall bear that in mind. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS 9/31 (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  
Q.	Witness, I'm going to put a few questions to you regarding matters discussed under examination-in-chief and perhaps only dwell on a few points.  In closed session you pointed out where you live -- I won't come back to that -- and you also pointed out the house of a person identified as No. 1 on the list.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I remember. 
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you tell us whether where you lived before the house of the person identified as No. 1 was closer to ************************** than your house?  
A.	You're referring to house No. 1 in relation to *************** and my house in relation to ***********?  We all lived in the same place.  We lived very close to each other. 
Q.	I shall try and be more specific.  Was the house belonging to No. 1 in front or behind yours? 
A.	We all lived in the same trading centre.  Our houses -- our houses were very close together. 
Q.	Yes, Witness, you did even specify that your house was a hundred -- or, rather, 80 metres from No. 1's house.  What I'm asking you is, did your house come first or second, even if you lived close to each other? 
A.	The person lives at the distance that I told you, and between our two houses there is about 80 or a hundred metres.  And when you say "80 to a hundred metres", that means that there's a short distance between our two houses, but nonetheless I reside in the same trading centre as the person you mentioned.  We both lived in ******************************.  
Q.	You still haven't answered my question in respect of that trading centre, Witness.  Was your house before No. 1 or after?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, I think you're going to have to rephrase the question.  He says they both live in the trading centre, so it's difficult to say which one was closer to the trading centre in which they both live.  So you'll have to relate your question to some other circumstance which he can grasp.  I think he's been trying to answer your question by saying that they both live in the same trading centre, so he can't say which one is closer to the trading centre.  I think that's what he's trying to say.  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, but if I refer to the witness's statement -- 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	You did state that you're in the same alignment in **************************.  
A.	Yes, that is what I stated.  Our houses are in the same alignment.  
Q.	And you were shown, I think, three photographs and on the three photographs you identified house No. 1 as being that belonging to No. 1, and house No. 2 as being yours.  Do you recall that? 
MR. HOOPER:
House No. 3 is his, or photo 3.  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, yes, yes, that is correct. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	And in reference to those photographs, is it correct to say that the house of No. 1 was, therefore, before yours in the same alignment? 
A.	Yes.  You pass before house number -- belonging to No. 1 before you reach my house. 
MR. HOOPER:
Depending, of course, which direction you come, because if you go the other way, you pass his house first, which is part of the difficulty of dealing with it just in this way.  They're all part of a line of houses.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Well, to be more specific, let us say if one comes from Kigali.  
A.	If you come from Kigali, you get to No. 1 first and then you get to me at house No. 3. 
Q.	Thank you for that clarification.  You told us that you witnessed certain attacks that occurred at that trading centre.  
A.	I do not very well understand the attacks you are referring to.  Did you say three attacks?  
Q.	I have the impression that you are not understanding my question.  I've asked you whether you stated here that you witnessed attacks that occurred at ****************************.  
A.	Yes, I referred to one attack against ***********************. 
Q.	We will return to this matter.  You also stated during a closed session that you provided services in a certain area.  I won't mention that area because it could lead to your identity being divulged.  Do you remember stating that?  
A.	No.  I never engaged in any political activities. 
Q.	No, I am not talking of political activities.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I thought we could avoid a closed session, but given the circumstances, I would apply for a closed session.  I wanted to avoid a closed session by all means, hoping she would answer specific questions regarding the services provided in a certain area.  I have tried to be as specific as possible, but I'm not getting the answers I expect, and that is why I believe it would be better for us to go into closed session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we go into closed session now.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 29 to 30] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 24 to 28 by Karen Holm)





















BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Before we proceed, Witness, on this subject, let me ask you one question.  Do you know the person called Rwamakuba? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us for how long you have known him -- for how long you had known him during that period? 
A.	I have known Rwamakuba for several years, but as -- I last saw him about ten years ago, more than ten years ago. 
Q.	You say you have known him for a long time.  Can you tell us during what period approximately you knew him, and under what circumstances? 
A.	First of all, I knew him while I was in primary school, perhaps in the third year at the primary school.  We went to play football in Nduba area.  There was a pupil from his family.  That pupil was a good footballer, and that child was pointed out, and we were told that that child's father was Rwamakuba's brother.  

Secondly, I saw Rwamakuba when I went to Kigali to attend a wedding.  I was a youngster at the time.  I was a young man.  I was single at the time, but I was big enough.  That is when I saw him for the second time.  
Q.	You say that was when you saw him for the second time.  But when you talked about the first occasion, I do not remember you saying that you saw André Rwamakuba.  You stated that you went to play football on the field in Nduba, and you said there was a child who stood out because he played football very well, and someone pointed at him and said he was the son of Rwamakuba's brother.  On that occasion, did you see Rwamakuba?  
A.	No.  A finger was pointed, rather, at Rwamakuba, and we were told that that man was the uncle of that boy who was playing very well.  
Q.	Would it be possible for you, Witness, to give us an approximate period or date for that event, or for those events? 
A.	I believe it was around 1978, 1979.  I do not very well remember the exact date. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, we did not hear the Prosecutor's question because of an overlap. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, could you repeat the question?  The interpreters did not get it because of an overlap of microphones.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Let me repeat the very last question.  I suppose that's the one you did not hear.  Is it therefore possible, from what you said, that during that period of 1978-1979, André Rwamakuba came to Nduba to watch football matches? 
A.	In fact, I do not know why he had come to Nduba, but -- I do not know whether he came on that occasion to watch a match or whether he came for something -- for some other reason.  It was said that he was the uncle of that child who distinguished himself during the football match; that is all. 
Q.	But the fact remains that he was there, present, during the football match organised by primary school pupils, isn't it?  
A.	No, he was not at that school.  He was further off.  He was not like instructor at that school. 
Q.	Let us now return to the second occasion when you said you saw André Rwamakuba.  Can you tell us approximately at what time that was, what period that was? 
A.	Regarding the second occasion, I told you that I had gone to Kigali to attend someone's wedding.  Since I had already seen him while I was a pupil, I recognised him.  When I looked at that man carefully, I remembered that I had seen him before that occasion, while I was still a pupil.  I looked at him and I realised that I recognised him. 
Q.	And regarding the second meeting, you said that was ten years ago.  Are you in a position to give us an approximate date? 
A.	I believe that was 12 or 13 years ago.  I believe it was around 1991 or 1992.  On that occasion a young man who had invited our church to his wedding invited us.  I believe it was around 1991, 1992.  That is, therefore, about 11 or 12 years ago, and you can see that that was a very long time ago. 
Q.	Witness, you also stated that you were not aware of Rwamakuba attending any political rallies in that area.  
A.	Yes, that is what I stated. 
Q.	Please answer this question with a "yes" or "no".  Do you know whether any rallies were organised in Gikomero commune? 
A.	The commune was a very big administrative area.  I do not know whether such rallies were held.  It is possible that they were held, but I was not aware of them. 
Q.	Since you were not aware of rallies organised, you are, therefore, not in a position to say who attended such rallies, are you? 
A.	I am not in a position to tell you the names of persons who attended those rallies.  You could perhaps question me regarding what happened in Gikomero, our area.  I would be in a position to answer such questions. 
Q.	Witness, please answer my questions.  You also stated that the name André Rwamakuba was never mentioned during Gacaca sessions.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you attend all Gacaca sessions in your cellule? 
A.	Yes, I attended almost all sessions of the Gacaca court, apart from three.  
Q.	Could it be that during the three sessions you did not attend, André Rwamakuba's name could have been mentioned? 
A.	No.  His name was not mentioned because before the next Gacaca session is held, the minutes of the last Gacaca session are read out to make sure nothing was omitted or badly taken down.  So I attended the sessions held after the ones during which I was absent. 
Q.	Would you be surprised to hear that some persons recognised before this Court said that André Rwamakuba's name was mentioned during those Gacaca sessions? 
MR. HOOPER:
Before you answer that question, we've had no evidence to that effect concerning any Gacaca court that this man attended.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I believe we can refer to the transcripts of testimonies of certain witnesses who appeared before this Court, and it is up to the Bench to assess those transcripts and the evidence therein.  I don't want to return to those statements, but by reading the transcripts, you would be able to know what was actually said. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm asserting that no witness has stated that any of the Gacaca proceedings that this witness has referred to were Gacaca proceedings where André Rwamakuba's name was mentioned.  There is no evidence.  So to put it to the witness that that is the case is wrong and misleading, and the question should be withdrawn in that way.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, did you assert in your statement that all what was said during Gacaca sessions was recorded in a report that was sent to the regional office and that Rwamakuba's name was never mentioned on any occasion?  
A.	Yes, that is what I stated. 
Q.	Would you again be surprised to hear that other persons, perhaps some other cellules, mentioned Rwamakuba's name? 
A.	I would not be surprised.  If those people have evidence regarding what happened in their cellules, they could present such evidence.  I myself am talking about what happened in my cellule, and I say that his name was never mentioned.  
Q.	You, therefore, cannot appear before this Chamber and assert that all the evidence was presented and that André Rwamakuba's name was never mentioned, as you have just said and which has been echoed by counsel for the Defence? 
A.	No, that does not contradict what I said.  I said that in my cellule, and in the neighbouring cellules, which are four in number, the name André Rwamakuba was never mentioned.  This, therefore, does not contradict what I stated.  Those from those four neighbouring cellules never mentioned André Rwamakuba's name because he never came to our cellule.  
Q.	The Chamber will appreciate the evidence or assess the evidence.  
Let us return to certain events.  In answer to some questions put to you -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
About how far are you from completing your cross-examination?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, it all depends on the witness's answers, but I believe I should be done in about 40 minutes, perhaps less.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think we should take the lunch break now, unless there is any particular reason why you think it's important to complete, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Personally, Mr. President, I will abide by the Court's decision, but I don't think there's -- I don't know when is the best time to speak of certain submissions, arguments, that Mr. Hooper raised.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those are legal matters; they can be dealt with at any time.  We are more concerned at the moment with -- what our major concern was, was completing your cross-examination of these witnesses and the testimony of any other witnesses that the Defence would produce.  So we wanted to give priority, court-time priority, to the completion of the taking of the evidence because we can address the legal issues at any time.  So my real question was that, as far as we are concerned, we think that if we took the break now and resumed on Wednesday morning, as we had originally -- that would give us sufficient time to complete all the evidence that was remaining in this trial.  We just wondered if you would accept that that was possible.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'd, if possible, request that, if it's possible to sit later this morning, to get further into the witness -- 40 minutes is quite a chunk, and we know how that can double.  And if I've got an entire witness on Wednesday, plus the man who is coming back with prison documents -- because we've got them now -- I was hoping, in fact, to close my -- and also in terms of the other witnesses, the one who is on a transfer, we should know certainly by Wednesday whether that person on a transfer is in a position to be transferred at all.  It's not looking good for us at the moment.  

So the reality is this, that I would be in a position to close my case on Wednesday, with leave to reapply to open it if the subpoena witnesses emerge by Friday, but to conclude my case by Friday.  In other words, I would be in a position, to that extent, if possible, to introduce a degree of certainty in the case, to close the case on Wednesday.  That's my expectation.  But I think it would be help if a little more time could be spent this morning to allow Ms. Fall to cross-examine this witness, rather than have him in three chunks, as it were, which is a difficulty for the witness, as well as for everyone else.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we think it's better to stick to the schedule.  All the administrative support would be affected, and the Court has another use at the usual time.  What we will do, though, we will try to facilitate the possibility of closure on Wednesday, if that becomes a reality, and we will ensure that the administrative support staff is geared to sit a little longer on Wednesday, if that becomes necessary or desirable.  So we take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Witness, we are going to take our adjournment today now, and your testimony will continue on Wednesday.  We trust at that time that it will all be concluded.  I remind you that you are not to discuss the case or your testimony during this adjournment.  

We take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1239H)
