         2        today.  He is on another matter.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  Interpreter, could you 

         4        please tell Witness KAA that the Trial Chamber reminds 

         5        him of the solemn declaration that he made yesterday and 

         6        that he will continue with his evidence today on that 

         7        same solemn declaration.  

         8        

         9        Yes, Counsel.

        10                  EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF(continued) 

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, yesterday before we adjourned, you told us that 

        13        you were on the road going towards the Busogo road -- 

        14        going towards ISAE when you saw the crowd coming towards 

        15        you and let them pass.  You went to the side, you were  

        16        describing the individuals who were there.  Witness, 

        17        what did you do, if anything, after the crowd you saw 

        18        the crowd coming towards you?

        19   A.   As the crowd was moving in our direction and as I said, 

        20        that members of the crowd were armed with traditional 

        21        weapons, guns and grenades, we avoided this crowd.  We 

        22        went to the lower side of the road and we waited for 

        23        them to pass before we could get some information on the 

        24        events that we were observing. We intended to speak to 

        25        those who came after the crowd or some members of the 

        26        crowd.

        27   Q.   I am sorry, Your Honour, I didn't hear any of this.  

        28        Could we have the translation again?

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes you can read back the answer for counsel 

        30        to hear.  Can you now hear.

          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I am hearing you.

         2   THE WITNESS: Since this crowd was moving towards us, and 

         3        since the members of the crowd were armed with 

         4        traditional weapons, guns and grenades, we went to the 

         5        lower side of the road to allow the crowd to pass.  We 

         6        intended to get some information from those people 

         7        coming after the crowd or from some members of the 

         8        crowd.

         9   Q.   Witness, did you at the time that you saw the crowd 

        10        coming towards you, did you have any idea what these 

        11        people were about, what they were intending to do?

        12   A.   The intentions of the members of the crowd were clear 

        13        within the group, there were war-displaced persons and 

        14        others.  Some members of the group were singing saying 

        15        "let's exterminate them."  Others, that is the displaced 

        16        people were saying that these people had sent them away 

        17        from their properties and that they could no longer 

        18        stand for that.

        19   Q.   Witness, how were you able to identify those individuals 

        20        whom you described as being displaced people?

        21   A.   I was able to recognise them because some of these 

        22        displaced persons lived in neighbouring localities, and 

        23        in those localities, particularly Byangabo, Busogo and 

        24        even in my own locality, one could see these displaced 

        25        persons passing by and given the conditions under which 

        26        they lived, they would normally go to the rural areas to 

        27        gather some means of survival.  They themselves were 

        28        saying that they had been sent away from their houses.  

        29        It was therefore, clear that these were people who were  

        30        forcibly displaced from their homes.

         1        Further, their clothes distinguished them from other 

         2        members of the population.  Their clothes were dirty and 

         3        torn.  There were so many indices that enabled one to 

         4        distinguish them.

         5   Q.   Now, Witness, did you at that time, I may have asked you 

         6        this question, but I think, just for today, I need to 

         7        re-establish it.  Did you at that time see 

         8        Juvénal Kajelijeli or his vehicle?

         9   A.   I was able to observe these people who were passing 

        10        because I stopped to let them pass.  I did not want to 

        11        be part of this group whose objectives I did not know.  

        12        I was able to observe and I didn't see Kajelijeli nor 

        13        his vehicle in the crowd.

        14   Q.   Now, did there come a time when you followed these 

        15        individuals and could you tell the Chamber, what if 

        16        anything,  you did after the crowd passed?

        17   A.   When this crowd passed and there were fewer and fewer 

        18        people, I decided to follow them and I was wondering  

        19        where they were going and what they were going to do.  

        20        So out of curiosity, I followed the others to see what 

        21        was going to happen.

        22   Q.   Now, Witness, you said you followed, where you alone, or  

        23        were you with others?  If so, could you tell the 

        24        Tribunal who you were with at that time that you were 

        25        following the crowd?

        26   A.   No, I was not alone.  When I was following this crowd, I 

        27        was in the company of other young men that I mentioned 

        28        and the two girls, those two people that accompanied me 

        29        when I left my locality in the beginning.

        30   Q.   Now, Witness, did there come a time when you saw where

         1        these individuals were heading to, what specific 

         2        location they were heading to?

         3   A.   Since we were not far from the road to the Busogo 

         4        parish, we took that road towards the Busogo parish and 

         5        left the road that goes to our locality to move towards 

         6        the Busogo parish.

         7   Q.   Did you see this group arrive at any location, and  if 

         8        so, what location did you see them arrive at?

         9   A.   This crowd went to the building which was the residence 

        10        of the religious community.

        11   Q.   Are you familiar with this facility in this area?

        12   A.   Yes, it is a place that I am very familiar with and I 

        13        know very well, and it is a place not very far from the 

        14        parish and that parish is where I normally attend church 

        15        services.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I would like to show the 

        17        witness, Prosecutor's Exhibit, P7, Photograph 51, 52 and 

        18        53.

        19   THE WITNESS:  Very well.

        20   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        21   Q.   Witness, I would like you to look at photograph 51, and 

        22        can you tell the Chamber whether or not you can identify 

        23        that particular photograph and if so, what is it?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Photograph?

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Fifty-One in Prosecutor's Exhibit 7.

        26   THE WITNESS:  Yes, I recognise the photograph 51 which is the 

        27        Busogo parish.  On this Photograph 51, we see the 

        28        Busogo church building.

        29   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        30   Q.   Witness, does this photograph of the parish and

         1        grounds -- was this structure and the grounds as you 

         2        remember it in April 1994 or are there any differences 

         3        that you can see?

         4   A.   When I look at this photograph and I compare it to what 

         5        I saw in April 1994, I realise that there is a slightly 

         6        modification regarding the church building itself.  I do 

         7        not see any difference compared to what I saw in April 

         8        1994, but regarding the compound around the church 

         9        building, I think there are changes, there are weeds 

        10        within the church compound, but at that time there were 

        11        no weeds within the church compound.

        12   Q.   Did the witness actually say weeds?  I am not sure what 

        13        he said?

        14   A.   Weeds.  

        15   Q.   What was -- what if anything was in front of the church 

        16        compound if there were not weeds?  Could you describe   

        17        to the Trial Chamber what the church compound looked 

        18        like?

        19   A.   I did not want to say, I did not mean that there was no 

        20        vegetation within the compound at that time.  Those 

        21        days, there was grass which was well-maintained, but now 

        22        when I look at the photograph, there is some vegetation, 

        23        but which is not what used to be, which is not well-kept 

        24        like what used to be there.   

        25        

        26        Another difference is that in 1994, outside the church 

        27        building, there were temporary structures made with 

        28        plastics.   At that time, there were many of them and on 

        29        this photograph I cannot see any.

        30   Q.   Do you know what, those you call temporary structures

         1        made out plastics were used for?

         2   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: I meant that there were displaced 

         3        people who were living in these structures, these 

         4        temporary structures covered with what the witness 

         5        referred to as sheeting.  So there were some displaced 

         6        people who would spend the night outside the church and 

         7        some lived in these temporary structures.

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Witness, I would like you to look at Photograph 52, and 

        10        53 and could you tell the Tribunal whether you have seen 

        11        these structures before and if so, what are they?

        12   A.   Yes, I recognised that photograph.

        13   Q.   And what does the photograph depict?

        14   A.   On this photograph, there are buildings which served as 

        15        residence for the nuns.

        16   Q.   And did you see that particular building in April of 

        17        1994?

        18   A.   Yes, I saw them.

        19   Q.   And, can you tell the Trial Chamber after you said you 

        20        followed this crowd, did you see the crowd approach any 

        21        of these structures and if so, which; that is with 

        22        respect to 51,  Photograph 51, or 52 or 53?

        23   A.   This crowd was moving towards the building in 

        24        Photographs 52 and 53.

        25   Q.   And did there come a time when you arrived at the 

        26        vicinity of the building shown in Photograph 52 and 53?

        27   A.   Yes, I got there.

        28   Q.   And what if anything, did you observe?

        29   A.   I saw a large crowd and some members of the crowd were 

        30        carrying clubs, guns and grenades.  I saw some members

         1        of the crowd throw stones and sticks on the roof of the  

         2        building and some roofs and some windows were broken. 

         3   Q.   When you arrived at the scene, had this activity that 

         4        you described had it already begun, that is the throwing 

         5        of the grenades and other objects at the building?

         6   A.   Yes, this activity had already started.

         7   Q.   How far were you from the structure you described as the 

         8        nuns' convent when you were making these observations?   

         9        How far were you?

        10   A.   I cannot give you specifically the distance between me 

        11        and that building.  When those people were shooting and 

        12        throwing grenades towards these buildings, people were 

        13        running and then they would come back when there were 

        14        few shots, but I cannot tell you the exact distance 

        15        between me and that building.

        16   Q.   Witness, were you able to identify anyone within the 

        17        crowd of people you saw there, either among the 

        18        attackers or the spectators?

        19   A.   I cannot assert that all those persons present there 

        20        were attackers.  So when I make reference to attackers, 


        21        I am referring to those who were throwing stones, and 

        22        other missiles at the building, but there were those who 

        23        were there out of curiosity just as myself and just as I 

        24        was able to identify some of the attackers, I was able 

        25        to identify other people.  Obviously there were other 

        26        people that I could not identify.

        27   Q.   Can you tell the Trial Chamber the people and you can 

        28        mention names of people you identified who were there at 

        29        the time when you saw the attack taking place?

        30   A.   Most of the people I knew, I only knew them by sight.  I

         1        did not know their names, given the fact that most of 

         2        these people came from localities other than mine, but 

         3        there was a soldier who came from the same locality as 

         4        mine.  His name was Hashery, and I saw him there and it 

         5        was said he was the leader of the attackers during this 

         6        attack.

         7   Q.   Could you tell the Trial Chamber --

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you spell out the name of the soldier, 

         9        Hashere.

        10   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: I spell it the way I heard it; 

        11        S-A-H-R-I-S-H-E-R-I.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, let's have the witness spell the name  

        13        so that we will show what the witness meant.

        14   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        15   Q.   Witness, you identified someone and gave a name.  Can 

        16        you spell the name of that individual to the 

        17        interpreter?

        18   THE WITNESS: R-A-C-H-E-L.

        19   Q.   Now, Witness, could you tell us what this individual was 

        20        wearing, if anything?

        21   A.   Some of these people were wearing military uniforms and 

        22        others were wearing civilian clothes.

        23   Q.   Witness, with respect to the person you identified, 

        24        spelled, R-A-C-H-E-L, could you tell the Tribunal what 

        25        that person was wearing?

        26   A.   This person called Rachel was wearing a black military 

        27        beret.  He was wearing a jacket with a code around the 

        28        waist.  He was also wearing boots and was carrying an 

        29        RA rifle.

        30   Q.   What if anything, did you see Rachel doing?

         1   A.   As I have already said, at the time these attackers were 

         2        shooting in the direction of that building and when they 

         3        were throwing grenades on the building, onlookers would 

         4        run back, but at one point we would stop to see what was 

         5        happening and in all, we were seeing explosions around 

         6        the building.

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, were the shootings and explosions -- were 

         8        they continuous over the length of time that you were 

         9        there or were there pauses?

        10   A.   The gunshots we were hearing were intermittent.  

        11        Sometimes we would hear the gunshots, then there would 

        12        be a pause and then another burst of gunshots.

        13   Q.   Witness, did you see anyone among the attackers or other 

        14        individuals enter that building while you were there?

        15   A.   When the gunshots stopped, we observed people going in 

        16        and out of the building and there were others who were 

        17        looking into the building from the windows.

        18   Q.   Now, Witness, did you hear any noises coming from within 

        19        the building during the time that you were there?

        20   A.   I could hear noises from the nuns' convent.  People were 

        21        shouting and asking for assistance.  There were cries of 

        22        distress.

        23   Q.   Do you know at that time, did you know who were in the 

        24        nuns' convent?  Do you know -- did you have any idea who 

        25        were in the nuns' convent?

        26   A.   Since, the convent belonged to the nuns, I said to 

        27        myself that it would be the nuns who would be in the 

        28        building.  Regarding other people, I am unable to say 

        29        who else could be there. 

        30   Q.   Now, how long did the attack last as far as you recall?

         1        What was the duration?

         2   A.   At the time, I was not wearing a watch.  Even now, I 

         3        don't have a watch, but I think the attack must have 

         4        lasted over an hour, an hour twenty minutes.  It didn't 

         5        last very long.

         6   Q.   And did you stay there throughout this attack?

         7   A.   Yes, I remained there for the entire duration of the 

         8        attack and even when the attackers left, I stayed on for 

         9        a while.

        10   Q.   And why did you remain there?

        11   A.   I remained there to see those who were crying out from 

        12        within the building and  I wanted to make sure that they 

        13        were nuns.

        14   Q.   Why did you want to make sure of the identity of the 

        15        individuals?

        16   A.   *********************************************

        17        ***, I wanted to be sure that there were nuns and to 

        18        know what had happened to them.  Besides, I want to know 

        19        if there were other persons and to see if anything 

        20        happened to them.

        21   Q.   Witness, did you see any bodies or did you see anyone 

        22        being killed that day?

        23   A.   There was an event which occurred in front of the 

        24        building where there was a patch of grass.  There was a 

        25        child who was hiding in the flowers that were there.  

        26        Someone saw the plants moved and he moved towards that 

        27        direction and threw a stone on the child.  Since we were 

        28        there, we cried out and the person turned around and 

        29        said:  You are also part of the group and since the 

        30        person had a gun, we fled, but this event made me very

         1        sad and up to today, when I remember that event, I 

         2        become very sad.

         3   Q.   Witness, after that event where did you go?

         4   A.   After that incident, we ran to the back and then we came 

         5        back and since these people had moved on, there was a 

         6        pause and then I went through the door, at the back and 

         7        got to the inner courtyard.  I saw dead bodies.  There 

         8        were bodies with broken heads and brains visible.  There 

         9        were also little children.

        10   Q.   Witness, I would like you to look at Photograph 54 and  

        11        ask you whether or not you identify that photograph?

        12   A.   Yes, I see the photograph and I see the building.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Which photograph is that, Counsel.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Fifty-four.

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Witness, were you -- did you see that particular 

        17        location on the 7th of April 1994?

        18   A.   Going through that door, you can see the other building 

        19        directly and since I went through that door, I was able 

        20        to see that space.

        21   Q.   And was this an area where you saw the bodies that you 

        22        previously described?

        23   A.   Some of the bodies were on the patch of grass but there 

        24        were others close to the wall.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Is he showing us something, Counsel?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that he is referring to 54.  Maybe 

        27        we should have him go to the screen.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT:  If he is showing something, he should show to 

        29        all of us, perhaps.

         2   Q.   Witness, can you go to the overhead projector. 

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: And could we display photograph 54, which I 

         4        think the witness was addressing.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, before the witness shows this 

         6        photograph, whatever he has to show, do we see that this 

         7        is the -- is it the inner side of the building?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I would like the witness to identify 

         9        it.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  He said he went through a door and then 

        11        in the inner courtyard, that is where he saw the dead 

        12        bodies, according to his evidence, so far.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Witness, can you go to the overhead projector, please?

        15   A.   This is the inner court of the residence of the nuns.  

        16        To the top, there is a horizontal building and on this 

        17        side, there is another vertical building.  And on this 

        18        side, there is another horizontal construction adjacent 

        19        to the other.

        20   Q.   Now, Witness, the testimony -- 

        21   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: A moment, Counsel, please. 

        22   THE WITNESS:  On this side there was a stone fence around the 

        23        compound.  There was a stone fence, a wall around this 

        24        side.  

        25   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Witness is showing the wall.  It is 

        26        visible on the picture.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Witness, is this the area that you testified previously 

        30        where you saw bodies?  Was it within this area?

         1   A.   Yes, there were bodies on the grassy area, but the other 

         2        building which was on this side facing the other 

         3        building, also had dead bodies on its verandah.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay, you can take your seat.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT:  No, you will describe that for the record.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I will describe that for the record.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Before the witness leaves.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: We are looking at photograph 54 with the 

         9        tree on the left side of the photograph and there is a 

        10        building with a wall and the wall is shown on the 

        11        photograph.  The wall is perpendicular to the building.  

        12        There is grass in the area in front of the wall and the 

        13        building that is perpendicular to the wall and there is 

        14        shrubbery shown on the boundaries of the wall and in the 

        15        fore-front of the photograph.  Anything else, 

        16        Your Honour?

        17   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, of course, according to his evidence, 

        18        that is where the bodies were spread.

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, that is in the transcript.  I am just 

        20        describing the structure as shown on 54.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT:  Well, according to his evidence, he was 

        22        pointing out where the bodies were.  According to 

        23        evidence, it appears the bodies were on the grassy area 

        24        there and he seems to say if you can confirm there is a 

        25        building below and also for the Prosecutor, according to 

        26        the evidence, there were also bodies on the verandah of  

        27        that building.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is also correct, Your Honours that is 

        29        not shown.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: But at least for the transcript that would be

         1        the area down at the grassy area after the bottom of the 

         2        photograph where there is shrubbery.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Which is described as a building which is 

         4        parallel to the wall and perpendicular to the other 

         5        building that is there.  

         6        

         7        And  witness also testified that there was a wall around 

         8        the whole structure, stone wall.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Prosecution, is that correct?  Is that right 

        10        to you?

        11   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  So let the record so reflect.  You can move 

        13        on.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Witness, you can take your seat.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel?

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        17   Q.   Witness, for the entire time that you were at this 


        18        location at the nuns' convent, did you see Juvenal 

        19        Kajelijeli or his vehicle there?

        20   A.   I did not see Kajelijeli nor his vehicle in that 

        21        location.

        22   Q.   Were you able to see, Witness, the attackers leave that 

        23        location?

        24   A.   Yes, I saw them leave.

        25   Q.   And, did you see Juvenal Kajelijeli among those who 

        26        left?

        27   A.   No, I didn't see him among the attackers.

        28   Q.   If Kajelijeli was here, would you have been able to  see 

        29        him?

        30   A.   Yes.  Had Kajelijeli been there, I would have seen him

         1        because I saw the attackers.

         2   Q.   Now, Witness, what if anything did you do after you 

         3        looked at the buildings and made observations you have 

         4        testified to?

         5   A.   As I have said, there were people who were crying within 

         6        the building, but there were other noises which came 

         7        from behind the building and when I went in, I realised 

         8        that there were bodies which no longer had heads and 

         9        some bodies had been -- had their intestines removed.   


        10        I couldn't bear it, so I left.

        11   Q.   How did this scene that you observed affect you?

        12   A.   Anyone who would have seen the state of this place would 

        13        have been affected, and I think that everyone was asking 

        14        himself or herself what was the value of man.  When I 

        15        saw this situation, I was traumatised and I wondered why 

        16        were these people killed in this manner?  The situation 

        17        is difficult to describe since these people were 

        18        unjustly killed.  And the situation affected me a great 

        19        deal.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would like to go into closed 


        21        session because I need to -- for the witness to give 

        22        some particulars which may reveal his identity.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, Counsel.  We will go into closed session 

        24        to enable counsel to raise questions which could have a 

        25        bearing to the witness.  We regret to members of the 

        26        public.  It is a procedure that has got to be followed 

        27        at this stage of the proceedings.

         1   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         2   Q.   Witness, why did you agree to testify in this case?

         3   A.   I agreed to testify in the present case because I was 

         4        witness to events which took place in the area.  I also 

         5        accepted to come to testify because I thought that if I 

         6        were to come and testify and say the truth about these 

         7        events, this would be useful for the court.  Personally 

         8        I do not like injustice.

         9   Q.   Witness, did you -- were you able to count or estimate 

        10        the number of bodies you saw inside the nuns' convent?

        11   A.   Let me tell you, Counsel, when we heard gunshots, what 

        12        we thought to be happening in the convent, and also 

        13        given what we had seen when we entered the courtyard, we 

        14        were surprised by what we saw and we were traumatised 

        15        and astonished.  Given my astonishment and my trauma, I 

        16        was unable to count the bodies that were in there.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: We may be at the end of our direct, Your 

        18        Honour.

        19   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        20   Q.   Witness, on the morning of 7th April 1994, did you pass 

        21        Munyamvano's compound -- did you take that path?

        22   A.   No, I didn't use that path.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would like the tender the 

        24        sketch as Defendant's Exhibit 37.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: No objection?

        26   MR. FLEMING: No objection, Your Honour.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  So let the sketch drawn by the Witness 

        28        KAA be admitted as Defence Exhibit No. 37.

        29             (Exhibit No. 37 was admitted)

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  That is our direct.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: We have five minutes to our time of break.  

         2        But that will not be just the beginning of the 

         3        cross-examination, if any.  We propose that we take the 

         4        break now and come back and continue the 

         5        cross-examination of the witness.


         6   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honour.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: So, we resume our work at ten past eleven.  

         8        (Court recessed from 1050H to 1120H)

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, proceedings are resumed.  We continue 

        10        with the testimony of this witness, cross-examination of 

        11        the witness by the Prosecution, Mr. Fleming.

        12   MR. FLEMING: I am sorry, My Lord.

        13   MR. KIYEYEU: I am sorry, My Lord.  Mr. Hinds indicated that 

        14        he would wish that the exhibit be sealed.  So I had --

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Oh, I see.  Is it signed?  I hope it is 

        16        signed.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: It is not signed, Your Honour.  I hope the 

        18        witness will sign and date it.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right.  If it is signed and dated, I 

        20        think the same can be kept under seal for the reason 

        21        that this is a protected witness.

        22   MR. KIYEYEU we have taken note, My Lord.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.

        24        

        25                   CROSS-EXAMINATION

        26   BY MR. FLEMING:

        27   Q.   Witness, you say you don't like injustice and that is 

        28        why you are here.  What injustice here are you 

        29        attempting to address by coming here?

        30   A.   When I say that I do not like injustice, I mean that the

         1        victims who were killed at the nuns' convent were 


         2        innocent persons who had not committed any crimes to 

         3        deserve death.  That is what I mean when I say that I do 

         4        not like injustice.  It is to say that those people who 

         5        were killed in the convent were victims because they had 

         6        not committed any offence.

         7   Q.   And in your own personal view of life which you 

         8        expressed just before here again is that, man does have 

         9        a value; isn't that so?

        10   A.   That's not what I meant.  What I said was this, that 

        11        when I saw these victims killed, as a person I asked 

        12        myself what is the meaning of life.  I did not mean that 

        13        human life has no value.  It is a view that came to me 

        14        when I witnessed what I witnessed.

        15   Q.   And you were very moved by what you saw, weren't you?

        16   A.   The incident I witnessed really scared me.  I was 

        17        disturbed and that is why I decided to leave the place.

        18   Q.   The incident that you witnessed that scared you was the 

        19        citing of the bodies, wasn't it?

        20   A.   It was the bodies that I saw and the state in which 

        21        these bodies were.  These were the two things that 

        22        scared me.

        23   Q.   Let us go back to your evidence as you have given us 

        24        with respect to the 7th of April 1994.  You told us 

        25        first on that day when you heard gunfire and you saw 

        26        some things burning that the war might have come there.  

        27        You told us that, didn't you?

        28   A.   When we heard the gunshots and the explosions of the 

        29        grenades we asked ourselves one question: Is this the 

        30        beginning of the war?  We were seeking to understand

         1        what was happening.

         2   Q.   So, you went, didn't you, in the direction of the 

         3        gunfire and the grenade explosion?

         4   A.   That is correct.

         5   Q.   And it was while you were in that direction that you saw 

         6        a group of people coming towards you; isn't that the 

         7        case?

         8   A.   That is correct.

         9   Q.   That group you told us yesterday, numbered in the 

        10        thousands; isn't that so?

        11   A.   The fact is that I did not take a count of these people, 

        12        it was a large crowd.  And back home in Rwanda, we 

        13        normally say that a large crowd of people is in the 

        14        thousands.  So, I didn't take a head count to be able to 

        15        say that there were five thousand or any specific 

        16        number.  This was just an estimate for the Chamber.

        17   Q.   The leaders of this group were armed with rifles and 

        18        grenades; weren't they?

        19   A.   When I saw this crowd I could not immediately identify 

        20        the leader of the group, but in the group there were 

        21        people who armed with guns, others with grenades, others 

        22        machetes, and others clubs and sticks.

        23   Q.   And this crowd, you have told us, some were singing, you 

        24        told us this morning: "Let us exterminate them," isn't 

        25        that so?

        26   A.   When I heard this song, that was not the first time I 

        27        was hearing it, because when the soldiers of the Rwandan 

        28        government were going to the war front they would sing 

        29        this song saying that let us exterminate them.  When 

        30        they were singing that they meant the RPF fighters.  The

         1        government soldiers were saying; "let us exterminate the 

         2        RPF fighters." I do not know whether when the crowd was 

         3        singing the same song whether they were just trying to 

         4        remember the words that the government soldiers were 

         5        singing.

         6   MR. FLEMING: Witness, I do not need an explanation.  I just 

         7        want you to answer the question.  The simple question 

         8        was: Some of these people were singing, "let us 

         9        exterminate them," that is the simple question.  Now, 

        10        what is your simple answer?

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  The witness 

        12        answered the question to the best of his ability.  

        13        Mr. Fleming may not like the answer, but that is the 

        14        witness's answer.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: The question hasn't been answered, Counsel.

        16   MR. FLEMING: And for the record, I rather like his other 

        17        answer as well.

        18   BY MR. FLEMING:

        19   Q.   Witness, you haven't answered my question.  Some of the 

        20        crowd was singing, "let us exterminate them," weren't 

        21        they?

        22   A.   It is obvious that I cannot just answer a question 

        23        without giving explanations.  I did say that I came here 

        24        to testify on events that I witnessed.  What I am saying 

        25        is linked up to the events that I witnessed during the 

        26        war.  Now, regarding your question, it is true that 

        27        members of this crowd were chanting that, "let's 

        28        exterminate them."  Let me add that this song existed 

        29        well before.

        30   Q.   When I need something like that I will ask you.  You

         1        just answer the question, please.

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Objection, Your Honour.  And, Mr. Fleming 

         3        does not have to yell either at myself or the Court or 

         4        the witness.  The witness has answered the question and 

         5        the witness has presented information that the witness 

         6        felt needed to be presented.

         7   MR. FLEMING: My learned friend doesn't understand that is how 

         8        cross-examination works, My Lord.  It would be much 

         9        better -- I have got the floor, thank you.  It would be 

        10        much better if the witness answered the questions -- 

        11        simply answered the questions, we would move much 

        12        faster.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I cross-examined Prosecution's 

        14        witnesses and this Court certainly knows witnesses 

        15        answered questions as they wanted to.  I was frustrated, 

        16        I raised a number of issues and the Court ruled, "the 

        17        witness answered the questions."  Now, I expect that the 

        18        Defence witnesses when they come from the same area, 

        19        they are answering questions to the best of their 

        20        ability, the Court would rule as they ruled with respect 

        21        to when I was cross-examining.  And the record is very 

        22        clear.  I spent hours and hours trying to get a simple 

        23        answer.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT:  Learned Counsel for the Defence, we have said 

        25        time and time again that when you have submissions on a 

        26        legal point please make it.  But it is really 

        27        unfortunate for somebody as an officer of the Court to 

        28        be making that kind of insinuation, as it were.  If you 

        29        have a legal issue to raise, please raise it.

        30

         1        All right.  Tell the witness that -- let him listen 

         2        carefully to Counsel's questions and answer them 

         3        accordingly and we will move fast.  If there are 

         4        explanations to be given they will be given in the 

         5        course of the evidence and arising from the questions 

         6        put to the witness.

         7   THE WITNESS: May I say something?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT:  Let's go on.

         9   BY MR. FLEMING:

        10   Q.   Witness, others in the crowd were either singing or 

        11        saying, "these people sent us away from our properties.  

        12        We can no longer stand this."  That was your evidence; 

        13        wasn't it?

        14   A.   I said that some members of the crowd were saying that 

        15        these people have moved us from our properties.  I did 

        16        not say that members of the crowd were saying that they 

        17        had taken their property.

        18   Q.   So, witness you decided that you would follow these 

        19        people; didn't you?

        20   A.   That is true.

        21   Q.   It was apparent to anybody that these people were not 

        22        intent on doing good.  Isn't that the case?

        23   A.   That is correct.

        24   Q.   Nevertheless, knowing that they were not intent on doing 

        25        good you decided to follow them; isn't that so?

        26   A.   This crowd was not made up only of attackers, but there 

        27        were other members of the crowd who were there out of 

        28        curiosity.  So I followed them out of curiosity.

        29   Q.   You have described them as attackers, you knew they were 

        30        attackers, but nevertheless you followed them as a

         1        matter of curiosity.  That is your evidence; isn't it?

         2   A.   When I followed the crowd I did not support the 

         3        objectives of the crowd.  I followed this crowd in the  

         4        group that came after them, and I followed them just 

         5        because I wanted to know what they were going to do.

         6   Q.   They came to Busogo Parish, and they started throwing, 

         7        according to your evidence, rocks and sticks through the 

         8        windows and on to the roof; that is your evidence, isn't 

         9        it?

        10   A.   That is true.

        11   Q.   They started shooting rifles and throwing grenades, 

        12        didn't they?

        13   A.   That is correct.

        14   Q.   There were screams and pleas persistent coming from 

        15        inside the building; weren't there?

        16   A.   It was at the time that when those who were shooting in 

        17        the direction of the building stopped that we could hear 

        18        the cries from within the building.

        19   Q.   You knew what was happening by then; didn't you?

        20   A.   When there are gunshots or explosions of grenades, when 

        21        you are a hundred meters or two hundred meters from 

        22        where the gunshots were coming or the grenades were 

        23        exploding, you will still hear, that is obvious.

        24   Q.   You knew what the attackers were doing; didn't you?

        25   A.   The attackers were shooting and others were throwing 

        26        rocks, that was obvious, every one could see them.

        27   Q.   You knew that they were attempting to kill people; 

        28        didn't you?

        29   A.   That is correct.

        30   Q.   So, your curiosity had been set aside when you knew that

         1        they were attempting to kill people, wasn't it?

         2   A.   No, I didn't know all the people who were inside the 

         3        buildings.  I knew there were nuns, and since I, myself 


         4        intended to become a clergyman, I did not have all the 

         5        information on the people inside the building.

         6   Q.   So, you stayed and watched for an hour and twenty 

         7        minutes; that is your evidence, isn't it?

         8   A.   Just as other curious persons I remained there for that 

         9        period of time that I estimated for you.  I am not 

        10        saying that I stayed there for exactly one hour twenty 

        11        minutes; it was an estimate.

        12   Q.   It turned out to be about the period of time as a 

        13        foot-ball match; that is about the length of time, isn't 

        14        it?

        15   A.   An estimate will always remain an estimate, but I think 

        16        that the duration of a football match is longer than the 

        17        period of time that I stayed there.

        18   Q.   You knew that the people as they walked to Busogo Parish 

        19        had a murderous intent, you followed them and you stayed 

        20        there while they executed that murderous intent.  That 

        21        is the truth; isn't it?

        22   A.   That is correct.

        23   Q.   And afterwards you waited long enough to go in and see 

        24        who they had murdered exactly; that is what you did; 

        25        isn't it?

        26   A.   That is correct.

        27   Q.   It wasn't the gunfire, according to your evidence, or 

        28        the one hour and twenty minutes or so of murdering that 

        29        frightened you, it was seeing the bodies at the end of 

        30        the time that frightened you, according to your

          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1        evidence; isn't it?

         2   A.   What you are saying is not true.  I don't know if you 

         3        have ever witnessed a shoot-out.  When guns are being 

         4        fired it's not a game, it is not like a football match, 

         5        everybody is scared.  I was therefore scared when I 

         6        heard the gunshots and the explosion of grenades, and 

         7        the dead bodies I saw.

         8   Q.   You have just asked me whether I have ever witnessed a 

         9        shoot-out.  Was anybody shooting back at these 

        10        attackers?

        11   A.   The persons who were inside the building were not 

        12        shooting back.  You realise that I was outside, and 

        13        therefore I was witness of the shots that were fired by 

        14        the people who were outside.  If those outside and those 

        15        within were both shooting, I would have heard only 

        16        gunshots.  But for me, those within the building did not 

        17        shoot back.

        18   Q.   So, let me understand your evidence, finally, for one 

        19        hour and twenty minutes or thereabout, you stood and 

        20        watched the massacre where the people being massacred 

        21        put up no resistance; that is your evidence, isn't it? 

        22   A.   Let me explain to you how things happened.  Those who 

        23        were shooting were not shooting from the first minute to 

        24        the 40th or 45th minute.  They would shoot for a while 

        25        and then stop.  People were running in all directions.  

        26        And I, myself did not remain on the spot as if I was 

        27        watching a football match.

        28   Q.   Witness, let me understand this.  While these people 

        29        were being massacred without putting up any resistance, 

        30        you were present and you watched the whole process, that

         1        is your evidence; isn't it?

         2   A.   I challenge what you have just said; I did not stay 

         3        there are standing to watch what was happening.  There 

         4        were a lot people outside the building who were standing 

         5        around the building which was either a rectangle or a 

         6        squire.  So, these people were outside throwing stones 

         7        and firing shots, and people were running back, and I 

         8        myself at one point at one point in time ran back.

         9   Q.   One point in time over an hour and twenty minutes.  That 

        10        is what you are telling us now; isn't that the case?

        11   A.   I want us to understand this clearly; when I said one 

        12        hour twenty minutes it was an estimate.  I did not have 

        13        a watch on me to time the events.

        14        

        15        While I was on the spot sometimes the noise would stop.  

        16        There was a lull and sometimes they would start shooting 

        17        and I would run back just as the other persons who were 

        18        watching.

         1       1200H

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         3   BY MR. FLEMING: 

         4   Q.   Witness, the people that you saw inside that building, 

         5        were Tutsis, weren't they? 

         6   A.   Some of the people I was able to see in the building 

         7        were Tutsis. 

         8   Q.   Witness, please, have a look at Defence Exhibit 38.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Thirty --

        10   MR. FLEMING: The last exhibit. 

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: There is no 38, Your Honour.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  -- is 37, that is the last exhibit.

        13   BY MR. FLEMING:

        14   Q.   This is the sketch that you drew -- there is no need to 

        15        expose it to us all.  You can use it, it's just for your 

        16        own assistance.  You marked Busogo parish on there, 

        17        didn't you?  And you marked Mukingo commune on there, 

        18        didn't you? 

        19   A.   That is correct. 

        20   Q.   What is the distance between Busogo parish and Mukingo 

        21        commune? 

        22   A.   I don't know the estimate that you want from me.  Did 

        23        you want the distance in a straight line or going 

        24        through -- using the path that takes you there?

        25   Q.   Using the path that takes you there, the path that you 

        26        would normally take if you walked in that direction? 

        27   A.   That is a question that appears difficult, but I would 

        28        attempt to find an answer.  The distance between the two 

        29        places is between five and ten kilometres. 

        30   Q.   How long would it take you to walk there, that is,

         1        between Busogo parish and Mukingo commune? 

         2   A.   That would depend on the person who is covering the 

         3        distance because all people do not move at the same 


         4        rate. 

         5   Q.   I didn't ask anybody.  I asked how long it would take 

         6        you to walk there? 

         7   A.   I personally could take between 30 and 45 minutes to 

         8        cover that distance. 

         9   Q.   And if you had very urgent business and you decided to 

        10        run as far as you could, how long would it take you? 

        11   A.   I don't know if you are talking about covering that 

        12        distance running.  I would say probably between 15, 25, 

        13        30 minutes to cover that distance. 

        14   Q.   You knew, didn't you, that the bourgmestre was based in 

        15        Mukingo commune? 

        16   A.   At what time?

        17   Q.   On the morning whilst these killings were going on in 

        18        Busogo parish. 

        19   A.   I wouldn't know.  I was in the locality that I told you 

        20        about.  I never went to the communal office.  I 

        21        therefore wouldn't know. 

        22   Q.   If you needed to get help in an emergency, where would 

        23        be the closest place you would go to from Busogo parish? 

        24   A.   I don't know what assistance you are talking about.  Is 

        25        it medical assistance or water?  What exactly do you 

        26        want to know?

        27   Q.   Let us be blunt.  If you saw somebody killing somebody 

        28        else and you needed the intervention of authorities, 

        29        where would you go? 

        30   A.   I think there are state bodies within the cellule, the

         1        secteur, the commune, and if I needed assistance at one 

         2        given point, I will contact the authority of the 

         3        cellule.  And, in any event, these incidents that were 

         4        happening would be within certain cellules, so I would 

         5        address myself to the authorities of the cellule. 

         6   Q.   So why didn't you address yourself to the authorities of 

         7        the cellule on the morning of the 7th April 1994, when 

         8        you knew that people were being killed? 

         9   A.   I did not do it, and in any event, I would have done 

        10        that in my capacity as who?  I did not address myself to 

        11        the authorities of that cellule because I am not from 

        12        that locality.  Maybe somebody from that cellule would 

        13        have done that.  So, I don't see how I could have gone 

        14        to talk to the authorities of my cellule which was far 

        15        away from this cellule where this thing was happening.  

        16        I am saying that I could not have gone to address myself 

        17        to the authorities of the cellule in which this event 

        18        was happening, whereas I come from a cellule which is 

        19        far from this cellule.  Would that mean that those who 


        20        live in that particular cellule are not aware of what 

        21        was happening?  So, I could not imagine how I could have 

        22        gone to address myself to the authorities as if they 

        23        didn't know.

        24   Q.   Are you suggesting the authorities knew this was going 

        25        on, are you? 

        26   A.   No, that is not what I mean.  I was simply asking a 

        27        question -- I was answering to make you understand how 

        28        normally things ought to have happened, but I am not 

        29        saying that the authorities of the cellule were informed 

        30        or were not.

         1   Q.   You said before, who were you to go to them.  Let me 

         2        describe you in the way in which you have described 

         3        yourself.  You are here, you told us, because you hate 

         4        injustice, and you have decided to testify because the 

         5        victims of this massacre were the ones against whom 

         6        injustice was committed.  You have told us that, haven't 

         7        you? 

         8   A.   The fact of being against injustice does not mean that 

         9        you cannot find yourself in a situation where it is 


        10        impossible for you to assist somebody who is in danger. 

        11   Q.   Witness, you stood there while an injustice was going 

        12        on.  You watched, you moved around and you did nothing 

        13        at all, and not even going to the authorities.  That is 

        14        the truth, isn't it? 

        15   A.   What you are saying is true, that I did not do anything.  

        16        I did not inform the authorities, but I explained why I 

        17        didn't contact the authorities.  First of all, the 

        18        cellule in which the incident was happening was far from 

        19        my own cellule.  I was not in a position to know where 

        20        the authorities of the cellule lived.  There were other 

        21        people who hailed from that cellule who were there.  I, 

        22        therefore, wouldn't know if one of these people might 

        23        have informed the authorities.  So, I am saying that I 

        24        did not inform the authorities for two reasons:  

        25        One, because I didn't know where the officials of the 

        26        cellule lived.  And secondly, there were other members 

        27        of that cellule there who were aware, who knew what was 

        28        happening.  Since these events were happening within the 

        29        cellule, you can't tell me that the cellule official was 

        30        unaware, and that someone who is foreign to that cellule

         1        should have gone to inform them instead of the officials 

         2        of the cellule.  You can't tell me that, can you? 

         3   Q.   Witness, the only person that you have identified out of 

         4        these thousands of people is Rachel in your evidence.  

         5        That is the case, isn't it, the only person? 

         6   A.   That is not true, I said that I was able to identify 

         7        Rachel because he comes from my cellule; I know his 

         8        home.  But I also said that I was able to identify 

         9        others whose names I did not know.  I could therefore 

        10        identify them by sight.  If any of those people who were 

        11        there were to appear, I would be able to recognise them. 

        12   Q.   But let me understand this.  The only people out of 

        13        those thousands of people whose names you knew was 

        14        Rachel, that is what you are telling us. 

        15   A.   No, he was not the only person that I was able to 

        16        identify and whose name I knew.  But first of all, I 

        17        would like to know -- there were groups of persons, 

        18        groups of attackers and other people who were passing 

        19        and looking on out of curiosity.  How would you want me 

        20        to identify these other people by their names?

        21   Q.   Witness, when was the first time you discussed the name 

        22        Rachel with Kajelijeli's Defence counsel? 

        23   A.   I think we never discussed this name Rachel in 

        24        particular. 

        25   Q.   So, Rachel just came spontaneously out of your mouth 

        26        today as the only person whom you could name out of that 

        27        group or did name out of that group?  Is that what you 

        28        are telling this Court? 

        29   A.   You cannot say that this is the first time that I am 

        30        mentioning the name, Rachel, or that it is the first

         1        time that this name has come to my mind.  Even before  

         2        the events of 1994, I knew that name already and after 

         3        the events of 1994, given what he had done and this name 

         4        remained engraved in my mind.  However, I have never 

         5        mentioned this name Rachel with the Defence for 

         6        Kajelijeli. 

         7   Q.   Witness, who were the Interahamwe? 

         8   A.   As far as I know, the Interahamwe were members of the 

         9        MRND party. 

        10   Q.   It was the youth wing of the MRND party, wasn't it? 

        11   A.   I wouldn't be able to answer you in the affirmative or 

        12        negative because I do not know what the MRND's 

        13        constitution was.  All I can say is, I am answering 

        14        given what I heard said.  So, I cannot tell you with any 

        15        certainty that the Interahamwe were members of the youth 

        16        wing of the MRND, or they were simply members of the 

        17        MRND.  What was said simply was that the Interahamwe 

        18        were members of the youth of the MRND, at least most of 

        19        them, but I don't know whether that is true. 

        20   Q.   There were Interahamwe in the region in which you lived, 

        21        weren't there? 

        22   A.   I am unable to confirm whether they were Interahamwe or 

        23        not because I didn't see them. 

        24   Q.   Witness, the Interahamwe wore uniform, didn't they? 

        25   A.   I know that within the MRND just like as within other 

        26        parties by the way, there were party colours and people 

        27        had the habit of wearing clothes in the colour of their 

        28        party.  I heard it said, and this is something that I 

        29        have heard, I wasn't a witness to that, but the 

        30        Interahamwe often wore the cloth known as kitenge but I

         1        was not sure of that because this is something that was 

         2        reported to me, I never saw anyone wear that kitenge or 

         3        piece of cloth which was allegedly worn by the 

         4        Interahamwe. 

         5   Q.   Witness, the Interahamwe were trained as militia, 

         6        weren't they? 

         7   A.   Unless that is the piece of information that you are 

         8        giving me, I would say otherwise I don't know. 

         9   Q.   Are you Hutu? 

        10   A.   Yes, I am Hutu. 

        11   Q.   You are related to Mr. Kajelijeli? 

        12   A.   Apart from the fact that he lives in Mukingo, I have no 

        13        other relationship with him. 

        14   Q.   Do you think he is innocent of the crimes which he is 

        15        charged? 

        16   A.   I am unaware of the charges levelled against him.  As 

        17        for whether he is innocent or not, I cannot say anything 

        18        about that.  I do not know whatever crimes he is charged 

        19        with, and I wouldn't be able to pronounce any verdict 

        20        whatsoever in his regard.  I, therefore, cannot say 

        21        anything about that. 

        22   Q.   Are you still studying? 

        23   A.   I was pursuing my studies, but given the difficulties I 

        24        encountered, I am not in school or pursuing my studies 

        25        at the present moment. 

        26   Q.   Do you have the opportunity to pursue them in the near 

        27        future? 

        28   A.   That is my desire and if these difficulties could be 

        29        resolved, I would pursue my studies. 

        30   Q.   Witness, Kajelijeli, I am putting to you was present at

         1        the Busogo parish during the killing of the Tutsi on the 

         2        7th of April 1994.  You have an opportunity to respond 

         3        to that.

         4   A.   I cannot completely refute that.  All I am saying simply 

         5        is that in the interim during which I met the attackers 

         6        as I have said, until the time that I left the Busogo 

         7        parish, I can confirm with certainty that he was not 

         8        present on the site for the simple reason that I didn't 

         9        see him.  But I cannot say anything about the period of 

        10        time before I reached the Busogo parish or before I met 

        11        the attackers.  This is in regard to his presence at the 

        12        location.

        13   Q.   At least it is your evidence, Witness, out of curiosity 

        14        you remained at this parish during the whole duration of 

        15        the massacre of the people there.  That is your 

        16        evidence, isn't it? 

        17   A.   That is correct. 

        18   Q.   Witness, you understand English, don't you? 

        19   A.   I understand English because I studied in the English 

        20        speaking system.  But I also understand French. 

        21   MR. FLEMING:  That is the cross-examination of this witness.

        24        Any re-examination, Professor Hinds?

        27                          RE-EXAMINATION 

        28   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        29   Q.   Witness, during the time that you were at the parish and 

        30        when you saw the individuals on the road to the parish,

         1        did you see anyone wearing kitenge colours? 

         2   A.   I was unable to see all the people who were there at 

         3        that location; there were many people.  Furthermore, I 

         4        know that there are many kinds of kitenge.  There is the 

         5        kitenge which is referred to as wax, Dutch wax, I 

         6        believe.  There are also other pieces of cloth which are 


         7        worn by the local people and which are similar to 

         8        kitenge.  So, I do not know which cloth is being 

         9        referred to here.  Let me add once again that there were 

        10        many people there, many more than you would see at a 

        11        marketplace on market day.

        12   Q.   Witness, among the people who were the attackers, the 

        13        individuals you saw throwing grenades, shooting, 

        14        throwing sticks and other objects, did you see any of 

        15        them wearing the MRND kitenge colours? 

        16   A.   I think I have described the clothing worn by many 

        17        people that I was able to see.  I didn't see any of them 

        18        wearing clothing which were in kitenge. 

        19   Q.   Witness, Rachel, do you know what if anything, he does 

        20        within the military?  Do you know based upon your 

        21        personal knowledge of him whether he belonged to a 

        22        particular branch within the military?

        23   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, that doesn't arise out of 

        24        cross-examination at all.  There wasn't even a mention 

        25        of Rachel being in the military in cross-examination.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: What was that?

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: What was raised about Rachel was how this 

        28        witness out of all the other people who were there was 

        29        able to identify this one person called Rachel, and I am 

        30        certainly asking him what he knows about Rachel.  He has

         1        already testified concerning Rachel, that he was wearing 

         2        the beret and so on and so forth. 

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: In examination-in-chief?

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, but the question was raised questioning 

         5        the witness's credibility in terms of mentioning this 

         6        person, and I am simply asking the question with respect 

         7        to what he knows. 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: That one you can ask, arising from that as to 

         9        clarify, but not the specifics as to -- you can ask that 

        10        general question arising from both his knowledge.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, what do you know personally about Rachel? 

        13   A.   Rachel was a well-known soldier in our location, in our 

        14        area.  It was known in our area that he was a 

        15        para-commander.  It was well-known that he was a 

        16        courageous soldier especially on the front. 

        17   Q.   Witness, as you were witnessing the events that were 

        18        unfolding before you at Busogo parish, what was going 

        19        through your mind, at that time? 

        20   A.   When I was looking at these events, many things came to 

        21        my mind and this is because I know about something of 

        22        the life of an orphan, because I had lost my parents 

        23        when I was young.  So, I know the fate of an orphan.  

        24        So, when you say that when I was looking at these events 

        25        which were happening at the Busogo parish, there are 

        26        quite a few things, quite a number of things which came 

        27        to mind. 

        28   Q.   Witness, how have the events that occurred on the 

        29        morning of April 7th at Busogo that you witnessed 

        30        affected you in your life?

          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1   A.   These events that I witnessed at that time affected me 

         2        in several ways.  First of all, I almost lost my life at 

         3        that time right on the spot, especially at the time when 

         4        a small child was being beaten down with a stone.  At 

         5        that time, I cried out and someone who was carrying a 

         6        gun almost shot at me in the group within which I was.  

         7        This is to inform you how I almost lost my life.  

         8        Furthermore, this event affected me a great deal to the 

         9        extent that I will never ever forget what I saw that 

        10        morning. 

        11   Q.   Witness, how can you confirm with any certainty that 

        12        Juvénal Kajelijeli was not there either when you first 

        13        saw the group of attackers come or the attackers who 

        14        came during the attack and after they departed? 

        15   A.   At the time of the events, Juvénal Kajelijeli was not 

        16        someone who could walk the same pace as the attackers 

        17        and those people there, given the fact that he was of a 


        18        certain age at the time and then his physically 

        19        attributes did not enable him to move as fast as those 

        20        other people.  So for him to be present, he either had 

        21        to be in a vehicle, aboard a vehicle or be escorted by 

        22        people who would be ensuring his security.  I can say 

        23        with certainty that in 1994, Kajelijeli would not be 

        24        able to move alone without an escort ensuring his 

        25        security and safety.  During the attack when these 

        26        attackers were shooting, I didn't see him.  He wasn't 

        27        present.  I didn't see him, and until the time I left 

        28        the location, Kajelijeli was not present because I did 

        29        not see him.  To the contrary, I cannot say anything 

        30        about his presence or otherwise after the time I had 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        left that location. 

         2   Q.   Did you see any vehicle belonging to Kajelijeli during 

         3        that time? 

         4   A.   I did not see him at all.  

         5        

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, that maybe our final question 

         7        but I just need to check with Mr. Kajelijeli.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Witness, in 1994, were you -- had you seen Juvénal 

        11        Kajelijeli in 1994 prior to April of 1994?  

        12   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, this doesn't arise out of 

        13        cross-examination, with the greatest respect. 

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: It doesn't arise. 

        15   MR. FLEMING: I should have noted my learned friend's new 

        16        evidence that he adduced from the witness.  Now, he is 

        17        trying to carry on from there. 

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness has testified 

        19        concerning an event.  Maybe I will ask him the question 

        20        direct.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   Witness, have you seen Juvénal Kajelijeli with an escort 

        23        prior to April 7th of 1994?

        24   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, this is the fresh evidence that my 

        25        learned friend extracted just a moment ago.  Now, he is 

        26        wanting to follow-up on it.  With the greatest respect, 

        27        it doesn't arise out of cross-examination.  And if he 

        28        does want to lead it then I claim the right to 

        29        cross-examine again. 

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the witness with respect to a 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        47



          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1        question that was put -- the witness with respect to a 

         2        question that was put, and that was in -- and I raised 


         3        that in response to a proposition put by the Prosecutor.  

         4        The proposition was that Juvénal Kajelijeli was there.  

         5        I asked a question: How can you say with any certainty 

         6        that Juvénal Kajelijeli was not there.  The witness 

         7        answered and answered with respect, indicated that if 

         8        Juvénal Kajelijeli was there, he would have needed to be 

         9        escorted. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: We think it doesn't arise, Counsel.

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  No further 

        12        questions.

        13   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, Mr. President.  

        14        

        15        Mr. Witness, you said that Rachel was a para-commander, 

        16        a courageous soldier.  Don't you find it odd that he was 

        17        leading killers on that day?

        18   THE WITNESS: I have nothing to say about that being 


        19        surprising or not.  All I can say is that, I saw the 

        20        individual at the location and people used to say that 

        21        he was a para-commander. 

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: You said that:  "I do not have any 

        23        relationship with Kajelijeli, apart from the fact that 

        24        he lives in Mukingo commune".  But do you not know who 

        25        was the bourgmestre for Mukingo commune on that very 

        26        day, the 7th of April?

        27   THE WITNESS:  As for the relationship, that is true, I had no 

        28        relationship with Kajelijeli, but I never knew -- I 

        29        never said that I didn't know who was the bourgmestre at 

        30        that time for Mukingo commune.  As to that question, it 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        48



          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1        was Emmanuel Harerimana who was the bourgmestre of 

         2        Mukingo commune and he had replaced Kajelijeli in that 

         3        position.

         4   JUDGE RAMAROSON: For how long did you follow the group of 

         5        attackers until you reached Busogo parish?

         6   THE WITNESS: These attackers were in front.  They were 

         7        further ahead in the crowd that were going towards 

         8        Busogo parish, and I wasn't walking at the same pace as 

         9        the attackers.  There was the first group of the crowd 

        10        which was in front, then came another part of the crowd 

        11        of people, and I was in the group of the curious 

        12        onlookers accompanying the group and in the interim, I 

        13        was walking with the various people who were with me, 

        14        and I was asking them what had happened in Rwankeri.  

        15        So, it was some time before I got to the parish and the 

        16        killers had even gone ahead of me and reached there 

        17        before me. 

        18   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Did you see Rachel from far or were you near 

        19        him?

        20   THE WITNESS: At the time when the attackers were shooting, 

        21        the curious onlookers were running in all directions, 

        22        but there was a time when there was a lull, a short 

        23        interval so people who were taking the direction of ESTB 

        24        could leave towards that direction are those who went in 

        25        other direction.  There were people who went to look 

        26        through the windows of the building, people like Rachel 

        27        were on the road towards ESTB.  I don't know whether you 

        28        know the lay of the land because the road which goes 

        29        towards ESTB is not far from the convent, so you could 

        30        see them as they were busy doing their job.

         1   JUDGE RAMAROSON: You said that these people were of ill 

         2        intent; is that not so?

         3   THE WITNESS: Yes, that's right.

         4   JUDGE RAMAROSON: So why did you follow them?  Didn't you -- 

         5        were you not afraid that they might kill you?

         6   THE WITNESS: I have told you that we had left the attackers 

         7        to pass.  We had gone to the side of the road.  If the 

         8        attackers were going to kill me, they were going to -- 

         9        they would have done so because they saw me.  Further 

        10        more, behind the attackers, there were other people who 

        11        were not killed. 

        12   JUDGE RAMAROSON: So your curiosity was stronger than your 

        13        fear of death.  Why did they not kill you?

        14   THE WITNESS: I don't think that it is correct to say that my 

        15        curiosity was stronger than my fear of death.  The fact 

        16        that I was afraid and when I was going down further on, 

        17        I wasn't thinking that I was going to meet the 

        18        attackers, and when I met them, they were attackers who 

        19        were carrying clubs and other weapons, all kinds of 

        20        other weapons.  I let them pass and I went to the side 

        21        of the road and let them pass.  So I was afraid of these 

        22        attackers.

        23   JUDGE RAMAROSON: But you remained with them for an hour and 

        24        twenty minutes without them touching a hair on your 

        25        head?

        26   THE WITNESS: It is true that no one touched me when I was in 

        27        that location.  Physically, nobody touched me.  They 

        28        didn't slap me or anything like that.  However, at a 

        29        certain point in time following the compassion that I 

        30        had for the child who was beaten down with a huge stone,

          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1        I almost lost my life. 

         2   JUDGE RAMAROSON: What was the ethnic group of the attackers?

         3   THE WITNESS: The attackers were Hutus.  At least the ones 

         4        that I saw were Hutus.

         5   JUDGE RAMAROSON: You said that the people who were killed, 

         6        some of them were Tutsis.  What was the ethnic group of 

         7        the others who were killed?

         8   THE WITNESS: I said that the people that I was able to see 

         9        when I entered the building were Tutsis.  But I was 

        10        unable to see the other people who were in the other 

        11        room.  So I cannot say anything about them. 

        12   JUDGE RAMAROSON: In the final analysis, what explanation can 

        13        you give about these killings?  Was it the Hutus who 

        14        were killing the Tutsis, that is?

        15   THE WITNESS: That is practically the reality.  I would say 

        16        that it was the Hutus who killed the Tutsis on the basis 

        17        of the fact that the attackers that I was able to see 

        18        were Hutus and the victims, the persons killed who 

        19        were -- I was able to see were Tutsis.  So, it is on 

        20        that basis that I am saying that the Hutus were killing 

        21        Tutsis. 

        22   JUDGE RAMAROSON: Thank you, Mr. President, that is all. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Judge Maqutu has a question to ask.  

        24   JUDGE MAQUTU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

        25        

        26        There is only one question that keeps on cropping in my 

        27        mind, and it is this:  You said as a future or an 

        28        aspiring priest, you were concerned about the nuns in 

        29        the convent.  Now, what I would like to know is what 

        30        would you have done for those nuns in the circumstances

          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002



         1        and in the prevailing violent atmosphere? 

         2   THE WITNESS: Even though****************************, I 

         3        could not under the circumstances go and look for other 

         4        people to come and help me to defend these nuns or to go 

         5        and fetch weapons so that I could fight the attackers, 

         6        that was not possible; neither could I ask these people 

         7        who were shooting and throwing stones at these buildings 

         8        to stop that activity.  I could not.  Can you realise 

         9        that this little thing that I did when I had pity on 

        10        that child almost cost me my life?  All I could do was 

        11        to pray to the Almighty so that he could receive their 

        12        souls purely and simply, that is all I could do. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: I have only one question also.  Since you were 

        14        familiar with that area according to your evidence, that 

        15        is, the place where you went to church; is that correct? 

        16        That is the Busogo parish, you are familiar with that 

        17        area, according to your evidence because that is the 

        18        place where you went to church, isn't it?

        19   THE WITNESS: Yes, I know that location very well.  I would go 

        20        to mass in the Busogo parish, so I know very well where 

        21        the convent is, the church, then the parish and as well 

        22        as the dispensary. 

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: You saw what was happening at the convent, the 

        24        shooting and whatever?  Did you try to find out within 

        25        the area to see whether the priests, if any were there, 

        26        and whether they were informed or whether they were 

        27        doing anything about this event? 

        28   THE WITNESS: The question that I was asking myself at the 

        29        time of the event was that I was constantly wondering 

        30        whether within that building, were the nuns or the 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        52



          KAJELIJELI                                       4 DECEMBER 2002




         1        priests of that area.  I was always wondering about that 

         2        and that is why I remained on the spot waiting for the 

         3        priests or the nuns were within the building.  

         4        

         5        When the attackers did withdraw, I went into the 

         6        building and, unfortunately, when I saw the scene within 

         7        the building, my reaction was to leave immediately.  So 

         8        I went home right away.  I was shocked by what I had 

         9        seen in that place. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Interpreter, could you tell the Witness KAA 

        11        this marks the end of his testimony.  We thank him.  We 

        12        shall have time at a later stage to review and consider 

        13        his evidence together with all the evidence that is 

        14        going to be adduced in the course of this trial, but 

        15        once again, we thank him. 

        16   THE WITNESS: I also wish to thank you. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: You may leave after the curtains have been 

        18        withdrawn. 

        19        

        20        Yes, Professor Hinds, your next witness for this 

        21        afternoon?  We would be taking the usual lunch break. 

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: The next witness the Defence intends to call 

        23        is ZLG.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: ZLG, thank you. 

        25   THE WITNESS: Mr. President, I would request if it is possible 

        26        for me to be able to greet Mr. Juvénal Kajelijeli.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: The registry can see to that if it is 

        28        possible, they can arrange that.

        29   MR. KIYEYEU: We have taken note, My Lord.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  We will resume our work at ten to

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: The proceedings are resumed.  You said your 

         5        next witness was?

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: ZLG. 

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you bring in the witness.

         8   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lord.  

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Can he make the solemn declaration or can he 

        10        swear?

        11        (Declaration made by Witness ZLG in Kinyarwanda)

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Witness ZLG, you have just made a solemn 

        13        declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to how 

        14        your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a few 

        15        essential elements.  You will be led in your 

        16        evidence-in-chief by the Defence who are sitting on this 


        17        side of the courtroom, and Counsel is already standing.  

        18        And thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        19        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        20        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        21        of you, may also put questions to you to clarify your 

        22        evidence, if they will have such questions to ask you.  

        23        If a question put to you is not clear, or you do not 

        24        understand it, please say so and such a question shall 

        25        be repeated or explained.  These are the few essential 

        26        things we want to bring to your attention before you 

        27        begin your testimony.  

        28        

        29        Yes, Professor Hinds, learned counsel?  

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         3                       testified as follows:

         5                         EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 

         6   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         7   Q.   Witness ZLG, how do you feel this afternoon?

         8   A.   I am all right, I have no problem. 

         9   Q.   Witness, we will show you a document, it is in English 

        10        the translator will help you to translate the 

        11        information on it.  It contains your particulars.  We 

        12        would like you to review this document and if it is 

        13        accurate, you should sign and date it and return it to 

        14        me.  Do you understand that? 

        15   A.   I understand.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would mark this as 

        17        Defendant's Exhibit 38 and ask that it be sealed because 

        18        it contains particulars of this witness who is a 

        19        protected witness.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection?

        21   MR. FLEMING:  No objection.  May we see it when it is so 

        22        marked?

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: Sorry.

        24   MR. FLEMING: May we see it again when it is so marked, 

        25        Your Honours?

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  So let the document containing the 

        27        personal particulars of Witness ZLG be admitted as 

        28        Defence Exhibit No. D38, and the said document shall be 

        29        kept under seal as it contains the personal particulars

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I would like to begin my 

         4        preliminary questions in closed session so as to protect 

         5        the identity of this witness.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  You would like to begin in closed 

         7        session?

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  We will go into closed session to enable 

        10        counsel to raise questions with the witness, some of 

        11        which could have a bearing on his identity.  And inform 

        12        Witness ZLG that we are going into closed session and 

        13        that he should be free to mention names of people and 

        14        places even those which have a bearing on his identity

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: And, Interpreter, could you tell the 

         2        Witness ZLG that we are now back into open session.  He 

         3        should be careful not to mention names of people and 

         4        places which could have a bearing to his identity.

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Are we in open session yet, Your Honour?

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Registry.

         7   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lord.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Right.

         9   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        10   Q.   Witness, we are now in open session, and I would like 

        11        you to listen to my questions very carefully before you 

        12        answer it.  When you do answer, do not say anything that 

        13        could reveal your identity either giving names of people 

        14        and places that may reveal your identity.  Do you 

        15        understand?

        16   A.   Yes, I have understood, Counsel.

        17   Q.   Now, Witness, you talked about roadblocks that were set 

        18        up by the RPF at some point in time.  Can you tell us 

        19        what time roadblocks were set up?

        20   A.   The roadblocks were set up by the RPF on the 

        21        8th February 1993.  On that date, there were attacks, 

        22        but the government forces were unable to dislodge the 

        23        RPF forces from the positions they had held.  The 

        24        government forces set up roadblocks some two or three 

        25        kilometres from Ruhengeri town, and those of the RPF had 

        26        their roadblocks opposite the government forces.  The 

        27        roadblocks of the RPF were made up of large stones which 

        28        these forces had place on the road.  I realised that 

        29        there was another roadblock set up when I was going to 

        30        visit my paternal uncle, who was a soldier.  I had gone

         1        to see him at the Susa trading centre.  At that centre, 

         2        there was a roadblock set up by the RPF, and opposite 

         3        that roadblock there was another roadblock which belong 

         4        to the government forces.  Those were the roadblocks 

         5        that I realised they were on the road linking Kinigi to 

         6        Kigombe and Mukingo and Kinigi.

         7   Q.   Now, were there any other roads that could be travelled 

         8        by a vehicle attempting to get into Kinigi through Susa 

         9        from Mukingo, then the one that you've just described?

        10   A.   The roads that I have just mentioned are the ones which 

        11        could be used by vehicles in order to go from one 

        12        commune to another.

        13   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know the Susa area called Susa?

        14   A.   Yes, I know the Susa centre.  That centre is located at 

        15        Kinigi, but it's at the border between Mukingo and 

        16        Kinigi.

        17   Q.   Now, Witness, is there a river in that location?

        18   A.   I drew a map last evening, I don't know whether I can 

        19        use it here now, otherwise I can show you where Susa is, 

        20        because Susa is a small river, which is -- which serves 

        21        as a border between Mukingo and Kinigi.  This river 

        22        flows towards Kigombe.

        23   Q.   Witness, could you take the map that you've drawn and 

        24        put it on the overhead projector?  Now, Witness, does 

        25        that map show any personal particulars that could reveal 

        26        your identity?  Does it have your name or anything on 

        27        there?

        28   A.   No, my name is not on the map, but I would like to show 

        29        you where the roadblocks were erected, and I did this as 

        30        an approximation, but my name does not appear on this

         2   Q.   Okay, Witness, just go to the overhead projector, 

         3        someone from the registry would direct you.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, has this map been seen by --

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: I will show it to Mr. Fleming.  I haven't 

         6        seen it yet, Your Honour.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: And clearly establish the authorship.  Yes, 

         8        Counsel.

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I would like the witness to go to the 

        10        overhead projector.  I thought that the registry would 

        11        help him so he could explain.

        12   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        13   Q.   Witness, could you just describe the roads and the 

        14        roadblocks that you've just testified about?

        15   A.   Here we are at Kigombe and two or three kilometres 

        16        later, you would come to the roadblocks set up by the 

        17        RPF forces -- I'm sorry, government forces.  The next 

        18        roadblock which was opposite was manned by RPF soldiers.  

        19        As from the Mukingo region, the roadblock held by the 

        20        government forces was there where I am pointing my pen.  

        21        There is a road which --

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  Wait a minute, Interpreter.  Could you, 

        23        please, tell Witness ZLG not to remove his pencil or pen 

        24        until the translation has been completed in both 

        25        languages so that we can follow closely his explanation, 

        26        to keep the pen there.  Yes.

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Now, Witness, could you identify where Susa -- first of 

        29        all, the Susa river, where is that located and where is 

        30        the place called Susa where people lived on that map?

         1   A.   Susa river runs along the border between Kinigi -- this 

         2        river goes along the boundary between Mukingo and 

         3        Kinigi, and goes like this.

         4   Q.   Now, Witness, could you indicate where Susa was located?

         5   A.   From the river to the Susa centre, there is hardly 

         6        500 metres.

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, are there houses on both sides of the 

         8        river?  Do people live on both sides of the river in 

         9        this place call Susa; that is, the river that separates 

        10        Mukingo from Kinigi?

        11   A.   At this centre, there were buildings and beyond the 

        12        centre, there was the population and there was also 

        13        residential houses belonging to the population, and 

        14        that's on the Kinigi side.  Susa also towards the 

        15        Mukingo side, there were some inhabitants who live in 

        16        this place here.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Now, could we get a chair for the witness 

        18        because he maybe there for a little while?  And maybe 

        19        for the Interpreter.

        20   THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER: Thank you, Counsel.  I can hold 

        21        my own.

        22   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        23   Q.   Witness, you testified that at some point in time the 

        24        whole of the Kinigi area were controlled by the RPF, 

        25        could you show the Kinigi area just going around the 

        26        boundary so that the Trial Chamber would be able to see 

        27        this?

        28   A.   Part of Mukingo commune had been taken, then you can see 

        29        the border between Mukingo and Kinigi.  All this border 

        30        area was occupied by the RPF and the RPF also occupied

         1        part of Kigombe up until the boundary between Kinigi and 

         2        Kigombe in that direction, as indicated by the pen.

         3   Q.   Now, Witness, you've indicated that occurred in -- after 

         4        February of 1983; is that correct -- I'm sorry, 

         5        February 8th of 1993; is that correct?

         6   A.   Yes, that's right.

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, how could -- at that time, how could 

         8        people from Mukingo or Kigombe get into Kinigi, and how 

         9        could people from Kinigi get into Mukingo or Kigombe 

        10        given the situation, as you described it?  How was the 

        11        movement of people from the various location 

        12        accomplished?

        13   A.   None of the inhabitants could reach Kinigi and those who 

        14        tried to go there couldn't go beyond this place I'm 

        15        pointing at, because our servant left Kigombe one day to 

        16        go to Kinigi and up till now -- up to today we don't 

        17        know what his fate was.

        18   Q.   What about on the Susa side?

        19   A.   From the Susa side, it was impossible.  Those who dare 

        20        go there were bound to have problems.  That was possible 

        21        after the Arusha Accords.  People thought that peace was 

        22        going to be restored and some inhabitants were able to 

        23        go to see their farms and others were able to go and 

        24        cultivate.  But peace was not re-establish, although 

        25        UNAMIR were patrolling the area. 

        26   Q.   Witness, are you completed?

        27   A.   I would like to give you an example.  Let me give you an 

        28        example, and this piece of information was even 

        29        announced on the radio.  UNAMIR monitored the area and 

        30        carried out patrols.  This included the area known as 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II

         1        Base and Nyarutovu.  At that time one Kanyamibwa was 

         2        killed there.  The government -- Kanyamibwa and his 

         3        whole family, the government asked UNAMIR to carry out 

         4        investigations, but nothing was done.  Base is spelt, 

         5        B-A-S-E, Nyarutovu is spelt, N-Y-A-R-U-T-O-V-U.  

         6        Kanyamibwa is spelt, K-A-N-Y-A-M-I-B-W-A.  Another 

         7        example I can give you is that even after the Arusha 

         8        Accords, my little brother and I, we wanted to enter the 

         9        zone while aboard a vehicle and we were showered with 

        10        bullets, and it wasn't possible for us to reach that 

        11        area.

        12   Q.   Now, when was the Arusha Accords establish that set up 

        13        what you call the demilitarised zone?

        14   A.   I don't remember the date very well, but it was towards 

        15        the beginning of November and December 1993.

        16   Q.   Witness, can you identify by name the secteurs of -- the 

        17        commune of Kinigi that was covered, as you know, by the 

        18        demilitarised zone?

        19   A.   The whole of Kinigi commune was under UNAMIR control, 

        20        but I have another map, sketch, where I was sitting. 

        21        Which can better give you an -- which can give you a 

        22        better understanding of this area.

        23   Q.   Well, let's stay with this map for a minute, Witness.  

        24        You've indicated that at some point in time, there was a 

        25        buffer zone that was established.  How did that affect 

        26        the roadblocks, if any?

        27   A.   I don't quite understand the question, Counsel.  Could 

        28        you, please, repeat it for me?

        29   Q.   Witness, you testified that at some point in time around 

        30        November or there about of 1993, pursuant to the Arusha

         1        Accords, a demilitarised zone was set up which included 

         2        all of Kinigi.  The question is, how did the 

         3        establishment of the demilitarised zone affect, if any, 

         4        the roadblocks that are now shown on this sketch?

         5   A.   After the zone was held by the UNAMIR forces, the 

         6        roadblocks previously held by RPF were dismantled, but 

         7        those belonging to the government forces were still 

         8        there, but the control measures were as stringent as 

         9        previously.

        10   Q.   Now, Witness, could a vehicle travel from the Mukingo 

        11        area into the Susa area after that time; that is, 

        12        November of 1993, when it was a demilitarised zone?

        13   A.   A vehicle could move about in Kigombe without any 

        14        problem, but going beyond Kigombe and entering the 

        15        UNAMIR zone, one had to be escorted by the UNAMIR forces 

        16        themselves.  In Kigombe the same applies, but to go from 

        17        Kigombe to Kinigi, one needed UNAMIR escort.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Was that your question?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: No.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: No.

        21   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        22   Q.   What about on the Mukingo side; that is, the roadblocks 

        23        on the Mukingo side, what affect did the demilitarised 

        24        zone have on the ability of vehicles travelling from 

        25        Mukingo getting into Kinigi commune and the Susa area 

        26        after the demilitarised zone was set up?

        27   A.   I have just told you that vehicles could move freely in 

        28        Mukingo commune, but those which wanted to cross towards 

        29        Susa into Kinigi, that would be impossible without 

        30        UNAMIR escort.  However, I gave you an example that one

         1        day myself and my younger brother, we wanted to go into 

         2        this area here in a vehicle, we were shot at.  So, you 

         3        can, therefore, understand that the roadblock which was 

         4        held by the RPF was dismantled, but the RPF soldiers 

         5        could not enter the area.  UNAMIR was present, but the 

         6        RPF soldiers could escape and use other routes or 

         7        infiltrate other areas.  I went into Mukingo commune 

         8        area in December and at the end of March also, but I 

         9        wasn't able to see any vehicle going beyond this area.  

        10        I had gone to see my uncle who was at a location held by 

        11        the Rwandan forces, but the vehicle --

        12   Q.   Yes, Witness, that was December --

        13   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: I'm sorry, Counsel, could you just 

        14        let me finish?  "The only vehicles which could pass were 

        15        those which had the letters "UN" on them".

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, but there is some confusion here.  Where 

        17        was his uncle?  Because he is talking about this stretch 

        18        as well as this other stretch in a sort of not very 

        19        clear way.  For example, where was his uncle, Counsel? 

        20        Can you follow it up?  Maybe we'll be taking a --

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: Let me just deal with the dates first and -- 

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe we stop here and -- how long will it 

        23        take to -- take you to --

        24   PROFESSOR HINDS: Finish up the map?  

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: This aspect, yes.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that I may need about four or five 

        27        questions on the map before we finish with this map.  

        28        Four or five questions, including what the questions you 

        29        wanted to know about. 

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: And how long would that be?

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: I don't know. 

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: All right, try so that we finish up with this 

         3        map. 

         4   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         5   Q.   Witness, you mentioned two dates when you visited your 

         6        uncle; one was in December and the other in March.  

         7        Could you give us the years, December of what year and 

         8        March of what year?

         9   A.   December was 1993 and March was 1994.

        10   Q.   And where was your uncle located, Witness?

        11   A.   He was at a place -- at a position in Mukingo commune, 

        12        and the position was not located in Kinigi.  It was 

        13        within Mukingo commune, because Kinigi was within the 


        14        buffer zone.

        15   Q.   And, Witness, how far was your uncle's location from 

        16        Susa?

        17   A.   There was a distance of some 800 metres.

        18   Q.   Now, Witness, at the time that you were visiting your 

        19        uncle both in December and in March of 1990 -- December 

        20        of 1993 and March of 1994, could any vehicles travel 

        21        from Mukingo into Kinigi or from Kinigi into Mukingo?

        22   A.   I have testified that vehicles could not go from Kinigi 

        23        to Mukingo unless they were under UNAMIR escort.  The 

        24        same apply to Mukingo commune, a vehicle could not come 

        25        from Mukingo and go into Kinigi without UNAMIR escort. 

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that is it for this map, Your 

        27        Honour.  We would like the map marked as Defendant's 

        28        Exhibit 39.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: No objection, from the Prosecution?

        30   MR. FLEMING: No objection, Your Honours.  It's dated

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, is it dated, or it should be dated?

         3   MR. FLEMING: By that, I mean, Your Honours, that the evidence 

         4        in respect of it appears to come up to March of 1994.

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  All right.  Then let this document be -- 

         6        I think he should sign it first. 

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: No problem, Your Honour.

         9        formally as Defence Exhibit number thirty --

        15        to sign it.  I don't know how he signs, it might be 

        16        signing by name.

        20        resume our work at twenty to five.  Twenty to five.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, please.

         5   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         6   Q.   Yes, Witness, you testified that at sometime you were 

         7        farming your family's property in Kinigi from your home 

         8        located in Kigombe.  Can you tell the Trial Chamber, how 

         9        you were able to accomplish this, given the security 

        10        situation?

        11   A.   This was after the UN forces came to the region that I 

        12        tried to help my family to farm the land that we had in 

        13        Kinigi.

        14   Q.   Witness, were any provisions provided for the 

        15        inhabitants from both communities to attend market or 

        16        conduct business between the two communities as a result 

        17        of the Arusha Accords?

        18   A.   After the buffer zone which was controlled by the UNAMIR 

        19        forces was established, all inhabitants who sought 

        20        refuge in various places, when they heard that security 

        21        had been restored came back to their lands.  Some would 

        22        go and farm their land, some would go and harvest 

        23        products from the farm, but some of these people could 

        24        be  killed in the process.  For example, women who could 

        25        move about with the problem, even women who could move 

        26        around without problems were not 100 percent safe 

        27        because the Inkontanyi had removed their military 

        28        uniforms and were wearing ordinary civilian clothes.

        29   Q.   Now, Witness, where were you when you first heard of the 

        30        death of the president?

         1   A.   When the president died, I was at home where my parents 

         2        lived, in Kigombe.

         3   Q.   And who was home with you?

         4   A.   During this time, I was at home with my mother, two 

         5        young brothers, my elder brother and my two sisters and 

         6        there were also the domestic servants who were with us 

         7        at home.

         8   Q.   And, Witness, how did you learn of the president's 

         9        death?

        10   A.   At the time of the death of the president which occurred 

        11        on the night of the 6th, I was at home in bed around 

        12        2300H.  My young brother is an artist and he normally 

        13        went to bed late.  He heard the news on radio.  He heard 

        14        that the presidential had been shot down.  He woke me   

        15        up to wake me.  I was surprised and I did not understand 

        16        immediately what he wanted to tell me up.  

        17        

        18        The following morning, it was announced on radio that 

        19        the plane which  was carrying the president had been 

        20        shot down and that the president was dead in the crash.  

        21        

        22        Still on radio, the people were urged to stay at home 

        23        pending further instructions.  It was also said on radio 

        24        that no one should go to work.

        25   Q.   Now, what was your reaction to this news that you heard, 

        26        first of all at 11:00 on the 6th and then confirming on 

        27        the morning of the 7th?  What was your reaction, 

        28        Witness?

        29   A.   The news made me very sad, but since I couldn't do 

        30        anything, I just did as others because I respected the

         2   Q.   Did you go outside of your residence at all that day on 

         3        the 7th?

         4   A.   I told you that I respected the directives that were 

         5        given on radio.  I, therefore, did not leave the house 

         6        and since our house was on a small hill such that if you 

         7        stood on the verandah, you could see the road down hill. 

         8        So I could see the road and I didn't go out of the 

         9        house.

         1        1700H

         2   Q.   What observation did you make with respect to traffic on 

         3        the roads?

         4   A.   The road was empty.  There was no activity on to road at 

         5        that time.

         6   Q.   Did you see any civilians travelling along the road, 

         7        that is on the morning of the 7th?

         8   A.   Let me repeat that on that day of the 7th no one was  

         9        moving, there was no movement on the road, and I also 

        10        told you that our house was on the hill such that 

        11        standing on the verandah one could see what was 

        12        happening on the road and I did not see any movement on 

        13        the road.

        14   Q.   Did you hear any noises coming from any direction on the 

        15        7th?

        16   A.   On that 7th of April I didn't hear any noise, the whole 

        17        day was calm.

        18   Q.   Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber what you did, if 

        19        anything, on the 8th of April, the next day?

        20   A.   The following day I did not do anything.  I woke around 

        21        6 a.m.  I was a bit late and I was met by gunshots and 

        22        bombs which were falling on Ruhengeri town.  Around 7:30 

        23        a.m.  I met people coming from Tero, T-E-R-O, Msanze 

        24        secteur, M-S-A-N-Z-E, Secteur Jihora, J-I-H-O-R-A, and I 

        25        was even able to speak to some of these people who were 

        26        moving, fleeing those secteurs and they told me that all  

        27        areas that the Inkontanyi had taken in 1993, that they 

        28        had taken them back, who were in those areas.  We did 

        29        not decide immediately to flee.  We remained in 

        30        Ruhengeri but the noise was deafening and around 12:00,

         1        some people started moving towards Nyakimana.  Nyakimana 

         2        is N-Y-A-K-I-M-A-N -A.

         3   Q.   Now, Witness, was the situation -- witness what was the 

         4        situation the next day on the 9th?

         5   A.   On the 9th of April, early morning, we realised that 

         6        bombs were being thrown into the town and virtually the  

         7        whole day bombs were falling where we were.  From time 

         8        to time there was some respite, but that was very brief 

         9        and virtually the whole day there were bombs falling on 

        10        the town.  It was only in the evening at night that 

        11        there was a respite.  Even then at night, there were 

        12        gunshots in the préfectural areas of Kigombe.

        13   Q.   Now, Witness, did you know at that time on the 8th and 

        14        9th where the bombs and gunfire were emanating from?

        15   A.   Since we could hear the explosion of bombs from where  

        16        they came, and we could also hear the explosion when the 

        17        bombs landed into the town, we could determine where the 

        18        bombs came from in the same manner we could determine 

        19        the direction from which the gunfire was coming from.  

        20        There was a location, Kagano and Gasiza, which is a 

        21        locality.  There were bombs which were coming from those 

        22        places and missiles were landing in the town centre.  

        23        

        24        Secondly, there were shots from Nyabitinde, shots from 

        25        Nyabitinde and missiles were directed at the centre of 

        26        the town.  I personally witnessed an incident where a 

        27        person was hit by one of the missiles and was killed.  

        28        Nyabitinde is N-Y-A-B-I-T-I-N-D-E.  Kagano is, 

        29        K-A-G-A-N-O, Gasiza, G-A-S-I-Z-A.

        30   Q.   What was the situation on the 10th, that is the 10th of

         1        April, 1994?

         2   A.   As far as the 10th of April until the 11th of April, the 

         3        situation did not change.

         4   Q.   Did the situation deteriorate or did it remain the same?

         5   A.   During that period of time there were soldiers who were 

         6        going to the war front to fight and we realised that 

         7        there had been some fighting and some belligerent  

         8        behaviour and we realised also that the positions held 

         9        by the government soldiers had been pushed back a 

        10        little, that is when we became pre-occupied and 

        11        concerned about the situation.  We decided to leave the 

        12        place and from then on we left and headed for exile.

        13   Q.   Witness, how do you know that fighting had intensified 

        14        in the area around the 10th of April, 1994?

        15   A.   At that time there was no truce, there was no lull.  I 

        16        am talking about fighting.  One could still hear the 

        17        gunshots from our home.  And I remember there was a 

        18        soldier who came right to our home and told us that the 

        19        situation was getting worse.  In fact, he was providing 

        20        us with information so that we can see how we were going 

        21        to leave the area.  

        22        

        23        As for the shootings and gunshots, we could ourselves 

        24        hear the gunfire and the firing was quite intense; we 

        25        ourselves realised that.

        26   Q.   Witness, you testified previously about seeing people 

        27        coming from particular areas.  Can you describe to the 

        28        Trial Chamber what secteurs, what areas people were 

        29        coming from and where were they going?

        30   A.   These inhabitants came from the following localities:

         6   Q.   Witness, where, if you know, were those individuals 

         7        leaving those areas were travelling to?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, what would be the relevance of this 

         9        information, vis-a-vis the case of Kajelijeli?  Where 

        10        they were coming from how do they relate?  They are 

        11        useful information, yes.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: They would be linked up graphically with a 

        13        map.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Because, we have been on that one for quite 

        15        sometime unless we know exactly the --

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: We are on the second map, Your Honour.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Because we want to know how it relates to --

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: They relate to April the 10th.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: In Mukingo? 

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Susa.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Susa.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Kinigi.

        23   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours, obviously I loathe to rise at 

        24        such a late hour of the afternoon, but where people 

        25        came, where they are going to, is hardly something that 

        26        this man can say of his own knowledge.  He can describe 

        27        the direction from which they came and the direction to 

        28        which they went.  If there is any other information than 

        29        that it necessarily be hearsay.

         1        The third objection that we have to this is, of course, 

         2        none of that has been disclosed to us at any time and 

         3        before, now, the information given in the summary of 

         4        fact, there is no resemblance to what is now being 

         5        given.

         6   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, obviously we are talking about 

         7        travel within that particular zone with respect to the 

         8        location, he clearly knows about Susa and we are talking 

         9        about the date of the 10th of April and this witness is 

        10        testifying about his own knowledge about the situation 

        11        in that particular area and the question I put to him 

        12        was:  Can you tell us what areas he talks about seeing 

        13        people coming from an area of intense fighting?  So he 

        14        says that occurred starting from the 8th going up to the 

        15        10th and subsequently thereafter, he and his family left 

        16        the area.  

        17        

        18        Now, the witness ought to be able to show on a map where 

        19        these people were coming from, what its  proximity was 

        20        to Susa and what information he has concerning what was 

        21        happening there.

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  He was at Kigombe.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: He is at Kigombe and he is telling us what 

        24        has happened to the people who were coming -- I really 

        25        don't want to testify for him and he is now talking 

        26        about these individuals who were fleeing the fighting.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: We don't see the connection.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honours, let the witness put it on the 

        29        record that we know precisely what he is testifying to.

        30   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you round it up and see exactly how it

         1        relates to Susa and --

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: I was about to have the witness -- ask him 

         3        to go to the overhead projector and show the areas so 

         4        that you could see where people were coming from and how 

         5        those areas relate to Susa.  He talked about a secteur 

         6        called Tero.  Where is Tero in relation to Susa?  Is 

         7        Susa in Tero?  Is Tero in Kinigi?

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: What has that to show?  I mean we want to 

         9        understand, Counsel.  We --

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness is testifying about the state of 

        11        the belligerence in an area which resulted in people 

        12        being driven out of that area seeking refuge.  There is 

        13        an allegation and that is the prosecutor's case and that 

        14        is at that precise time Kajelijeli is travelling into 

        15        that area on board a whole truckload of Interahamwe, 

        16        according to their evidence.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: In Kinigi?

        18   PROFESSOR HINDS: In Kinigi going towards this area where 

        19        there is intense fighting.  That is their evidence.  We 

        20        are entitled to confront that.  I don't even think that 

        21        there is a stretch there with respect to what all this 

        22        is about.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: We will allow you to do that, but if you can 

        24        do it in very brief terms so that we know --

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, this is all about our defence.

        26   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Please go on.

        27   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        28   Q.   Witness, can you go to the overhead projector?  Do you 

        29        have a sketch that you have drawn concerning your

         1   A.   Yes.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we take note of the observations raised 

         3        by the Prosecution.  We will allow the Defence to follow 

         4        up this evidence and see how it develops within a 

         5        treasonable time and other issues can be followed up 

         6        cross-examination and see how it takes off from here.

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.  

         8   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         9   Q.   Can you show Mr. Fleming that -- I have seen it myself, 

        10        but show it to him.

        11   MR. PRESIDENT: And I think -- how long will it take you, 

        12        Counsel?  We normally stop at 5:30.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I think that I would only need 

        14        about fifteen minutes with the witness.  We could do it  

        15        first thing in the morning since there is going to be 

        16        cross.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Fifteen minutes to end your 

        18        examination-in-chief?

        19   PROFESSOR HINDS: That is what -- I mean we could do it in the 

        20        morning.

        21   MR. FLEMING: It is a break, Your Honours, presuming I am 

        22        going to cross-examine this witness.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Are we working tomorrow, Your Honours?  Has 

        24        the moon has been -- the configuration has been 

        25        established?

        27        Lords?

         1   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, just inform us.


         2   MR. KIYEYEU: Okay.  Tomorrow we are going to work.  The 

         3        holiday will be on the 6th of December.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, My Lords.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: So we will stop here and Counsel for the 

         7        Defence have fifteen minutes or so to complete his 

         8        testimony, examination-in-chief with regard to this 

         9        witness and then whether there will be cross-examination 

        10        and then we take the cross-examination and we hope it 

        11        will not -- we cannot ask the Prosecution to indicate 

        12        and time frames because they even haven't started, but I 

        13        think what can be arranged that there is a possibility, 

        14        and there could be a possibility of taking up the next 

        15        witness tomorrow.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, we are ready, the next witness is 

        17        ready.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  So we stop here and tell Witness ZLA, 

        19        that we will stop here and we will resume our work 

        20        tomorrow at 9 in the morning and since he continues to 

        21        testify he should not discuss his evidence with anybody 

        22        else out of court until we meet tomorrow morning.

        23   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we do have a problem with our 

        24        next witness.  The next witness will be out of turn 

        25        because the witness we had contemplated did not arrive 

        26        and we will be calling MCLF, which is the last witness 

        27        we have.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: MCLF is -- are your colleagues informed?

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes -- this matter is on the list, but all 

        30        I am saying is that it was scheduled for next week.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: That is MCLF?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: That's correct.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: But other witnesses are scheduled, as you 

         5        can see on the order of presentation for next week.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: But he is here?

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: Oh yes, he is here.  We are ahead of 

         8        schedule. 

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  And from the time frames indicated, it 

        10        is rather a short witness from your --

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: I am keeping within my parameters, not a 

        12        minute over.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay. Then we will stop here and resume our 

        14        work tomorrow morning at 9 in the morning.
