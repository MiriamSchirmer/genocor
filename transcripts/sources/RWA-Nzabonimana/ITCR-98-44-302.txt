P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.

Madam Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?
MS. KOUO:
Yes, Mr. President, thank you.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Friday, the 10th of November 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Karemera et al., case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

The appearances are the same.

Before the evidence continues, Mr. Weyl, you were asking about admission of documents just before the close yesterday afternoon.  I think the document that you spoke about, the legislation, was, in fact, admitted.

And, the registrar, could you confirm, was that D. N --
MS. KOUO:
D. NG4 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
D. NG40.
MS. KOUO:
Forty-one.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The legislation, what is the number?
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, the last exhibit, which is D. 39 -- the last is D. 40 which is the list of the names of the persons, and D. 39 -- D. NG39 is the publication of the updated list of the first category prescribed by the article, 9, of the Organic Law.  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So, the legislation has not been admitted as yet.
MR. MJUI:
Yes, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So we admitted it as D?
MS. KOUO:
D. NG41.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now the statement.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe there is some confusion because we made a request, and I think our request was accepted by the Trial Chamber.  We requested that the confession of **********************be exhibited as D. NG41, and the law of 19th of June 2004 should, therefore, be entered as D. NG42, "A" for the French, "B" for the English.
MR. WEBSTER:
That's also my recollection.  But it was not the confession, it was the -- I thought it was the Gacaca records, which is different from the confession.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. WEYL:
To be more specific and to join what the Prosecutor said, it was the record of the confession.  Mr. President, I would also like to move -- Mr. President, it was the document, which is No. 13 on my summary table, 13, A, B, C, and it is indeed the document which Mr. Issa is having in his hands right now.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, Mr. Weyl, we will make the adjustment as you have applied for.

And, Mr. Issa, would you confirm what the record is now?
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, record dated 19 June 2004, titled "Gacaca courts national service, Record and transcript of confession, guilty plea, repentance and apologies", will be D. NG41; and document, dated June 19, 2004, "Official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda", will be D. NG42.  Thank you, Your Honour.
(Exhibit No. D. NG41 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. NG42 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.

Yes, Mr. Weyl.

Mr. Witness, good morning.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I've seen you've been trying to attract my attention since you have been in the witness box, so what do you wish to say?
THE WITNESS:
Indeed, Mr. President, there is something I would like to say.  I've understood fully the documents being discussed now.  From what I understand, there are two documents, but the only document which I recognise is my guilty plea.  Regarding the second document in question, I think it is lists prepared.  I was not informed of it.  The Gacaca court never informed me of it, so I do not recognise that document.  I think what needs to be considered is my guilty plea and another statement which is in my possession, regarding the guilty plea which I recorded when I was confessing to my crimes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you show the witness D. 42, please?  Sorry; yeah, D. 41 -- D. NG41.
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  This is the document -- I don't think you should attach any importance to this document; rather, you should consider the other documents which I have mentioned.  So regarding the document I have before me, we prepared this document under duress.  It's not on our own volition.  Let me add, if I may, this document was prepared by the secteur Gacaca court, and I will not be tried by my secteur Gacaca court; I will be tried by a higher court.
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, another document is being shown to you.
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I have that document.  I recognise the contents thereof.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we think we should admit the document which the witness identifies as his state confession and the -- Mr. Weyl, in terms of giving a number, is it a document that you wish to have given a D. NG-number?
MR. WEYL:
Quite so, Mr. President.  And it is in my disclosures in French, English and Kinyarwanda.  It is document No. 11 on my summary table.  So, my request is for the Chamber to admit it into evidence, but, Mr. President, I would like to say that Exhibit 41 and 43 have be to entered under seal.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Mr. Issa, you could admit the document as D. NG43.  It is in three languages, so it will be recorded accordingly, and they are -- 41 and 43 are under seal.
(Exhibit No. D. NG43 admitted, under seal)
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, your testimony will continue now.  You remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began, and Mr. Weyl will continue his cross-examination.
WITNESS HH,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.
A.	Good morning, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, you told us that you know Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it is.
Q.	Were you familiar with Mathieu Ngirumpatse?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you call him using his first name -- were you on a first-name basis?
A.	He is someone whom I respected, and deservedly so.  I could not speak to him calling his name.
Q.	So, whenever you wanted to refer to him, you would, "Mr. Ngirumpatse", you wouldn't use his first name "Mathieu"; is that correct?
A.	From what I can see, you are insisting in having me say I can easily talk to him.  I could not use his first name, or his surname, for that matter.  I referred to him as the secretary general.  For instance, if I wanted to say hello to him, I would say, "Good morning, Mr. Secretary General".
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  So, in this courtroom, when you talk of Mathieu Ngirumpatse or you talk of Mathieu, it does not correspond to the form of address you used with him in 1992, 1993 and 1994 in daily life; is that correct?
A.	You are right, Counsel.
Q.	Witness, during your evidence in-chief you answered a question put to you by the Prosecutor, but I did not quite understand what you were saying.  The Prosecutor had asked you whether you had been invited at Mathieu Ngirumpatse's home.  Had you been invited to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's home?
A.	No, he did not invite me to his home.  Concerning the first mission during which I accompanied him, he spoke to me when we were in the party office, that is, in his office.
Q.	Witness, you have never entered Mr. Ngirumpatse's private residence, have you?
A.	I've been there.
Q.	You've been to his private home?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Where was it located?
A.	Kicukiro, that is where he lived.
Q.	Can you be more specific than that, sir?
A.	I'm going to explain it to you, Counsel.  When you take the city centre to Kanombe road, before you reach Kanombe, when you arrive in Kicukiro, very close to Sonatube, and you go by the dirt road leading to Bugesera, before you reach the Kicukiro trading centre, you pass through the home of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, which is on the right-hand side.
Q.	So, you've been to that house?
A.	That's right.
Q.	Are you in a position to describe the house?
A.	Counsel, perhaps you may want to be more specific regarding what you want, because from what I could say it was a house just like any other house.
Q.	Did it have a garden, a garage; was it a storey-building, one- or two-storey building; did it have a porch; were there trees; was it first?  Kindly describe that house for us, sir.
A.	As I told you earlier on, I have told you the place the house was located at.  Most of the houses in that area were facing the road, but Mathieu Ngirumpatse's home was not overlooking the road.  The roof of that house was slanted on one side only and, as I said, it could not overlook the road.
Q.	Witness, you mentioned having been to his home on three occasions.  So, the three times you went to his home, was it to that house?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Witness, let us start with the first time you went there.  Could you tell us under what circumstances you went there?
A.	The first time I went there we were at party headquarters, and Mathieu Ngirumpatse told me that "I would like to meet you at (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and kept under separate cover) because I would like us to go together for the rally in Rwahi, in Shyorongi commune".  So, he asked me to go there the following morning, and I went there and we went to the rally.  We participated at the rally.  At the end of the rally we headed to his home.  And his driver took me to my home after that encounter.
Q.	Witness, what was the date?
A.	Counsel, I crave your indulgence.  I believe I told you from the beginning that it is very difficult for me to remember dates and months, but the years I can remember.
Q.	So in which year was it?
A.	That was in 1992.
Q.	So, you stopped at Mathieu Ngirumpatse's home when you were returning from a rally?
A.	That's right.
Q.	Which vehicle did you -- did you use on that occasion, sir?
A.	It was a sedan, but I'm unable to remember the make.
Q.	Can you remember who the driver of the vehicle was?
A.	I can't remember the driver's name, but what I remember is that he lived at Rugenge secteur.  He was his daily driver.
Q.	Is it your evidence that it was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's usual driver?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, if I were to put it to you that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's usual diver was Gerard Rutayigirwa, R-U-T-A-Y-I-G-I-R-W-A, would that ring a bell, sir?
A.	I don't quite remember the driver's name but, as I've told you, he was his usual driver and he lived at Rugenge secteur.  I can see Mathieu Ngirumpatse sitting very close to you and he's aware of that situation.  He knows the driver's name.  The driver was still single and -- and he had a very hairy head.
Q.	But Mr. Ngirumpatse is just telling me that his usual driver is bald.  What do you have to say to that?
A.	Counsel, from what I can see, you have asked him that question, but what I'm telling you is the truth.  He was his driver and he lived at Rugenge secteur.  He was unmarried.  He was not quite young, but he was still unmarried.  That is the driver I know of.
Q.	Would you know whether he was a Hutu or a Tutsi?
A.	It was rumoured that the driver was a Tutsi.
Q.	Witness, on that occasion did you get into Mathieu Ngirumpatse's living room?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	If you got into the living room, can you describe it for us, sir?
A.	So when you go through the door, you get into the living room.
Q.	Witness, do you mean that it was a living room, just like any other living room?
A.	Sure.
Q.	Did you stay in that living room for very long?
A.	No, I did not stay there for very long.  I was welcomed; I was given something, and then I went home.
Q.	You went home, did you?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And were you accompanied back to your home?
A.	At an earlier stage I told you that it was his driver who took me home.
Q.	Was that at the end of the day, then?
A.	It was, indeed.
Q.	I thank you.  Now I'd like to talk about the second occasion.  What was the second occasion on which you went to Mr. Ngirumpatse's residence?
A.	As regards the second occasion, there was a meeting of**************************************************, and I spoke to them about the rally that had been held at Shyrongi and that we had taken part in.  So, I was talking to ***************during that meeting and I said to them that at one point in time one of the members of the opposition party wanted to hit us.
Q.	Now, the purpose of my question was to ask you in what circumstances you went to his residence and on what date.  Now, please, content yourself with merely answering my question.
A.	I went there when I was driving a driver to his home and that driver was the one who drove the motorbike as an escort for Mathieu.
Q.	So if I understand you correctly, from your testimony, you drove a motorcyclist; is that correct?
A.	That is correct.
Q.	So you were the one driving the vehicle, were you?
A.	We were on a motorbike.
Q.	So it was, in fact, the motorcyclist who was the one driving?
A.	Yes, the motorcyclist was driving and I went along in order to tell him where the location was.
Q.	So you found that place in the company of the motorcyclist; and what happened then?
A.	When we arrived I told him where the location was and then we left together, and he was going to work.
Q.	I did not quite grasp what you said.  Where did you go and in the company of whom?
A.	I left with the motorcyclist.
Q.	So if I understand you correctly, you had just been on a recce in order to ascertain where Mr. Ngirumpatse's residence was to be found; is that correct?
A.	No, when we left that place we were in the company of the motorcyclist and also Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  That was at approximately two o'clock, and we were going to work.
Q.	And Mathieu Ngirumpatse was in his own vehicle, was he?
A.	Yes, he was.
Q.	And you went back with the motorcyclist on his motorbike, did you?
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	And what was the name of the motorcyclist?
A.	His name was******************************.
Q.	Could you please spell that name for us?
A.	Counsel, it is difficult for me to spell out his name.  I think that if you would like, you could hand a piece of paper to me so that I can write his name out, rather than spell it out.
Q.	Witness, I apologise.  I understand entirely.  I did not want to force you to spell that name out.
MR. WEBSTER:
In fact, Your Honours, it's No. 81 on our list and we have spelt it a few times already during his direct examination.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Yes, but, Witness, the name that you just pronounced was not pronounced in the same manner as it was pronounced during the examination-in-chief, so it might be a problem of pronunciation.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says Counsel Weyl.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, the third occasion on which you went to Mr. Ngirumpatse's residence, could you give us details as to the circumstances?
A.	Counsel, I must say that I have noted that you have stopped me from going into detail, but I believe that every time that you put a question to me I need to try and provide you with details.  Now, as regards the third occasion, I went in the company of Sebitabi.  He was the one who was in charge of the personal security of Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.
Q.	Witness, were you going there in order to introduce Sebitabi to Mr. Ngirumpatse, or were you just going there merely as part of your activities?
A.	I went there to tell him where Ngirumpatse's house was because it was the first time that he went there.
Q.	And, Witness, amongst your many duties, you were in the best position, presumably, to show to the man who was to provide him with close personal security -- to show him the residence of Mr. Ngirumpatse, were you not?
A.	Yes.  I went to Ngirumpatse's residence because Turatsinze had asked me do so.
Q.	Could you please give me a date, approximate date, to the best of your recollection?
A.	With regards to the date, I think I have said right from the outset, and I apologised, with respect to that, it was a long time ago, you know, and I did not take down details of those dates, and I had no idea that people would put questions to me on the subject one day.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apologies from the English interpreter.  The Kinyarwanda booth had their microphone on and I did not hear the question.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, could you repeat the question, please?
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you know where Sebitabi lived?
A.	Yes, I do.
Q.	Could you please tell us where? 
A.	Sebitabi lived in the Chez Rose building, who was conseiller of Kimisagara.  He lived in that building in order to provide that person with personal security.
Q.	Does that mean he was to provide security for Rose and also Mathieu Ngirumpatse?
A.	During the day he guaranteed personal security for Mathieu from the time he went to work until he came back from work, but he spent the night in the Rose building.
Q.	Rose's residence and Ngirumpatse's residence, were they located close each other?
A.	No.
Q.	What distance separated those two locations, approximately?
A.	Approximately, five to 10 kilometres in distance.
Q.	Do you think, therefore, that it was a good choice to designate Sebitabi as the person providing personal security for Ngirumpatse?
A.	I believe I explained that to you.  We talked about that during the meeting of***************.  He was the one who provided personal security for Ngirumpatse during the day when he went to work and came back from work, but in the evening he went to Kimisagara.  I never said that he spent the night at Ngirumpatse's house.
Q.	Witness, if I were to say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse's personal security was guaranteed by gendarmes and that he did not need to have Sebitabi by his side, what would your comment be on that subject?
A.	I tell you what I saw, what I was an eyewitness to.  Even if he was protected by gendarmes, I am telling you what I saw, and I believe that other people could corroborate what I have said.
Q.	Witness, so, you do not deny the fact when I say that Mathieu Ngirumpatse had gendarmes to provide for his personal security, do you?
A.	It might depend on the period that you are referring to, i.e., the month and the year, when you talk about protection being provided by gendarmes.
Q.	Witness, do you make a difference, personally, as to what happened during the months and the years that went by, because I'm talking to you of the period of 1992 to 1994, in fact, -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Said Counsel Weyl, correcting himself; he says --
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	-- 1992 to the end of 1993?
A.	No.  What you have just said is not true, Counsel, because when I accompanied the people I mentioned, whether it be Ntirugurirwa and -- or, Sebitabi, Ntirugurirwa --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the Kinyarwanda booth, correcting.
THE WITNESS:
-- I never noticed the presence of any gendarme at Mathieu's house.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you often go to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's office?
A.	On a good number of occasions I did.
Q.	And what building was that in?
A.	In the Kabuga building.
Q.	Could you tell us exactly where Mathieu Ngirumpatse's office was located in the Kabuga building?
A.	His office was located on the penultimate floor of the building.
Q.	And how many storeys did that building have?
A.	I'm not very sure as to the number of storeys it had, but whatever the case may be, when you found yourself in the office of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, the storey above his office was the third storey.
Q.	So, for you, his office was located on the third floor, was it?
A.	I just said that there was one storey above Mathieu Ngirumpatse's office that was the top storey.  I never told you that the office was located on the third floor.  If you say that it was a four-storey building, then, yes, his office was on the top floor.
Q.	Did you often go to Mathieu Ngirumpatse's office?  Or so you told me.  Could one easily gain access to that office?
A.	No.  It was not an easy feat to gain immediate access because you had to go through Turatsinze's office and he was the one who requested an appointment for you.  In the absence of Turatsinze, you would go through the office of a manager who worked in the same office and he would, then, ask for an appointment for you.
Q.	So one needed to make an appointment, did one?
A.	I don't know whether I would use the term "appointment", as such, but on most occasions we would turn up -- that is, ***************************************-- before he arrived.  And when neither the manager I mentioned nor Turatsinze were there, well, you would see him, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, when he went into his office and he would then invite you in.  There was a bench, a sort of waiting room, in front of Turatsinze's office.
Q.	If I understood your answer correctly, it was when Mathieu arrived and saw you there and then invited you; or did I do not understand you correctly?
A.	When Turatsinze or the manager were there, you would go through their office in order to greet them and tell them that you wanted to see Mathieu.  But when those two people were absent and you saw Mathieu arriving, you would then greet him and say to him that you wanted to see him.
Q.	And in such circumstances Mathieu Ngirumpatse would then greet you and invite you into his office.  Was he welcoming, was he available?
A.	Yes.
Q.	So, he did not live in secret in any way; do we agree?
A.	No, that is not his habit.  He knew practically all the Interahamwe and he knew that if we had come to see him, it was because we had a problem of some type.
Q.	So, he never gave you the feeling that he had anything to hide, now, did he?
A.	I don't understand what you mean by something that he wanted to hide from us.
Q.	Am I to repeat my question for you to understand it correctly?  So, he did not give you the impression, did he, that he was somebody who was attempting to hide something?
A.	That is what I don't understand from your question.  What I can say is that he never rejected anybody who came to see him.

0955H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  
	
	Witness, you said that you became an Interahamwe before becoming a member of the MRND party; can you confirm that fact? 
A.	Or, rather, I became an Interahamwe once I was already an MRND member. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Can you confirm what you just said to me, Witness?  
A.	Yes, I confirm what I just said. 
Q.	Witness, on the 8th of November of 2006, before this Trial Chamber, on page 16 of the French transcript, and I apologise because I do not have the English reference, your response to  --question from the Prosecutor, was as follows: "Witness, you said that you were, yourself, a member of the MRND party.  Can you confirm that?"  And you answered by saying, "I became a full member after having been recruited into the Interahamwe".  So, can you tell us which is the true or correct answer between the one you gave on the 8th of November and the one that you have just given now? 
A.	I shall repeat: I was a member of the MRND party and then I became an Interahamwe member.  So, that means that I was a fully-fledged member of the MRND party. 
Q.	So on the 8th of November you made a mistake? 
A.	I can make a mistake just as you can, but I would say that the reality is that I was a member of the MRND party, and that I subsequently became an Interahamwe. 
Q.	Witness, I'm asking you because you have taken an oath that is different from mine, and I would like to ask you to be extremely careful when providing answers in order to not to make mistakes.  

Witness, what was your motivation when you joined the MRND party? 
A.	I had been a member of the MRND party from sometime before like any other citizen.  And, then, with the advent of multiparty politics, each and every person joined the party of his choice.  I opted to remain within the MRND party.  And when the MRND party became a party that was evolving within the multiparty politics situation, I decided to remain in the MRND party. 
Q.	Could you please tell us at which date you joined the MRND party? 
A.	I do not remember the date, Counsel.  
Q.	Do you remember the year, Witness? 
A.	As regards the year, I have already explained that we were all members of the MRND party as a single party and then at one moment in time, with the advent of multiparty politics, I explained to you that I continued to be a member of the MRND party. 
Q.	And at what date would you say that multiparty politics came into existence? 
A.	I merely remember that I became a member of the Interahamwe in 1992, but I confirm that multiparty politics came into existence towards the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992. 
Q.	Witness, you just sorted out my next question, which was to ask you to, as much as possible, tell us the date when you joined the Interahamwe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has answered already.  Why do you have to ask him again? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if the witness is having his earphones on, perhaps it would be necessary for the earphones to be taken off, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It just seems that you are being very repetitious, that is all.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would like to highlight an inconsistency here.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, when a question was put to you by the Prosecutor in this courtroom, you said that you had been invited to attend a meeting by Turatsinze and*********, and you said at that time you were not yet a member of the Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I had not yet joined the Interahamwe organisation. 
Q.	It is your evidence in this courtroom that you joined the Interahamwe during that meeting or after that meeting; which is it? 
A.	It was during that meeting that I joined the Interahamwe because I had been invited to that meeting, and I was explained the ideology of the organisation. 
Q.	Witness, I would like to read to you a passage culled from your statement of the 3rd to the 11th of November 2004, and for the record, it is K0507848, in the French.  And this is what you tell the investigators.  Do you confirm that you told the investigators the truth? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	This is what you told them: "The first meeting of high-level Interahamwe which I attended took place in 1992 at a date I no longer remember.  The venue was the MRND office at the Vedaste Rubangura building.  At that time I had just *****************************************************************" -- which for the purpose of protecting your identity I'm not going to name.  But you said at that time you had just *******************************************************************.  How do you explain this inconsistency between your evidence here in this court, and this statement which you just told me is correct -- the statement you gave between the period 3rd to 11th of November 2004? 
A.	I'm telling you that I had been invited -- as you just said, I had been invited by **********and Turatsinze and, then, subsequently,***************.  That was my statement. 

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I move to enter the witness's statement of 3rd to the 11th of November 2004, but, perhaps, that will be at the end of my cross-examination.  So, I will have to re-visit the statement again - so, needless for me to have it entered paragraph after paragraph. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, who attended that meeting which took place at Vedaste Rubangura's meeting -- at Vedaste Rubangura's building? 
A.	Many Interahamwe attended that meeting at Vedaste Rubangura's.  I will mention the national leadership of the Interahamwe.  The party secretary general was also in attendance.  He is the one who introduced those national Interahamwe leaders to us.  
Q.	Can you remember the day of the week when that meeting took place?
A.	I think it was a Saturday; the meeting took place in the evening around 6:00 p.m.  That was when it started. 
Q.	Witness, the meetings you attended in the Vedaste Rubangura's building usually took place on Saturdays; is that your evidence? 
A.	No, on other occasions the meetings took place -- a meeting took place on Wednesdays at the same time.  So, the meetings would take place either on Saturdays or on Wednesdays at 6:00 p.m. 
Q.	Witness, is it your evidence that Mathieu Ngirumpatse attended that meeting? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	You see, Witness, I have a problem with your prior statements.  The statement you gave the Prosecutor in March 2006 was correct? 
A.	I have told you that all the statements I have been given since 2004 were statements I gave voluntarily. 
Q.	Witness, I'm going to read to you your statement to the Prosecutor, the report of which is dated 30th of March 2006, and this is what you said: "That meeting was attended by all the members of the national bureau of the Interahamwe who introduced themselves, as well as the president of the Interahamwe for the communes and secteurs of Kigali-ville préfecture and the surrounding communes.  However, I made a confusion when I said that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present".  Now, can you tell us which truth you prefer to stand by:  the statement of the 30th of March 2006 -- or, the evidence you just gave before this Court now? 
A.	I never said that we held only one meeting.  I clearly stated that the national leaders of the Interahamwe were present.  So, I talked about another meeting, because from what I remember during that first meeting the secteur presidents of the Interahamwe were not introduced to us. 
Q.	Witness, you are going to compel me to read the preceding paragraph, which I thought I am going to spare the Court.  I am going to read the entire paragraph: "I became an Interahamwe" ...
MR. WEBSTER:
If I could just have a point of clarification.  Could you direct us to the number of the paragraph because -- for the -- for the Rule 67. 
MR. WEYL:
Point 2.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And just to clarify something for -- for Mr. Weyl and for the Court, the Rule 67(G) notice of the 30th of March 2006, is not really a witness statement.  In fact, I'm not even sure that the witness has had this read back to him.  This started out as a note from an investigator that was then turned into a will-say statement, or a Rule 67(D) notice. So, although it records what the witness said, this is not a statement that was actually reviewed with him and that he signed.  So, bear that in mind when you put questions to him on it, please.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, to respond to my learned friend's objection, I believe I had told the witness that I'm going to read to him his statement as recorded by the Prosecution officials.  Now, if the Prosecution official is telling us that he poorly understood what was the witness's statement, then that's something I'm going to understand, but I want to remind the witness of what the Prosecutor wrote down, and, then, I will ask him to comment.  So, as I said, Mr. President, it is point 2 of page 2 of the Rule 67(D) notice.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, this is what has been ascribed to you and I would like you to comment: "I became an Interahamwe in the circumstances I described in the statement of 3 to 11 November 2004.  I wish only to add some further details.  I attended my very first Interahamwe meeting in Vedaste Rubangura's building at the invitation of a man called ***************and Jean-Pierre Turatsinze, the préfectoral Interahamwe chairman for Kigali-rural, since to be able to participate in a meeting of that kind you had to be introduced and presented by another Interahamwe.  Those two people, whom*** *****************************************************, knew me previously by name because of ************ ********************************************".  During that meeting -- and there is no mention of any other meeting -- what you said was that "That meeting was attended by members of the Interahamwe national bureau, who introduced themselves, and the commune and secteur Interahamwe chairmen from Kigali-rural préfecture and the neighbouring communes, but I was mistaken in saying that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was present".  Those were the words.  Now, Witness, what are your comments? 
A.	You just read that I was invited by *************and Turatsinze.  How could **************have invited me, whereas you were saying that********************, remember?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, I would like to make a request for disclosure of the investigator's note that led to compilation of the 30 March 2006 Rule 67(D) notice because we have never been given disclosure of that investigator's note and I think that the Niyitegeka case has established that when questions are put to a witness and the witness answers those questions by the Prosecutor that that becomes a statement that should be disclosed.  Thank you. 

MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, that's exactly what we've done with this Rule 67(D) notice.  Everything in that document that would be considered a statement is incorporated in this notice.  So, it is exactly the same thing, there is nothing, really, to disclose.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, should you therefore understand that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, the person who signed the document is the person who conducted the interview?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, sir. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I believe I signed this notice, but the person who conducted the interview is an investigator.  It was not myself. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
So, Mr. President, then, since there would be no prejudice to the Prosecution, we would ask that they produce the investigator's note signed by the investigator, or whoever else, so that we could have that and that way there would be no question whether we have had full disclosure.  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'll try to locate it, then make a decision and then inform the Court accordingly.  It shouldn't be a big deal, but I would rather not commit myself now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
 How much time would that be?  
MR. WEBSTER:
After the morning break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Continue, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:  
	Much obliged, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Now, Witness, we are moving from one inconsistency to the other, because when I put questions to you regarding the answers you gave the investigator in March 2006 you refer me to your statement of November 2003, which are (sic) different before this Bench.  Now, could you make some efforts to stick to one story, rather than shuttling from one story to the other.  What is the correct version, sir? 
A.	Counsel, you are stating that there are inconsistencies between the various statements, but I beg to disagree with you.  Regarding the first meeting that took place at the Rubangura building, I do not think there was only one meeting.  As I told you, there were weekly meetings holding on Saturdays and sometimes on Wednesdays.  So, if you think there are inconsistencies between the statements, it is because there was not just one meeting.  And, as you are no doubt aware, what is discussed during one meeting is not necessarily what would be repeated during another meeting.  
Q.	But knowing whether you had already been appointed ********************************************by the time you attended your maiden meeting at the Vedaste Rubangura meeting is something which is of importance, don't you think?  
A.	You are right, Counsel.  It is something of importance, because trust had been bestowed upon me.  I was introduced*******************************************.  
Q.	You say you were introduced***********************************, whereas you had not yet joined the Interahamwe; is that your evidence? 
A.	But, Counsel, I don't know why we are splitting hairs on this.  

	The first day I was introduced as someone who would be a member of that group and who would assist the others.  So, we were introduced by the national Interahamwe leaders.  During the meeting that came after this one,*************************************.  It was on that occasion that the Interahamwe leaders of all the communes of Kigali préfecture and in surrounding communes were introduced to us.  I think I was the last person to be introduced, amongst all those who were introduced, on that occasion. 
Q.	Witness, was the purpose of the first meeting which you attended at Vedaste Rubangura's building to rally the youth to support the Interahamwe of the MRND?  
A.	Yes, Counsel, that was the case. 
Q.	So that they would spread the party ideology? 
A.	Yes, that was the case. 
Q.	Had the name "Interahamwe za MRND" already been chosen? 
A.	Yes.  When I joined that organisation that was the term that was being used. 
Q.	During that meeting you were not shown machetes? 
A.	No, I did not see any. 
Q.	During that meeting you were not shown hatchets? 
A.	No, I did not see any. 
Q.	During that meeting it was not said that Tutsis had to be killed? 
A.	No, I did not hear anything of the sort. 
Q.	Anti-Tutsi songs were not sung? 
A.	I have told you that it was at night.  We had gone there to hold a meeting, not to sing.  So, there were no songs. 
Q.	So, it was during that meeting that you joined the Interahamwe; do you stand by that assertion? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Because the set objectives of the Interahamwe were something you espoused? 
A.	Yes.  When I left the meeting place, I was convinced. 
Q.	Did you share the ideology which had been explained to you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	We agree that it was an ideology which was underpinned by anti-discrimination? 
A.	I've told you that it was my very first meeting, so I did not hear such utterances. 
Q.	But the consensus during the meeting was the wish for unity, peace, and development, which were the MRND objectives; is that so? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So for you joining the Interahamwe under such conditions was a good thing? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I did not see any problem with that. 
Q.	So, if you had heard anti-Tutsi songs and calls for Tutsi to be killed, you would not have come back? 
A.	Counsel, you are saying that if such utterances had been made, I would not have gone there again.  No, Counsel, I could have gone there, and espoused such an ideology.  
Q.	Are you saying that you would have gone to a second meeting if they wanted to kill Tutsi, if there had been speeches made encouraging people to kill Tutsi?
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.  I'm objecting to the question, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The objection is overruled.  You can answer, if you wish. 
THE WITNESS:
When I decided to join the Interahamwe organisation I knew what it was.  I was convinced -- I can see that Defence counsel does not want me to elaborate, but I think that in order to -- for my answer to be complete, then, I will need to elaborate.  I know that he has asked me not to dwell on specifics, but I would seek such an authorisation now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may answer the question, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Before I joined the Interahamwe, again, we had asked someone to represent us.  It was a lady MP called  "Kamagema" (sic) who had betrayed us and had decided to join the PL party which was collaborating with the Inkotanyi who had attacked the country.  So, I noticed that if that lady who was a Tutsi had decided to leave our party and decamp to another party, then that meant that all Tutsi were against us and that they were seeking to collaborate with the other Tutsi out of the country.  So, I was convinced all the ingredients were there, and I was ready to espouse such an ideology. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, it was not the ideology which was communicated to you during the meeting which you attended. 
A.	Granted it was not the ideology which was communicated to me, but it did not take long for that to happen.  We talked about it during such meetings. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think, perhaps, it is time for us to have our morning recess. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we will take a short recess now. 
(Court recessed at 1033H) 
(Pages 11 to 18 by Eleanor Bastian)































(Court resumed at 1059H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can continue now.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I would like to continue on my line of questioning as to the functioning of the Interahamwe.  You mentioned quite a hierarchical structure, like a pyramid, if you like.  But I did not understand all of your responses, because it was somewhat confused, to my mind.  We were going from one structure to another, and I would like to clarify a number of points. 

Now, in view of the fact that you are a protected witness, I would ask you not to provide me with the names of the structures as such, but with the different rankings.  So you said that you joined the Interahamwe in the year 1992.  You were a simple member, and then you were appointed************ *************; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Were you appointed or were you elected?  Because I saw that you made a distinction between being appointed and being elected in your statements.  
A.	I was appointed to replace the person who preceded me. 
Q.	And what date was that? 
A.	I do not remember. 
Q.	Could you give us an approximation, possibly a month? 
A.	It was in 1992. 
Q.	You were appointed by whom? 
A.	I was appointed by**************. 
Q.	So that was***************.  Was there a secteur bureau, was there a secteur committee, or was there merely one leader for the secteur?  
A.	There was a leader for the secteur.  There was also a body that could be termed a committee because there was a deputy to the leader and there was also a secretary.  So I would say that there was, in fact, a committee. 
Q.	Could you tell us the name of the person whom you replaced?  
A.	His name was**********.  
Q.	Did -- the provisional national committee, was it informed of your appointment? 
A.	Apart from the fact that I met with them, well, I do believe that the committee -- the national temporary committee was informed, because when we came to meet, people noted that I was working at a level that I did not work at before. 
Q.	You then gained office*******************; is that what you told us? 
A.	Yes.  But on that occasion I was elected. 
Q.	And by what structure exactly were you elected? 
A.	It was **********************************************who elected me.  We came together in a gathering, and I was elected. 
Q.	Do you remember the date? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you remember the period? 
A.	Towards the end of the year 1992, during the last months of 1992.  
Q.	And were you replacing somebody? 
A.	No, I wasn't.  
Q.	Were you******************************? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	There was**********************************************************? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Which position were you elected to? 
A.	******************************************-- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
And the witness mentioned the name of the commune.  And now, Mr. President, counsel is saying if that last reference could be stricken. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, please, the name of the commune is redacted.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, was the national provisional committee informed of your election? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	By whom? 
A.	The MRND chairman for the commune.  I was elected and informed them. 
Q.	Witness, let us move to the next level.  What is the next level, Witness?  
A.	The next level after************************************. 
Q.	Were you appointed or elected?  
A.	I was elected. 
Q.	By whom? 
A.	By**************************************. 
Q.	Did you replace somebody?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Who? 
A.	***************************. 
Q.	Witness, what were your responsibilities within that structure? 
A.	My role was *************************************************************************************************** ***************************************************************************************************************** then. 
Q.	During which period were you elected, sir? 
A.	In 1993.  It was being said then that the RPF battalion was to come to the country.  There was also talk about RPF infiltrations throughout the country. 
Q.	Can you be specific with regard to the month? 
A.	I think it was between June and September 1993. 
Q.	Is it your evidence that your role was**************************************************************? 
A.	Yes, that was the role then. 
Q.	Was that not Turatsinze's role? 
A.	Turatsinze had a lot of work to do.  He was working in town, so he could not cover the 
	Kigali-rural préfecture.  He was very busy. 
Q.	So you are saying Turatsinze was overwhelmed with work?  
A.	Yes, he was working at the MRND party secretariat. 
Q.	Witness, I have a problem to understand you here.  But I thought I understood -- perhaps it was at a different time, but I thought I understood that you were*********************************************** ****************.  Can you clarify my doubts?  
A.	Before, when I was******************************************, I was considered as someone living in the periphery of Kigali town.  So I worked together************************************************************** ****************************************************************************************************************** ********************  And it's an activity I carried out until we went on exile. 
Q.	So while you were still********************************************************************************************  *******************************************************************? 
A.	That's right, Interahamwe for Kigali-ville. 
Q.	Did you discharge your duty ********************************in an adequate manner? 
A.	Yes, I tried to discharge my duty efficiently. 
Q.	So there was no problem of discipline? 
A.	Counsel, you certainly understand that wherever there are people there will be small issues.  There were problems, but it all depended on the causes and the origins of the acts of indiscipline. 
Q.	We are in agreement, sir.  But on the whole,************************************; is that so? 
A.	Talking about obedience, they obeyed me.  However, some of them still made mistakes.  
Q.	And when they made mistakes, did you warn them?  
A.	We would try to collect information in that connection and report to Turatsinze. 
Q.	Were the reports in writing? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you prepare the written reports? 
A.	Yes, I was the one who prepared those reports.  So if you have any problem regarding the drafting of the report, I will tell you we had a secretary who did the writing for me, and we would forward the reports to Turatsinze. 
Q.	I will revisit this point in due course. 

When you made those routine reports, in general terms, you reported that there were no problems of discipline; is that correct?  
A.	When you make a report, it is because there has been some incident regarding your work. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If counsel could repeat his question.  
MR. WEYL: 
I'm sorry.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, let me ask my question again.  Were there many acts of indiscipline about which you reported?  
A.	Even there were not many incidents, there were, however, some incidents.  Also you can even send a positive report.  You do not need to wait for something to happen before you would send a negative report. 
Q.	So when Interahamwe ****************************commit acts of theft, murder, looting, acts of assault against Tutsi and opponents, those were certainly acts of indiscipline, isn't it? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  And I would report such acts whenever they occurred. 
Q.	But I don't quite understand.  But, you see, you committed those acts with them, if I understand properly the statement you gave the Prosecutor, statement dated 3rd to 11th of November 2004.  
A.	Yes, I committed those acts also within the framework of my duty as well as the assignment we had received.  So I had to send a report to explain how the mission had been carried out.  
Q.	Even when it was not the mission you had been assigned with? 
A.	No.  The fact of committing acts, we had not been asked to accomplish.  In fact, that is why I had to make those reports. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, sir, talking about those instructions which you received, if at all you did receive instructions, was it to organise events? 
A.	No, not to organise demonstrations.  Others would organise such demonstrations and events, and then we would participate in them. 
Q.	But in earlier statements you had said that Turatsinze instructed you to organise demonstrations and events, and whenever he organised such demonstrations, you would avail yourselves of such opportunities to organise and commit acts of theft, murder, looting, acts of assault against Tutsi and opponents. 
A.	No, sir.  That was not the situation.  The events and demonstrations would be organised by the party, and we would be instructed to implement those demonstrations.  We were not the ones preparing the demonstrations.  It was the party. 
Q.	Witness, let me refer you to the statement you gave the Prosecutor, which is the subject of the notice of the 30th of March 2006.  It is on point 15.  I'm referring to the Rule 67 notice.  "Those instructions dealt, for example, with organising street demonstrations, roadblocks, and other actions of that kind, during which we took the opportunity to steal, commit murders and engage in destructions, looting, and attacks directed against the Tutsis and the opponents.  The instructions did not say openly that we should attack the latter, but it was understood."  

	So you prepared reports for what you were doing, whereas you had not been instructed in that connection? 
A.	Counsel, you just said, yourself, that we took the opportunity, so you certainly understand what that means, taking the opportunity of something.  We were given instructions to block roads.  When you are requested to block a road, it is not asking you to go to church to pray.  It is understood that when you block a road, then (unintelligible) of certain acts. 
Q.	Witness, in order for us to be complete about this, we are referring to the period 1993, when people blocked roads for peaceful purposes to organise demonstrations.  Those were just peaceful demonstrations and acts.  And now, Witness, you are telling us that you took the opportunity to commit acts of theft, murders and lootings, as well as assault? 
A.	If it was within our limit to block roads so that nobody could enter the town, then we had received the authorisation to do just that.  Even when there was collateral damage, we are not the ones to be answerable for such collateral damage.  Those to answer for those acts of damage are the leaders who gave us such missions. 
Q.	But, Witness HH, that is a somewhat gratuitous remark.  You receive a peaceful mission, you are **************************, you have specific responsibilities, and you take advantage of instructions you claim you had received to commit atrocities.  Do you assume responsibility for that or not?  
A.	No, sir, that was not the case.  If it was a peaceful mission, then they would have sent me to any church to go and pray.  If our mission was to block the road and prevent people from entering the town, it was because sometimes those people tried to resist and then we would have to use force.  It was not a peaceful mission, because we were not sent to the church. 
Q.	Witness, let me move on to another line, but when you say that you took advantage of demonstrations to steal, commit murders and attacks against the Tutsi, did you mention all those acts in your confession and guilty plea before the Gacaca court? 
A.	Regarding my confession before the Gacaca court, I would like to request from the presiding Judge and the honourable members of this Court that we set aside the Gacaca matter.  I am here before an international criminal tribunal to give evidence, and I was called to testify about that.  If I had pleaded guilty to all the acts I had committed, then it is obvious that I must have also mentioned this one before the Gacaca court.  So I would like you to move on, instead of belabouring this point, which is going to make us waste time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the question as you have framed it, requiring the witness to answer whether he mentioned all those acts in his confession or guilty plea, is not really a question which I would permit the witness to answer.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I was asking the witness whether he had mentioned in his confession and guilty plea that he has used the instructions given in order to organise demonstrations, put in place roadblocks, and undertake acts -- undertake acts of robbery, and I believe that the witness can say easily whether yes or no he mentioned such-and-such a thing in his confession.  Could you please ask the witness to answer my question, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but I just ruled on the matter.  Are you asking me to reconsider a decision I just made?  Continue with your cross-examination. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness HH, I'm also somewhat put out by the description that you have provided of your functions and the description that you have given of your appointment, because it doesn't really tally with what you gave in your previous statements, maybe because you had a far better memory at the time or maybe because you were not saying one and the same thing.  I shall remind you of the contents of your statement dated the 3rd of November, marked K0507848 for the French version. 

As regards***************************************************, you say that in -- you say that that was the case in 1992, and you were very precise in giving that date.  Can you confirm what you said?  
A.	All that I remember is the year in question.  
Q.	So today you only remember the year.  Now, in November 2004, you also remembered the month of your appointment to the post of***********************.  
A.	Well, I said that, but you can see how old I am, and as the years go by, I tend to forget some details, so I believe that you should not belabour the point that I mentioned the month in 2004 and not today. 
Q.	So, Witness, you are telling us that your memory is not solid enough today to give all the necessary details to the Trial Chamber? 
A.	I can answer all the questions that you will put to me before this Trial Chamber.  There is no reason for me not to be able to explain myself to the Trial Chamber. 
Q.	Witness, in November 2004, you indicated that you had been appointed at******************************** *************.  You did not say that you were elected, and at an earlier stage today you said you made a distinction between being appointed and being elected.  Now, why did you not make that same 
	decision (sic) in 2004? 
A.	It is true that I was elected.  If that was not taken down in my statement of 2004, it could be that the person who took my statement did not understand correctly and that it was a mistake. 
Q.	Witness, in November 2004, you indicated that you were elected ****************************************** in June 1993.  Were you appointed or were you elected? 
A.	I was elected.  I was never appointed.  You put such a question to me but a few moments ago, and I told you that that occurred between the months of June and August. 
Q.	Witness, in your testimony before the Gacaca courts, you said that it was in the month of January, at a date that you do not recall, that you were appointed*******************************************************.  So are you telling the truth before this Trial Chamber or in your confession before the Gacaca courts? 
A.	With regard to that statement made before the Gacaca courts, I told you that we only had to provide lists before the Gacaca, and those are the very lists that you showed to me yesterday that I did not immediately recognise.  We were asked questions and we filled out forms.  So I asked you to put the Gacaca courts subject to one side in order for us to concentrate on the case in question here. 
Q.	So before the Gacaca, your answer was induced, you were given indications as to how to enter your confession, and now you find it difficult to remain in keeping with those initial statements, do you not?  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	It's not a document that I drafted myself.  I did not draft a document for the attention of the Gacaca.  It was a sort of question-and-answer session, and some of our co-detainees transmitted the documents to the Gacaca, and that is the reason why I was not in a position yesterday to immediately recognise those documents. 
Q.	Because the statements before the Gacaca that I have just reminded you of is not the transcript, it is, in fact, a manuscript document dated the ************************that you recognised yesterday, that you recognised this morning, saying that it was your handwriting, even if it was written in the hand of somebody else.  So that's K0368348 for the French version.  And you said spontaneously, in the month of January -- "In the month of January, on a date that I do not recall, I was appointed********************** ********************** ."  And you go on to add that that was by********************************************** ******************.  So why are your indications different as to whether given, i.e., before the Prosecutor, before this Trial Chamber, or before the Gacaca? 
A.	You are underlining the fact that I was appointed by************.  I feel that you are putting words in my mouth.  Even if you are reading that from some document, it is a mistake.  I have convincing evidence to underline the fact that I was not appointed by**********************, so you should not rely too heavily on those documents that were drafted in the prison.  You should put them to one side, those documents relative to the Gacaca. 
Q.	Witness, Mr. Webster, during his examination-in-chief, lengthily put your memory to test on the Interahamwe structures in the neighbouring communes at a national level in order to show his case as to the very organised hierarchical structure of the Interahamwe.  Do you remember that?  
A.	Yes, I remember that he put questions to me on that subject, and if the Prosecutor has access to a document in which I might have said that I was appointed, I would ask him to provide me with said document.  
Q.	Now, Witness, I was referring to the exercise that had you appointed secteur by secteur, préfecture by préfecture, commune by commune, and the names of those that you identify as the Interahamwe leaders.  Do you remember that exercise we conducted?  
A.	Yes, I remember it very well, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, was it a list of names that you learned by heart, or is it people that you remember because you physically met them, or are they people to whom you can put a face to?  
A.	Those were the names of people that I came across during meetings.  I would give the example of your Defence team.  If you were invited to give the names of your team members, that of your Defence team members, I do not believe that that would be problematic for you, so that was -- those were the names of people that I knew.

1144H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Could you describe each and every person whose name you gave us? 
A.	Yes, I would in a position -- I would be in a position to do so were questions to be put to me on the subject of the behaviour of one or other of those leaders, because I did go to their homes.  
Q.	Did you know the address of each person whose name you provided? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And were you invited to their home? 
A.	Yes.  It was part of my duties.  I had to go to the residence of each and every one of those people in order to find out what the Interahamwe under their control were doing. 
Q.	Do you know the professions or activities performed by each of those people whose names you gave to Mr. Webster from that list?
A.	Yes.  As for the leaders of the Interahamwe at secteur level, yes, I do.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, you talked about Gatete.  Gatete was the president of which structure exactly?  
A.	I saw Gatete when he came to the party headquarters.  I never went to his residence, but I did go to the commune that he headed up when he was reintegrated to his post.  Otherwise, I would see him at the party headquarters.  And the same applies for the other presidents at préfecture level.  When I told you that I knew everybody, I was talking about those*******************************, in my neighbourhood and in the neighbouring neighbourhoods.  I did not talk about the préfecture level because I did not visit the residence of each and every one of those people. 
Q.	Witness, what was Gatete's function? 
A.	I often saw Gatete when he came to the party headquarters in order to talk to Turatsinze, and he would tell him of what was going on in the party.  And Turatsinze would then send him to Ngirumpatse, so I saw him outlining what was going on amongst the Interahamwe, and I saw that he was in charge of the Interahamwe at the level of Byumba préfecture.  
Q.	It took us quite a time to reach that answer.  I think that might have refreshed your memory with reference to what you said yesterday.  Now, do you know the other duties that were performed by Gatete? 
A.	I know that initially Gatete was bourgmestre, then he was rid of his title before being reintegrated into that post. 
Q.	If I said that he had never been reintegrated into that post, would you still confirm what you just said? 
A.	Counsel, how can you convince me, whereas I was the one who took part in that meeting? 
Q.	And when did that meeting occur? 
A.	I do not remember the month, but I believe that it was in the year 1993.  
Q.	So you cannot be more precise about a ceremony of such a type that you say that you took part in? 
A.	Counsel, I took part in a number of events, and, as I said, I no longer recall the precise dates. 
Q.	Who took part in that ceremony? 
A.	The most important guest, that is, of the MRND leaders, was the commandant de place named Bizimana.  So he represented the MINADEF, and I do not remember whether it was he or not.  There was also Robert Kajuga, who was present.  
Q.	Witness HH, Mutabaruka, M-A-T-A-B-U-R-A-K-A (sic), did you -- what -- in which location did he exercise responsibility within the Interahamwe? 
A.	I knew Mutabaruka when he was bourgmestre of the former commune of Sake in Kibungo secteur.  I then saw him when he came to the party headquarters in order to tell us of what was going on in the Interahamwe.  I saw him also in Cyasemakamba at meetings there, and he was also the person who was in charge of the Interahamwe of that area.  I saw him with my very own eyes.  
Q.	Witness, in view of the fact that you have met all the people whose names you have given us, do you remember what their family situation was and how old they were?  Could you, for example, give me the age of Pecos? 
A.	Yes, I can give you an approximation with reference to that individual.  So were I to try and estimate, I would say that Pecos was probably ***************younger than me, so I was older than him.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Mshimuye, M-S-H-I-M-U-Y-E, how old was he? 
A.	If you were referring to Claude Mshimuye, I would say that Mshimuye was younger than me, ******** years younger than me, in fact. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You know, Mr. Weyl, I've been trying very hard not to interrupt you, but what does the relevance of this have to do with the case?  Please go on.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, with reference to some secteurs, you gave a number of names of presidents.  Does that seem to you consistent and possible that there were a number of different presidents for a given secteur? 
A.	Yes, it is possible, Counsel.  I shall explain why.  In Nyamirambo secteur and in Biryogo secteur, I think that your clients are well aware of what I am telling you.  Let us take the example for Biryogo.  There was Ndayitabi and Hadji Gihundu in that very same Biryogo secteur.  But one of those two people was also leader of the Interahamwe in Nyamirambo secteur.  

Another example that I could give you,*********************************************************************** ****************************************************************************************************************** **************************************************************************. 
Q.	Witness, I am somewhat put out.  What is the second name you gave for Biryogo secteur? 
A.	With reference to Biryogo, I talked of Ndayitabi and another by the name of Hadji Gihundu.  
Q.	It is somewhat curious to me because, the day before yesterday, you gave one name, Hadji Ndayitabi, and on the rather pressing request of the Prosecutor, you said that his other name was Suedi.  So you didn't give another name.  Does that mean that your memory is better today than it was two days ago? 
A.	I did not deem it necessary to explain everything because, when questions are being put to you, sometimes you limit yourself to the question that is being put to you without providing details, and I believe that you stopped me from doing so.  But, as I said, one same individual can have more than one name.  
Q.	Witness, the day before yesterday, you said that Gaparata was the president of Cyangugu secteur, Kacyiru commune.  Is that what you're saying now?  Do you confirm that? 
A.	No, Counsel, that is not what I said.  I never said that he was president in that secteur.  I said that Gaparata was leader at Kimiccanga. 
Q.	That is indeed what you said on the 3rd of November 2004, but that is not what you said on the 8th of November 2006.  Haj Abakiga, H-A-J A-B-A-K-I-J-A (sic), you said that he was the president of Kimihurura secteur in Kacyiru commune.  Do you confirm? 
A.	Counsel, honestly, I do not know where you are getting that information from.  Regarding Haj Abakiga, I told you he was the leader of Interahamwe for Kimirongo.  Regarding Kimihurura, I believe I had given you the name of one Nzabanterura.  
Q.	Well, Witness, we are going to check the transcripts.  

And who did you place at Butare? 
A.	Counsel, I don't see how I can answer your question when you say, "Who did you place at Butare."  When you talk about placing, it means that I was the one appointing those people.  
Q.	Witness, let me rephrase my question.  What is the name of the person you said was the Interahamwe president for Butare préfecture? 
A.	Now, Counsel, I understand you, and I'm going to answer your question.  I was told that it was Munyagasheke (sic).  
Q.	Did you hear or did you meet Munyagasheke? 
A.	I saw him at the MRND party secretariat, but it was also said that he was the Interahamwe leader, and he was the one to solve all of their problems. 
Q.	Witness, if I were to put it to you that Munyagasheke was a member of the MDR, what would you say to that? 
A.	Counsel, if that is true, then they lied to me.  What I know is that I often went to the party secretariat, and when we saw someone influential like Munyagasheke there, then we would seek to know why he was at party secretariat.  So when I sought to know why he was at our party secretariat, I was told that he was the Interahamwe chairman for Butare préfecture.  
Q.	Witness, during that exercise, you gave the name of the leader for Muhima secteur.  Can you remind us of that name, please.  
A.	As I had said when I was answering the Prosecutor's question, immediately following the death of President Habyarimana, the leader was Habiyaremye, son of Mutaraba.  He replaced somebody else who had been killed immediately after the president's death because he was suspected of being a Hutu. 
Q.	And do you remember the name you gave the Prosecutor regarding Kicukiro? 
A.	Concerning Kicukiro, there were two secteurs, Ziniya and Kagarama.  I no longer remember the Interahamwe leaders for those two secteurs. 
Q.	But the day before yesterday, you told us it was Karangwa.  
A.	No, Counsel.  You are ascribing to me words I did not mention.  I said that for Kicukiro I did not remember those who were the leaders in the two secteurs.  When I mentioned that person's name, I said he closely followed Interahamwe activities in those two secteurs.  And the name was 
	Séraphin Twahirwa, but I never said that he was the Interahamwe leader.  
Q.	Witness, I am referring to page 28 of the transcript where, indeed, you first said that you did not remember the names of the leaders for Ziniya and Kagarama.  But, however, there is a name which comes to mind, and it is Karangwa, and that is the name of the Interahamwe leader when one goes to Kicukiro commune.  It doesn't ring any bell in your mind, sir? 
A.	No, Counsel.  I do not know where you got that name Karangwa from.  

If I tried to think, I think that the person who was Interahamwe leader for Ziniya was Buffalo, but I do not think I mentioned that name because, given that he had been replaced at that time, I did not have to mention his name. 
Q.	So is it your evidence that, as far as you can remember, the leader for Ziniya in 1993, early 1994 was called Buffalo? 
A.	Counsel, I have told you that that person had been replaced.  There was someone else at the helm of the Interahamwe in that area in 1994.  
Q.	And at about what period or date was that person replaced, since you are making some tremendous effort to recollect? 
A.	The person was replaced in 1993.  
Q.	So you do not know who replaced him?  You cannot be more specific about that? 
A.	I am afraid not. 
Q.	Well, then, I will have -- I will have to leave with that.  

Witness, what I'm going to put to you is that the leaders you have mentioned and the structures you have referred to did not really exist the way you are narrating them.  If I were to tell you that a witness, who was a member of the national provisional committee, said that there were no Interahamwe leaders in the préfectures except in one, what are you going to say? 
A.	And which préfecture would that be, according to you?  
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Could Mr. Weyl clarify -- or, I'm -- could the question be repeated?  I didn't quite understand it.  Is the suggestion that another witness that has already testified gave that information, or is it coming from somewhere else? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, if I have to answer Mr. Webster's -- Mr. Webster's query, then I'm going to rephrase my question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, if I were to put it to you that another witness in this Court has said that only Gisenyi secteur had an Interahamwe leader, what would you say to that? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm sorry.  Perhaps -- maybe Mr. Weyl wants -- would prefer that the witness not hear this, but I don't know what Mr. Weyl is referring to.  And if he could clarify it for me.  And you can ask the witness to remove his headphones if he would like to.  But I'd like to know what witness testifying on what day before the witness is asked to respond. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth is requesting Mr. Weyl to repeat the name of the secteur he just mentioned because the interpreters did not understand.
MR. WEYL:
Now, I'm going to answer the question raised by the interpreter, then perhaps seek the authorisation of the Chamber to set aside my question for another stage because there is a problem of witness protection here.  I am in a fix.  I don't know how to move on.  Because he's a protected witness, I do not know how to rephrase my question.  With the leave of the Court, I am going to ask the question differently at another point in time, give the inferences without me being jammed by the protection matter.  
MR. WEYL:
The reference to the town was Gisenyi préfecture.  I don't think it is necessary for me to spell it.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says counsel. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness, I'm going to put a proposition to you, then I will welcome your comments.  My proposition to you is that there was no organised hierarchical and pyramidal structure of the Interahamwe, contrary to your assertion.  What do you have to say to that, sir? 
A.	I don't know what is the source of your information; neither do I know what your objective is.  You are saying that in Gisenyi préfecture there was an Interahamwe chairman.  Well, that is funny.  I, myself, giving you this information now, ***************************************************************************** ***********************************************************************************
(Pages 27 to 31 by Ann Burum)




1215H 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Witness, what I am telling you is that the titles were given in a random manner, such that each and every one could have his own ideology and would want to move the ideology on.  Just as someone could use the name Interahamwe, because he wants to settle scores with people like 
	Venantie Kabageni; what would be your comment about that, sir? 
A.	That was not the case, sir.  We are saying that people gave themselves titles so that they could be known within the hierarchy of that organisation; no, elections were conducted in open.  People gathered to conduct those elections.  Perhaps it is necessary for me to request the president and the honourable Judges to carry out an investigation to ascertain whether those elections were not held in open. 
Q.	Witness, that is the reason why from one statement to the other, from your statement of the               *******************to your evidence in this courtroom, from your statement of the ************************** to the Prosecutor through this statement of the same day before the Gacaca, you are giving various accounts of events, various events of the designation process, and you have never been consistent in the story that you are telling? 
A.	Well, that is the way you construe it.  That is not what I said. 
Q.	So, the way I construe it is that the names of certain leaders, which you have repeated today, are names which you found in the document prepared for you to sign during the Gacaca proceedings, as you told us a while ago? 
A.	I think you are revisiting that Gacaca matter.  I thought we were rather looking at the issue concerning Interahamwe leaders.  As far as I am concerned, you are trying to confuse me when you go and pick up the Gacaca matter again.  Perhaps if you belabour that point, then let's get the issue of the Interahamwe leaders done with first, and then we are going to come back to the Gacaca matter. 
Q.	Witness, I thought I had sort of gone through all of the questions regarding that matter, by going through the statements you have given, what you have said in this courtroom in answer to my questions and compared with your prior statements, we had gone through all of that.  

Now, with the leave of the Court I'm going to move to another exercise.  And it is to ask you to give me the names of the people who were**************************, but here I have a difficulty which concerns your own protection.  So, my proposal would be for you to write down those names.  Do you think you would be able to write down the names of the people ****************************so that we can remain in open court?  Do you think that you can write down those names on a piece of paper which I am going to hand to you? 
A.	Concerning the names of those who were**************************, obviously there were lots of them.  Well, some of them I knew only their nicknames, especially when I was*****************.  So I'm not in a position to give you a comprehensive list of all of those names.  All what I can do is to give you names of the people whom I met with at least two or three times a week.  Those are the names I will easily remember, people that I very often contacted and interacted with.  I cannot give you a comprehensive list of all Interahamwe.  

Furthermore, let me say that in any case you have the resources and the wherewithal to go to Rwanda.  If you have been to Rwanda, then it is possible you have those names already.  Members of the public may have given you the information already. 
Q.	Witness, I expect those names from you.  And let me, once again, tell you that I am really perplexed.  You can give me the names of secteur leaders whom you saw only very occasionally and it is difficult for you to give me the names of the people that you say you worked with several times a week, almost on a daily basis.  How do you expect me to believe that? 
A.	(No interpretation) 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, we are going to get to the point where the witness and the Defence counsel are arguing with each other because that is not what the witness said a few minutes ago.  In fact, the witness offered to give -- to provide the names of the people that he met with two or three times a week.  Now, I thought we were at the point where we were trying to figure out the mechanism by which that information would be communicated.  

So rather than expressing his impatience, maybe Mr. Weyl can give some thought to how those names will be provided to the Trial Chamber. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I suggested a method, that is, giving the witness a piece of paper for him to write down the names, and I asked the witness whether he was able to do that?
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is not a good idea for him to write down the names.  And he has given evidence before which would indicate that that was not an appropriate way to proceed with this particular witness.  Now, it -- we just have about a few minutes before the end of our session, before we adjourn for the weekend.  And, perhaps, we should go into closed session and let him give this testimony, and then we can adjourn. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, that was the suggestion I wanted to make, but before we move into a closed session, I would like to have the witness give a last answer in open session on this point, perhaps.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	You said that the people you worked with regularly were names you remembered.  Is Pecos one of those names?
A.	Yes, I met him very often, even by virtue of his private activities.  We met on a daily basis before the president's death.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness said something which may have to deal with his identity.  
THE WITNESS:
Do you have any problem relating to any of the presidents, then give their names and I will tell you when we met.  Regarding the Interahamwe, sometimes I would spend about three or four days without seeing them. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Witness, I was talking about Pecos.  Pecos is a first name.  Do you remember his surname? 
A.	I have forgotten Pecos's surname, but I knew that name.  It is just that I can't remember the name here and now, otherwise I knew it.  I know that you possibly have that name.  If you could put a name to me, then I will be able to tell you whether or not it was Pecos's name. 
Q.	Was it Pecos Ngerageze, N-G-E-R-A-G-E-Z-E? 
A.	Yes, that is the name. 
Q.	And has it been a long time since you last remembered that name? 
A.	Actually the same reason that I just mentioned earlier on, sometimes we used first names, other times we would use nicknames.  When the surname is not often mentioned, you can easily forget it. 
Q.	Witness, you mentioned Pecos Ngerageze in your confession of the**************************; do you agree with me?  
A.	That is impossible.  As I told you, it happened a long time ago, so it is very normal that one would forget such things, and you have to take into account my age, sir. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, do you want us to move into the closed session now or perhaps when we resume at Monday morning, because we are looking at the time?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we were thinking that.  But we were wondering, is the closed session really necessary.  What was the question that you are going to put in closed session?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would want the witness to give me as many names as possible of the Interahamwe for each secteur and each commune that he knows; people that were under his order, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Those are two different questions, you see, the first question is not the closed session question.  If you put it in that way, it is not a closed session question.  Any way, we think it is time to take the adjournment now.  It is 12:30.  And we want to -- what I would like to find out from you is just to clarify what is going to happen next week.  How much -- how far have you reached on your cross-examination?  When do you anticipate concluding?   
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I should be done before the time limit I informed the Court about.  I should be done by the end of Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we don't think that any time limit has been imposed on anybody up to now.  We asked you to give information as to what your estimates were.  We have not made any order as yet.  So, basically, the times involved are what we interpret as being a reasonable assessment of what it will take to deal with your work effectively -- a reasonable assessment made by you.  So, that is all I was asking, what did you assess would be the time left in your cross-examination?  

You see, we have been thinking about imposing time limits.  And if we do that, then it will not depend entirely upon your estimate.  We would also want to make some assessments and have some objective basis to do that, but we have not reached that stage yet.  If you think -- if we think that counsel has been acting reasonably, then we will rely on counsel.  

The reason why I am asking is this, you see, we are trying to see whether or not it is possible to conclude this witness's testimony during the course of next week.  We have already decided that we will not be sitting on Tuesday morning, so there will be a morning off on Tuesday.  And depending on what transpires with this witness, we may not sit on Friday, if it is not necessary.  If the witness is concluded by Thursday, then we won't sit on Friday.  And we just wanted to find out what were the assessments that counsel had themselves made of the duration of their cross-examination. So that was the purpose of my question.  

I also wanted to inform you that we were thinking of not sitting on Tuesday morning, and we would not sit on Friday if the witness was concluded on Thursday.  So, that was, basically, what I was trying to discuss.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, would you allow me to give a brief answer?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEYL: 
I believe there is a problem in the way I express myself.  I did not say that the Chamber had imposed a time limit.  It is the way I said it.  I said, I had indicated a time limit myself, and it was a way of answering your wish to have my assessment.  My time limit which I had imposed on myself is my assessments.  So I would like to tell the Court, if there is a problem of understanding, my deepest apologies.  

But the answer I gave the Chamber to its question is that I want to make sure I myself finish by the end of Monday.  It is just to remind the Chamber that I still stay within the time frame I had indicated when I answered the Chamber initially.  

So to answer your question, once again, my assessment right now is that I will end latest, end of Monday afternoon.  And kindly forgive me for what is the result of a misunderstanding in the way I answer your question by informing you of time frames I imposed on myself.  I am not complaining that the Chamber has imposed time frames on me.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, from the interpreters; the English interpreter mentioned something which, in his opinion, could reveal the witness's identity.  When the witness was giving his last answer regarding Pecos, we got the French interpretation of something which we did not interpret into English, Mr. President.  So, if you could find out from your French speaking colleague Judge and let us know if we should give the answer. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Interpreter, thank you for your intervention, we have not spotted it yet, but we are checking it and by Monday morning we will make an order if necessary.
MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, would it help you to plan for next week to hear about our estimates, perhaps.  I think maybe if Mr. Sow is going to go next, I'm not speaking out of turn, he told me that he thought about one day or possibly less.  And I'm going to take two days.  I think that will bring us very close on the cusp of Friday.  So I think right now it looks like we would need Friday, but if some fortuitous things happened, perhaps we wouldn't. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  But we're certainly not sitting on Tuesday morning, there is something that we need to do to deal with one or two matters that are important for the overall management of the trial. 

Yes.
MR. SOW: 
Mr. President, with your leave I would like to tell you that my assessment is about one day or less than one day, because for the weekend I am going to go through the questions which Mr. Weyl has asked the witness, I will take them on board so I don't have to ask them again, which means that I may take less than a day.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Witness, we have come to the end of our session for today, and that really is the end of our session for the week.  So we are going to take the adjournment now and resume on Monday morning at 8:45 as usual.  I remind you, as I have done before, that during this or any adjournment, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, sir.
(Court adjourned at 1237H)
