MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you open the proceedings.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 24th of February 2010, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, Your Honour, we have a slight amendment.  We have the assistance of another 
legal researcher for another month.  Her name is Zina Al-Askari, and she is seated right here to my left.  So we can welcome her to the trial as well.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Well, we welcome you to our trial, and we hope you have a satisfactory tour of duty.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your testimony continues.  I remind you that you remain under the same oath to tell the truth that you took when your testimony began yesterday.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, first of all, if I could make an application for just an extension of 25 minutes of the time that the Defence spent in their examination, just 25 minutes, Your Honours.  I intend to spend at least 45 minutes with this witness this morning, and I would just need an additional 25 minutes beyond the time that was spent by the Defence.  

I need to cover quite a lot of issues.  I need to cover the convoy and the roadblock and the way to Gitarama and Mukingo.  And I think I would be able to do that comfortably within 40 to 45 minutes.  That's with Your Honours' indulgence.  Just 25 minutes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your application is granted, Mr. N'dow.  
MR. N'DOW:
Thank you, Your Honour.
WITNESS 45,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Mr. Witness, now let's look at the convoy and the vehicles that were in the convoy.  We start with the pickup truck.  It was the last vehicle in the convoy, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And it had only one cabin, the front cabin, which had the driver's seat and the passenger seat; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it was a Daihatsu pickup truck.  It had just one cabin that would take the driver and the passenger.  But in a war period people don't only get into the cabin.  They could even have people in the back compartment. 
Q.	So the maximum number of people it could carry is only two to three people; is that correct?  In the 
front seat.  
A.	But people did not only ride in the front cabin, considering the situation that prevailed at the time, as people could ride even in Mercedes-Benz trucks, in the tipper truck, and you could even transport more than 20 people in the back of the truck. 
Q.	Well, I thought the back of the truck carried the luggage, Mr. Setako's luggage, didn't it? 
A.	We were not transporting a lot of luggage, and you would agree with me that, by any logic, Setako wouldn't have given priority to his property or luggage and, therefore, people were allowed to climb into the tipper truck in the back compartment.  He could not abandon children because he wanted to transport his personal belongings. 
Q.	So these were only Setako's personal belongings; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct, because on our arrival at Setako's home we had no property with us. 
Q.	And Setako would put his children at the back of this truck?  Is that what you want Your Honours to believe? 
A.	Well, Setako was not present, and the children were quite young, and they themselves climbed into the truck.  And let me repeat, Setako was not present. 
Q.	A truck carrying luggages, with guns, explosions all over the city of Kigali, Setako risking his children to be put in a truck.  What do you say to that, Witness? 
A.	You are saying there were guns in the tipper truck?  Well, that's your word against mine, but I didn't see any guns. 
Q.	Putting his children in the last vehicle in the convoy, far from the military escorts.  What do you say to that?  
A.	I told you that one of the two soldiers was riding in the truck, this little truck.  And it was pointed out that we had two soldiers who accompanied us all through the journey.  And one of these two soldiers was with us in the little truck.  So you understand that the children were not all by themselves. 
Q.	So can you tell us why Mr. Setako would put his children in that truck?  Why?  Was it to accommodate the doctor and his family? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, you should not put that question to me.  I described the scene as it unfolded, and I told you that which I saw, but I cannot go into explanations about what led the children to climb into the pickup and what prompted their decision to do so. 
Q.	Okay, let's move on to the next car, that is the Mercedes saloon, which you drove.  You were in this car with the doctor, his wife, two children and the other children of Setako; is that correct? 
A.	What you say is not correct.  You need to correct that.  I was in that vehicle with**************, his wife and two children, as well as a girl.  And so this was not many children, as you claim.  In addition to the two children, there was a daughter of Setako's. 
Q.	And who else was the second child? 
A.	I talked about two young children, two children, that is the children of***************, and I would say these were babies.  And the other girl, ************, was maybe 17 in age.  And I think I've been very, very clear, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	I mean who was the second child with**********?  You said there were two children.
A.	The two children that I mentioned were children of****************.  So I only talked about two children, namely, the two children of*****************. 
Q.	How many of you were in the car, Witness?  You can just clarify that then for us.
A.	There was myself, and by me some other person, and the third person was ************ wife, and there also was**********, who was the fourth person.  And in addition to us four, you had these two children, which brought it up to six persons. 
Q.	You did not travel with any of Setako's housegirls, did you?  Or house servants.  
A.	Since yesterday I shared with you that which I observed, and I maintain what I said since yesterday.  Mr. Prosecutor, I told you what I saw.  I described the convoy as I saw it.  
Q.	This was Nzirorera's car.  And what was his relationship -- 
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	I haven't finished my question.
A.	I'm sorry about that.  
Q.	Why would he have Setako's children in his car?  Can you explain that, please.
A.	Can you kindly take over your question, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	All right.  Witness, what was the special relationship that Nzirorera had with this doctor such that he would allow this doctor to be in his car and put his friend's car (sic), Mr. Setako, in a truck? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, again I think this question should be put to those concerned and not to me.  I was entrusted a vehicle that I was supposed to drive with the persons that were on board this vehicle. 
Q.	So this doesn't really sound reasonable, does it? 
A.	Personally, I believe ***************and Setako were both friends of Nzirorera's.  And Setako had welcomed us at his home.  He had welcomed Nzirorera's family.  And that proves that they were friends.  If Nzirorera authorised the doctor to climb into his vehicle, that certainly confirms the fact that they were friends.  But again, I think that I'm not in the best position to answer such questions.  

And concerning the children of Setako who were in the pickup, these were children that had grown up.  They were adults, so to say. 
Q.	I thought you said they were children.  Now they are adults.  
A.	In Rwandan culture a child -- when you are talking about a child, that's someone below 18.  Even if for a parent, a child who is an adult is still his child.  But I think that we could clarify the situation if you ask me to maybe state the ages of these persons, of these children.  And I will repeat to you again that these were children that had grown up, because the youngest of them was more than eight years.  And I think that the one that was eight years old was in the car that was -- in the car that was driven by Nzirorera in the company of his mother.

And, by the way, what I'm telling you here is not abnormal, because in this war situation people covered thousands of kilometres on foot.  We're no more concerned with any luxury which we had enjoyed during the period of peace. 
Q.	Witness, if I surprise you -- the doctor is not saying that he had this special relationship with Nzirorera.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, I told you that I got to know *************during that trip.  I did not know him before then.  So concerning his friendship with Nzirorera and the reason for which Nzirorera transfers his car to me for me to drive it and transport the family of**************, I think that question should not be put to me.  I was asked to drive a vehicle, and that was it.  I did not have to discuss that order or decide who was supposed to climb into that vehicle. 
Q.	According to the********, he met Mr. Nzirorera for the first time on that particular morning -- on that particular afternoon, that is the 12th.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I have no comments to make to that, because I was not living in Kigali to have known whether this person knew that person or rubbed shoulders with this other person.  I don't know anything about their relationship prior to our meeting, so I have no comments to make on that matter.  And, by the way, I was not supposed to know or to do a census, an inventory, of all Nzirorera's friends. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now we move on to Nzirorera's 4x4-wheel.  That was a Mercedes-Benz, and he was the one driving it, and in front of it you have his bodyguard; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, there was a soldier who was part of his close protection who was seated by him on the 
passenger seat in front.  And on the second seat there was his wife as well as Setako's wife and the young children. 
Q.	And can you tell us how Nzirorera was dressed?  What was he wearing? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, this is something that happened 15 years ago.  Do you really expect me to be in a position to describe what Nzirorera was wearing?  That's impossible.  And that holds for all the persons that were with us in this convoy.  Considering what we were going through at the time, I cannot tell you that I took particular note of what Nzirorera was wearing or what anybody else in their midst was wearing.  It's like on our way out of here someone asks me, "Please, can you describe what each person in this Trial Chamber is wearing?"  No, that's not possible.
Q.	But you can recall what he was holding, whether he was holding equipment.  You can recall that, can't you? 
A.	All I do remember is that he had nothing; he was not carrying anything.  He boarded the vehicle.  And at the head of the convoy was the military vehicle, which was clearing the way to facilitate safe passage at the roadblocks.  And we, therefore, continued with that military vehicle all the way to the 
Nyabarongo roadblock where the military truck turned around, and we got on our way on our own. 
Q.	Now, Witness, if I tell you that he was wearing military attire, what would you say to that? 
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when a civilian wears military fatigues, that stands out, and I could have noticed it.  And so I can tell you what you are saying is not correct.  That could have been something that was likely to be noticed, and I should have noticed it myself. 
Q.	According to the witness here in this trial, Mr. Nzirorera was wearing a military fatigue, dressed like a soldier, camouflage.  What do you say to that? 
A.	On that 12 April when we left Setako's residence, Nzirorera was not wearing military gear.  His vehicle was parked directly before the vehicle that I was driving.  And had he worn military gear at that time, that picture would have remained engraved on my mind, because Nzirorera was a civilian, and if perchance he had put on military fatigues, that would have been a remarkable change that I wouldn't have forgotten.  He was not wearing military gear. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Now, how many people travelled in Mr. Nzirorera's car? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, under the prevailing circumstances I couldn't have counted the number of people who were found in his vehicle.  But I can tell the Chamber what I remember, and I recall that Nzirorera was driving, and his vehicle was directly in front of the vehicle I was driving.  And beside him was the soldier who was his bodyguard, and behind him was the spouse of Setako and his spouse as well as four young children.  

Among those four young children you had three little girls, another boy who was an orphan and who lived in Nzirorera's house.  Those were the people I remember were found in that vehicle. 
Q.	Was his house servant in that vehicle?  Or is it still your testimony that he had no house servant? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I remember that Nzirorera had two house servants.  These were two boys.  And they remained in his Gishushu residence.  They didn't go on the trip with us to Setako's house.  Rather, they remained in Gishushu in Nzirorera's house, and they stayed with one soldier.  So I remember that we didn't have any domestic servants with us at the time when we left to go to 
Setako's house.  

I'm not fabricating anything here.  I am telling you things which I witnessed myself. 
Q.	So who is fabricating?  Setako's daughter?  She said she met Nzirorera, his family and housegirl on the morning of the 7th of April.  What do you say to that? 
A.	But if that person talked to you about a domestic servant, was it a girl or a boy, Prosecutor?  What I have to tell you is that when we left Nzirorera's residence, I was able to see the people who were on board and -- which is what I am telling the Chamber here.  I am telling you that I was there, and I am talking to you about what I noticed. 
Q.	So we can say that all the ten seats in the car were occupied, weren't they? 
A.	I did not check to see if all the seats were taken, Prosecutor.  I just talked to you about the people who were found on board that vehicle as I recall.  But I did not check to see if all the seats were taken or not.  People boarded a vehicle, and the person who could find a seat would sit.  But I didn't give a thought to check to see if all the seats were taken or not.  

I described to the Chamber the people who were on board, and it is incumbent upon you to check if all the seats had been occupied by the people I identified. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, my understanding is that a 4-wheel drive would only have ten seats if you have to dispense with the luggage space.  Am I correct? 
A.	What you're saying is correct, and Nzirorera did not have luggage, so there was no luggage in the vehicle he was driving. 
Q.	You mean there was nothing for the kids, no luggage, no clothes.  Is that your evidence? 
A.	Yes, indeed.  At the time we were leaving we didn't take any luggage along because it was panic everywhere. 
Q.	And, Mr. Witness, now, you know Élie Sagatwa, don't you? 
A.	No, I don't, but I have heard about him.  People said that he was an army officer. 
Q.	If I could assist you, he was an influential figure in Habyarimana's government, his private advisor.  And he was also a victim of the plane crash.  Does that assist you? 
A.	Yes, I heard it over the radio after the crash of the plane.  But prior to that I had heard that he was an officer in the army and that he was one of Habyarimana's bodyguards. 
Q.	So you knew that he lived very close to Setako's house, didn't you? 
A.	Listen carefully.  I did not live in Kigali.  When I completed my education in the USSR, I went and worked in************, and I don't know in what neighbourhood people lived in Kigali. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 
A.	And I don't know what relationship there was between people in Kigali. 
Q.	Now, Witness, you have mentioned that there were several roadblocks on the way to Mukingo.  Who were manning these roadblocks, Witness? 
A.	With respect to the roadblocks, I recall, within the city of Kigali, in Nyabugogo there was a roadblock that was manned by both soldiers and civilians.  In Gitikinyoni you had both civilians and the military as well on the roadblocks.  

And as I was going through after the vehicle in front had opened up the road, I wasn't a very good driver, and I wasn't paying much attention to what was happening on the side of the road, but I believe that I did see the Nyabarongo roadblock that was manned by soldiers when we were about to enter Gitarama.  I did see it because the military soldier -- the military vehicle had just turned back.  

But as for the other roadblock, it was manned by civilians.  I'm only talking to you about events I was eyewitness to. 
Q.	These civilians were armed, weren't they? 
A.	We did not stop for me to take proper note of who was armed and who wasn't.  I told you that I'm not a good driver, which means that I had to focus on driving.  You had accidents here and there.  I didn't have the chance to look outside.  I was focused on the car.  I didn't -- I didn't get the chance to look on the side of the road along the trip.  And remember that I was in the middle of the convoy, and when we arrived the roadblock I would quite simply drive on. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, the evidence we have in this trial is that the convoy was moving slowly, that these cars were moving bumper to bumper.  What do you say to that? 
A.	While we were still in the city of Kigali, as there were many vehicles that were leaving Kigali and there was only one road, it is true that there were many vehicles, and since there were roadblocks, the vehicles were not driving at high speed. 
Q.	So you must have been driving slowly.  And the civilians, you could see that they were armed, didn't you? 
A.	I didn't see that.  For you to be able to notice these things, you need to have stopped.  I was in the middle of the convoy.  We did not stop at the roadblocks, although we slowed down.  And as I was behind in the convoy, every time that the roadblock was opened I went through.  And I told you that I focused on my vehicle because I wasn't very good at driving. 
Q.	When you slowed down, did people appear to recognise Nzirorera's car? 
A.	While we were in Muhima at -- exiting Kigali, I didn't get a feeling that people recognised Nzirorera.  And since we did not stop, I didn't see people approach us.  Every time that the road was open, the soldiers asked us to go through very swiftly. 
Q.	You didn't see him exchange pleasantries to those manning the roadblocks, did you? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, when we left Setako's residence around Muhima, there were so many gunshots and bombs flying here and there, dust all over, and I didn't notice any such conversations.  Every time the roadblock was open, the soldiers asked us to go through quickly, and we went through in a haste. 
Q.	All of the four children at the back of the truck, they must have been shocked.  Wouldn't they have been?  
A.	Yes, that is understandable.  We were at war, and so those children must have been scared. 
Q.	And, Witness, it seems you did not travel with the********, because the **********is saying something different.  He said he heard Mr. Nzirorera talking to those manning the roadblocks.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I did not witness any such thing.  If the *********stated that, I can't tell how he got to see it.  What I am telling you is what I saw, and I was the one who was driving.  If, for instance, the doctor was able to see Nzirorera, well, I can't understand how he could have seen things I didn't see.  I believe it wasn't the truth. 
Q.	Okay.  Witness, now we move to the way to Gitarama.  Did you stop at Kabaya centre?  There was evidence in this trial that there was a breakdown of one of the cars.  Did you stop at the Kabaya centre? 
A.	You need to know that Kabaya is in Gisenyi and not Gitarama.  We left Kigali and we went to Gitarama.  We took the road between Gitarama -- from Ngororero, Mukamira.  And Kabaya is located within Gisenyi.  Do you mind if I carry on?
Q.	Witness, there is a (microphone not activated).  That's the one I'm talking about.  
A.	I don't know any Kabaya in Gitarama.  Kabaya is found only in Gisenyi. 
Q.	And you also stopped at the OPROVIA office, didn't you, in Gitarama? 
A.	I recall that we stopped at fueling stations in Gitarama as we approached the entrance to the city to buy fuel at a station.  That is the only stop I recall.  I no longer recall if we stopped at the OPROVIA.  We stopped, people alighted from the vehicle.  I don't remember if Ignace went to the OPROVIA.  As a matter of fact, I didn't know where OPROVIA was found.  In any event, I remember that we stopped at fueling stations. 
Q.	And you saw dignitaries there, government officials, didn't you? 
A.	I didn't know them.  I didn't know the people who lived in Kigali, to tell you that I met such and such a personality.  

No, we didn't stop in Mukamira.  Rather, we stopped at Kabaya.  We did not stop at Mukamira.  We carried on our way to Rwankeli in the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Witness, can you repeat your answer, please, about Kabaya.  What did you say about Kabaya? 
A.	I said that we stopped at Kabaya to wait for people who had lagged behind.  The pickup had lagged behind.  We left Kabaya to go to Rwankeli in the Mukingo commune.  That's what I recall.  Subsequently, the convoy was no longer a compact unit, as it was in Kigali. 
Q.	So you did stop at Kabaya and you did stop at Gitarama.  Am I right? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So somebody -- so only a person in your convoy would have known this detail:  The number of people you travelled with, the people you travelled with, the vehicles you travelled with, the places you stopped at.  Only a person who travelled with you would have known this.  Correct? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecutor, I did not understand your question.  I didn't understand it well enough to be able to provide answers.  
MR. NIMY:  
Mr. President, I don't want to interfere in the cross-examination of the Prosecutor, but I have the feeling that there is some confusion because he is talking about Kabaya in Gitarama.  That is a bit of a problem, Kabaya in Gitarama.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Let the Prosecutor clear it up. 
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	Witness, now let's move to Mukingo, and that's going to be my last line of questions.  

Mr. Witness, as you approached Mukingo, wasn't it obvious to you the devastation, the destruction of properties and the killings?  Wasn't it obvious to you as you entered Mukingo? 
A.	Very well.  When we reached Mukingo it was already dark.  I went to Nzirorera's house, and I spent the night there.  The following morning I went to our home in our area, an area which I had not visited for a long time.  I hadn't been to that area for about seven years.  

But, although I didn't go to the centre to see that people's houses had been demolished, I would like to tell the Chamber that on the 12th there was calm except for the fact that one could see roadblocks on the way.  

I believe that the trouble didn't last long in that area.  I am telling you what I saw on that day. 
Q.	So these roadblocks you saw, they were manned by civilians, weren't they? 
A.	But before I had noticed that the Mukamira roadblock was manned by soldiers.  But apart from that, all the others were manned by civilians. 
Q.	And that included the roadblock at Byangabo centre, correct? 
A.	We didn't get to the Byangabo roadblock.  We stopped before Byangabo.  To go to Byangabo you have to go past Nzirorera's residence. 
Q.	Witness, I mean for the time that you were in Ruhengeri, in Mukingo, did you see a roadblock at the Byangabo centre?  That's my question.
A.	I no longer remember precisely, but it's likely there was a roadblock at that location.  You know, I wasn't paying attention to roadblocks to audit them.  You are in your area, and people knew you, and no one stopped me at roadblocks for me to realise that there was a roadblock, but it is likely there was a roadblock at Byangabo.  

Are you following me, Counsel for the Prosecution?  People in your -- on your hill can stop you at a roadblock.  It is likely that there was a roadblock and that those roadblocks were erected at night.  But I do not remember precisely where roadblocks were located. 
Q.	What did (By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence was extracted and kept under separate cover) -- what did they tell you?  
MR. N'DOW:  
Your Honours, if we could redact.  It was a slip.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We redact the relationships mentioned in the last question.  
MR. N'DOW:
Most obliged, Your Honour.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	What did they tell you? 
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, those young people, because at the time they were, indeed, youths, I didn't pay attention to their conversations while we were in the house.  There wasn't any special discussion between those youths and myself.  We're not age mates.  

When we reached Rwankeli in the Mukingo commune, I went to my *********** house in the Nkuli commune.  And from time to time I would visit Nzirorera's residence, which was about 800 metres away.  And after those visits I would return to my ************* at Nkuli. 
Q.	Did anyone tell you...(microphone not activated) 
A.	Yes, my neighbours told me about it.  They actually mentioned the names of people who had been killed.  There were Tutsis who lived not far away from the parish. 
Q.	Did they tell you who the killers...(microphone not activated)  
A.	Counsel for the Prosecution, I didn't ask about detail.  I wasn't there to conduct an investigation.  
But -- and considering the prevailing situation, such questions did not have to be raised as people were scared.  When you have disruptions like that, you don't go and ask who killed who. 
Q.	Would it surprise you, Witness, to know that people you had a close relationship with have admitted to carrying out these killings? 
A.	If those people acknowledge those facts, I'm not surprised.  If someone acknowledged what happened, well, that is their business.  But they didn't tell me.  Nobody told me that "I went and killed such and such a person."  They didn't say so to me. 
Q.	You were at Nzirorera's house for almost a week, and then you moved to your ************* house where you continued to visit Nzirorera.  Can we agree that he was present in Mukingo for the first two weeks of your arrival there? 
A.	No, that is not correct.  He lived 800 metres away from my ********** residence.  In the morning I would trek to my mother's house.  And remember that at a time when I was living Cyangugu, to go to our area I went there to visit my*********.  I hadn't gone to settle at Nzirorera's house.  I continued to live at my ************** house.  

I did not have friends.  And people used to tell me, "Be careful, stay indoors.  People no longer have a good relationship."  And when I left my *********** house, I trekked to Nzirorera's house, and then I returned to my ********** -- to Nzirorera's house, and then I returned to my ********** house until the time when we went to Gisenyi. 
Q.	So how often, Witness, did you see Mr. Nzirorera in Mukingo at the time when you were there? 
A.	I can't tell you -- I can't tell you how many times I saw him.  I did not take the time to count the number of times I met him.  Sometimes I went over to his home.  I would meet him.  Sometimes I would get there and he was absent.  So it's not easy to cite the number of times I met him.  

I hope you get me, Mr. Prosecutor.  I did not count the number of times I met him and the number of times I met him at his home.  I was not supposed to go to his home and check whether he was there or not.  This is a family that I visited from time to time.  
Q.	So you must have visited him several times.  
A.	As news about the family, and that was it. 
Q.	So you must have discussed with him about the killings, didn't you? 
A.	At the time Nzirorera was not my age mate.  We were not of the same official rank.  This was a high-ranking official.  I was a young civil servant.  I was a young kid.  And he just considered me as a young man, and that was it. 
Q.	But you can confirm that you saw him on several occasions, can you? 
A.	Yes.  When I went to his home, on some occasions I would find him at home, but on other occasions he would be absent.  That is all I can say. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you present in Mukingo when Noheli Ndayisaba was shot?  Were you present? 
A.	I don't think I was in Mukingo, because had I been present I would have attended his burial.  I don't think that I was present. 
Q.	But you know that he was killed when he was found raping Tutsi women.  You know that, don't you? 
A.	I don't have those details, Mr. Prosecutor.  All I learnt was he had been killed, without any further details.  And I tell myself that whoever is caught pants down would be killed.  But all I know was he was killed. 
Q.	Witness, did you hear about the attack on the court of appeal, the Rwandese court of appeal, on or about the 14th of April?  Did you hear about this?  This was about two days after you arrived in Mukingo.
A.	Mr. Prosecutor, when I got to Ruhengeri I settled at my************.  Insecurity was rife.  And then there was the high risk of being assaulted by people who may take you for a Tutsi.  And so, considering that, I did all to avoid going up and down.  So I would go to Nzirorera's and spend some time there and go back to my ************* place.  And so, in fact, my aim, my wish at the time, was to return to my place of work. 
Q.	So why did you feel that you could have been mistaken for a Tutsi?  Why?  
A.	During this war period, popular opinion was it was Tutsis that were attacking the country.  But that said, Mr. Prosecutor, I am here as a witness, and my impression is you want me to talk to you or to give you my political analysis.  But I think you may be taking me a bit too far off tangent.  And I think that my testimony is very, very clear. 
Q.	But, Witness, it was obvious that Tutsi civilians had been killed.  Wasn't it obvious?  And that's why you said you wanted to stay indoors, to avoid being mistaken for a Tutsi.  
A.	Yes, unfortunately that is something which happened during the war.  This could have been avoided, but unfortunately it happened, and all we can do is regret that such killings occurred.  But I did not take particular interest in the political analysis of the situation at the time.  You know very, very well that which happened in Rwanda. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are an ******************************-- 
MR. N'DOW:
Oh, sorry, Your Honours.  It's just a slip again.

Q.	Mr. Witness, if I could just write a name for you.
MR. N'DOW:
With Issa's assistance, if this name could be shown to the witness.  
BY MR. N'DOW:
Q.	You know that person, don't you? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  I think you know the relationship between this person and myself.  And I would say I considered him as my*********************.  
Q.	That means you are********************************; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	And, Witness...(microphone not activated) that he was around big dignitaries who visited Nzirorera whilst he was in Mukingo.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Yes.  On one occasion during that period I met him at Nzirorera's.  And he was visiting the latter, and they were -- they were friends, and there was this family relationship that bound us together.  
Q.	And when was it? 
A.	And so we were part of the******************.  I can no longer recall the dates, but I already told you that when I went to Nzirorera's home, it was not to find out who was visiting him.  I would go there and I would visit him, and after that I went to my***********.  I already told you that I was not interested in politics, and so I did not take time to sit down and discuss with this person. 
Q.	What I want to know, Witness, is when?  Was it closer to the time when you went to Mukingo or closer to the time when you left Mukingo?  Can you clarify that? 
A.	We arrived Mukingo, and about the week after our arrival there, I met him at Nzirorera's. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, that concludes my cross-examination.  I must thank Your Honours for indulgence and your patience.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  

Is there any redirect?  
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  
MR. NIMY:
Yes, Mr. President.  Can you grant me permission?  I have just one question to put to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Certainly.  You may proceed.  
MR. NIMY:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Witness, just one question:  When you leave your residence to go to Nzirorera's and you leave your residence to go to your ********** -- I'm talking when you go from your ********* to Nzirorera's home -- do you go past Byangabo?  
A.	No, Counsel.  To go from Nzirorera's to my**********, all you do is cross the road.  And to go to Byangabo, you need to go in another direction on the way -- on the road that links Gisenyi and Ruhengeri.  Apart from that, to go from Nzirorera to my ********* residence, you just go across the road and you go -- you cover about 800 metres and you are there.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I have no other questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, that concludes your testimony.  We thank you, as we do all witnesses who are assisting the Tribunal with its work.  And you are now excused and you are free to go.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. NIMY:
Mr. President, I forgot to request your authorisation to enable the witness to meet Mr. Nzirorera.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar will make the usual arrangements for that.  
	(Witness excused)
MR. N'DOW:
Your Honours, I ask for the name written by the witness to be admitted and put under seal.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Admitted, under seal.  
MR. MJUI:
The number will be P. 441.  Thank you.

1015H 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Nimy, your next witness is being called?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes, Mr. President.  And the -- the next witness is W28, Mr. Semanza. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, while the witness is being brought in, perhaps I could offer a few comments and that may save us some time when he actually does arrive in the courtroom.  

I did have some conversations with Mr. Nimy, I believe it was on Monday, and followed up with an email exchange which was copied both to the Trial Chamber coordinator and Mr. Hometowu. 

This witness, Semanza, was originally scheduled towards the end of our session.  And what I indicated to Mr. Nimy was that -- that this constant changing in the order of witness appearance is starting to become a bit troublesome.  Usually witnesses come and they testify far beyond what is in their summary.  

We're not throwing up any hurdles at this point, but I just wanted to indicate to the Chamber that when Mr. Semanza completes his direct examination, we may request that his cross-examination be delayed until sometime next week, which is when he was originally scheduled to appear.  
It's not an issue at this moment.  

My suggestion is that we simply hear what he has to say and then I'll inform the Court what our position is at the conclusion of his direct examination.  

But I did want to take the precaution of alerting the Chamber to the discussions I have had with Mr. Nimy on this very issue. 
MR. NIMY: 
But, Mr. President, this matter is in the hands of the Trial Chamber, with respect to what the Prosecutor just said. 

It is true he raised this issue with me concerning the list of appearance of witnesses.  I replied him and I wish to point out again to the Trial Chamber that Mr. Semanza was scheduled to testify before your Trial Chamber on the 2nd, that is the 2nd of March.  And due to a number of circumstances which I explained to Mr. Webster and which he very well understood, this witness is appearing today. 

It is obvious that, given the time now, we can continue up to tomorrow with him.  And if I finish my cross-examination, it is the Trial Chamber to decide whether -- I'm sorry.  If I finish my examination-in-chief, then the Trial Chamber would decide whether we can continue or whether the Prosecutor can continue with his cross. 

I don't think it's a matter of principle to decide now, but I think it would depend on the unfolding of the session.  The pace at which we are going to work will determine a number of things, given that if we are ready to -- for Monday morning it could -- we could also be ready for tomorrow.  This -- the Prosecutor is aware that this witness is going to testify here and it is not a one-month period before he had to testify.  It is a matter of a day or so. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  Maybe we'll take that decision if and when it is necessary for us to do so. 

Good morning, Mr. Witness, Mr. Semanza. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I beg your pardon.  I am sorry.  I am not directly before you for you to see me.  But I wish to mention, as part of what I said yesterday, that there were three -- there are three defendants and their three Defence teams.  But for a problem in the channel of communication, we did not receive the email that my counsel -- my learned friend referred to a few minutes ago 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, maybe you should discuss this with your - with your colleague, Mr. Nimy.  I don't think that's an issue which the Trial Chamber needs to manage at this stage. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm not mentioning correspondences by Counsel Nimy.  I am simply referring to the fact that when there are discussions between Mr. Webster and the Defence, well, the Defence is made up of three Defence teams, and it is not fair that the Ngirumpatse Defence should be kept aside from any meetings or discussions between the Prosecutor and other parties in this trial.  And that's my wish because this has to do with -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Webster didn't say he spoke to the Defence.  He said he communicated with Mr. Nimy.  And it was open to Mr. Nimy to draw you into the conversation, if he wished to do so.  So your first line of communication is with him.  And I don't see anything that the Trial Chamber needs to manage at this stage. 

Now, Mr. Witness, before you begin your testimony you have to take an oath to tell the truth and the registrar will assist you to do that now.
(Declaration made by Laurent Semanza in Kinyarwanda) 

THE WITNESS:
I also thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Witness, you now commence your testimony.  You will do so by responding to the questions put to you by counsel.  You'll respond, first of all, to Mr. Nimy, representing Joseph Nzirorera. 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours. 
LAURENT SEMANZA, 
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN CHIEF 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Semanza.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	After having waited for a long time, a number of days, I want to believe that you are in perfect health this morning, Mr. Semanza; am I correct? 
A.	I am doing very well.  Thank you. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, I believe you have before you a personal information sheet in which you have your particulars.  Do you have that sheet before you? 
A.	No, Counsel. 
Q.	Will you kindly go through that sheet and verify the information it is carrying and ensure that the information regarding your -- your identity is accurate.  And in case there is anything which is inaccurate, let us know.  But if it is fine, then please write the date, 24th February 2010, and after that kindly append your signature to the document.  Have I made myself clear? 
A.	You certainly have, Counsel.  It is done. 
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I wish to tender that sheet in evidence as D. NZ760. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ760 admitted) 
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 

Well, Mr. President, my watch corresponds directly to the watch that we have -- to the clock in the Trial Chamber.  It is 10:30.  Don't you think we should take our 10:30 break, after which 
I'll begin -- begin my examination-in-chief?  

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we can do that.  We take our mid-morning recess now.  
	(Court recessed from 1030H to 1055H)   
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, we are going to move on with our examination-in-chief. 

So, Mr. Semanza, would you kindly describe to the Trial Chamber your academic background.  
A.	I went through primary school, after which I spent two years in secondary school. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, please, can you be a bit more precise each time you are answering a question.  Can you add dates and places so that we can have a big picture of your academic career.  
A.	I was born in 1944.  I attended primary school at the Rwankuba parish in the Kigali-rural préfecture.  I did the first year of my secondary school studies at the Zaza teachers' training school.  I failed.  I did the second year in the school of professions at Kicukiro in Kigali. 
Q.	And did you begin working after that, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	Yes, I began working. 
Q.	And can you tell us about this professional career? 
A.	In 1992, or rather, in 1962, I worked at the Kigali préfecture as a state agent, a state employee.  And in 1963 I was appointed accountant of the former Gahengeri commune in the Kigali préfecture. 

Then in 1969 I was appointed bourgmestre of the Bicumbi commune which had undergone a change in its denomination.  It was Gahengeri before but was varied to Bicumbi. 

And from 1969 to 1993 July, I worked as bourgmestre within that same commune. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, to summarise your professional career, I recall that from 1962 to 1993 you were a 
	civil servant, is that correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, tell this Trial Chamber briefly, how can you explain such a long spell at the service of the state? 
A.	Well, my longevity, this long spell at the service of the state, is that I created a climate of development and democracy for the préfecture which I worked for.  For me, that is what explains this length of time that I spent serving government in my career. 
Q.	And after 1994, what became of you? 
A.	With the advent of multipartyism, political parties demanded power-sharing and, unfortunately, I was one of those who were targeted to be replaced as a bourgmestre.  And that's how I lost my office as bourgmestre, and I began working as a trader until the dates we left on exile. 

But while I was involved in trade, in business, I was one of the leaders of MRND at -- at national and préfectoral levels. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, can you be a bit more precise, just to avoid any confusion.  Did you say you were one of those persons who were targeted?  What do you mean exactly, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	You -- you -- you got me right.  You understood what I said. 

Political parties organised themselves to recruit their members within the framework of what was called Ukubuhoza.  Within different communes nationwide, these political parties resorted to violence to chase out conseillers and bourgmestres from their offices.  And these political parties made false accusation against these conseillers and bourgmestres for having committed big blunders in their offices.  And some of them were violently thrown out of their offices. 

While it is true that I, personally, did not suffer any of this violent treatment, but we continued suffering from false accusations, and members of the population in my commune were whipped up against me.  I was in a commune which had many people.  And each party wanted to have a stronghold in my commune so as to have many terms of membership within their ranks.  Thank you. 
Q.	So, Mr. Semanza, when exactly did you leave Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda in the month of July 1994. 
Q.	And, very briefly, can you tell the Trial Chamber what you did?  Where did you go to thereafter? 
A.	I settled in a refugee camp in Congo.  At the time we were leaving on exile Congo was at the time known as Zaire.  Later on I left Zaire and settled in Bangui in the Central African Republic.  Later on I found refuge in Cameroon, where I was arrested and taken to the UN detention facility in Arusha. 
Q.	And when was this?  When were you taken to Arusha? 
A.	I was brought to Arusha in 1997.  I think it was in the month of July. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, were you tried in Arusha? 
A.	Yes, I was tried right here in Arusha. 
Q.	And what was the sentence? 
A.	The Appeal Chamber sentenced me to 34 years and six months' jail term. 
Q.	Were you convicted as a -- as a perpetrator of the accusations, or was it because you were in a high-ranking position above the perpetrators? 
A.	The Judges acted according to their consciences.  At one point, they are saying that I committed crimes, at other times they are saying I encouraged -- I incited people to commit these crimes.  And that is what the Judges slammed on me. 
Q.	And so at what stage is the trial now? 
A.	After sentencing me -- after my sentence, I began gathering evidence and proof to seek a retrial. 
Q.	And so where are you in these preparations to table further evidence?  What are -- what are you waiting for?  
A.	I am still at it.  I am working on it and I'm very close to getting to my objective.  But I cannot tell exactly when this will take place. 
Q.	Well and good, Mr. Semanza.  Whatever the case, I'll put a few questions to you and your prior -- prior sentencing does not disqualify you from testifying in this Trial Chamber. 

Now, Mr. Semanza, can you tell me, do you know Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I do know him. 
Q.	And what is the relationship between you and him? 
A.	While we were still in our country, Nzirorera was an official, a high-ranking official.  I, too, was one.  And on different occasions and in different locations we would meet within the purview of the work we were doing.  In addition, broadly speaking, he's a brother. 
Q.	And your relationship ends at your past working relationship and as a brother, even in the largest sense of the word, as you said? 
A.	My daughter was married by someone from Nzirorera's family.  Furthermore, we were old militants of the MRND party. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, before you strengthened your relationship with Nzirorera as far back as the marriage of your daughter and a member of his family, how did you meet him before that? 
A.	When I met him for the first time he was general manager of a service that was in charge of 
road construction.  And since the communes were poor and could not finance the construction of roads, I went to request help from him, as every leader of a commune would do.  My commune was particularly poor.  He helped me and he provided my commune with equipment and staff to do the work.  By so doing, he lent me a hand in the construction and maintenance of roads.  

And concerning water and electricity, when he was appointed minister of public works, I also went to his ministry, as many other people did.  And, given that water and electricity were under this ministry, I often went to seek his intervention, and he would help me, of course, according to the resources at his disposal within his ministry. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  Which -- that which influenced the growth of your relationship was the marriage between your daughter and a member of his family in 1994; am I right? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  But again, as you well know, when a young man goes to ask for the hand of a lady, he first of all begins by loving the young girl in question.  And with time, when the young man and the young woman are in love with each other, they inform the family and until they -- they carry out their engagement, they are affianced, and then the family agrees to -- to -- to bless this fiançailles between the two. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza. 

Now, I will back-pedal briefly to the moment of your departure on exile, particularly to Cameroon, and until the day you were arrested, were you in contact with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes, I used to meet him.  And when we went on exile, and even before our exile, we met in Gitarama.  We were taking care of refugees by looking for homes for them.  And we came together within the framework of the party to see how we could improve security conditions in the areas that were not yet affected by the war.  

And we also tried to reassure the war-displaced persons by welcoming them and trying to alleviate the burden of their pain. And so within the framework of these activities we met from time to time, rather frequently. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza. 

Mr. Semanza, were you in a joint criminal enterprise with Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Do you think that is possible?  We were entrusted with the responsibility of helping people, of advising people, guide -- providing guidance to people.  I could not, in any event, agree with Nzirorera to commit crimes.  But again, such a charge was levelled against me, and yet I could never do any such thing. 
Q.	Exactly, Mr. Semanza, I was getting to that. 

Were you accused of being part of a joint criminal enterprise with Nzirorera? 
A.	No.  I had nothing to do with Nzirorera.  He was not my neighbour.  I did not meet him, not even within the framework of the trial.  There was nothing that brought us together.  

It is true that there are some legal accusations which were presented, done and accepted, and the Prosecutor came up with this joint criminal enterprise between us.  But I never took any contact with Nzirorera for any such thing, be it Nzirorera or any other person.  I never agreed or allied with anybody to commit any crimes. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, was this charge not included in your indictment? 
A.	No.  Well, let's say yes.  This joint criminal enterprise is there in my indictment, but the name of Nzirorera does not appear in my indictment. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, can you tell us the political party within which you militated in Rwanda? 
A.	I was an MRND party member. 
Q.	And since when were you a member? 
A.	I was an MRND militant since 1975. 
Q.	And after the advent of multipartyism, did you remain within the ranks of the MRND? 
A.	Yes, I stayed with the MRND.  Well -- but while I was in office I was compelled to be neutral, since I was called upon to protect the interests of all political party members. 
Q.	Very well.  Mr. Semanza, I would like to ask you whether the name Abakozi or Dragon -- or Dragon or Réseau Zero, Network Zero, or Friends of the Alliance; does that ring a bell? 
A.	Abakozi is an ordinary word.  Even all the people who are here before us are Abakozi.  It's a word which refers to people who are working.  Of course I know what that word means. But the other names, words or expressions which you used are words which are found in -- which we found in 
newspapers, papers which I did not read, by the way.  This was used by a media which had its purpose to tarnish the image of officials in power.  These were newspapers, news media, that were of the opposition and who would work in the interests of opposition members. 
Q.	That name, Mr. Witness -- Mr. Semanza, corresponds to an organisation, apparently an organisation of which you were a member; what do you say to that? 
A.	No, I know nothing about it.  That is information which I have never heard about. This is the first time I'm hearing this. 
Q.	Did you not hear any talk about it when you were in Rwanda?  You never heard about this secret organisation while you were in Rwanda? 
A.	Not at all, at all.  Absolutely not. 
Q.	And during your own trial, were you not reproached for having been a member of such an organisation? 
A.	No.  Not even in my trial were any such things mentioned. 
Q.	Well, thank you very much. 

Mr. Semanza, where were you on the 6th of April 1994? 
A.	I was at my home at the Gahengeri secteur within the Bicumbi commune. 
Q.	In the interests of the Trial Chamber, can you remind us exactly what was the office you were holding; what were you? 
A.	At that time I was a trader.  I was involved in transportation. After I left the helm of the commune I was engaged in this business of transportation. 
Q.	And, Mr. Semanza, can you tell us how you learned about the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Towards 9 p.m. Radio Rwanda announced the attack against the aircraft that was transporting the president of the republic. That was around when I got this information. 
Q.	And what was your -- your reaction to this information when you heard about this? 
A.	Well, Counsel, you can imagine that for yourself.  I was very, very sad, like everybody who got this news.  But I, for one, was very, very sad.  And I still am sad until this day, because the events which ensued after this assassination struck -- rendered me sad, a sadness which fills me until this day. 
Q.	And did you stay indoors? 
A.	Yes, I stayed at my home.  And I left my residence -- I fled from my residence on the 8th of April 1994.
(Pages 15 to 22 by Mark Mac Artain)






1130H 
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	And where did you flee to, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	I went towards Gitarama. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Semanza, briefly, tell the Trial Chamber -- things were very, very tumultuous at the time.  What pathway did you use to go towards Gitarama? 
A.	Because many had infiltrated the country and because I was one of those who were wanted by the infiltrators and they had reached our region, I got information, pointers, which told me that an attempt was going to be made on my life.  And when infiltrators hit my home -- they attacked my home -- I fled in the night -- by night, and I spent the night at the office of the commune where there were armed policemen who protected me.  

And the next day I continued on my way going via Bugesera and the Muhira commune in the Butare préfecture.  And by so doing, I went right as far as Ruhango in the Gitarama préfecture. 
Q.	When did you arrive Gitarama, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	I arrived Gitarama on the same day, on the 8th of April 1994, around 9 p.m. 
Q.	(No interpretation) 
A.	Yes.  I remained in Gitarama up until late May.
Q.	And did you meet Nzirorera during that time? 
A.	Yes.  We met.  Subsequently, I went to Murambi centre where the government was, and I also found refuge in the houses that were around the Murambi centre, which allowed me to meet Nzirorera. 
Q.	When exactly, Mr. Witness? 
A.	As from the 12th I met Nzirorera now and then, when he was not on mission or when he wasn't visiting Ruhengeri.  I also recall that we also had a chance to make a trip together to Kigali. 
Q.	When was that, Witness? 
A.	I believe it must have been on the 9th of May.
Q.	We will get there.  Okay.  So you meet Mr. Nzirorera in Gitarama.  What did you discuss with him? 
A.	I didn't discuss only with him.  On some occasions we would hold meetings and discuss the security situation as well as the situation of the refugees who were joining us in Gitarama, whether they were inhabitants of Kibungo and those from Byumba who had already started to flee as from 1991.  That crowd was moving towards Gitarama, and we had to examine ways and means of lodging those people as well as how to feed them.  And it was a challenge because the number of refugees was increasing by the day.
Q.	And as far as you can recall, when did Nzirorera leave Gitarama? 
A.	Nzirorera used to leave, but he would return after some time.  He didn't stay in Gitarama 
in -- continuously.  He -- he normally moved to Ruhengeri, his native area, or to go to Gisenyi, but then he would come back to attend meetings which -- to which he had been convened.  
So he was not permanently resident in Gitarama.  And as we speak, I am in no position to tell the Chamber on what dates he was found in Gitarama or the dates on which he was away because he didn't stay in Gitarama continuously. 
Q.	But, Mr. Semanza, maybe I should ask you to tell the Trial Chamber if Nzirorera went along with your family to Mukingo from Gitarama.  
A.	Yes.  That is indeed correct.  Nzirorera met me in Gitarama when we were in a difficult situation.  We had practically nothing, no money.  All I had were the clothes -- I had the clothing I had on my back.  He helped me and took all my relatives to Ruhengeri.  

And I remained in Gitarama to await my vehicle which had gone to Gisenyi and which I had not been able to locate until then.  But when I was informed by other drivers that my driver was still alive, I had a message sent to him that he should come and meet me in Gitarama. 
Q.	And, Mr. Semanza, when he left with your family to Gitarama, what date was that?  If your memory serves you well.  
A.	It was after the 12th.  I don't recall the exact date.  But it was after the 12th.  What I mean is the 12th of April. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	I will put it in late April.
Q.	And when did you see him again after he had left in late April -- around late April to Mukingo? 
A.	I believe that he returned to Gitarama, because that is where the government was.  That is where all decisions were taken.  So he came back after a number of days. 
Q.	So if we are in late -- if we are in late April and you state that he returned some days later, would I be wrong in inferring that this was in May?
A.	In any event, he returned before the trip we made together to Kigali.  And that trip to Kigali is the 
	only (inaudible) I have.  You know, these are events that happened over 15 years ago, and I can't recall all the dates today. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, this -- when did that trip to Kigali take place? 
A.	We undertook that trip on the 9th of May.
Q.	Very well.  Now, did you -- sorry.  Sorry.  Were you in Kigali around the end of May?
A.	No.  
Q.	Mr. Semanza, did you get to learn that a meeting with Préfet Renzaho allegedly took place in the Kigali-ville préfecture on the 30th of April 1994? 
A.	How -- how would I have learnt about what was happening in Kigali, Counsel?  
Q.	Witness, because a Prosecution witness stated to the Chamber that you and Mr. Nzirorera had attended a meeting on the 30th of April in the Kigali-ville préfecture.  That is why I'm putting that question to you.  What do you say about it? 
A.	Prosecution witnesses often tell lies.  And it is something systematic.  That is not true.  We did not attend a meeting which allegedly held at the Kigali-ville préfecture.  How could I have attended such a meeting?  I was not member of any council.  I had no official office at that préfecture.  So it is clear that I couldn't have attended such a meeting. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  Now, let us backtrack to this month of May, during which you saw Mr. Nzirorera in Gitarama.  That's it indeed.  You did see him in Gitarama in early May, according to what you stated.  
A.	Yes indeed.  
Q.	And you were together, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	Yes.  We met.  We were indeed together. 
Q.	I would like you to describe to the Trial Chamber what your -- what happened when you were together.  You met him on the 7th or 8th May 1994 in -- in Gitarama.  You are together.  What did you discuss, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	I recall that after the 9th of May, after we had returned from Kigali where I had gone to see in what state my houses were, to see if my houses had not been bombed and destroyed, Nzirorera was going there to see if he could also recover his lorry which was also in the Magerwa premises and which was loaded with fuel.  He also wanted to check the state of his filling station in -- where there was some money which had been abandoned on the 6th of April.  

And when we returned from Kigali, we held a meeting of the political bureau on the 12th and 13th.  And our objective was to replace some authorities who had disappeared.  And at the time I recall that a minister of the interior had not shown any sign of life and he had to be replaced.  The president himself had died and -- and he also had to be replaced.  So we held a political bureau meeting after the 9th of May.  
Q.	Now, Mr. Semanza, if you allow, I am going to state what you have made in a more methodical manner so that the Trial Chamber would understand it clearly, step by step.  Are you in agreement? 
A.	Yes, I am, Counsel. 
Q.	So, Mr. Semanza, on the 7th and 8th of May, you meet Nzirorera in Gitarama; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I believe that he had already returned from his Ruhengeri residence. 
Q.	Very well.  And you stayed together?  I had indeed asked you what you discussed when you were together.  Firstly, would you -- first of all, tell me, when you are together with Nzirorera, 
what did you -- what do you talk about? 
A.	We talked about the people's security as well as the security of the 
international -- international -- internally displaced persons who had met us in Gitarama.  

Further, Counsel, I would like to inform the Chamber that I didn't have discussions only with 
the -- Nzirorera.  We would exchange with several people generally, be they 
internally displaced people, to tell us what they had seen, be it members of cabinet -- cabinet who were with us.  We discussed to have a grasp of how to behave, considering the onslaught -- the war that was advancing towards us. 
Q.	And the following day, 9th of May 1994, did you meet Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  That is the day on which I travelled with him to Kigali. 
Q.	Did you remain in Kigali?  If you did, for how long?  
A.	We left on the 9th.  We tried to go -- to remove our vehicles from the Magerwa.  And there were -- and we used people who were playing the kamikaze to recover those vehicles, but they couldn't do it because there was gunfire shot from Mount Rebero targeting the Magerwa or the Rwandan general stores.  So we had to spend the night in Kigali.  Early, very early in the morning, we went to Gitarama to prepare for the meeting which we had to hold on that day. 
Q.	Witness, let us -- let us be methodical.  I apologise for interrupting you.  Now, we are on the 10th of May 1994; is that correct? 
A.	Yes indeed. 
Q.	And we are in Gitarama; right? 
A.	Right. 
Q.	Very well.  So what happened that -- that -- what do you do -- that is what you were about to say.  What do you do in Gitarama? 
A.	We had nothing to do.  I just told you that every time we tried to collect information people who were fleeing -- regions where fighting was ongoing told us what they had seen, and we tried to foresee what would happen the following day, taking into account the number of refugees who had joined us in Gitarama. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, the reason why I asked to know what you were doing is that I thought I heard that you were preparing yourselves for a political bureau meeting.  Is -- is that the case? 
A.	Yes, that is indeed the case. 
Q.	And on what date did that meeting hold in Gitarama? 
A.	I believe the meeting held on the 12th and 13th of May.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
From -- from the Kinyarwanda booth, Mr. President, would you like to instruct the people who are speaking close to the counsel to stop speaking, as the Kinyarwanda booth is unable to understand who is saying what. 
MR. NIMY: 
Interpreters, I apologise on behalf of the Defence team. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Nimy.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	So, Witness, you were talking about those preparations for the political bureau meeting that was expected to hold in Gitarama on the 12th and 13th of May 1994; is that it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, after that meeting you stayed in Gitarama when -- up till when, along with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I believe that Nzirorera must have gone on mission somewhere.  He didn't stay in Gitarama.  He went on mission somewhere. 
Q.	What about you? 
A.	I stayed in Gitarama because all the people who were living around the Kigali-rural préfecture had come to Gitarama to seek refuge.  And I tried to reassure them and help them to settle down and find food. 
Q.	And did you see Mr. Nzirorera again, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	I believe I met him once -- one more time, had he -- as he had come to -- to submit a report about his mission in Gitarama. 
Q.	What date was that? 
A.	I have no intention of telling a lie, so I am not going to advance any date.  But I know he returned to Gitarama to report about his mission. 
Q.	Thank you.  And you told me that you went to Gisenyi in early June.  Is it maybe mid-June; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did you stay in Gisenyi for the entire month of June?
A.	Yes, I stayed in Gisenyi. 
Q.	Didn't you go somewhere else at all in May?  Sorry.  In June?  
A.	Yes, you are correct.  In June I believe that I went to Ruhengeri.  This was for the 
oath taking -- the -- the swearing-in to office of Bourgmestre Kajelijeli. 
Q.	Really, Mr. Semanza?  How did you hear about this swearing-in ceremony of Mr. Kajelijeli? 
A.	Kajelijeli was someone I had known before.  Nzirorera as well had told me about it.  He told me that a date had been chosen for Kajelijeli to resume as bourgmestre.  And since it was 
Nzirorera's native commune, we went together to attend that ceremony. 
Q.	If you recall the date of that ceremony, would you kindly tell the Trial Chamber what it was.  
A.	I believe it was in mid-June, but I don't have a specific date.  But it must have been beyond the 
15th -- beyond the 15th of June.
Q.	Very well.  Now, Mr. Semanza, I would like you to describe to the Trial Chamber how that swearing-in ceremony took place.  
A.	We left.  And when we arrived, I was shown a guest of honour's seat.  The ceremony started.  Dancers danced.  Musicians played music.  The préfet started his speech.  Kajelijeli himself, who was becoming bourgmestre again, also made a speech.  

And the ceremony was limited in times, because it was in a war zone and we didn't want to receive bombs.  A reception was subsequently organised for the guests.  And after the reception we left. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, you talked about speeches that were made during that occasion; is that correct? 
A.	Yes indeed. 
Q.	Did Nzirorera take the floor for a speech during that ceremony? 
A.	No.  I don't remember him making a speech. 
Q.	After the swearing-in ceremony itself, did you all leave, or was there what is referred to as a cocktail reception?  Tell the Trial Chamber if there was any form of cocktail or reception ceremony.  
A.	Yes.  A reception was organised.  But it was a really short one.  Because there was that concern looming over everybody, because this was in a war zone and a shell could drop any moment anytime, there was an assembly of people anywhere.  So there was indeed a reception, but it was a brief one. 
Q.	And during this brief reception, were you close by -- were you close to Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes.  I was quite close to him.  I was nearby. 
Q.	And did you overhear him make any aggressive statements towards anyone -- towards anybody? 
A.	No; absolutely not.  To the best of my knowledge, he was conversing with his neighbours very normally, very naturally.  He did not stand up to make any speech whatsoever. 
Q.	Very good.  Mr. Semanza, permit me to ask you a question, a question to which I expect you to assist the Chamber in better understanding the situation that prevailed in your country after the advent of multipartism in 1991, 1992, 1993, and particularly in the confrontations which you of the MRND had with the other political parties in the opposition.  Did you get my question? 
A.	I did, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, after having laid that foundation, this is my question:  On a daily basis, you who were administrative officers, how did these things transpire between you, the parties in power, and the opposition parties, through the prime minister and you -- the prime minister and you -- people who were not of the same political party?  How do you witness this climate?  How did things unfold at this time?  Am I much clearer now, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	I think I got you.  I think I understand what you are referring to.  The political parties came together, and their aim was to get the MRND dissolved.  And this occurred as from 1991 with the advent of multipartism.  

Now, these opposition parties went on to put in place a strategy to recruit members across the nation.  These opposition political parties used every means to recruit members.  They left no stone unturned.  And they began by having political rallies which set out to sabotage MRND authority.  They would attack transport vehicles.  They would burn down -- burn wood and destroy work which had been done under the framework of community development, Umuganda.  

But when these political parties noticed that this method or strategy did not enable them to achieve their goal, they now resorted to kubohoza practices.  This practice known as kubohoza targeted the authorities who were vulnerable to them.  Members of these political parties would go to these officials, pull them out of office, and install authorities which were -- which they preferred, and begin clamouring that they had taken over the zone, the commune, or the secteur.  

And I -- for that I could give, for example, the Bicumbi commune where I was bourgmestre.  These political parties, these opposition parties, came together, and members of these political parties marched to the secteur office, bureau du secteur of Rubona, and they forcefully threw out the conseiller and replaced him with a PL militant.  And they asked members of the population to recognise the new authority which they had forcefully installed.  

But since the former conseiller had his own supporters, there was a clash.  And there was a confrontation.  And there was a skirmish.  And the new conseiller who had been forcefully put in office was also forced to leave the secteur office.  

Whenever a problem of this kind arose, members of these opposition political parties sought the intervention of the person in charge of the party at the préfectoral office, who in turn would seek the intervention of the prime minister, who was from the MRND.  And as a result, the prime minister 
would -- would contact the other administrative authorities or organs by telling them that there was disorder here or there.  And at the time the gendarmerie of Rwamagana who -- which covered the Bicumbi commune had to step in, and the gendarmerie noticed that the genesis of these skirmishes began with the militants of opposition parties.  

I can recall that one -- an incident of this kind occurred in the Rugende secteur.  The person in charge of the commercial centre had raised the MRND flag since he was a member of the MRND.  But by him there was a militant -- militant of the MDR party.  And this militant asked MDR party members to pull down the MRND flag.  And there were clashes there.  The gendarmerie section there at Kabuga had to step in to put an end to the -- to the fray or the violence which left two dead.  And I know that this incident was brought to the knowledge of the prime minister, who, in turn, stated that I was the one who had provoked that incident.  But unfortunately, I never received a copy of correspondences (sic) that were written at -- about that event.  

At the time the ministry of justice was in the hands of the PL -- was controlled by the PL and the -- a party which was under the -- the party which was under the ministry of justice would go out to carry out investigations.  And when the party noticed that it was nervous of its -- of the party who were causing these clashes, they would stop their investigations.  And so in the case of Bicumbi concerning these two incidents, the perpetrators or the authors were never prosecuted.  

So in a few words, we asked leaders from the other parties -- from our parties to remain neutral.  And in Bicumbi we asked leaders of political parties at communal level as well as the conseillers, and we invited the head of the gendarmerie of Rwamagana to come to a meeting.  And during that meeting we agreed that each time there is a clash, there is a confrontation between different political parties, the administration was supposed to seek the intervention of the gendarmerie, just to ensure that the militants of political parties did not accuse us of any biases or prejudices within the MRND.  And that was why the gendarmerie would intervene each time such incidents occurred.  And the party thereby intervened, and we always got to know that all these incidents were provoked by practices of kubohoza, which consisted in pulling out of office forcefully persons in office in order to put in place authorities that were in their favour.  

In Bicumbi I was forcefully thrown out.  And when I left that office, the -- there was a procedure for appointing a new bourgmestre.  And the political parties put in their candidacies, but the MRND, despite everything, carried the day after those elections.  And I recall that there were many exchanges between officials of political parties, opposition political parties as far as the prime minister, and the prime minister would inform the other structures.  But, again, all these correspondences were all meant to denounce the situation that was prevalent, because opposition parties always sought to provoke troubling -- trouble in the Bicumbi commune.  And opposition members had received grenades and were training themselves in handling these instruments, this equipment.  

And at a certain point in time, there was an explosion in which one of the members of the opposition lost his life.  And that was how the court had to step in.  And when this person who was -- when these persons who were training themselves to handle these grenades were arrested, they confessed that they were doing this in preparation of clashes in which they were going to fight against MRND militants.  So I think that -- on that occasion they were condemned -- they were sentenced to paying a fine.  And members of the opposition consequently put a temporary stop to this practice.  

When this party took over in Bicumbi, the chief of that party, again, began convincing most of the population that he was the only one capable of leading that commune.  But when the RPF arrived, the R -- the RPF shot this person in charge of MDR and which had always caused problems.  So in a nutshell, the opposition parties always tried to create havoc so as to be able to seize power, which hitherto was in the hands of the MRND. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza, for that long explanation.  Now, this leads me to put a simple question to you.  Mr. Semanza, with the advent of multipartism, can you tell us -- which occurred in 1991, '92, '93 -- the MRND which prior to that date was the only party in the country which was all powerful, was it the same MRND, the almighty party in Rwanda, even after the advent of multipartism? 
A.	No.  MRND accepted to power-sharing and even accepted to put -- to -- to do some repairs.  Within the framework of multipartism, the other parties were authorised to hold meetings.  And it was within that framework that M -- that MRND accepted that some of the bourgmestres be dismissed during elections or that they should be -- that elections should be organised so that -- political parties that could be elected would be able to occupy some of these offices.  And within that framework -- within the Butamwa commune, the bourgmestre of MRND was replaced by a MDR militant.  

And in other communes there were other bourgmestres from other political parties.  And it was the same case within the secteurs.  Some conseillers were from opposition political parties. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  And after the death of President Habyarimana on the 6th of April 1994 until the moment he went -- until the moment all the leaders of the former regime went on exile, did the MRND remain the all-powerful political party in Rwanda? 
A.	No.  From 1992 there was power-sharing among the political parties within the ministries, within the parastatal corporations.  And each time a leader of the opposition was appointed, he would recruit members of the opposition.  And that was the same pattern within the school system.  All inspectors were MDR militants.  

And at the ministry of agriculture, all the cadres were members of the opposition.  Even all the agricultural engineers of lower institutions were in the hands of the opposition.  

And whenever anyone from the MRND tried to cling to power, he was transferred very, very far away from his family.  And so MRND was forced to share power with the political parties in the opposition. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  Now, the last question along those lines.  Can you tell us whether the MRND had a -- a register, a vocabulary that was quoted and which was known only to its members.  Did they have any such of a vocabulary in use, the MRND? 
A.	No.  Initially, Rwandans all belonged to the MRND.  And when, with the advent of multipartism, some left MRND to militate within other opposition political parties, those who left in that manner already knew the principles of the MRND.  

And even if we had any vocabulary which was used uniquely by militants of the MRND party, you can understand -- you will agree with me that that would have been impossible, Counsel, because MRND had quite a big population within its ranks.  And so it would have been impossible to keep that vocabulary secret. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  Now, Mr. Semanza, do you -- do you know Setiba, Joseph? 
A.	Yes, I know Setiba. 
Q.	And can you tell the Trial Chamber who this fellow is.
A.	Setiba hailed from the Minazi secteur in the Rushashi commune within the Kigali-rural préfecture.  And I am of the Coko secteur within the Musasa commune and within the same préfecture of Kigali-rural.  Now, these are two bordering secteurs.  
And you can understand that I know the locality very well where Setiba came from because my aunt, my maternal aunt, was married in that locality.  And my parents usually sent me to my aunt's while I was doing my primary school studies.  And I know very well that region of Setiba -- or the period that Setiba lived close to the Baramba river, which was the limits between the Coko secteur and the Minazi secteur.  

In the eighties I learnt that the neighbours of Setiba in the -- that secteur of Minazi had forcefully chased him from the locality, accusing him of practising sorcery.  And so Setiba moved to Giticyinyoni, which is found in the periphery of Kigali town.  

When I installed myself at the Bicumbi commune, I usually saw him going to visit my parents.  And when Setiba arrived, Setiba continued his work as sorcerer and a crook.  He would use these practices to swindle money from all those who came to seek for his help. 
Q.	So, Mr. Semanza, the man that you just described and who, according to your description, shows that you know him rather well, was -- was he president of the Interahamwe at any point in time as he's préfet of the Kigali-rural préfecture? 
A.	I was the president of MRND in the Kigali préfecture -- Kigali-rural préfecture.  And I could not propose the candidature of a person like him, someone who was a crook, and now asking people to vote him to a post of responsibility.  

Even if he testified before this Trial Chamber that he occupied that position, I must tell you that that was a lie.  He would never had had the courage to present himself as candidate to that office.  And maybe I must tell you here that nobody else could have proposed him to any office if I were not -- if not me -- if I were not a leader at the Kigali-rural préfecture office. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Semanza.  And in the side of what you just said, did anyone whisper to you the idea -- the idea of-- maybe of -- even considering Setiba, Joseph as president of the 
Interahamwe -- Interahamwe there at Kigali-rural?  
A.	No.  I knew Setiba very well.  And nobody could have come to suggest to us the idea of him putting in his candidature to -- for that office when I knew very well that this was someone who did not have what it took to sit in that office.  I don't think he even knew how to read or write. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President -- Mr. President, I am virtually through with this witness.  And it will soon be 12:30.  And I prefer to suggest that we take our luncheon break so that I can take up another line of questioning eventually -- subsequently. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I may have misunderstood you.  I thought you said you were virtually through with the witness.  About how much more time do you anticipate?  Or was it just with a particular line of questions?  
MR. NIMY: 
Yes.  I am done with this line of questions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I think -- an enquiry to make.  I'd -- I'd like to know from Mr. Nimy how much more he intends to do with the witness.  My concern is that the testimony we've heard so far goes well beyond the summary.  And I mentioned the problems we might encounter when the witness was coming into the courtroom.  I think the best way of moving forward is actually to allow Mr. Nimy to complete his examination now if he only has a few more questions. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No.  He didn't say that.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Okay.
MR. PRESIDENT:
That must have been a mistake in the translation.  He said he's just finished this line.  He's about to move to a new line of examination. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
If it wouldn't be too much trouble, could we enquire how much longer he has with the witness for today.  Because they may impact on the recommendation we'd make on how we move forward with this witness or the one that would follow him. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

Mr. Nimy, do you have an answer?  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, if I must do that, I don't think I would go beyond 30 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you. 

We can take our adjournment now.  Yes.  We take the luncheon break now.
(Court recessed at 1231H)

(Court resumed at 1409H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  

Mr. Nimy, you can continue.  
MR. NIMY: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. NIMY:
Q.	Mr. Semanza, when we broke off, I looked at the clock and it was 12:30.  And as I wanted to respect the time commitments, I simply asked for us to suspend the proceedings at that time.  And so, I just want now to get some clarification from you as to what you said, so that I can be sure that I understood you properly when you answered my last question about Mr. Setiba.  Were there any Interahamwe at the Kigali-rural préfecture? 
A.	No, there was no organ or body of Interahamwe at Kigali-rural préfecture. 
Q.	Very well.  Now I have fully understood you.  Was it the MRND that could appoint Interhamwes?  Was that your testimony?  
A.	No.  No.  It was not the MRND that appointed Interahamwe.  You see, political parties recruited members and supporters, and these members included adults, young persons, men and women alike, who would join a political party of their choice, also, because some of the civil servants of the party were close to them.  But there was no status of Interahamwe as such. 
Q.	If I understood you well then, it was not you who appointed Setiba; is that correct?  I just want to understand.  
A.	I never appointed Setiba.  In principle, I am the one who was supposed to get someone to be elected to the head of the body within the préfecture, but that body was not yet in place, so I could not proceed to the election of an -- any individual whereas such a structure was not in place.  The party at the 
	national level had not recognised Interahamwe as having any particular status.  That is why I could not have appointed that person. 
Q.	Was Robert Kajuga appointed by the MRND? 
A.	I know Robert Kajuga in Kigali préfecture where he claimed to be somebody with national jurisdiction, but I'm not able to give you the details as to how he was appointed. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  You see, when we broke off, I had not fully understood what you had said.  Thank you for those clarifications.  

Now, let us move on to another line of questioning relating to adjudicated matters in your trial.  And 
this -- these are issues that have been brought into this trial by the Prosecutor.  

Mr. Semanza, it is stated that on the 13th of April 1994, at about 10 a.m., you led a group of persons to rape Tutsi women and then kill them.  One of the victims, whom we can refer to as A, was raped by a member of the group and his cousin.  And another victim, whom we can refer to as B, was taken outside and killed by two other members of the group.  What do you say to that, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	It is true that I was convicted on that count.  However, I believe that in due time, or in the future, the Prosecutor and those whom he called to testify against me -- well, it is our hope that the Judges will be visited from heaven so that they may understand that I -- although I was convicted, I still hope to be acquitted.  This matter was raised in my trial, but it was all predicated on lies, lies which the Prosecutor built on in order to win his case. 
Q.	Mr. Semanza, on a second set of facts, it is said that civilian Tutsis were killed at a church by soldiers and gendarmes and Interahamwe militia on the 13th of April 1994 at Musha church, and that you yourself participated in that attack, that you took the Interahamwe to that location to be involved in the attack and that you led the attackers to the location of the refugees for the said refugees to be killed.  What is your reaction to that, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	Once again, that is a crime for which I was convicted, but as time goes by, evidence is emerging to prove that I was convicted on the basis of lies.  

Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to tell you that one of those persons who claimed to have been with me has forwarded a number of letters to you.  I'm talking about Paul Bisengimana who was bourgmestre of Nikiro (sic) commune -- of Gikoro commune where the Musha church was located.  That person wrote to you over and over again requesting that you appoint an independent commission to conduct worthy investigations into the facts that he acknowledged because the Prosecutor had promised him gold and silver.  Now, later on when Bisengimana found out that he would not get 
gold and silver from the Prosecutor, he then began to write letters to you denouncing what he had already agreed to before the Prosecutor.  

This is evidence, Mr. President, that those who confess and enter guilty pleas do so because they have been misled and because they have been promised silver and gold.  And so they ultimately understand that they have been trapped when they were asked to recognise and acknowledge facts which they were not involved in.  

I can promise the Judges that in the near future it would be discovered that this state of affairs is untrue. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Semanza.  Another fact again is the following:  That in April 1994 attacks were launched against several -- in fact, most Tutsi civilians who had sought refuge at Mount Mwulire; is that correct?  And what do you say to that?  
A.	Well, the date is 18th of April 1994, and it is true that I was convicted for that crime because it was deemed that I was one of those who launched the attack on Mount Mwulire.  Yet, it was clear at the time that I had fled the RPF infiltrators who had sought to kill me.  And once again, this is another lie.  Witnesses have appeared before this Court, witnesses sent by Ibuka and working in collaboration with the Prosecution.  Those witnesses came here to lie when they said that I was present during that attack and that I, indeed, led the attack.  

The fact of the matter is that the attackers who fired on the victims say that I was not even present at that location.  So those witnesses who were misled by the Prosecutor made statements and testimonies that should not be taken into account.  And very soon we will understand and the entire world will know that those who set up this Tribunal were mistaken and that they had another agenda whereby we were being forced to hand over power to the RPF in Rwanda. 
Q.	On another point, another fact, Mr. Semanza, it is said that on the 12th of April 1994, you were armed and present during an attack on the Mabare mosque, which led to the death of about 300 
Tutsi refugees.  What do you say to that, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	I have said consistently that there is no distinction to be made between that count and the 
	previous counts.  These are counts or accusations that were motivated by false testimonies and in collaboration with the Prosecution.  It is our hope that when my judgement will be reviewed, witnesses will be called to testify that previous witnesses had lied.  And I'm afraid that this will tarnish the image of this Tribunal.  So once again, that conviction was predicated on lies. 
Q.	Very well.  On the 8th of April 1994, in the morning, it is again said that you met Rugambarara and a group of Interahamwe in front of a house in Bicumbi commune and that you said to the Interahamwe that one Tutsi family had not yet been killed and that no Tutsi should survive and you said that the Tutsis should be sought after and killed.  Mr. Semanza, what do you say to that? 
A.	Yes, indeed, those people died.  And those who killed them are in prison, having been convicted by Rwandan courts.  The said criminals provided the names of their accomplices, and these names -- of those who had ordered the persons to kill, these names do not include my name.  I did not give them any orders.  I had no authority over them.  And once again these are lies, lies upon which most of those who were convicted by this Tribunal were so convicted because of the said lies. 
Q.	Finally, Mr. Semanza, later on on, the same day, that is the 8th of April 1994, it is said that the Interahamwe searched through a farm near the residence of the family you mentioned.  They found the members of that family and killed them.  What do you say to that, Mr. Semanza? 
A.	Yes, those who assassinated the members of that family are available.  Some of them acknowledged the facts, some confessed, and they -- none of them ever mentions my name in relation to those killings.  And, again, they do not mention having seen me on the day on which the members of that family were killed.  And once again, that is a lie. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Semanza.  
MR. NIMY: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for Mr. Semanza, the witness, and that will put an end to my examination-in-chief.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Do any of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have some very short questions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may proceed. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Sabanza (sic) -- Semanza, I am one of Mathieu Ngirumpatse's counsel, and I would like to put a few very short questions to you for you to specify to the Chamber if what the Prosecution witnesses said is true, as far as you know, or if you challenge it.  
A.	Are you talking about witnesses who came and testified against me?  I don't quite follow your question.  
Q.	Mr. Semanza, I would like to explain the direction of the questions I'm going to put to you.  It is to 
	cross-check statements that have been made by witnesses in this trial.  For example, a Prosecution witness stated that you attended a meeting between June and September 1993 at the MRND headquarters in Kimihurura -- K-I-M-I-H-U-R-U-A (sic) -- in the presence of 
Mr. Rusjariye -- R-U-S-J-A-R-I-Y-E -- Mr. Mbonyinshuti -- M-B-O-N-Y-E-N-S-H-T-U (sic).  Do you recall having attended such a meeting? 
A.	That is not true, and I believe that that meeting never took place.  I didn't organise it, and I never organised a meeting in which the people you just mentioned attended. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Sorry to interrupt.  Would Mr. Weyl mind mentioning the pseudonym of the witness that provided that information.  
MR. WEYL: 
Of course, Counsel for the Prosecution.  It was Witness HH.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, according to Witness HH, you allegedly instructed Joseph Setiba to accompany him to a meeting in the Ngenda commune, in the Bugesera sous-préfecture, to introduce him to the people in the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse and Minister Faustin Munyazesa.  Do you remember having given those instructions to Mr. Joseph Setiba in 1993 after the election of Mathieu Ngirumpatse as present of the MRND?  
A.	I know a meeting which took place in the Ngenda commune, but as I said previously, Setiba was nothing.  He was not even an Interahamwe in the Kigali-rural préfecture.  He was nothing.  I couldn't have asked him to accompany me.  I was the MRND president in Kigali-rural, and he was a -- had no function within the MRND in that préfecture.  I know that he was a crook, a sorcerer, who used to scam people.  He had no means of meeting an authority -- any authority whatsoever. 
Q.	Quite simply, Witness, I wanted more specification.  Maybe you could just stick to just answering my questions.  According to that witness, you allegedly took Setiba to a meeting during which Mr. Karera and Mr. Ngirumpatse allegedly attended in the Rushashi sous-préfecture after July 1993.  Do you remember having taken Setiba to any such meeting in Rushashi, which allegedly was held in the presence of Mr. Ngirumpatse and Mr. Karera?  
A.	After July 1993, we could no -- not hold meetings any longer for security reasons.  As a matter of fact, RPF -- the RPF had increased its number of attacks, and for that reason, we couldn't move about and assemble people in view of holding a meeting.  It was a risk.  We couldn't do that.  And as I stated previously, Setiba is a native of Rushashi, but the people of that locality chased him out because of sorcery.  So I couldn't have taken him to a commune from where he had been chased away because of his sorcery.  
Q.	Witness, a last series of questions, which are specific in nature.  According to one Prosecution witness, on the 4th of July 1994, you allegedly were present at the Méridien Hotel Izuba in Gisenyi; is that correct? 
A.	We had not started to flee.  The president of the republic had not yet been killed, and I was still in my commune.  What could I possibly have gone to do in Gisenyi?   
Q.	Witness, do you know one Juvénal Uwiminimana -- U-W-I-M-I --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The English booth could not get the spelling. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Before we move on, with respect to the last question and answer, what we heard in English was 
that -- a question about the 4th of July 1994 and a meeting in a Hotel Méridien in Gisenyi.  I'm wondering if that's what the witness heard as his question, because his answer doesn't really make sense to me under the circumstances.  So if Mr. Weyl could ask that question and get a clarified response from the witness, and if Mr. Weyl could also tell us where this information is coming from, the pseudonym of the witness that provided us that information.  
MR. WEYL: 
In response to the Prosecution's objection, the witness's pseudonym is Witness GOB.  As for my question, it was related to the presence of the witness on the 4th of July 1994 at the Hotel Méridien in Gisenyi.  
THE WITNESS: 
Ah, did you say the 4th of July?   
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	1994.  
A.	Yes, that's correct.  Yes, I had sought refuge in Gisenyi -- in Gisenyi, but I no longer recall if I was in Hotel Méridien Izuba, but on that date I was a refugee in Gisenyi.  I am sorry.  I made a mistake.  Yes, it's true, we had fled on that date. 
MR. WEYL:
I would like to thank Mr. Webster for assisting us to get that clarification.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, let me ask my question again.  You confirmed to me that you know Mr. Juvénal Uwilimana? 
A.	Yes, I do.  I know him, Counsel.  
Q.	Do you recall having met Juvénal Uwilimana on the 4th of July 1994? 
A.	No, I don't believe I met him.  We had fled, but I can't tell if I saw him or if he saw me.  I don't believe that we met.  No, I don't believe so. 
Q.	Witness, do you recall around the 4th of July 1994 you said to Juvénal Uwilimana that Mathieu Ngirumpatse wanted to see him? 
A.	No, not at all.  Uwilimana was a native of the Kigali-ville préfecture.  I know him very well.  Before the Kigali-ville préfecture and the Kigali-rural préfecture were split, at the time when both were one and the same préfecture, we would attend meetings together.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, I believe that the answers that you provided are complete with respect to the questions that I asked you, and maybe I would like to thank you for the manner in which you answered these questions in a very terse manner.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have concluded my cross-examination.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Now, Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to the Prosecutor who will have an opportunity to cross-examine you now.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, Your Honour.  I actually have an application and a recommendation, as I had alluded when we began with this witness.  The switch in the order of appearance for the witnesses has put us at a disadvantage and my suggestion -- or I'll characterise it as an application -- is that we conclude today and pick up tomorrow with this witness and the Prosecution would be able to start its cross-examination tomorrow morning.  

I have gone over this issue with Mr. Nimy.  I don't know if it really requires more extensive discussion before the Chamber.  I could certainly offer my reasonings and be more elaborate, but I think the Chamber is aware that we've had more witnesses this session and there has been constant readjustments in the order of their appearance.  So I think that would be -- the best solution is to simply adjourn today and pick up tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you need to cross-examine this witness?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
If we start in the morning, I think we certainly would be finished before the end of the day.  I would think we'd be finished by midday.  I can't make that guarantee, but it's not a long cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Webster, this witness has been on the witness list for a very long time.  He is very well known.  His testimony is well known to you.  We just have 45 minutes.  You must have done some preparation.  You certainly could use the time this afternoon to guarantee a completion of his cross-examination by midday tomorrow.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, we could probably put 45 minutes to good use, but we don't have exhibits lined up, we don't have things reproduced, and we'd like to make an examination that's well organised and efficient.  We don't want to really do this by the seat of our pants.  We can certainly make an undertaking to the Court that we'll finish by the end of the day tomorrow.  I'm not sure -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How long did this witness last in examination-in-chief?  
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Your Honours, the examination-in-chief lasted two hours, four minutes.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm not sure if there is any other Defence witness available tomorrow.  That's another practical consideration. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, we have a list of witnesses for the Defence.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
We all have a list, Your Honour.  But I've been speaking to Mr. Nimy on a daily basis about the witness line-up.  The next witness, as I understand it, is Setako, who may be commencing his testimony on Monday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but Setako is not the only -- if Setako cannot give his evidence tomorrow, there are other witnesses that the Defence could bring on tomorrow.  Setako is not the only witness that's been listed.  And this witness list has been published for a very long time, since last year.  So you knew since last year that this witness was going to testify during this session. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
We did not know that this witness was going to testify this morning, Your Honour.

MR. PRESIDENT:
But that is how trials go.  That is how trials -- you can't expect that the -- if this witness is scheduled to testify next week, on Monday next week, you said you were going to start your preparation for cross-examination after today that you have not been prepared up to now?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
It's not a question of starting the preparation but it's a question of pooling all the materials together, and the Prosecution deserves just as much courtesy from the Defence as was extended to them during 
	the --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, you cannot say that, because there have been several occasions during your case where you adjusted the order of your witnesses when emergencies arose.  And you knew earlier that this was going to happen when Mr. Robinson was not available this week, just as we knew, I knew, more than two weeks ago that this was going to happen. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, the Prosecution did not know that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And we understand that you were copied the correspondence that our coordinator received. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
The last correspondence we received was that the next witness was going to be Setako and this witness would be appearing next week.  And that's the information we received a week and a half ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but you will receive information when Setako's judgement is going to be delivered and that he was going to testify after that.  And you were copied to the correspondence that the coordinator received.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes.  And there was Rutaganda and Rugumire and several other witnesses that were supposed to testify before Setako, and this witness was scheduled to testify after Setako.  We're only talking about 
40 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know, but you are now trying to manage how the rest of the session goes.  And if we do this now, we're going to lose much opportunity. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honour, I thought I was trying to assist the Chamber and Mr. Nimy in organising how we move forward.  When I first discussed this with Mr. Nimy, my suggestion to him was that he call his 
	next witness and that we deal with the cross-examination of this witness next week, which is how the Court handled the similar situations during the Prosecution case, where we heard the 
direct examination of witnesses and then interrupted them and took the cross-examination at a later time.  I thought we were being considerate of Mr. Nimy and his difficulties in getting witnesses by saying, "Let's just do it tomorrow morning," because when I first raised the issue with him, that's the position I was going to take on behalf of the Prosecution. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Personal convenience is not the only interest that we have to consider in these matters.  We are interested in the way -- how the proceedings are conducted as well, and we have interests as well. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Well, if there is another Defence witness available --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, why would you need more than two hours to cross-examine this witness?  Suppose we granted your application to start the cross-examination tomorrow.  Would your cross-examination be completed before -- you know we're adjourning at 12 o'clock tomorrow. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yes, I do.  The reasonable explanation -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would the -- would the cross-examination be completed by the time we adjourn at midday?  
MR. WEBSTER: 
That's our objective, and that's what we expect to happen, but I don't want to commit to that because it may take longer than the two hours but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Three hours and 15 minutes.  12 o'clock is three hours after we start.  That's longer than two hours. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Okay.  Well, that should be fair.  I wouldn't expect it go beyond that.  But at the same time, it depends on how the witness is answering the questions.  But our assumption and our objective is that we'll be finished by lunchtime tomorrow at 12 o'clock when we adjourn. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you'll be finished before 12 o'clock to enable any re-direct.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Yeah.  That seems -- that seems like a reasonable projection, Your Honour.  So we're all in favour of that.  The only caveat I make is the one I make consistently, which is that nothing is guaranteed, but that's certainly what we'll try to achieve finishing in time to allow for the re-direct so that the witness is discharged by the time we complete the morning session at 12 o'clock.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, Mr. Webster.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Thank you.  Thank you very much, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the adjournment now.  
Mr. Witness, I remind you, as I'm sure you know, that during this adjournment while you are on the witness stand you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.
(Court adjourned at 1453H)
