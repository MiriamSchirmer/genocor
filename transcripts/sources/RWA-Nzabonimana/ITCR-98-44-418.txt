P R O C E E D I N G S 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The Trial Chamber would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year.  

And the Accused is in court?  Okay.  It's a strange court, so we are trying to get acclimatised to -- to the configuration here.  

So could we have the appearance of the parties, please.  
MS. MAPOSA:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  Happy New Year to you.  

Representing the Prosecutor are the following persons:  Memory Maposa, Simba Mawere, 
Diana Karanga, and two interns, Roy Kiarie and Nicola Averell. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

Could we have the appearances for the Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  I am also acclimatising to the new equipment.  

My name is Philippe Larochelle.  I'm the co-counsel for Mr. Nzabonimana, who is here on my left.  
And I'm accompanied this morning by Célestin Kagango, who is an investigator in this team.  
Madam Nathalie Leblanc is our new legal assistant.  And behind me, Mr. Erick Sullivan is an intern in our team.  He will be assisting us during the Defence phase of this trial.  

And on behalf of my whole team I would like to extend to the Bench and to my colleagues on the Prosecution side my wishes for a very Happy New Year.

Thank you, Madam President 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.

We would like to propose that we start with the scheduling of this trial.  

As you all know, this trial is scheduled to commence on the 29th of March -- to recommence on the 29th of March this year.  However, two of us are involved in another case which is ongoing, and that is the case of Ngirabatware.  

Depending on how things evolve in that case, we may or may not have to postpone the beginning of this trial, because we have to finish the trial of that case first -- the Prosecution case first in that case before we proceed with the Defence in this case.  

So, therefore, we have drawn up a tentative programme which we hope will suit counsel, and we propose to go on with the Ngirabatware case until the 31st of March this year at the latest.  

If that is the case, we then have to postpone the beginning of this trial to the 12th of April of this year and sit through this case until June the 5th, 2010, with a tentative break between the 
26th and the 30th of April to allow one of us to undertake a prior commitment.  So we thought that we should give you this information first and hear what you have to say.  But this is what is proposed.  

Counsel, you may now react. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, your schedule sits well with the Prosecution.  We have no problem with that at all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
The Defence as well, with the reservation that I will have to verify with my lead counsel, Courcelle-Labrousse.  But there are two of us.  And, as far as I'm concerned, on the Defence side -- if that -- if those dates become the final dates for the Defence, then we will abide by those and be available for the Chamber to proceed during these dates. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We are sorry that we can't make a definitive -- we cannot make it definitive whether we start on the 29th or we start on the 12th.  It all depends on how the other trial unfolds.  And so we will keep it tentative for now and we will inform the parties in a timely fashion if and when we are not able -- or not able to stick to the original statement.  So thank you very much, Counsel.  

We will now proceed with the pre-Defence conference.  So this conference is being held in accordance with Rule 73 ter of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of this Trial Chamber.  

We have been informed that the Defence has filed a pre-Defence brief in French comprising of a 
list of witnesses and the facts upon which the witnesses will testify.  We are also informed that some other information has been given in this pre-Defence brief.  We are yet to see the English translation of this pre-Defence brief, but the Trial Chamber is following up this matter with the language section.

What we would like to know from the parties is the following:  Are there any admissions by the parties and any statements of other matters which may not be in dispute?  

Defence Counsel?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, the Defence has made admissions before the trial began.  On our side, we have not solicited any admissions from the Prosecutor because the evidence we intend to put before the Chamber goes to disprove and refute allegations which the Prosecutor has made.  So we may -- we have -- there will be an expert for the Defence.  Once the expert report has arrived and is ready to be filed, we may solicit some admissions regarding the sources and some facts that are relevant to the expertise.  

But apart from that, on the Defence side, we have no -- we cannot announce that any admissions or any facts have been omitted so far. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution, any comment?  
MS. MAPOSA:
No comment, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  The Trial Chamber takes note of the submission of counsel for the Defence on this matter.  

Is there a statement of contested matters of fact and law?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, as we indicated in the pre-Defence brief, all the allegations made by the Prosecution witnesses are contested and the legal conclusions that are drawn from these facts as well.  

So, as far as we are concerned, I would have vigilantly denied all the allegations that were made by the Prosecution witnesses.  That would be -- that is in essence what our pre-Defence brief states. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Prosecution Counsel, any comment?  
MS. MAPOSA:
None, Your Honours. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, let's now move on to the witness list.  We are made to understand there has been filed a witness list.  And we are given to understand that it contains pseudonyms for each witness and summarised facts in the indictment -- summarised facts on which each witness will testify with regard to the indictment.  

Defence, how many witnesses do you intend to call?  We need this matter to be clarified because it's not clear to us from the documents which you have filed. 
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Well, I would answer to that:  As many as the Chamber would allow.  But if I may comment on the 
	list of 162 witnesses that we have filed, of course, it is no secret that many of these witnesses were included in the list to allow us to file their statements via Rule 92 bis later, because, as Your Honours well know, filing a statement under 92 bis, a prerequisite is that the witness was included in the 
	Defence witness list.  

In terms of the exact number of witnesses which the Defence intends to call, we will -- we understand that there will be very difficult negotiations arising from this list.  But, on our part, because we are facing 57 different allegations in the indictment, because none of these allegations have been taken away from the Prosecutor, as far as Mr. Nzabonimana is concerned, up to this date, he is facing 57 different facts, which according to the Prosecutor demonstrate his liability in what happened in Rwanda in 1994.  

So because of that, and because our witnesses are not, if I may say, as versatile in terms to testifying to different allegations of the indictment as those of the Prosecutor, it will be very difficult for us to reduce that list under 60 witnesses.  

So my submission this morning is that -- and even 60 would be very difficult.  I see my client is already nodding negatively.  But I understand that there are scheduling concerns, that there are timing concerns.  

What I would like to add is that many of these witnesses are very short.  When we say one hour, we mean it.  We calculate 20 -- 15, 20 minutes for the examination-in-chief of these witnesses.  And so we take double the time for the cross-examination of the Prosecutor, that's 40 minutes.  And we are confident that we can lead several witnesses per day once we start and once they are in Arusha.  

So I will summarise my submissions by stating that if we are pressed very hard, we will attempt to reduce the list to 60 witnesses, but even that would be a very difficult exercise.  If I may add this:  These are not imaginary or irrelevant witnesses.  
We have -- I don't think that I have ever seen such an important amount of statements disclosed.  We'll discuss the statements later.  But you can see the seriousness with which we have done this investigation.  We have done all of this within less than one year of investigation from knowing what the indictment was, which, if you compare it with the nine years that the Prosecutor benefited to conduct its investigation, is telling in terms of the quality of the work that was done on behalf of Mr. Nzabonimana.  

So because of the quality of those witnesses, because of the importance of the facts under which they are testifying, we insist very strongly not to be reduced -- not to have to reduce our number of witnesses under 60.

I thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, we'd like to understand you clearly.  You are saying you have filed this list of 163 witnesses, but in reality you intend to call 60 witnesses; is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Madam President, if I was given all the time I -- we would call each and every one of these witnesses.  I am trying to be pragmatic and realistic.  I know that we'll be asked and called to reduce the number of witnesses.  My initial position -- I don't want to waste the Court's time.  We have filed a list of 
	162 witnesses.  And if we are given the time -- the necessary time to call on these people with all the obstacles that some of these witnesses involve in terms of putting video conferences, 
	subpoena -- subpoenaing some of these witnesses and obtaining the proper remedies necessary to compel the witnesses that may be reluctant to come, then our position -- the reason why we have filed this list of 162 witnesses is, first, to provide an overview of the work and the investigation that was done and, second, given the importanty (sic) to call each and every one of them. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Defence Counsel.

Yes, Prosecution. 
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President.  The Prosecutor has some submissions to make in respect of the number of witnesses that the Defence intends to call.  We are actually going to move the Trial Chamber to invoke the provisions of Rule 73 ter D and Rule 54 to order the Defence to reduce the number of witnesses because, in our view, Your Honours, the Defence are calling an excessive number of witnesses and these witnesses, most of them, Your Honours, are actually proving the same facts.  

If you can allow me, Your Honours, to just take you through our analysis of the witness pre-Defence brief and also their list of witnesses.  There is a serious duplication of witnesses, Your Honours, and we feel that some of the witnesses are really superfluous.  Let me give you an example.  We have 
38 witnesses who are testifying on paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 30 -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, slow down. 
MS. MAPOSA:
I am sorry.  30, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 45, 50, 51 and 52.

There is an interesting aspect that is coming out of the list of witnesses, Your Honours.  These are 
38 witnesses testifying on these paragraphs.  We have 12 witnesses testifying on paragraphs 
34, 35, 36, 37, 42, 43 and 52.  

Now, you'll find that the difference between these 12 witnesses and 38 witnesses is only two paragraphs, that is, paragraphs 34 and 42, which actually means that at the end of the day some of their witnesses are superfluous, Your Honours.  

We also have an instance whereby we have 12 witnesses testifying on paragraphs 
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 26, 38 and 51.  And these paragraphs are already covered by the 38 witnesses.  Is there any need to call these witnesses again, Your Honours?  And we also have 13 witnesses testifying on paragraphs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 32, 38, 51, 53 and 54.  

The only new paragraphs that these 13 witnesses help are paragraphs 32, 53 and 54.  But otherwise all that they're saying -- all the paragraphs that they are testifying on is included among the 38 witnesses, Your Honour.  

This is just to give a glimpse of the whole excessive nature of the witnesses that the Defence is calling.  We've made an analysis of the whole indictment, but I may not take you through the whole thing.  I just want to give you those examples.  And, Your Honours, calling 162 -- in fact, we'd calculated.  We came up with 164.  Maybe there is a mathematical error somewhere, somehow.  164 witnesses vis-à-vis how much the Prosecutor called:  20 witnesses.

1030H
MS. MAPOSA:
I think, Your Honours, this is out of line with the principle of equality of arms here.  And I think if we take it in terms of time, if we use the Prosecution estimate of their time -- they estimated to spend 78 hours on their witnesses which even got down to 50 hours.  But the actual time that we spent I don't think is more than 40 hours in court.

Look at the disproportionate and astronomical disparity that is there now between the Defence and the Prosecution.  Their estimate is 338 hours, Your Honours.

The Prosecutor submits, Your Honours, that according to case law, if Your Honours can allow me to cite the case of Nyiramasuhuko and others, the Trial Chamber yielded that an excessive number of witnesses were on the Defence list, to the extent that they were to examine the pre-Defence brief and the statements, and they held that 15 witnesses testifying on this. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I beg your pardon, Madam President.  It seems the French booth is having difficulty keeping up with the pace of the speaker.  She is apparently reading a document.  It would be useful if the booth had a copy.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Counsel, you need to slow down.  And are you reading any document which you could provide?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Of course.  I prepared my notes, but I'm not following word for word.  I just have my notes, Your Honours.  I'm not reading a document. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You need to slow down to enable the translation to proceed smoothly.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.

So, Madam President, Your Honours, what we are saying is having more than ten witnesses testifying on the same facts is not necessary, to say the least.  And in this case, Your Honours, maybe if I can just give you even in terms of paragraphs. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we got your point.  So make a summary of your submissions so that we can make a response.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  So in view of our submissions, Your Honours, we are actually moving the Trial Chamber to enforce the provisions of Article 73 ter, C and 54 of the 
Rules of Procedure and Evidence to order the Defence to reduce their witness list.  And there is also an anomaly that we would want to bring to the attention of the Trial Chamber that we noted.

There are some witnesses, Your Honours, who are on annex I, the list of witnesses for the Defence, and who are not even referred to in the pre-Defence brief, Your Honours.  We have about 38 witnesses who are not referred to in the pre-Defence brief.  We don't know what the Defence intends to do with these witnesses, Your Honours.  We actually have the names of such witnesses.

Those are our submissions, Your Honours, concerning the witness list of the Defence. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before we hear from the Defence, maybe we should take this together with witness statements under identifying information so we can give one ruling in respect of this matter.

What is the position with regard to statements that have been disclosed under "disclosed"?

Prosecution, do you have any comment on this matter before you sit down?  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Your Honours.  We filed the motion, and we are actually requesting that the Trial Chamber order the Defence to give us statements of witnesses.  And we have seen their response, and we are still considering whether to reply or not. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Defence, any reply?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Your Honour, with regard to the statements, as I stated earlier, I challenge the Prosecutor to show me a case before this Tribunal where more statements were disclosed to the Prosecutor.  I've talked with my colleagues working on the Defence bench, and the amounts that we come up with:  two, very often zero, one.

We are opening our books to the Prosecutor, and we are -- we have given them everything we have.  All the statements of the witnesses we intend to call have been disclosed.  The Defence cannot give what it doesn't have.  And the case law is quite clear about that.

We have quoted cases in that respect in our response.  The Defence is at a loss trying to understand how it could be ordered to provide material which it doesn't have.  I again can only inform the Chamber that the statements we have provided the Prosecutor are all the statements of the witnesses we intend to call that we had in our possession.  There is not much I can add to that.

Thank you, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Learned Counsel, submission of issue of 38 witnesses who are on your list but are not included in the pre-Defence brief, could you comment on that one as well.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If I may add, the Prosecutor has also outlined, identified, some mistakes, some clerical errors and some errors in the list of witnesses.  Just as it was the case for the Prosecutor who was to amend their 
	pre-trial brief and list of witnesses before we started, the Defence is doing its best to have perfect documents.

It understands that some mistakes may have occurred.  But we will amend those documents so that we work perfectly together.  And those witnesses that are not referred to in the list, in the pre-Defence brief but that are, nevertheless, included in the list will be in due time included as soon as we filed a revised -- an amended version of the pre-Defence brief will be included in the footnotes of the pre-Defence brief as they should have initially.  And the Defence apologises for that error. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel, we are seeking a clarification from you from the scrutiny of the statements that were accompanying the pre-Defence brief, we notice that some are entitled "Statements"; others are entitled "Declaration".  So we wanted to understand this difference and what it implies.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
There are no differences.  All of the statements or déclarations that were disclosed should be treated equally.  They are all written statements of witnesses.  There is no difference between these documents, just that what happens is that the statements were taken by different persons.  

So depending if the witness was francophone or working with an anglophone person, the document may have a different title.  But as far as we are concerned and if that may be of any reassurance to the Prosecutor and the Bench, we can confirm that all these documents are witness statements.  They should not be treated otherwise. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.   
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV: 
Defence Counsel, a question here.  I think that out of 162-64 witnesses, about 60 or 63 are listed as déclarant.  Does that imply that those witnesses are the ones who have made statements or declarations; whereas, the remaining hundred have not?  Please clarify that.  Thank you.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
It is precisely that, Your Honour.  I can announce that we have further statements.  We are still obtaining statements from some of the witnesses from which we didn't have any before the time came to disclose to the Prosecutor.  We will disclose those statements.  But as far as you are stating that the déclarants are those from which we have statements, this is absolutely true.  
JUDGE TUZMUKHAMEDOV: 
Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  This is what the Trial Chamber can say at the moment regarding the Defence witness list, 
witness statements, and identifying information:  Identifying information and, where possible, statements which have not been disclosed in accordance with the Trial Chamber's orders of 3rd February 2010 should be disclosed as soon as possible and, in any case, not later than seven days from today.

The Trial Chamber believes that in the interests of justice and for the smooth conduct of this trial, all these things should be placed before the trial commences, more so if it is to commence on the 
29th of March.  The Trial Chamber also warns the Defence that it needs to disclose sufficient information about what the witnesses are going to say to the Prosecution because the Trial Chamber will not allow the Defence to lead evidence on matters for which the Defence has not been given adequate notice.

And for those witnesses where no identifying information -- where no adequate information is provided, the Trial Chamber will strike them off the list if the information is not availed.  So we leave this upon the Defence to make sure that this is done as soon as possible and to enable the trial to commence without any hitches.

We are happy that the Defence has volunteered to file a revised pre-Defence brief.  We hope that it's going to be comprehensive and that it will address all the matters that have been raised here.  And, Defence Counsel, how much time do you think you will need to file this revised pre-Defence brief.  We want the time to come from you, but if it's unreasonable, we might have to curtail it.  How much time?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
The Defence could undertake to file a revised pre-Defence brief by next Friday, Friday of next week, just accompanying the statements we have not disclosed so far which were obtained in the last few days.  This is why they were not included.  We wish to stress that we are not hiding anything from the Prosecutor.

And what we could do is file a revised pre-Defence brief next Friday along with -- with corrections to the Defence list.  There were misspellings and things like that that occurred.  That will be done as well along with the statements that we have obtained -- that we will have obtained because they keep arriving and coming, as well as the statements that we will have in our possession by next Friday.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  And complete identifying information of witnesses is important.  And we need not emphasise this point because it's very crucial to investigations and to preparedness, trial readiness. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
If I may briefly, Your Honour, comment on that point.  We are -- the Defence is doing its best to provide that information.  We have many witnesses, and maybe we will deal with that matter later.  We have many, many witnesses who are in a state of terror and who are hiding because -- even from us.  It is difficult for us -- it is difficult to contact them.  We have dealt with issues -- Your Honours are well aware of the conditions of what exists.  These people keep moving.  These people keep hiding in different places.

These people are ex-Prosecution witnesses who are -- we have explained what happened to them.  So the Defence can only do its best in terms of providing that information.  It cannot be bound to impossibility.

Many witnesses have fled Rwanda.  They keep changing places and countries for reasons which we have detailed and which our investigator has detailed.  We have matters to deal with at WVSS on the identifying material for these witnesses.

We are meeting WVSS immediately after this pre-Defence conference to address some of these matters and some of these issues which we hope to resolve as well.  But we can only undertake to continue, as we have done so far, to provide updated and accurate identifying information to the best of our knowledge.

If the witnesses change location after we meet them, I don't think the Defence can be blamed for that.  When they are here before Your Honours, they will give you a full picture, all the details of why they were moving like that.

But in terms of for the Defence to provide the identification information of these witnesses, we can only disclose and provide the material which we obtain when we meet them.  And we cannot be held responsible if that information changed thereafter.

If I can say so, we have some witnesses who are literally living in the woods.  And they are trying to -- they are fearing for their lives.  They are in fear for their security.  We are trying to -- we are stuck between a rock and a hard place where we are trying to accommodate the Prosecutor.  But we have also moral obligations to these people who have objective and valid fears.
Your Honours have issued a very, very clear order for the protection of these people.  Nevertheless, we are trying to make sure to obtain their attendance and to work with WVSS and the Prosecutor in terms of providing all the necessary information.  And we will continue to do so.  There is nothing more I can add to that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Maybe in light of what you said, we should hear from the witness protection unit.

Is it here?  
MR. DIALLO: 
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Officer, do you have anything to say?  And please put down your name for the record.  Mention your name for the record before you address the Chamber.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  The stenographer is indicating something, and I'm lost.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Is it the speed?  He needs to slow down.  Okay.  

I'm sorry.  You have to start again because the stenographer and interpreters have not been able to catch up with you and have lost some of what you are saying.  Can you start again and slow down, please. 

We can proceed?

Sorry.  You have to start again.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
I shall take up from where I stopped.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't think that will be good enough, Madam President.  You asked him to repeat the whole thing. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Can you start from the beginning, please, because the recorders were not able to hear you.  She had -- one of them had a problem with her earphones.  And say the whole statement.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Yes.  In summary, I was saying that what we have received to date as information regarding witnesses made us realise that, for the most part, they were living in countries which were not their countries of origin and that a large number of them needed action on behalf of our section in order to have them to return to the said countries.  

And that is a problem which we often face when we are dealing with these kind of witnesses, and that also obliges us to negotiate certain arrangements with various administrations in the various countries concerned.  The message I'm trying to pass on to you, Madam President and Your Honours, is the following:  We have a certain number of constraints which we cannot avoid because there are certain impositions made upon us by the countries in which the witnesses are.

Given the schedule which has been given by the Chamber a few moments ago, I cannot hide it from you that we will have to endeavour -- I'm not making any guarantees.  That's why I'm using the term "endeavour" -- to ensure that some countries close their eyes to some of the constraints obtaining from their own administrative arrangements, and that is our problem at this particular moment.  Madam President, Your Honours, I thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Maybe what we would like to know, Officer, is what are the implications of these for the dates which have been indicated?  Will you be able to get here the witnesses in time?  And what does the Chamber need to do to facilitate that process?  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Your Honour, there is not much that the Chamber can do here.  We are going to negotiate with the concerned countries.  And from what we'll be able to get, we're going to keep the Chamber up to date depending on how fast we get the information.

If the trial is going to start on the 12th of April, as the Chamber has proposed, it means that we have less than two months to negotiate temporary travel documents, to make arrangements in terms of security, in terms of august security, and escort of these witnesses.  That is something that we do normally.

But when it comes to the issuing of temporary documents, this is where we -- most of the time, this is where we have organs because countries may tell us, "Look.  This is too short a notice for us to do anything during that time."

But the assistance we can get from the Chamber is if the Chamber is flexible enough -- let's say if a witness was expected in two or three days' time and it is not possible, there are indications that this won't be possible, if the Chamber can accept a delay maybe of one or two days when we are certain that this will save the situation, we are going to keep you posted, Your Honour.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And, Officer, we have given -- we said that is a tentative programme because we don't know how the Ngirabatware trial is going to unfold.  It may very well be that we are able to proceed on the 
29th of March in which case we also need a response from you with regard to that date.  
MR. ESSOMBE-EDIMO:
Yes, Your Honour.  We have taken that scenario into account.  And as the Defence counsel has told you a while ago, we are going to have a meeting during which I hope we're going to come out with quite a good number of witnesses that might allow the Chamber to sit and not to waste its time while, if at all, it has to start at the end of this month.

If I may, Your Honour -- in fact, the idea is this.  If at all we have a witness -- I mean, a list of witnesses on which we can do our available job, we are going to inform the Chamber that this is where we are and this is what we have, and we can assure you that you can do your job without wasting your time and without being at a certain time obliged to stop because there are no witnesses.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, officer.

Defence, you have heard from the witness protection unit.  Do you want to make any comment, or should we go ahead and -- okay.  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Very briefly, Your Honour.  This is -- I can state that so far. 
(Pages 7 to 14 by Kelly Surina)
















	1100H
BY MR. LAROCHELLE:
Very briefly, Your Honour, I can state that so far we have given the details of -- because we don't want to waste anybody's time either -- we have given the WVSS the details of 35 people, which they have started making arrangements to come.  So I don't think -- there should be no fear on the part of the Chamber to -- in terms of having people present whenever that trial starts.  

And this brings me back to one thing which would also help us in terms of planning and scheduling the beginning of the Defence case, and that is the end of the Prosecutor's case, because we have one cross-examination left, but there is also hanging out there a further witness from the Prosecutor which the Prosecutor attempted to schedule two times but which for various reasons never came to testify.  Maybe if we could hear from the Prosecutor on that issue that would be helpful for both us and the WVSS in terms of planning the arriving of these witnesses, first.  

And, second, I'm glad that the witness protection officer informed you of the difficulties encountered in securing the attendance of the witnesses here.  And I just want to state for the record that we wish WVSS to be proactive in informing us of any such difficulties to allow us to make timely and necessary motions before the Chamber, if Article 28 motions are necessary in terms of obtaining the protection of states where witnesses without any valid travel documents are located.  And we are ready to start immediately to file these motions, and the Chamber is well accustomised (sic) with Article 28 because of the motions we have filed under that topic.  

So we just want to tell WVSS to inform us as rapidly as possible whenever such difficulties are encountered to give us the opportunity to make the appropriate submissions before the Trial Chamber.  

That is all on that topic, Your Honour, and I thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Prosecution, what is the position with regard to the remaining witness?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, thank you, Madam President, Your Honours.  

	Maybe before that, Madam President, Your Honours, I just want to reiterate our submissions in our motion concerning the identifying information of some witnesses.  

We are greatly incapacitated, Your Honours, if we don't have that information.  And the problems that the Defence, Your Honours, has cited are not unique to the Defence.  We also experienced the same problems as the Prosecution, but we had to come to a decision so that the Defence was not prejudiced.  
So if there are some witnesses for whom they still don't have identifying information, and the time is running out, time is going, the Defence has to come to a decision, Your Honours, in time so that we know whether they are still pursuing those witnesses or not.  

And as far as our two outstanding witnesses are concerned, Your Honours, we are in touch with WVSS and we are in the process, Your Honours, of filing our 90 bis motion in respect of CNAC.  We understand he was taken back to Rwanda, so we have to request for his transfer back, and I'm sure by next week everything will be in process.  And CNAJ, Your Honours, is coming to testify, and we have informed WVSS of it.  

Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  This is what we have to say.  We -- first of all, we want to reiterate what we have said, that identifying information must be provided in a timely manner, both to the WVSS and the Prosecution.  

The Chamber -- we repeat, the Chamber will not allow the Defence to lead evidence in matters of which the Defence has given no adequate notice.  And we expect the Defence to rectify the errors and omissions which have been pointed out here when it files the revised pre-Defence brief.  And they have offered to file this by Friday next week, so we take it that it will be filed by that date.  

And connected with this matter is the length of the testimonies of these witnesses.  Counsel, we understood you to be saying that the estimates you made include cross-examination; is that the case?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  And we have noticed that you indicate that some of your witnesses will testify for one hour and a few for five or six hours.  Going by the time the Prosecution took to lead their evidence, we still believe that you can indicate -- you can reduce the time within which these witnesses are supposed to testify.  

So we actually require you to do two things:  We want you to -- first of all, to reduce the number of witnesses which you are going to call and to give a proper proofing chart, including both examination-in-chief and cross-examination.   We believe that you are in a position to refine any estimates you may have been made -- you may have made and to provide an order of appearance of these witnesses.

An order of appearance is absolutely necessary because it determines the order in which WVSS will bring these witnesses here and also how the Prosecution will prepare for these witnesses.  And the Trial Chamber as well needs to know which witnesses are coming.  So please take these matters seriously.  

We need to have a proofing chart filed, including indicative times for examination-in-chief and cross-examination.  We need a reduced list of witnesses.  We leave this to you for now.  We -- we feel that there is no need for very many witnesses to testify on the same sets of facts, and we leave this to your discretion to decide which witnesses will testify on which facts and a reasonable number of them.  So we expect you to file a realistic list that would be proportionate to the list that has been filed by the Prosecution.  

We -- so let me repeat:  A proofing chart including time for both examination-in-chief and cross-examination, a refined estimate, and an order of appearance of the witnesses.  This must be made available to both the Prosecution and the Trial Chamber as well as the witness protection unit as soon as possible.  

And we want to restate that these -- all these things should provide an efficient use of the 
Chamber's time and that witnesses should be available on a continuous basis.  So we don't expect to sit for three days waiting for witnesses to arrive.  So please liaise with the witness protection unit so that there is no break once we start the trial.  

And we need to say this again:  The number of witnesses needs to be reduced.  We don't see the need to have repetitious evidence or even redundant -- repetitious and redundant evidence.  So have a second look at your list and do what is necessary.  

Yes.  And we need to repeat that "as soon as possible" actually is seven days from today, yes.  

All right.  Now that we have sorted out this matter, we will now go to the exhibits, the 
Defence exhibit list.  Any comments on this, Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Madam President.  We received a list of Defence exhibits, but we are humbly requesting the Trial Chamber to order the Defence to provide us with the copies of those exhibits to enable us to prepare for the Defence case, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
Would next Friday be fine as well, in terms of providing exhibits to the Prosecutor and the Trial Chamber?  We can do that -- since everything must be put together for that date, we may as well put that item on the same -- due for the same date.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  We take it that you are conceding that you are going to give copies to the Prosecution to enable them to prepare their defence within seven days.  Okay.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If I may briefly add, Your Honour, that translation is of a concern to the Defence.  We are sending everything to the translation unit, and we are trying to prioritise the documents, but we will send the original version so the Prosecutor will be at liberty to solicit its own translation if it wants to refer or use other material which will be provided.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The Trial Chamber believes that that is a reasonable approach because the Prosecution may have its own in-house arrangements for expedited translation.  So while you pursue the official translations, it's in order for you to provide the Prosecution with the originals so they can make do what they want with them.  

There are other pre-trial issues which the Trial Chamber would like to broach.  There are two pending motions.  

	The Prosecution motion to compel Defence to comply with the Trial Chamber's decision.  Now that we have discussed this issue here and the Defence has agreed to comply, the Trial Chamber will review the pre-Defence brief after it has been filed, and it may very well be that this motion may become moot.  So we'll await the filing of the pre-Defence brief before we take any further action on this motion.  

There is another motion pending before the Trial Chamber seeking cooperation and assistance of France in respect of the matters mentioned in that motion.  The Trial Chamber will issue a decision on this motion in due course.  

We would now like to move on to the alibi.  

It has -- we have been informed that the Defence filed its alibi notice pursuant to Article 67(A)ii(a).  And we would like to know whether it has filed all necessary documents in support of this alibi.  

Defence?  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If I may be allowed 30 seconds, I will respond.  

Two points on the alibi notice, Your Honour.  We have been announcing that alibi notice for quite some time.  Even before Your Honours arrived in this trial, we announced to the pre-trial Chamber that we had an alibi to offer with respect to the presence of the Accused at the French embassy between 
6th and 12th April 1994.  That was acknowledged by the pre-trial Chamber when certain motions were granted to obtain the cooperation of France.  I think it's important to stress that with regards to the 
	alibi notice that was filed.  Because of the failure of France to comply with the various orders that were issued to that country, we were put in a position where we had to seek alternative means of proving the alibi, which is what this alibi notice endeavours to do.  

We have provided the names and full addresses of the people on which we would rely to prove the alibi.  They are included in the notice of alibi.  There is one witness, the eighth -- the seventh and eighth witnesses for which fuller information would be provided.  For example, I think for number 8 we have a statement which we will disclose by next Friday with the rest of the information and material we have to provide the Prosecutor next Friday.  

And while we are at it, we will also amend that alibi to refer to certain materials which have been filed.  If Your Honours remember, we used a video where we were seeing the swearing-in ceremony of the interim government where Mr. Nzabonimana was present.  So that evidence will be mentioned here, although it already has been put on the record.  And there is also a radio broadcast of Radio Rwanda dealing with the same events that will be added to this list.  But in terms of providing the Prosecutor with the material pertaining to our alibi, this is our position.  

Thank you, Your Honours.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Defence counsel.  

Prosecution?  
MS. MAPOSA:
Yes, Your Honours.  We confirm that we have received the alibi notice and some of the information concerning the alibi witnesses.  But our great concern is with the French unidentified witnesses who are not known even by the Defence, Your Honours.  This also incapacitates us a lot in the preparation of the Defence case.  So I don't know how Your Honours are going to assist us on that aspect of these unidentified French witnesses.  
MR. LAROCHELLE:
If I may briefly respond to that, Your Honour.  For once I think the principle of equality of arms applies fully and has its full effect.  We are as incapacitated as the Prosecutor in terms of providing the Court the identifying information of these people.  We have been complaining about that for almost a year now.  I am at a loss to see that the Prosecutor has not gotten that yet.  It's seen all the motions.  It's seen all the decisions, some of them even issued yesterday, regarding the topic.  I don't think the Defence can be blamed for the refusal of a state to implement clear cooperation orders from the Tribunal.  

I think the fact that the Defence of Mr. Nzabonimana is compromised because France, to name the state which is not complying with the Tribunal's order, is refusing to provide any assistance to the Defence.  And that is despite clear orders.  France -- and we have asked -- also I want to come back on the fact that we have had delays to be able to obtain that information and to be able to work because, of course, if we obtain official documents from France and names of people who can attest by their official capacity of the presence of the persons who were at the French embassy between 
6th and 12th April 1994 it would be much simpler.  Maybe one witness would suffice rather than eight like that, which we have to find and meet on all corners of the planet, to try to repair the prejudice that is caused by France to the defence of Nzabonimana.  

These are my comments on that issue.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  All we can say at this point in time is that as and when the information becomes available, the Defence can always apply to the Chamber to vary its witness list.  The Trial Chamber has made all decisions necessary in this respect, and there is nothing more it can do.  

Yes.  In conclusion, we would like to remind the parties about the trial schedule and repeat the dates which we have already given you, that, all things being equal, this case will proceed as scheduled on the 29th of March.  But should the Ngirabatware trial not end in time and proceed until the 
	31st of March, then the Nzabonimana trial will be rescheduled to start from the 12th of April up till the 5th of June with a break in between the week of 26th to 30th April this year.  

We will communicate in a timely manner a decision, one way or the other, as soon as it becomes very clear to us.  

And with those remarks, we would like to thank all the parties and all the officers from all the sections who have participated in these proceedings, and we look forward to have a smooth recommencement of this trial on the 29th of March or on the 12th of April.  
These proceedings stand adjourned.
