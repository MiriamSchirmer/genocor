aware that the multi-party system started in

1991; is that correct?

19

A.

20
21

Yes, if my memory does not fail me, I think
it was in 1991.

Q.

Do you recall whether or not based upon your

22

experience as one of *** ********, at the

23

24

was a statute of the MRND which was filed in

A.

Q.

And do you know whether or not that statute

that was filed set forth the leadership of

4

the MRND within each of the communes and

5

each of the prefectures throughout Rwanda?

6

A.

Sorry Counsel, when you are talking about

7

the statute, are you referring to the

8

statute of the MRND or the statute of the

9

other parties?

10

Q.

I am talking only now about the MRND, and I

11

am asking you as someone who was * ****** at

12

the cellule, prior to 1992, whether you had

13

any knowledge of the content of the statute

14

that was filed in 1991 during the

multi-party system?

A.

Yes.

Do you understand the

Now, before I went to prison in 1982,

I do remember that there was -- I don't

Q.

Very good.

What I am asking you is whether

4

or not you are familiar with statutes which

5

form the MRND which set forth the rules, the

structure of the MRND at the prefecture

7

level, at the commune level, and then

8

setting forth the leadership of the MRND in

each of the prefects in 1991 when the

10

multi-party system was, in fact, initiated.

11

Are you familiar with that process?

12

A.

Well, yes.

All that I know is that before

they just put in things like government

22

That was the one that I liked.

As for the official

Could you repeat the first sentence?

4

Q.

Your involvement in the massacres and other

5

crimes that were committed by you on April

6

7th of 1994?

7

A.

Yes, I explained everything, all the more so

8

as I pleaded guilty at the Tribunal.

9

explained everything, how the events

unfolded, that is, the massacres or the

11

genocide at the level of our commune.

12

Q.

So, on July 26th of last year, sir, you

13

talked about your role with respect to those

14

massacres, and you talked about other people

such as Shadreck Sendugu, who you say was an

with the interest of justice and fairness,

It is their

3

at the same time, the interest of justice

must always prevail and is paramount.

But

person perhaps may be referred to and he has

need to refresh his own memory.

considered into -- taken into account.

that unless there are reasons to justify the

proposal that was made by Learned Counsel,

19

Professor Hinds, for the witness to remove

20

his earphone, whatever it is, unless it is

21

clearly a matter that needs to be dealt with

that way we don't see how or why we would,

23

you know, instruct a witness to remove the

earphones when there is no specific issue

25

that needs to be raised, and particularly

reason for that is so that the witness is

in all that I said, I will never contradict.

6

Q.

Now, sir, you also testified that Kajelijeli

7

promised reinforcement of the Interahamwe

8

from Mukingo at that particular meeting; is

9

that correct?

10

A.

Yes.

11

Q.

Did you, in fact, make that statement to the

12
13

ICTR on the 26th of June?
A.

Yes, Kajelijeli promised us assistants and

14

reinforcements and that's what happened in

15

the morning of the 7th.

16

Q.

Can you point out where you say Kajelijeli

17

made those promises of reinforcements of

18

Interahamwe from Mukingo in the statement on

19

June 26th?

20

A.

No, because the question was not put to me.

21

Q.

With respect to weapons that were used to

22

commit all of these massacres, and the

23

distribution of those weapons, did you make

24

any reference to distribution of weapons and

25

obtaining of weapons by Kajelijeli in your

Give me a minute.

Sorry, I have a problem

with reading this, but give me a minute.

Sorry, Counsel, why don't you show me the

Would you like to see the second statement?

2

Interpreter couldn't do so because the

3

Defence didn't give him that opportunity, so

if you can direct that so he doesn't repeat

because, otherwise it will cause some

problems in the transcript.

There is a moment the

where there are names mentioned, will

MR. PRESIDENT:

4

No, it is really the Interpreter who is

5

sitting next to the witness.

6

MR. KIYEYEU:

7

No, My Lords, if the names are spelled out

8

by counsel or anybody, there's no problem.

9

The problem is when the witness that

10

testifies and mentions some names that are

11

not spelled out; now, when the interpreter

12

wants to spell out, he's not given that

13

chance.

is Rwandan habit, I kept some ideas, the

details, in order to be able to give them to

you make any reference to Juvnal Kajelijeli

BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

No, sir, you talked about hearing Nzirorera

giving instructions to Kajelijeli at a

5

meeting that was held in 1993; is that

6

correct?

7

A.

Yes.

8

Q.

And you, in fact, told us who was at that

9

meeting which was held at the end of 1993;

10

is that correct?

Yes.

Can you tell us again who was at that

13

meeting, at the end of 1993, where

14

Nzirorera, you say, instructed you to act on

15

Kajelijeli's instructions?

16

A.

There was the members of the Amahindure

17

group, if I do remember.

There was the

18

population from the neighbouring areas,

19

because, as I testified yesterday, it was to

20

introduce the Amahindure group to the

population and to explain to them the

22

reasons for their existence; namely, the

23

protection of the area.

That's my answer.

Q.

Was Shadrak there, Sendugu?

No.

So I am just

2

clarifying from you whether you have any

statement there dated 26 July 2000?

4

A.

No.

Q.

You told this Court that if you told the

ICTR officials all you know about what

happened, the events that took place in

preparation and then the execution, that it

correct?

Yes, that's very correct.

Q.

The details you've told of the massacre of

Tutsis -- when I'm talking about details,

I'm talking about the preparation all and up

did you tell the truth about the details

20

that you've testified about in this court?

A.

Yes, it is the truth.

Yesterday, I gave the

Your Honour, in view of the fact that this

other witness who has already testified and

whose statements we have obtained from

before, and if we are in a position to

examine him, we would want to do so.

that is a matter that we want to resolve.
