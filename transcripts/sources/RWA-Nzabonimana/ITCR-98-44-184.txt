P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  I am sorry for the late start this morning.  There were some administrative matters that occupied my attention.  

Mr. Robinson, you have the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, are you going to allow me to open the proceedings today, or you would rather have the Registrar do it? 
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I do apologise, the horseman stays back and forth.  

Mr. Registrar, could you please open the proceedings.  
MR. FRY: 
Yes, Your Honour.

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of 
Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today,
Tuesday, the 18th of October 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor vs 
Karemera et al.  Case number ICTR-98-44-T.

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  I think we can note the appearances as previously stated. 

Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:  
Yes, Mr. President, I have a brief application to make before we can start with Witness G, and that relates to your order pursuant to Rule -- relating to Rule 66C, materials on -- and the government that is involved in that case.  You ordered that the Prosecution by the 17th of October disclose some of its ex-parte fillings, and they made that disclosure this morning, the 18th of October.

You also ordered us to reply by the 19th of October, and I am asking for an extension of time to reply until Monday, the 24th of October, because I don't have enough time between this cross-examination of Witness G, and the material that has been disclosed today is very interesting and I do want -- I think that it is very important that I be given a full opportunity to comment on it.  

I understand that the government doesn't have to respond until November, the 3rd.  So, it doesn't seem like my extension will prejudice anyone.  So that's my application.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The extension is granted. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, may I deduce from what you have just said that I also, am granted leave for that extension?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we grant the extension to all Defence teams.
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
WITNESS G,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, you are there? 
MS. TALON: 
The registry has requested counsel to repeat.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Good morning.  Witness G.  Yesterday, we were talking about Mr. Turatsinze, and the fact of weapons.  And I want to see if we can put a time frame on that incident.  You testified earlier, and correct me if 
	I am wrong, that the distributions of weapons took place in the second half of 1993.  And so, can you tell us approximately when it was, that Mr. Turatsinze stole some of these weapons, as far as you know?  
A.	Those weapons were sold after October 1993. 
Q.	And, would it have been before the arrival of the RPF battalion in Kigali, in December of '93? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  That's very helpful.  And then after the theft of those weapons or the sell of those weapons, Mr. Turatsinze disappeared, correct? 
A.	I no longer saw him. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to direct your attention or the registry to place before you the contents of Tab 85 which is a coded cable from General Dallaire to the United Nations Headquarters in New York.  And within Tab 85, there are two versions, English and French.  So you can direct yourself to the French. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And while we are doing that, Mr. President, I will offer this coded cable, the French being 
Exhibit D. NZ15A and the English being Exhibit D. NZ15B.

Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is so ordered. 
(Exhibit D. NZ15A, D. NZ15B, admitted)
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, you now have the document in front of you? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	Okay, we are going to go through this in detail so; I will start with paragraph No. 1.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And first of all, is the Trial Chamber organised?  Do you have everything you need for this?  Okay, I will take one minute to wait, Witness G, until the exhibit is before the Trial Chamber. 
MS. TALON:
Witness G has the document, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very mush, Madam Registrar.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:. 
Q.	Okay, Witness G, directing your attention to the first paragraph of this telegram, it says that the 
	Force Commander was put in contact with informant by a very very important government politician.  And then it goes on to say that the informant is a top level trainer in the cadre of Interahamwe armed militia of MRND.  And I want to ask you, first of all, if Mr. Turatsinze to your knowledge was a top level trainer of the Interahamwe? 
A.	What I can tell you is that I don't know what type of military training he had, but apparently --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could the witness kindly repeat his answer?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay, Witness G, I am sorry, but the interpreters didn't catch your answer.  Can you please repeat that?  
A.	What I can tell you is, I don't know what type of training Turatsinze had.  What type of military training, I don't know if he had in-depth military training.  What I know is, before he came to the MRND, he worked as a driver for the director of the Central Intelligence Services. 
Q.	And at the MRND, as far as you know, he was also serving in the capacity of a driver, correct? 
A.	He was a driver.  He put the executive committee in contact with the Interahamwe.  He was a middle man. 
Q.	And as far as you knew, did he -- was he a top level trainer of Interahamwe, militia? 
A.	I couldn't tell you.  I don't know. 
Q.	Now, turning to the second paragraph, it says that, "He informed us, he was in charge of last Saturday's demonstration."  Let me ask you; to your knowledge was Mr. Turatsinze ever in charge of any Interahamwe or MRND demonstrations? 
A.	Which demonstrations?  Rallies or other types of demonstrations?  I am not sure what you mean. 
Q.	Well, in this particular paragraph, it seems to be referring to a demonstration of the previous Saturday.  That being in early January of l994 which he claims would target deputies of the opposition parties coming to the ceremonies and Belgian soldiers.  So, first let me ask you with respect to the incidents at parliament building in which deputies of parliament were attending the ceremonies for the swearing in of the broad based transitional government.  To your knowledge, was Mr. Turatsinze ever in charge of that demonstration? 
A.	I was not aware of that. 
Q.	And to your knowledge, was he ever in charge of any demonstration or orally by the MRND or Interahamwe? 
A.	What I know is that when there were demonstrations planned for Sunday or even Saturday, every time there was a meeting to that effect, he would come to make an announcement.  He would announce what would happen on that Sunday to the Interahamwe.  He was on his way from the executive committee of the Interahamwe. 
Q.	So as I understand it, he was relaying information from the MRND about the scheduling of its rallies and he was providing that information at the meeting of the Interahamwe committee on Wednesday evenings; is that correct? 
A.	Precisely he also spoke at those meetings to inform us of that. 
Q.	And was his role in the MRND or the Interahamwe at the top level were to be said that he was in charge of any demonstration or orally? 
A.	Not to me.  He was not important in the executive committee of the MRND.  He was just a middle man. 
Q.	Now, the paragraph number two goes on to say that; "At this demonstration in early January, some time last Saturday, as it is referred to here, they hoped to provoke the RPF battalion to engage", meaning being fired upon, "The demonstrators and provoke a civil war.  That deputies were to be assassinated upon entry or exit from parliament.  That Belgian troops were to be provoked, and if Belgian soldiers resorted to force, a number of them were to be killed, and thus guarantee Belgium withdraw from Rwanda."  

Now, Witness G, did you ever know of any such plans by the Interahamwe or the MRND? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, I ask you to look at paragraph 4.  It says that; "The informant is a former security member of the president."  To your knowledge was Mr. Turatsinze ever a former security member of the president? 
A.	I believe I told you that he was a driver for the director of the intelligence services.  That intelligence service fell under the presidency.  So, he was an informant or some type of agent for the intelligence services. 
Q.	The next sentence says that he is paid 150,000 Rwandan francs per month by the MRND party to train Interahamwe.  To your knowledge was that true? 
A.	At that time the MRND also had financial troubles.  It could not pay its employees.  So, I don't see how that man could have received 150,000 Rwandan Francs.  That's a lot of money.  Not everyone would receive that sum of money. 
Q.	How much did a minister in Rwanda receive in l994, per month, approximately? 
A.	Counsel, I think you need to ask your client, maybe.  I wasn't minister.  I wasn't interested even in that kind of thing, but I don't think they received as much as a 150, 000 Rwandan francs.  Maybe the president of the republic did. 
Q.	Now, the next sentence says that the informant claimed to have a direct link to the chief of staff of the Rwandan army.  Did you know of any link that Mr. Turatsinze had with the chief of staff of the Rwandan army? 
A.	I wasn't aware of that. 
Q.	Now, turning to paragraph 6, he says that the principle aim of the Interahamwe in the past was to protect Kigali from the RPF, is that true? 
A.	You know, the Interahamwe didn't have that kind of training.  They didn't have enough power for one to be able to say that they were there to protect Kigali.  In Kigali, there were military camps.  It's not the Interahamwe who were responsible for this kind of job, no.  They were rather for the protection of its own officials, that's all. 
Q.	And then the next sentence in paragraph 6, says that; "Since the UNAMIR mandate, he has been ordered to register all Tutsis in Kigali.  He suspects it's for their extermination.  An example he gave was that in 20 minutes his personnel could kill up to a thousand Tutsis.  Were you aware of any request or order that Tutsis in Kigali be registered? 
A.	No, but the fact remains that in Kigali I don't think that neighbour's needed to have lists made up, because everybody knew one another.  We all knew who was Tutsi, who was Twa or Hutu, who was from the north, who was from the south, who belonged to such and such a party?  Everybody knew one another.  It was very easy. 
Q.	So, as far as you know Mr. Turatsinze -- neither Mr. Turatsinze nor anyone else in the Interahamwe was ordered to register all Tutsis in Kigali? 
A.	I cannot confirm that.  What I know is that I wasn't aware of that myself. 
Q.	And were you aware of the fact that the Interahamwe were trained to kill up to 1,000 Tutsis in 20 minutes? 
A.	I wasn't informed of that. 
Q.	Now, with respect to paragraph number 8, at the last sentence, do you see where Mr. - well, the informant is requesting that he and his family.  That is being his wife and four children, be placed under UNAMIR protection? 
A.	Yes, I can see that. 
Q.	And this was at the time where he had disappeared from the MRND after having stolen weapons, correct? 
A.	I told you that I didn't see him again.  I don't know whether he remained at the MRND to work.  But I told you that after those weapons were sold, I personally did not see him again. 
Q.	And you know that there were some people looking for him, to try to find him after it was discovered that these weapons were missing? 
A.	What I know is that after the weapons disappeared or the so called sale of those arms, that's when people began to say that he wasn't being seen any more and maybe he had taken the money and he fled.  I don't know whether there was any investigation whatsoever or any search.  But the fact remains that I myself did not see him again. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to be shown a photograph which has been faxed to The Hague and its number 11 on our list, and if that can be put before you.  Are you able to recognise that building? 
A.	Unless this is the residence of the United States embassy, I really don't know. 
Q.	Have you been to the MRND office in Kimihurura before? 
A.	I think once. 
Q.	And are you able to say whether or not this photograph depicts the offices in Kimihurura where the MRND had its offices in l994? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time, I would ask that this photograph be marked as ID. NZ10 and I will ask the witness about that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Marked for identification 
 BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Did you ever see any weapons at the MRND office in Kimihurura on the one occasion that you were there? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about UNAMIR.  Did it appear to you that in 1993 and 1994 that UNAMIR was pro-RPF and anti-Habyarimana regime rather than a neutral force? 
A.	I would say more specifically, the UNAMIR Belgian contingents were attacking the MRND, people who were wearing the MRND uniforms. 
Q.	And was it your perception that UNAMIR favoured the leaders of the opposition parties who were sought to be pro-RPF, such as Faustin Twagiramungu, and Agathe Uwiligiyimana? 
A.	What I saw or observed is that they were responsible for the security of those people, whereas the leaders of the other -- of our party, the MRND did not have any UNAMIR guards such as the other leaders, for instance of the MDR. 
Q.	Did you believe that UNAMIR's conduct towards MRND was too hard, that it was disastrous? 
A.	What I have told you, is what I saw and observed about the UNAMIR Belgian contingent.  They behaved badly in relation to the members or officials of the MRND.  But as for the others I wouldn't say as much. 
Q.	And did you feel that the Belgian contingent harassed soldiers of the Rwandan Army? 
A.	I do not know the functions of the Belgian contingent of the UNAMIR, but I think that they were responsible for security throughout Kigali town.  And, so it happened that they behaved badly when they wanted to disarm a member of the Rwandan armed forces. 
Q.	For example they disarmed and humiliated Major Kabila, correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	They attacked Colonel Bagosora? 
A.	I think I heard mention made of that. 
Q.	And they attacked a daughter of Colonel Serebunga? 
A.	Yes.  They attacked the daughter of Colonel Serebunga. 
Q.	And they attacked Jean Bosco Barayangwiza in his home? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	And it was your understanding that when they left Rwanda, the Belgian contingent handed over their weapons to the RPF? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Now, I would like you to be shown Exhibit P. 13 which is at Tab 86, which you covered in your direct testimony with Mr. Rapp slightly, and we are going to go into a little bit more detail.  So, if that can be placed in front of you.

Witness G, directing -- 
A.	Yes, I have the document. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Directing your attention to this document. this is a letter from the national committee of the Interahamwe to the special representative of the United Nation, 
	Dr. Jack Roger Booh-Booh, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, at the beginning of the letter, does it indicate that the Interahamwe committee is complaining about the UNAMIR press release in which they reported that the MRND and other political militia had intentionally blocked the way of the members of parliament going to the national assembly? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And then does the Interahamwe committee ask in the paragraph that begins - and it's on the 4th paragraph on the first page, and the third item?  Is the Interahamwe committee asking how true is such information being received from UNAMIR within 24 hours while General Dallaire is still awaiting information to conclude on massacres perpetrated on innocent civilians in Karambo, in Ruwisinji, Rutura and so on?  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And what the committee is referring to at that point are killings that occurred in November of 1993 in those areas, correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And what had happened in those areas was that those people who were arrested in the elections from the MRND and their families were killed, correct? 
A.	I think that is partially true.  And there were also agents or employees of Tea factory who were killed by the RPF.  So there was a need for an investigation to be carried out but the investigation did not come up with a final report. 
Q.	And you recall during the period after November 1993 on RTLM Radio, they would ask every day, "General Dallaire, can you give us the results of your investigation? 
A.	Yes, every morning. 
Q.	Now, turning back to this letter, does the Interahamwe say -- and I am looking on the second page at the top that the accusations against the Interahamwe are false and that these false accusations can no longer work? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then did they list a number of incidents in which there are false accusations made against the Interahamwe such as the massacres at Bugesera? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then turning to the bottom of the second page and the top of the third page, does the Interahamwe committee complain about the bad behaviour of the Belgian soldiers? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at the end, last paragraph on that page, perhaps the beginning of the next page.  Does the Interahamwe committee invite representative Booh-Booh that if you would like to know more about the organisation of the Interahamwe that the members of the committee are open to a constructive dialogue? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, was there any dialogue between the Belgian contingent or any other UNAMIR representatives and the Interahamwe committee before 6th April l994? 
A.	I know that at a given point in time, people had wanted to organise a meeting between Mr. Dallaire and the committee of the Interahamwe.  And the day on which that meeting was to take place it was cancelled by Mr. Dallaire and Mr. Dallaire agreed to meet with another General.  I think a General from Ghana who did have a meeting with some members of the Interahamwe committee. 
Q.	Were you -- well, with respect to this meeting between the General from Ghana and the Interahamwe leaders, can you tell us from Exhibit P. 9, to your knowledge which persons from the Interahamwe committee attended such a meeting? 
A.	From the Exhibit P. 9, I would mention numbers, 1, 2, 3, I believe 8, and 9 -- and 6 as well. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, I would like you to be shown a document number 13, from the list of exhibits that were sent to The Hague from me and there are two documents in 13.  One is in French and the other one is in English.  So, perhaps you can look at the French.  

Witness G, what is placed in front of you is a report from a UNAMIR officer, named Mark Nees.  N-E-E-S.  It's dated the 17th of March l994.  And he is reporting on a meeting he had with No. 1.  And in his report he relates the contents of this as he records them of that meeting.  So, I would like you to take a look at this exhibit and tell us whether or not you are familiar with this meeting between No. 1 and an officer from the Belgian UNAMIR? 
A.	I have just read the document. 
Q.	And were you aware that (by order of the Court the name has been redacted and put under seal 
	Mr. Kajuga) had met with a member of the Belgian UNAMIR and he had in fact invited them to attend Interahamwe meeting? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, we redact the name.  I suggest you use the phrase, No. 1.
MR. ROBINSON:
I am sorry. 
BY MR. ROBINSON.
Q.	Let me ask you the question again.  Were you aware that No. 1 had spoken with a UNAMIR 
	Belgian representative and invited him to attend meetings of the Interahamwe? 
A.	I wasn't aware of that.  But what I know is that there was a meeting with UNAMIR, and as far as I am concerned No. 1 did not go there alone. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  
The witness mentioned the name of No. 1, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. That name is redacted again.  Mr. Witness, remember to use the numbers on your list when referring to people on it.
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	So, Witness, can you repeat your answer? 
A.	I told you that I wasn't aware of this letter of the 17th of March and as far as I know, No. 1 met members of the UNAMIR contingent, but he definitely did not do so alone. 
Q.	And do you know of any other members of the Interahamwe committee that you can list by number that would have attended such a meeting? 
A.	I told you that in my view it was No. 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 and 6. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, directing your attention to the period of January l994, did a Tutsi friend of yours, tell you, in early January l994, that the RPF would try and kill President Habyarimana if he did not put the government in place? 
A.	Yes, I do recall that there was a Tutsi friend, someone I could joke with.  We were friends.  Now, during the swearing-in, a little bit before the ceremony, he told me that if your president doesn't accept it, he is going to have it tuff.  Yes, that is true.  I was informed of that.  Whether it was true or whether it was a joke, I don't know, but he did tell me that. 
Q.	And was President Paul Kagame quoted on Radio Muhabura as saying that if the Arusha Accords were not implemented they would be forced to accept them at gunpoint 
A.	I think I heard that speech. 
Q.	Now, I would like next, to turn your attention to the 16th of January 1994 and the rally at 
	Nyamirambo stadium which was contained in Exhibit P. 14, at Tab 152.  There was an excerpt of  
	Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech on that occasion.  So, if that can be placed before you.
MR. RAPP: 
Your Honour, I am on my feet at this point just to inquire whether it's Mr. Robinson's intention to exhibit the note which he has at document 13 in both French and English which has been referred to by the witness.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I would actually like to exhibit that document.  I didn't think that I had laid an appropriate foundation.  So, at this time I would offer that as Exhibit D. NZ16A, and if it can be admitted by agreement, I am happy for that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ16A, NZ16B admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, there is actually a French and English. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  The registrar has actually drawn our attention to the A and B.
MR. ROBINSON:
The French being A and the English being B.
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, you have in front of you the contents of Tab 152? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  So, I would like to go through with you now some of the things that Mr. Ngirumpatse said during the speech on the 16th of January l994.  And if you can look at the French transcript, you see on page K0244051.  That's K0244051 which is page 3 of that transcript where the speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse begins.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And for those following in English, it's on page K0244821.

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, I am going to ask you some questions about this speech, but I am just waiting for other people in Arusha to have the document in front of them.  So, just give me a minute and I will have a question for you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I am being asked to repeat the document number.  So, it's Tab 152 and the French is at K0244051.  That's where Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech starts on page 3 of the French transcript within that exhibit.  And for the English within the exhibit it starts at page K0244821.
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	And Witness G, looking at the beginning of Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech, and perhaps counting down four paragraphs from the beginning, does Mr. Ngirumpatse indicate that, "You will recall that at the time after the 1959 disturbances broke out, some persons retired into a house in Kavumu and started compiling a list of people who had to die and who were subsequently killed.  And that now, we observe that some individuals who feel power - " you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then in the next paragraph he says that -- 
A.	Yes, I can see. 
Q.	Okay.  And then in the next paragraph does he say that, "For now -- "
A.	Yes. 
Q.	"For now, we observe that some individuals who feel power has eluded them because the people do not accept them, have started compiling a list of persons who have to die.  And if you look back you will realise that events we went through can reoccur."  Do you see that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And later on two paragraphs down, does he indicate that, "We cannot claim therefore that there's safety while someone is claiming to commit or to compile a list of persons to exterminate.  The blood of President Habyarimana, Justin Mugenzi, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Karemera, Kabagema, Nzirorera and the blood of MRND members will not at all wipe off the republic.  And that my fear, and this is what I keep telling people is that if this blood was shed, they will not benefit from it just like those who killed Ndadaye."  Do you see that?" 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you believe that it was true that in this period of January l994, the leaders of the MRND feared for their own safety as a result of events which were taking place in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes, they were afraid.  The RPF and its contingent was there.  That's why they took army, Interahamwes as guards they were afraid just like everyone. 
Q.	Now, I want to try to call your attention to some other paragraph of this document.  And if you look now on page 5 of the French, and the second four paragraphs from the top does, Mr. Ngirumpatse says that, "Dear members and brothers, we believe what could restore peace is for people to sit down together discuss and share power effectively and equitably without having to kill one another.  And that indeed they are preparing massacres.  And I said we left after we had accepted the Arusha Accords for the Rwandans to have peace.  And we have acknowledged that up to now.  However, I should had that there's no law that compels any party to take part in the government nor is there any law that forces any party to remain there.  So no dictatorship.  We are seeking and working for peace.  All MRND members have certain objective that they will not cause trouble and that they would not like anyone to cause them any".  Was that said by Mr. Ngirumpatse?" 
A.	I am following everything that you are reading. 
Q.	And do you believe that, in fact what Mr. Ngirumpatse said was true that the MRND did not want violence, that they wanted peace? 
A.	Counsel, can I ask you a question.  Can you tell me why they refused the PL Landould MPs. 
Q.	Well, Witness G, I am not supposed to -- in this role, we have to answer questions.  Maybe I can ask you a question that will try to answer that.  

When the PL party split, there were two factions Mugenzi and Landould, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And each of them wanted a certain number of the posts that were allocated to the PL party for ministers, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And each of them wanted the posts that were allocated to members of parliament within the government to the PL party, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And are you aware that the MRND proposed that those posts had to be split equally between the two factions? 
A.	I believe that the MRND was president of the republic.  When the president took the oath to -- the transitional government there was a break.  There was a press release from the presidency announcing the names of the MPs who were to take the oath on that occasion.  The names on the list were the names of the MPs from the PL Landould camp, rather from the PL, Mugenzi camp and not Landould as such. There was no sharing between the two factions. 
Q.	And do you believe that that was done with the intention of exterminating Tutsis? 
A.	No.  I did not say that.  That's not what I said. 
Q.	And this split within the parties, the MDR and the PL those splits were not caused by the MRND, correct? 
A.	That was a PL internal problem. 
Q.	Now turning again to January, 1994, and we could leave the speech of Mr. Ngirumpatse now.  Was there another meeting between the Interahamwe committee and President Habyarimana during this time? 
A.	I believe that I told you that there was a meeting between the president and the Interahamwe committee at his home. 
Q.	And could you tell us who organised this meeting? 
A.	Félicien Kabuga organised the meeting. 
Q.	And can you tell us on P.  9, who attended this meeting on behalf of the committee? 
A.	Numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
Q.	And can you tell us what the president said at this meeting? 
A.	The meeting was not organised by the Interahamwe, but rather by Mr. Kabuga.  He organised the meeting between the president and the members to show the president that these people didn't need anything from the MRND.  They were businessmen some of them.  Others were civil servants, and they managed quite well.  And simply they supported the MRND and its chairman, rather the chairman or the president rather of the republic.  He thanked us, he encouraged them to continue to support the MRND.  And on that occasion, he told the group there that he had spoken with some bank leaders who were going to help by extending credit rather easily.  And so everything was going well.  So if you needed credit you had authorisation to obtain it.  Those who wanted vouchers in MRND represented companies would have them.  Later on, after the meeting or even during the meeting, Ms. Habyarimana was there.  She asked the group there to help the president to understand that by signing the Arusha Accords, he was signing over his life.  You must understand she was vigorant (sic).  She couldn't understand how her husband could have signed the Accords.  His son-in-law Alphonse Ntirivamunda was there.  And you could see that they were harassing the president of the republic by telling him that what he was doing was not good.  To stress that, Ms. Habyarimana launched an appeal for close members of the family to be there.  So, the president saw that it was useless to move forward, because there were so many people there, he did not incite.  He thanked us.  It was very late at night and we left the area. 
Q.	During your meeting with President Habyarimana, did he tell you that he was having problems with the Belgians and the Americans, and asked the Interahamwe if they could make contacts with the embassies so that his position could be made known? 
A.	In fact, yes.  The president of the republic seemingly had problems with the embassies.  He asked the group if there were any amongst them who had friends in the embassies of Belgian and United States.  He asked them to get close to them and inform them that the MRND was not against the 
	Arusha Accords.  He told them to emphasise with those embassies.  He realised that he had to find out whether or not there were people who had friends in those embassies. 
Q.	And President Habyarimana also encouraged the members of the Interahamwe committee to make contact with the MDR and PSD parties and tried to find a way to work together? 
A.	I don't believe that was mentioned.  What I do know is that during the conversations, the president of the republic told us, "The elections were going to take place in two years."  And he had no problem with them.  He said that if they could obtain 20 percent in Gitarama préfecture that could be enough for him. 
Q.	And did it appear to you that the president was receiving pressure from outside in January l994, concerning the future of Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  In fact, during that meeting there was a cabinet meeting that very evening.  On that occasion, they were awaiting results from the cabinet meeting.  He said that he was not sure it was going to happen.  Unfortunately his expectations were not met.  A minister telephoned, giving him a report, saying that he was not sure that there had been an agreement between the parties and the ministers and everything was going to go well. 
Q.	From your observation, did it appear to you that President Habyarimana genuinely wanted peace in Rwanda? 
A.	During that meeting I found that Habyarimana was in favour of peace and power sharing according to the Arusha Accords.  At that meeting, he spoke to us about the refugees at Nyacyonga.  He was concerned a great deal about them.  They were on the doorstep of Kigali.  They were suffering.  It was raining.  Trees were being cut down.  He said that with peace, those people would be able to go home.

1130H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And did you get any indication from President Habyarimana whatsoever that he favoured the extermination of the Tutsis?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness G.  Now, I would like to turn to an event which took place -- or a communiqué which was issued on the 1st of April -- excuse me -- the 1st of February 1994, and this is at tab 87.  So I would ask that you be shown the contents of tab 87 at this time.  
MS. TALON:
By your leave, Mr. President, can we come back to this document maybe after the break?  Because we do not have the English version.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Actually, there is no English version.  So you should just have a French version, but if that's a subtle suggestion that we take a break, perhaps the President would want to do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber bows.  We take the break now. 
(Court recessed from 1132H to 1205H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can resume now, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Mr. President, before we resume with the witness, I just want to correct a mistake that I made with respect to the exhibit that is the photograph of the MRND office in Kimihurura.  I had identified it as ID. NZ10, but it should be ID. NZ9.  So I skipped a number, but I've been asked to correct that.  So if that could be that designation now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, that's correct, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet as well on a small point of housekeeping.  It may be that the transcripts produced by the registry in respect of the 7th of November of 1993 have already gone in as Prosecution exhibits.  Your Honour may recall yesterday, in the thicket of all the various bits of information Mr. Robinson was dealing with, he offered those also as Defence exhibits.  We'll tidy it up at the luncheon adjournment, but one of the things we're anxious to avoid is exhibiting things twice.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  Thank you.  And if we could now turn to Witness G.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And, Witness, do you have in front of you the communiqué of the national committee of the Interahamwe, concerning crucial problems of the country that's dated February 1st, 1994?  
A.	I have it.  
Q.	And do you recall this communiqué being issued by the national committee of the Interahamwe around the 1st of February 1994?  
A.	Yes.  
MR. ROBINSON:
At this time, Mr. President, I will offer the communiqué as Exhibit D. NZ17.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ17 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Looking at this communiqué, Witness G, I think if I could just -- if we could just read along portions of this communiqué together.  First of all, does it indicate that number 1, the national committee of the Interahamwe expresses its support for the Arusha peace agreement?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And second, that the national committee finds that all Rwandans should reinforce their unity and condemn all those who would like to bring them into a war? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And third, that the national committee condemns vigorously, A, all of those who hold illegal demonstrations and impersonate Interahamwe by wearing our uniforms; and B, any person who imputes any criminal behaviour, demonstration, crimes, or any kind of act threatening the national security to Interahamwe with the aim to cover real criminals?  Is that in there?  
A.	Yes, I follow.  
Q.	And four, that the national committee of Interahamwe take this opportunity to inform all Rwandans that there is actually a group of wrongdoers, non-identified, that have made or printed MRND uniforms and logos in some neighbouring countries to tarnish the reputation of MRND and its youth; and that the committee appeals to all militants to search and identify those criminals so that they may face the law; and they offer a reward of 100,000 Rwandan francs to any person who can show the place where the wrongdoers are hiding copies of the uniforms of the MRND; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And in point 5, did the national committee of Interahamwe inform all of its members that from now on, because of security concerns, no one is allowed to put on the Interahamwe uniform until the situation becomes clear?  
A.	Correct.  
Q.	Now, was this communiqué issued because of events that occurred in Kigali, where people who did not have authorisation acted -- created demonstrations and they were blamed on the Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes.  Wearing uniforms, as supposed Interahamwe, but they really were not.  But there were many cases where there were problems with the uniforms.  There were people who wore two different uniforms in one meeting.  They were from the CDR.  They would change sides, and they would become Interahamwe all of a sudden.  There was that problem.  And then as a result, this release was broadcast over the radio.  
Q.	And did the ban on Interahamwes wearing uniforms continue all the way through the end of your time in Rwanda?  
A.	You know, this communiqué was broadcast.  Some people didn't follow it and continued to wear the Interahamwe uniform.  
Q.	Now, also in February of 1994, was an individual by the name of Gatabazi assassinated?  
A.	Yes.  Felicien Gatabazi was assassinated.  
Q.	And what was his position in the government and what political party?  
A.	That man was national secretary of the PSD party.  He was also minister of public works.  
Q.	Was the Interahamwe involved in his assassination?  
A.	Frédéric Nzamurambaho gave an interview.  He was chairman of the PSD party.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
There was a problem.  Could witness kindly repeat his answer?  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, could you please repeat your answer?  We didn't get the translation.  
A.	The morning after Gatabazi was assassinated, Nzamurambaho, Frédéric, the chairman of the PSD party was interviewed about the causes of Gatabazi's assassination.  He blamed everything on the Interahamwe during that interview.  
Q.	Was it true, did the Interahamwe assassinate Mr. Gatabazi?  
A.	Not to my knowledge, no, but that's how people took it.  During the funeral or the wake, if you were an MRND member, you were poorly received.  You were refused access by those people who were at Gatabazi's place.  
Q.	And then after the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi, was there another assassination that took place within the next day or two?  
A.	The chairman of the CDR, Martin Bucyana, was killed.  
Q.	And did the Interahamwe have anything to do with that?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, I would like to turn to the evening of 6 April 1994, when President Habyarimana was assassinated.  Would you agree that the assassination of President Habyarimana was the main course -- was the main cause of the massacres?  
A.	What I could see is that after Habyarimana was assassinated, the massacres began straight away.  
Q.	And would you agree that the person who was responsible for the assassination of President Habyarimana bears a great deal of responsibility for what happened thereafter?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Did you have any advance knowledge that President Habyarimana would be killed?  
A.	No.  
Q.	In fact, one of the persons on Exhibit P. 8 was on the plane with President Habyarimana and also died; correct?  
A.	I don't have that document with me.  
Q.	If you could be shown Exhibit P. 8, and I'll direct your attention to the first person listed under item number 8.  And can you tell us if he was also on the plane with President Habyarimana when he died?  
MR. ROBINSON:
For the information of people in The Hague, Exhibit P. 8 is the document listed "Protected Information of Witness G." 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  There is a person on that document.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And prior to the assassination of President Habyarimana, had you heard of any contingency plans to exterminate the Tutsis upon the death of the head of state?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you have any reason to believe that anyone connected with the MRND or the Interahamwe was responsible for the assassination of President Habyarimana?  
A.	I couldn't tell you.  Personally I was not in favour of that.  Were the others in favour of it?  I have no idea.  It seems there were people in his entourage who didn't want him because he accepted too much and made too many concessions to the opposition.  But that's all I can say.  
Q.	When you heard of President Habyarimana's death, who did you think was responsible at that time?  
A.	Honestly, I can't tell you.  I didn't think about that.  What I do know is that when he was killed, there was a lot of speculation.  I can't tell you who was responsible or not.  The fact remains, the Rwandan population and radio stations, especially the RTLM, blamed the Belgians and the RPF.  
Q.	In your first interview with the Office of the Prosecutor that was recorded, you're quoted as saying that "I believe that the Tutsi were attacking the country to take over Rwanda."  Is that what you thought on 6 April when you heard of the death of the president?  
A.	Frankly, when the assassination took place, I personally thought that the RPF was responsible.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions as to how things stood as of 6 April.  As of 6 April, did you know of any plan to exterminate Tutsis?  
A.	Prior to the 6th of April, at one point it was said in Kigali that the chief of general staff, Deo Nsabimana, had an accident in Kigali.  The car he was driving in had a list of Tutsis inside, and it was a list of Tutsis who were to be eliminated.  That's all I can say.  
Q.	Did you know, from your position within the Interahamwe, of any plan to exterminate Tutsis by the Interahamwe or the MRND?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you, yourself, favour the extermination of Tutsis?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever participate in any joint criminal enterprise to destroy the Tutsis as a group?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you ever hear any of the Accused -- Mr. Ngirumpatse, Mr. Karemera, or Mr. Nzirorera -- in public or private, advocate the extermination of Tutsis?  
A.	No.  
Q.	I'm going to read you a paragraph, and tell me if this is accurate or not, as far as you know.  "During late 1993 and early 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse chaired meetings of the national committee of the Interahamwe in Kigali.  At these meetings, Mathieu Ngirumpatse in concert" -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I'd like to, if I may, enquire where Mr. Robinson is reading from at this point.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  This is paragraph 25 of the amended indictment.  
MR. WEBSTER:
In that case, I would object to this question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, Mr. President, we are here to determine if the allegations of the amended indictment are true.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, what's the legal basis?  What's the legal basis of the objection?  
MR. WEBSTER:
That paragraphs of the indictment should not be read out to the -- to the witness to determine whether he agrees with its contents or not.  If Mr. Robinson wants to ask factual questions, he can do that independently of literally reading out the indictment to the Accused -- to the witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Your Honour, I believe I'm entitled to put a proposition to the witness, wherever I get that proposition from, if it's relevant.  I think the fact that it's from the amended indictment makes it even more helpful to the Trial Chamber to have information on directly what you're going to have to decide.  I don't think there's anything legally wrong with framing a question by putting a proposition that happens to be in the indictment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there's not much difference between what you and Mr. Webster are saying.  It's a question of style.  So perhaps you can get around the objection by rephrasing the question.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, is it true, to your knowledge, that during late 1993 and early 1994, Mathieu Ngirumpatse chaired meetings of the national committee of the Interahamwe in Kigali; and at these meetings, Mathieu Ngirumpatse, in concert with other Interahamwe leaders, prepared lists of persons to be killed and planned a killing campaign against Tutsis and moderate Hutus?  Is that true?  
A.	I did not participate in that meeting.  
Q.	And as far as you know, that statement is not correct; correct?  Is that true?  
A.	You know, with regard to that statement, perhaps there are people who have evidence of that, but the only meeting I participated in, in 1994, with Mathieu was************************************************** ************************.  That's the only time -- or meeting that I had with him in 1994.  
Q.	And were you aware of Mathieu Ngirumpatse or any other Interahamwe leaders preparing lists of persons to be killed and planning a killing campaign against Tutsis and moderate Hutus?  
A.	I told you that I was not aware of that. 
(Pages 15 to 20 by Wendy Molnar)
















      1230H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, is it true that over the course of 1993 and early 1994, Edouard Karemera, Mathieu Ngirumpatse and Joseph Nzirorera often participated in various MRND political party meetings and addressed public gatherings and rallies where they characterised the Tutsi as the enemy, is that true? 
A.	I don't believe that they used the word "Tutsi".  They said "enemy".  We had an enemy at that time, it was the RPF, and the RPF's accomplices.  That's all that they said.  When they said "accomplices", it was understood that those were Tutsis from within who were opposed to the MRND. 
Q.	And did you hear any speeches from Mr. Nzirorera, for example, where he talked about the enemy? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And were you ever aware of any instructions given by the MRND, or Interahamwe leaders, in public or private, that Tutsi women should be sexually assaulted? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, did you become aware that, on the evening of 6th April, 1994, roadblocks were erected in Kigali? 
A.	Yes.  I found out about that subsequently. 
Q.	And is it true that there is a tradition in Rwanda of setting up roadblocks as soon as there was a problem about insecurity? 
A.	Well, this was not authorised by any person whosoever (sic).  There was an authority or an official who had to authorise the setting up of such roadblocks. 
Q.	And do you know who ordered the roadblocks to be set up in Rwanda after the death of the president? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did the national committee--
A.	I do not know who. 
Q.	Did the national committee of the Interahamwe order its members to set up roadblocks after the death of the president? 
A.	What I observed, after the 6th of April, is that people like numbers 6 and 9, when they came to evacuate me, they encountered no problems at the roadblocks, and when we had a chat with them, it would seem that already on the 7th and the 8th of April they had conducted patrols around all the roadblocks in -- in Kigali.  And they were aware of that.  And one could see that they were given due respect at the roadblocks. 
Q.	I understand that, Witness G, but I'm trying to understand who ordered these roadblocks to be set up in the first place, and I will ask you if you ever knew of any plan to erect roadblocks by -- or any orders to erect roadblocks by any members of the national committee.
A.	I am not aware of the person who ordered the setting up of the roadblocks.  While I found the roadblocks, and to this date I do not know who ordered the erection of those roadblocks. 
Q.	And to this day, number 9 has never told you who it was who -- who ordered -- that these roadblocks be erected? 
A.	Number 9 also, when he was at his place, it was thanks to number 6 that he was able to see all the roadblocks.  So he was not aware himself.  And to this date he has not given me any information as to who gave the orders for the roadblocks to be set up. 
Q.	And can you tell us where were you on 6 April when you learned of the death of the president, just in general?  Were you at your home, were you at a bar? 
A.	I was at home.  I was at my home. 
Q.	And then, on the 7th of April, the next day, did you listen to the radio and hear instructions that you were not to leave -- that people were not to leave their residences? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And if you could be shown, please, tab number 245, which I believe is also number 14 on my documents.  It's a communiqué from the ministry of defence.
 
	Witness G, do you have that document, which is number 14, of my documents that I sent there? 
A.	Yes, I have it. 
Q.	And does this appear to be the communiqué, one of the communiqués, which was issued on the 7th of May telling the people to remain indoors -- excuse me, 7th of April? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON:
	Mr. President, at this time I would offer this communiqué which is contained in tab 245, the French version being D. NZ18A, and the English being D. NZ18B? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence.  
	(Exhibit No. D. NZ18A and D. NZ18B admitted)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, this communiqué, after announcing the death of those who perished in the plane with President Habyarimana, does it indicate that the minister of defence called upon the Rwandan people not to lose courage as a result of this painful event, and to avoid any act that may jeopardise public safety? 
A.	That's what is written down. 
Q.	And the last sentence of this communiqué urged the population to remain indoors pending further instructions, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you obeyed those instructions on the 7th of April? 
A.	I did obey those instructions. 
Q.	If you could be shown exhibit -- the exhibit that's at tab 246? 
MR. ROBINSON:
And since this is already in the Prosecution's exhibits, I took the step of offering the French version as D. NZ19A and the English as D. NZ19B. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ.19A and D. NZ19B admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, do you have this communiqué in front of you? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	And directing your attention to the item under number 1, does it ask -- does it indicate that, "The participants in the meeting of the armed forces leaders recommended that they do everything possible, together with the other component departments, to ensure a speedy normalisation of the situation in the country, and that, to this end, the members of the armed forces are earnestly requested to surpass themselves and show restraint and discipline in order to comfort people and to restore order to the country."  Do you see that under number 1? 
A.	Yes, I can see it. 
Q.	And did the members of the armed forces obey that provision? 
A.	I can say -- all I can say is that this was a press release.  I know that, on 7th of April, members of the armed forces themselves began attacking people. 
Q.	So they did not obey this press -- this communiqué, correct? 
A.	I have told you that this is a communiqué.  Now, however that worked out, in practice, was the contrary. 
Q.	And turning to number 4 of this communiqué, does it indicate that, "The senior officials of the Rwandan armed forces invite the population to stay calm and refuse any appeal that could stir up hatred and any kind of violence, and that the people, in particular the youth, must refrain from acts of vandalism, or else be liable to severe punishment."  Do you see that there? 
A.	Yes, that is what is written down. 
Q.	And did the members of the population, and the youth, obey that portion of this communiqué? 
A.	I have told you that on the 7th of April, when I went out of the friends of the house, I saw a minivan transporting Interahamwe whom I knew.  So this communiqué, or this so-called communiqué, was not respected, was not obeyed. 
Q.	Okay, thank you.  Now, I just have a question about your own activities on the 7th of April, and that is that you say that you stayed home that day, but at any portion in the past when you were discussing this day with the OTP, did you ever indicate that a neighbour, who had been ill, had died in the hospital that day, and that you spent the whole day of 7 April in the house of that deceased neighbour after his body was returned to the house, and that you returned to your own house about 9 pm on 7 April?  Did you ever say that?  Have you said that in the past? 
A.	Yeah, I believe I have done so, yes. 
Q.	And so which is true; did you stay home all day in your own house on the 7th, or did you spend the day in the house of a neighbour? 
A.	Well, the neighbour was right next doors (sic).  I didn't spend the whole day at his (sic).  Just part of the day.  And by the way, it wasn't at his home, inside his house.  We were outside.  His house was very small and the women were in the house, so it was 10, 15 metres away from my home.  So I didn't remain at that location.  I moved from his place, to my place now and then, and then I was able to see what was going on at my place as well. 
Q.	Okay.  It's not important, but I was just curious about that.  I'm not insinuating at all that you are not been truthful.  Now, on 7 April, did anyone call you and give you any instructions to join the Interahamwe in killing Tutsis? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You told us that you saw the Interahamwe, or some Interahamwe, on the road, and they said they were on a mission.  Do you know who gave them the orders for that mission? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you have any knowledge that Mr. Nzirorera ordered the Interahamwe to kill Tutsis? 
A.	No.  I'm not aware of any such thing. 
Q.	Now, also on the 7th of April, the RPF was engaged in military activity in Kigali, correct? 
A.	I know that there was some exchange of gunfire. 
Q.	And that was between the RPF and the Presidential Guard, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you also learn that on the 7th, the RPF had infiltrated in Remera, and that relatives of yours could not move from their house? 
A.	I learned about that later on, around the 9th of April, and at that time the RPF had already infiltrated Remera. 
Q.	And as far as you know, had they infiltrated Remera as early as the 7th of April? 
A.	Well, I don't know.  I was in contact with somebody who lived near, and I talked with that person on the 7th and 8th of April, and we had a good communication and he told me everything was okay, and that was number 11.  He lived in that area.  Later on he was taken away by the RPF, you see. 
Q.	And in the evening of 7, is it true that an RPF commando unit had come to your neighbourhood and taken some Tutsi families to the CND? 
A.	Well, there was a commando which infiltrated and came as far as where I was living, and there were two Tutsi families who were my close neighbours.  The next day, on the 7th, we were told that people had taken them off to the CND.  And that was true because they returned after the events of 1994. 
Q.	As of the 7th of April, 1994, at least sometime during that day, is it fair to say that total war had broken out in Kigali? 
A.	I think that war had broken out in Kigali, but Remera, garde présidentielle and CND were the affected areas.  But in Gikongoro, downtown, and the other areas, they were not affected yet, I believe. 
Q.	And then turning to the next day, the 8th of April, did you also remain in the area of your home on that day? 
A.	Yes.  I remained at my home. 
Q.	And if you -- if you could be shown document number 16 from the exhibits that were sent by myself to The Hague, and if that could be placed in front of you.
 
	Witness G, what I have placed in front of you purports to be a transcript in the Kinyarwanda language of an address by President Théodore Sindikubwabo on 8 April, that was broadcast over Radio Rwanda and is contained on cassette number 49.  It bears K-number KO164484.
MR. ROBINSON:
	And at this time I would offer this document as Exhibit D. NZ20. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NZ20 admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'm going to ask you, Witness, if you would please simply -- it's not a long address, and I would ask if you could please simply read it to us, beginning where it starts on the bottom of the first page, the name of Théodore Sindikubwabo and ending a halfway to the third page before another speaker comes.  So if you could slowly please just read this to us. 
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness starts to do that, could I just confirm, is this D. NZ20 or D. NZ19?  
MR. ROBINSON:
My records show that D. NZ19 was the second communiqué from the ministry of defence.  This is D. NZ20.  Can the registry confirm that?  
MR. FRY:
I believe that's correct, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness G, when you're ready, take your time and please can you read this to us? 
A.	 "We asked all officials beginning from the cellules to all discharge their duties.  A short while ago you put forth a suggestion to me, namely, that the number of gendarmes should be increased.  I do understand your proposal, but I do not agree, and I cannot grant your request.  I believe that what I said in French is very clear.  However, I do not quite understand the nature of your request.  I agree with the principle itself, however, I do not agree with the practice, because it is, indeed, contradictory in view of my message of yesterday.  As regards that message which I delivered yesterday, I had called on every member of the population to ensure the security of his or her neighbour, and I insist that each member of the population should behave like a gendarme and ensure that the security of his or her neighbour is guaranteed."  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, sorry to interrupt.  I think I have a mistake here.  I think this is a speech of a later date, perhaps even the 18th of April.  
BY MR ROBINSON:
Q.	So Witness G, excuse me for that, but I think that I have not presented you with the right speech, and I will go back and do some research on that.  Does that appear to be the speech at Gikongoro on the 18th of April? 
A.	I believe it is, yes, because I'm quite familiar with this. 
Q.	Okay.  We'll come to this at a later point in my questioning, but for now I am going to pass this, and I hope if I can find the speech of 8 April before my examination ends.  So let's turn now to the 9th of April and your activities.  Can you tell us, on the 9th of April, did you leave your home? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And were you picked up from your home by number 9? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was he also with number 6? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was there also an individual, named Noël Hitimana, present? 
A.	Hitimana, yes. 
Q.	And he was an announcer for RTLM radio? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then when you and your family left your residence, you said that you saw many bodies, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that number 9 had told you that the killings had been done by their children, referring to Interahamwe members, as you understood it, correct? 
A.	Yeah.  With soldiers, yes. 
Q.	And did number 9 ever tell you who had given the order for Interahamwe to kill Tutsis? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And is it true, also, that number 9 told you that the family of number 1 had been killed by former soldiers of the army and that they didn't know the whereabouts of number 1 at that time? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And then did you go from your own residence to the residence of the family member who is listed as the first person in number 8 of Exhibit P. 8? 
A.	Whose place?
Q.	The residence of the person listed under item 8 on Exhibit P. 8; the first person listed there? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Okay.  Then, as far as the place that you took your family to, can you tell us, without revealing your identity, perhaps with looking at Exhibit P. 8, what location you took your family to on the 9th of April? 
A.	On P. 9 there is no name where I would have taken my family. 
Q.	I'm asking P. 8, looking at Exhibit P. 8. 
A.	Yes, on P. 8, P. 8, number 8, I went to number 1. 
Q.	Okay, I understand.  Thank you.  And how long did you remain there before leaving again? 
A.	Maybe 30 minutes. 
Q.	And then is it true that after leaving that place, you went again with number 6 and number 9 and you went to the RTLM offices? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	And did you go there because number 9 told you he wanted to visit the director of RTLM? 
A.	It is, because we were with Noël Hitimana and he had to stop there.  He worked there and his family was there.  On that occasion number 9 wanted to avail himself of the opportunity to speak to the director of the RTLM. 
Q.	And who was that director? 
A.	Mr. Habimana, Phocas. 
Q.	And are you sure then that it was on the 9th of April that you went to the RTLM? 
A.	Yes, for sure. 
Q.	I note that during your interview with the Prosecutor back in 1997, at cassette number 11, 
	K- number 0111555, you said that you had gone to the RTLM with number 6, number 9 and number 7 on the 12th of April, and in an interview with a foreign government at page number KO295198, you had said that you went to the RTLM on the same day that you first went to the Diplomat Hotel.  So in light of what you have said earlier, are you confident now, as you thought about it, that the first time that you went to RTLM on the 9th of April? 
A.	I do confirm that I went to RTLM on the 9th of April. 
Q.	Okay, thank you very much.  Now, continuing on the 9th of April, after going to RTLM, did you arrive at some point at the residence or bar of number 6? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And while you were there, did you hear leaders of the secteurs telling number 6 that bodies were piling up on the roads and that they needed trucks to haul them away, and number 6 replied that he would try to get trucks from the ministry of public works the next day.  Do you recall that? 
A.	I do not have a clear recollection of that. 
Q.	Now, after leaving the place of number 6, where did you spend the night of the 9th? 
A.	I spent the night of the 9th at number 9's. 
Q.	And in the past, when you have been interviewed by the Office of the Prosecutor, did you tell them that you had spent that night at your sister -- at a relative who's listed on number 8, on P. 8, the first person under item 8.  Have you told the Office of the Prosecutor in the past that you spent the night at that relative's house? 
A.	I don't remember, but what is certain is that I spent the night at number 9's. 
Q.	Now, is it true that the people doing the killing after 6 April were not only members of the Interahamwe, but members of the population? 
A.	Counsel, I haven't quite understood your question. 
Q.	Maybe I should ask you a better way.  It's true, is it not, that the Interahamwe changed after 6 April, or as before 6 April it denoted persons who are the youth of the MRND.  After 6 April, the term "Interahamwe" came to mean youth of all political parties who were not in support of the RPF.  Is that correct? 
A.	That's true. 
Q.	And all -- people from all youth wings were mixed together at roadblocks and essentially everyone had become labelled Interahamwe, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, I want to turn to the next day, the 10th of April, 1994.  And this was the day, you've told us, that you went to the Hotel Diplomat.  Now, in the past, you have said that that took place on the 9th of April, and that you remembered the date of the 10th because you stayed home that day, and I'm quoting from your testimony in the Media trial on the 25th of February, 2002, at page 148, and on the 26th of February 2002 at page 49.  So can I ask you, Witness G, if in the past you have been somewhat uncertain about the dates that these events took place on? 
A.	In the past, yes, I did have some doubt with regard to dates. 
Q.	But as far as you know, at least you're as certain as you can be that the meeting at the Diplomat Hotel took place on the 10th of April, correct? 
A.	What I can tell you is the meeting did take place on the 10th of April at the hotel, The Diplomat.  It was the day after they came to get me on the 9th of April. 
Q.	Okay, and then--
A.	And let me say something else.  It was when numbers 6 and 9 came to pick me up at home on the 9th of April, number 9 told me that he was coming from the hotel, The Diplomat, where the ministers had just taken the oath of office. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, can you tell us then, you went from the residence of number 9 to the Diplomat Hotel on the 10th of April, and who was with you? 
A.	The names?
Q.	The numbers.
A.	There were numbers 6, 7, 8 and 9. 
Q.	And what were you told about this meeting before you got there -- about the purpose of why you were going to the Diplomat Hotel? 
A.	They told us that the government wanted to task us with a mission through Joseph Nzirorera, and that we had to go to the hotel, The Diplomat, to be welcomed by Nzirorera. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us approximately what time of day it was when you arrived at The Diplomat? 
A.	I can tell you that it was towards the end -- the morning of 10 April, 1994. 
Q.	And when you arrived at The Diplomat, did you see any other people on the list P. 9? 
A.	Yes, number 4. 
Q.	And did number 4 participate at the meeting that you had at the Diplomat on the 10th? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived at the Diplomat Hotel, there were many people there, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And those included ministers and prominent people from Rwandan society, correct? 
A.	Correct. 
Q.	And also, you noticed that there were Tutsi businessmen and Tutsi families who had taken refuge at the Diplomat Hotel, correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Now, when you arrived at the hotel, can you tell us where you met Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	I met Nzirorera in one wing of the hotel, the Diplomat, right near the main restaurant, which was there at the time. 
Q.	So you were not in a private hotel room, but you were in a public area, is that correct? 
A.	No, it was not in a room.  From where we were, you could see the main road, Kigali's main boulevard. 
Q.	So were you in a meeting room or a part of the restaurant, or what part of the hotel were you actually in? 
A.	On the restaurant terrace in the hotel, the Diplomat. 
Q.	So you were outdoors? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And were there other people on that terrace also at other tables? 
A.	When we arrived, it was empty.  No one was there.  No, there was no one.  There was only when we returned.  I don't remember if it was when we got there, or when we left from that mission that there were two people seated at that same terrace. 
Q.	Well, when you first arrived at the terrace then, and the members of the committee that you've told us were there, were present, and Mr. Nzirorera was present, was anyone else there? 
A.	Edouard Karemera and Justin Mugenzi. 
Q.	Now, are you sure that those two individuals were present at your meeting when you met with Mr. Nzirorera in the late morning of the 10th of April? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, could you tell us then, who was the one who spoke when the meeting commenced? 
A.	Joseph Nzirorera. 
Q.	And did Mr. Nzirorera tell you that the government had asked him to ensure that the massacre stopped? 
A.	He told us that the government tasked him with a mission, that he should go to see the Interahamwe, his Interahamwe.  I'm using the possessive; that they should stop the killings and pick up the bodies all along the road.  And the next day they sent trucks from the ministry of public works to pick up those bodies. 
Q.	But staying with what Mr. Nzirorera told you, and the morning of the 10th, he told you that the government had given him a mission to contact the -- his Interahamwe and to get them to help stop the killing, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And Mr. Nzirorera was now telling you, those who are assembled there, that he wanted you to go out around the secteurs of Kigali and tell the people to stop the killing, correct? 
A.	To stop the killings, and to pick up the bodies, and get them out of there. 
Q.	Now, in fact, the presence of a large number of bodies on the streets of Kigali created a very dangerous health situation, did it not? 
A.	It could have created a health hazard.  The fact is, though, that the international community started showing up in Kigali.  They were afraid that those journalists would report on what they were seeing. 
Q.	Well, Witness G, isn't it a fact that the international Red Cross was already in Kigali on the 10th of April, 1994, and had specifically asked the prime minister to organise the collection of bodies from the streets? 
A.	I'm not sure.  But I could see people from the Red Cross picking up bodies, and sometimes they had problems with peoples -- with people who were at the roadblocks because those from the Red Cross were hiding Tutsis underneath the dead bodies.  And so the Red Cross had problems with those stationed at the roadblocks. 
MR. ROBINSON:
If the registry could show to Witness G item number 17 on the list of exhibits that were faxed to The Hague. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, if you could let me know when you have that document in front of you.  It's an excerpt from testimony by Jéan Kambanda at the Appeals Chamber.

	Witness G, do you have that document, the excerpt of Prime Minister Kambanda's testimony? 
A.	I do. 
Q.	And does that refresh your memory as to whether or not the Red Cross was asking the government to remove the bodies from the streets of Kigali for health reasons? 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm just on my feet at the moment.  I don't object to the general thrust of the questioning, but this is not a memory-refreshing document.  This is somebody else saying what he learned as a result of other conversations with other people.  It can't be a memory-refreshing document in respect of this witness.  I'm not objecting to the general elicitation of the evidence, but it's not a memory-refreshing document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, when your leader was examining in-chief, I had thought we had looked at the legal position, and we permitted the witnesses to refresh his memory from documents that he had not prepared, and it was suggested that he could refresh his memory from anything as a matter of law.
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes, except that the witness has already said that he wasn't aware of the Red Cross talking to the prime minister.  So it doesn't refresh his memory to read the prime minister saying that he had spoken to the Red Cross.  It's simply something that the witness wasn't aware of.  But my learned friend is entitled to elicit from the testimony that this is what the prime minister said.  All I'm doing is identifying the fact that it's not memory refreshment.  It's simply elicitation of evidence by a different means. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I can rephrase my question.  That would be the simplest -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, and remember the time. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I think we can finish with this question. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, can you tell us, having now read this document, whether you were aware, or you are aware, that the Red Cross was requesting the interim government to remove the bodies from Kigali for health reasons? 
A.	In this document Kambanda says that, starting on the 12th of April, we began doing that.  On the 10th of April I was in a meeting.  There were already bodies as early as the 6th of April.  We were in a meeting on the 10th of April, in the evening.  There were killings in Kigali, such that the dead bodies on the roads grew in number.  So the 12th of April is after the 10th, I hope, and on the 10th, when we were at the hotel, The Diplomat, I personally saw a woman, I think, from the newspaper, Liberation, who was with minister Eliézier Niyitegeka at the hotel, The Diplomat.  This is to illustrate that the international community had already begun showing up in Kigali. 
Q.	Yes, Witness G, there's no dispute that the international community was present in Kigali.  In fact, UNAMIR was in Kigali on the 10th of April, correct? 
A.	For a long time. 
Q.	So, I guess my question to you, or my suggestion to you, is that the reason for removal of the bodies may well have been a sanitary or health-related reason.  Will you accept that? 
A.	Yes.  It could have caused epidemics, that's correct. 

MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President.  Thank you very much, Witness G, and I think we can take our lunch break now, if the President wishes. 
MR. SOW:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW:
Before we break, I wanted to address a concern that I have with regard to your decision of this morning.  Thank you for giving us an extension of time limit to respond, but as you know, the Defence for Karemera is still facing translation issues with regard to documents, and so the problem for us remains whole.  We are faced with this unfortunate situation, Mr. President.  I simply wanted to address that concern with you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, is there a special proposition?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  It would be desirable to liaise with the language section to make sure that that translation is provided as shortly -- as quickly as possible, because it is difficult for us to participate in the proceedings without the translation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay. Well, that could best be accomplished by communication through our trial coordinator who is already actively engaged in association with translation issues.  So that may be the best -- the most appropriate way of getting some positive responses. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You can take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1335H) 
(Pages 21 to 32 by Jennifer Spring)









(Court resumed at1530H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
 Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Robinson, are you ready to resume?  We can now resume. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, good afternoon? 
A.	Good afternoon. 
Q.	After the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera and others on the terrace of the Hotel de Diplomat, did all the members of the Interahamwe committee proceed to the secteurs or was there someone or more who did not accompany the others? 
A.	I did not quite understand the question.  Was it before or after we had provided the report?  What is the question, Counsel? 
Q.	Yes, I am sorry.  After the meeting with Mr. Nzirorera and the others on the late morning of the 10th of April at the Diplomat hotel, is it true that all of the members of the Interahamwe committee with the exception of Number 4 went out to the secteurs together? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And, did you all go in the same vehicle? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were escorted by soldiers; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And as I understand it, you first went to Byogo secteur; correct? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	And at Byogo secteur, No. 6 told the people that the government had given them the mission to stop the massacres; correct? 
A.	To stop the killings and to bring back the dead bodies.  That is correct. 
Q.	And the people to whom he spoke accepted that order; correct? 
A.	Yes, from my understanding, they seemed to agree with what No. 6 had said.
Q.	And then the next secteur you went to was Nyamirambo; correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And again No. 6 spoke and the people accepted to stop the killings; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then you went to Nyakabanda secteur; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And No. 5 spoke about Nyakabanda secteur and the people accepted to stop the killings; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then you went to Kimisagara secteur; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And there was a lady there named Rose who wanted to go and kill more Tutsis; correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And No. 6 spoke, and convinced the people that they had to stop killing Tutsis and they ultimately agreed; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And then you went to Gasata secteur, Gatsata; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And there No. 9 spoke, and the people agreed to stop the killings; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And also in that secteur, you met Colonel Mugiruka there; correct? 
A.	Colonel Mugiruka. 
Q.	And did you seek that colonel in the area of Gatsata secteur when you were making your tour? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And was he a colonel in the army? 
A.	Yes, he was a colonel in the army. 
Q.	And when you told him what you were doing, did he say that that was a good thing because the military had been unable to stop the killing? 
A.	I do not believe that he said that the soldiers were not able to put an end to the killings.  Well, I believe that he was the head of military operations in Kigali secteur and Gasara was in his area over which he had control.  And, I believe, that he was familiar, very familiar with No. 9.  They talked among themselves about killings to be stopped by soldiers, but I didn't quite follow what they were saying.  But we were there to tell the population to stop the killings.  
Q.	Well, in your interviews with the Prosecution back in 1997 in cassette No 19, at page K0111812, you told them that you met Colonel Mutaruka in the area of Gatsata secteur and he said it was a good thing what you were doing because the military had been unable to stop the killing.  Now, is that wrong or you simply do not recall anymore? 
A.	What you have just said is not the same thing as what they said. I am sorry, but you might need to consult the translators. 
Q.	Okay.  Well, this is not a big point, so let me move on.  Now, after Gatsata secteur -- 
A.	It is very important.  It is very important because it led to you - - to consult what I had said, and therefore, you come to the conclusion that maybe what I said initially was not correct.  So, something is being said here and I think it needs to be cross-checked. 
Q.	Okay.   So, just wait one minute, and I am going to get the exact text, and I am going to read it to you. 
A.	I am not challenging the text.  I am talking about the translation, the previous translation what of you talked about.  They said that the soldiers had stopped the killings whereas in the text, I said that he said that the soldiers were not able to stop the killings.  Those are different things. 
Q.	Okay, I think you are right. There is a translation problem because I was asking you that very thing.  So let us start all over and see if we can get this right.  What I am asking you is that when you met 
	Colonel Mugiruka, he said that the military had not been able to stop the killings; correct? 
A.	Yes, I believe so. 
Q.	Thank you, for calling that to my attention.  I think it was just a translation problem.  Okay, now after Gatsata secteur, did you try to go to Kimihurura secteur? 
A.	Kimihurura, well, we had difficulties getting to Kimihurura.  This was an area we weren't quite certain about and the RPF wasn't present in that location. 
Q.	Did you say the RPF wasn't present in that location or the RPF was present in that location?  
A.	It was thought that the RPF was already at Kimihurura.
Q.	So, the translators, maybe, we are all tired this afternoon, but I would appreciate, I know it is a very difficult job, but I would appreciate it if you could try to pay a little more attention and try to get this exactly correct, and maybe I will go a little bit slower.  Now, you were unable to go to 
	Kimihurura secteur; is that correct? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Okay.  Maybe that was a bad way to ask the question.  Were you able to go to Kimihurura secteur? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you go to Muhima secteur? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And at Muhima secteur, did No. 8 speak and ask the people to stop the killing and the people agreed? 
A.	Yes, I think so. They agreed. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And then did you go to Gikondo secteur and No. 6 spoke? 
A.	I believe so. 
Q.	And the people accepted to stop the killing there? 
A.	Yes, they accepted. 
Q.	And after Gikongoro secteur, did you return to the Hotel Diplomat? 
A.	Yes, we returned to Hotel Diplomat. 
Q.	And, when you arrived at the Hotel Diplomat for the second time on the 10th of April, can you tell us approximately what time of the day it was? 
A.	I believe it was between 6:00 and 6:30. 
Q.	And when you arrived there, did you find Mr. Nzirorera? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And where was it that you met with him on the second time on the 10th of April? 
A.	We met at the same spot where we met for the first time.  That is at the restaurant of the 
	Hotel De Diplomat. 
Q.	And, can you tell us who was present besides the same members of the committee who had gone on the secteur tour and Mr. Nzirorera?   Who else was there? 
A.	Karemera and Mugenzi were present. 
Q.	And again, are you sure about that? 
A.	I am very certain, very sure.
Q.	And, were there other people at other tables on that terrace, when you returned for the second time on the 10th? 
A.	There were two other persons who were seated on another table at some distance from ours in the restaurant.  So, there were two other people who were members of the MRND who were present rather. 
Q.	Do you remember who those two persons were? 
A.	I believe they were Charles Nyandiwi and Mr. Simeon, if my recollection doesn't fail me.
Q.	And, could you tell us that second name, again, Simeon, I didn't catch that exactly?  Who was the second person? 
A.	Mr. Simeon.  He was a minister at the presidency, probably Nteziryayo Simeon, something like that. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, which members of the Interahamwe committee made the report about the tours of the secteurs at this meeting? 
A.	Number 6, 7, 8, 9 and 5.  
Q.	And, what was the report that was given to Mr. Nzirorera and the others? 
A.	They were told that the mission on which we had been commissioned had been properly conducted and that the population had taken good note of what had been requested of them.  And they told us that they would do or comply with what we had asked them to do.  Those who were at the roadblocks where we had meetings, where there was no secteur, they were asking for ammunition and weapons.  That was the report that was submitted to Nzirorera's group. 
Q.	So, the committee reported that their mission had been a success, in the sense that they had asked the people to stop the killings and the people had agreed; correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	And, now are you saying that during the tour of the secteurs on 10th April, people at the roadblocks, the local population, manning the roadblocks had complained of a lack of weapons? 
A.	No, I am not saying that they did not have enough weapons.  In those secteurs I noticed that they were in possession of traditional weapons at the roadblocks.  So, what they were requesting was for firearms, guns and grenades because all they had was traditional weapons.  
Q.	Now, I want to direct your attention, I am going to quote from something that you said before when you were  interviewed by a foreign government in the year 2000, and this is at cassette No. 3, at 
	page K0295198, and you were describing this tour of the secteurs, and you talked about the people who delivered the message, and then the questions they asked you are the following questions:  "Did you know of instances where the local population or people manning roadblocks complained of lack of weapons and then you gave the following answer: "As regards weapons during the periods from 7 to 13th, we did the tour, there was no mention of weapons because weapons were distributed from the large scale.  Distribution was done as from 14 April and before the large scale distribution.  Apart from the few weapons the Interahamwe had, the large scale distribution took place as from 14 April 1994. So, Witness G, when you gave that answer in the year 2000, was it your belief that the people at the roadblock had not in fact asked for firearms as of at the time of your tour? 
A.	Maybe you did not quite understand me.  During the tour, those who were manning the roadblocks did not have firearms.  They had traditional weapons.  So, they were wondering if it was possible for everything to be done to ensure that those people were given firearms, because they didn't have firearms.
Q.	What about firearms that had been distributed in 1993 to the secteurs? 
A.	The firearms that were distributed in 1993 were distributed to MRND, people of the MRND secteurs and they were distributed for purposes of protection, and those secteurs also had some weapons.  Now, what I want to say is that during our tour, I saw at many or several roadblocks persons manning those roadblocks in possession of traditional weapons.
Q.	But since you were delivering a message to the people to stop the killing, what reason did the people then give for asking for firearms?
A.	As far as, I know, they asked for arms or weapons because from the 6th to 10th of April, messages were broadcast on the radio indicating to the population the advances and the infiltrations of the RPF in the Kigali area.  And to the RPF people were armed with firearms.  So, the population felt threatened because of that.  Radio Mille Coline was conveying this information.  And also playing up for the war, informing the population about the position of the enemy, and where the enemy might surface.  So people were frightened at that time.
Q.	So is it your understanding that while you were asking them to stop the killing of Tutsi civilians, the population wanted to have firearms so that they could defend themselves against the RPF? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, during -- when it was reported that the people at the roadblocks had asked for firearms, did 
	Mr. Nzirorera, or anyone else at that meeting make any response to that? 
A.	No one reacted to that request for firearms. 
Q.	Now, after the meeting at the Hotel de Diplomat with Mr. Nzirorera, Mr. Karemera and Mr. Mugenzi, what happened next? 
MR. MORLEY: 
Sorry, Your Honour -- I am on my feet at this stage for moving on to another topic because I have listened very carefully to Mr. Robinson's questions of Witness G or perhaps Witness G, might take his headphones off for the moment, please I cannot be concerned if they are off. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, the witness has taken off his headset. 
MR. MORLEY: 
In my home jurisdiction, at this point, it would not be uncommon to establish exactly from the questioning that Mr. Robinson has conducted.  What his case is about presence of Nzirorera at the Diplomat hotel on the 10th of April, he has asked the witness whether he was sure that Nzirorera was there in the morning, and whether he was sure that he was there in the afternoon.  But he has never suggested to the witness that Nzirorera was not there.  He has also asked the witness whether he was sure that Mr. Karemera was there on the two occasions.  And he has never suggested that 
Mr. Karemera was not there.  And it is my respectful submission that Mr. Robinson from the way he has conducted his questioning, is in a position to say whether it is his case that Mr. Nzirorera was at the Diplomat hotel.  Or if it is his case that Nzirorera was not at the Diplomat hotel, that ought to be put to the witness that it is something that has been positively challenged.  So, I invite Your Honour to invite Mr. Robinson to say which it is, please. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Robinson, please. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, I don't believe the rules of this Tribunal require me to state my case to a witness and I believe I am free to question the witness, and they will hear our case when we present our Defence, and if I do, I have something in particular to put to the witness, I am free to do it, but I don't believe, I am required to do that in this jurisdiction
MR. MORLEY: 
Well, it's only in fairness to the witness, if there is a positive case being put, that Mr. Nzirorera was not at that meeting, that he was not at the Diplomat hotel, then the  witness ought to be allowed to hear that question and answer it because part of my learned friend's duties as a questioner, as Your Honours  would have made out in the forefront of your minds, is to give a witness an opportunity to answer fair questions in order to assist the Tribunal and just because Mr. Robinson may not do this back in California, it is my respectful submission, he ought to make clear to this witness whether he is challenging the presence of Nzirorera and Karemera.  It's not enough to simply say, "Are you sure he was there.  That is my respectful submission.  

My learned friend, Mr. Webster has been extremely helpful as always.  He has identified Rule 90, testimony of the witness, Rule 90(G) (ii) which reads, if I may assist, Your Honours, "In the cross-examination of a witness who is able to give evidence relevant to the case, for the 
cross-examining party, counsel shall put to that witness the nature of the case of the party for whom that counsel appears which is in contradiction of the evidence given by the witness?"  That seems if I can put it this way to bang on point. I invite Mr. Robinson to put to the witness if Mr. Nzirorera is saying he was not there. 

MR. ROBINSON: 
Excuse me, Mr. President, if I can just respond to that.  I am trying to call up the rule at this very moment, but we had this before and I believe if you look at the exact wording of the rule, it is limited to situations where the witness is being asked to give evidence on behalf of the cross-examining party which is essential evidence beyond the scope of direct examination as I understand, it and that is not the case.  With this examination, I am cross-examining on matters covered by the direct examination.  I don't believe that that Rule 90(G) (ii) in the circumstances applies to put to the witness - - 
MR. MORLEY: 
If I may.  It is not a by - - I just don't understand at all what my learned friend has just said.  It doesn't seem to be at all in keeping with what the rule says.  I don't think it makes any sense, unless I am being damned. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We don't think that we ought to order cross-examining counsel to put any particular question or matter to a witness. 

As we understand the rule, however, the impact of not disclosing contradictions during the testimony of a witness may surface if on the Defence case contradictory testimony is given, and we have to make an evaluation about what to believe.  The conduct of cross-examination may have an impact on the quality whether that is attached to the testimony which is given at that time.  So, I don't have that sufficient indication at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, with all due respect, Mr. President, it's not quite sufficient because I am not very clear myself.  I don't want to do anything in my cross-examination that will in any way diminish the weight of evidence to be represented in our case.  But if I could just go back to the Rule, because-- maybe I don't  understand it the way you understand it or visa-a-visa.  In 90(G) (i), it says that cross examination should be limited to the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief, and matters affecting credibility to the witness, and an additional matter, where the witness is able to give evidence relevant to the case for the cross-examining party to the subject matter of the entire case.  So that last clause seems to be - - that means to me that when you are asking something beyond the scope of the direct examination, you are now into this area of giving evidence relevant to the case of the cross-examining party.  

And then Rule G (ii) says that in that instance when you are asking someone to give evidence relevant to the case of the cross-examining party, that being the instance that is beyond the scope of direct examination, then you should put to the witness the nature of the case of the party for whom counsel appears which is in contradiction to evidence given by the witness.

Now, the subject of the meeting at the Hotel Diplomat was definitely covered by the subject matter of the evidence-in-chief, and I don't see how reading this rule can be required to put my case to the witness concerning those events that were covered by the subject matter in chief, and I don't want to be penalised later if I don't do that.  So I think it is important that we clarify this. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It's not a question of penalty, Mr. Robinson. Rule G (i) says that cross-examination shall be delivered to the subject matter of the evidence in chief and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.  If the witness says and just take a case in point , the witness says, "Mr. Nzirorera was present at a particular location" and you don't challenge him on that and then subsequently you ask the Court to believe that the witness was lying about that because it became your case that Mr. Nzirorera was not present at that location.  The fact might be that you did not give the witness a chance to comment on that challenge.  It's a factor which will feature into our determination of what to believe. I think it's a normal way of looking at cross-examination in terms of a witness speaking of an issue under a particular issue or not.
MR. ROBINSON: 
It may be normal in your jurisdiction. It's not normal in mine and it's also not covered by this rule. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But it says this is cited really under 90G (i) not 90(G) (ii) as a matter of fact and credibility. 
MR. ROBINSON:   
Right but under 90(G) (i), you don't have to put your case to the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is not a case of putting your case as Mr. Morley referred to G (ii) which says putting your case recommended on an issue affecting credibility.  If you ask us subsequently to say that the witness is lying in relation to a particular fact, and the witness was never challenged on that particular fact, we will take that into account when we are considering your submission that the evidence is underlying that fact, that is all what I am saying.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And by challenging the witness on that fact, for example, if I ask the witness, "Are you sure?"  And so it's clear that the witness has said, "Yes, this person was at this place at this time."  Am I required to go any further than that?  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is what we said; we are not ordering you to go any further.  You see, I cannot order you to go any further than that. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, but I don't want to make a mistake.  It's not a question if being ordered.  I don't want to make a mistake so that I insufficiently cross-examined a witness to find out in your judgment that because I did not put some affirmative assertions to the witness you are-- you are diminishing somehow the weight of my case. 

MR. PRESIDENT: 
You, see, we do not know what your case is, and we don't think that we can direct you to disclose your case at this time; it's not our intention to make that decision.  We don't -- we are not expecting you to disclose your case and that is not what we are ordering but if at the same time we have to evaluate the credibility of the witness of such, under a particular fact, we are going to look on the surrounding circumstances as to how the witness was questioned, how the witness answered and we look at the other evidence related to that fact in coming to our conclusion.  I am not sure if I can be more specific at this stage because I am -- 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, let me give you a concrete example and see if I am misunderstanding because I do not want anything that's not sufficient.  With respect to a meeting we discussed earlier at the Ribero hotel in 1993, Mr. Nzirorera does not recall being present at that meeting.  The witness, I asked the witness, "Are you are sure that Mr. Nzirorera was there?"  And he says, "Yes, I am sure one hundred per cent."  Now, am I required to now say to that witness, in order for you to accept later on that I have done nothing to diminish the weight of my own case, am I required to take a further step and say to the witness?
 "Mr. Nzirorera contents that you are mistaken and that in fact he was not there?"  Are you requiring me to take that step of putting that case to the witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, just in relation to that particular example, you did that because you did put to the witness that 
Mr. Nzirorera did not recall being present at that meeting.  So but we are not saying that you are necessarily obliged to do it, but in relation to that particular example, you did challenge the witness very directly in that way. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Well, if I had not done that would it be necessary for me to do that in order for you to feel I had not diminished our chance of -- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
No, no. I don't know how to answer that question because I am not saying anything as specific as that.  I am just saying it's a factor that features into the evaluation of credibility.  I am not certain if I have been sufficiently helpful. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, I still  feel a little ambiguous how much affirmative information I need to put to the witness, but I guess I will just take the cautious approach and put the information affirmatively because I don't want my case to be diminished in your eyes in anyway by my cross examination. So --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You see, I am not overruling one way or the other, but at the end of the day we have to decide what we believe is the truth.  And these are factors which are considered when we are determining the truthfulness of a witness. You have to decide how you present your case in this context, but we thought we should alert you that is a factor which we take into account in deciding what testimony to believe. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay, I understand, I appreciate that so I will try and conduct myself accordingly.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Really. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Robinson, it may be that in certain situations, if you try to juggle the witness's memory, he may then admit  the proposition you put to him, but if you don't, then his answer stands and then subsequently you try to discredit that answer when you have not given the witness the opportunity to either recollect or to find out whether he was mistaken then your task of impugn his testimony part or on that point becomes a much greater burden, you understand because the witness has been not given an opportunity to find out whether he may have been mistaken by putting across, you know  your version to him.  I hope you get the point. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I get that point and I wasn't aware that I was required to do that but now that may be you are telling me that I am not required to do that but it would be better to do it.  So, I think I am getting that point and I am going to do it.  So thank you. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay if we would have Witness G put his earphones back please. 
MS. TALON: 
The witness has put his headphones back on. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, we have talked about the two meetings that we had at the -- that you had at the 
	Hotel de Diplomat on the 10th of April of 1994 and I want to suggest to you that you have made a mistake as to the persons who were present at both of those meetings and that in fact, Mr. Karemera was not present at either of these meeting?   I am not accusing you of lying, but I am suggesting that you are mistaken in your recollection as to that point.  Could you comment on that please? 
A.	What I can tell you is that I confirm what I had said and I will stand by my word.  I was present and so was he. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much.  Now, moving on the 10th after meetings at the Hotel Diplomat, where did you spend the night? 
MR. MORLEY: 
So I am on my feet again before the witness answers.  I just want to be sure I understood exactly what Mr. Robinson has done a moment ago.  Perhaps, if the witness might take his headphones off please and it can be confirmed that they are now off.  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Yes, he has removed them. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Thank you.  From the question which has just been put, I understand Mr. Robinson to be accepting that Nzirorera was there, but through Nzirorera's presence disputing that Karemera was there.  Is that the point of what has just been put?  Or does Mr. Robinson have yet to put that Mr. Nzirorera wasn't there. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we have ruled that we are not directing Mr. Robinson to put his case to disclose his case at this stage, but he has put a question and from it one can make a deduction, but we are not directing him to put his case. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honour, yes, but he has chosen to put a positive aspect and we welcome that just saying that won't there be any misunderstanding it seems pretty plan as Your Honour put it as a matter of deduction that it is Mr. Nzirorera's positive case, and as a result of that question that he was present and saying through his counsel that Karemera wasn't, and if I have misunderstood that. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
That is exactly what we said we are not ordering Mr. Robinson to do. 
MR. MORLEY: 
But he has done it.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well if he has done it he has done it. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Yes, and now that he has done it, I am simply seeking clarity that that is what he has done I am not asking Your Honour to order anything, I am seeking clarity now that he has done it although 
Your Honours, didn't order him to do it so that it is clear that what he has done as he said that Nzirorera was there. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we are never going to get on it.  Everything on the record needs to be clarified over and over again.  He has asked a question, and he has got an answer and it is already on the record. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Your Honours yes, I am not in the habit of seeking clarification.  This is I think the first time I ask for clarification over the way my learned friend is conducting his case.  It is the only time I have done it and it is big a subject, please the presence at the Diplomat Hotel.  So on this one point it having been raised, it having been done by Mr. Robinson, if I have misunderstood what has been put I would welcome his correction. 
JUDGE SHORT: 
Mr. Morley, you might draw inferences from the questions and answers, and the questions just as we would draw our own inference.  If you think there is need for clarification on a particular issue, you can do that in re-examination. 
MR. MORLEY: 
Okay.  I am sorry, Your Honour, I didn't hear the end of your sentence. 
JUDGE SHORT:   
I said that you must draw inferences from the questions and answers and it is not appropriate to be asking whether this is what counsel has done or not and if you think there is some ambiguity, you have the opportunity during re-examination to clarify such an ambiguity. 
MR. MORLEY: 
This is not a matter of ambiguity for re-examination; it's a matter of clarity as to what Mr. Robinson is putting. I can't elicit from the witness what Mr. Robinson's case is.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
But we have just ruled that Mr. Robinson is not obliged to state what his case is and we can rule that, so I think there is enough.

Mr. Robinson, please continue with your cross-examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON: 
Q.	Witness G, can you tell us where you spent the night of the 10th of April?
MS TALON: 
Can Mr. Robinson please put that question to the witness again because he didn't have his earphones on?  Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, thank you, Witness G.  Can you tell us where you spent the night of the 10th of April? 
A.	The night of the 10th of April, I spent the night in the home of a family where my family was sheltered. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you about some other events during the day of the 10th of April concerning efforts to stop the killing and I would like you to be shown, first Document Number 20, from the packet that I faxed to the Hague which is entitled, "Communiqué of the political parties MRND, MDR, PSD, PDC and PL on the 10th of April". 
MR. ROBINSON:   
And Mr. President, I have an English version of this and I would like to disturb the Registrar distribute.    May the registrar be asked to come and collect my English version? 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I must say I didn't quite get whether this document is the - - which document is this now?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
This is document 20 in my bundle, yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, do you have the document of the communiqué issued by the political parties in front of you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And it's true, is it not that while you were out on the 10th of April in the secteurs trying to get people to stop the killing, the five political parties made a communiqué to be broadcast on the radio also asking people to stop the killing? 
A.	I can see this communiqué.  What can I add to it?  
Q.	Well, it's true, isn't it that this communiqué issued on the 10th of April, the political parties strongly urged all Rwandans and foreigners living in Rwanda to remain calm and they said that they must understand that every individual's security is a necessity which must be safeguarded by each and every person respecting, and that the party officials, therefore called on its members of the parties to set an example and to make effort to restore security in the country regardless of the their party membership ethnic group and region or origin; correct? 
A.	Yes, I am reading it as you are. 
Q.	And it's also true that in this document the political parties called upon the administrative bodies close to the population to make every possible to immediately put an end to these disturbances, massacres and looting throughout the country and in particular in towns and the political parties requested the forces of law and order to punish without delay anyone infringing the law or instructions aimed at restoring security.  And then they asked the government in particular to study how the conseillers, the head of the cellules and the neighborhoods could receive urgent information so that together with the people and the armed forces, they could provide the people with security so as to ensure that none becomes a victim of attacks anymore; is that correct? 
A.	Counsel, I would like to tell you one thing:  The media communiqué is asking the population to stop the killings, they're not making a communiqué to stop the RTLM radio from sowing seeds of discord in the population.  Do you understand that?  
Q.	Well, let's go step by step and I will be answering that question in a minute, but first of all would you agree that on the 10th of April the five parties including the MRND issued a communiqué in which they called on people to stop the killing? 
A.	Yes, that's what was written in this communiqué. 
Q.	The communiqué was broadcast on Radio Rwanda and RTLM as well.  Correct?  
A.	I believe so. 
Q.	So on the 10th of April, you were sent to the secteurs to try to stop the killing and the five political parties issues a communiqué to try and stop the killing; correct? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, actually, I would like to offer this communique in French as DNZ21A and the English as 21B.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Admitted. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ21A and D. 21B admitted) 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, witness G, I would now like you to be shown the contents of tab 164 in the Prosecution exhibits that are there in The Hague and in particular when you have that exhibit, I will give you the number of the page I would like you to look at. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Meanwhile, Mr. President, the English -- this is a radio Rwanda broadcast and there are French, English and Kinyarwanda transcripts within it and the English version of this particular passage that 
I am going to be dealing with is on page K0330132 and in French it would be at K0260673.  

Mr. President, as long as your staff is trying to assemble these tabs; this would be an effective time to take a break. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Okay.  Are you going to be completing this afternoon? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, I am not even going to be close
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay. 
(Court recessed at 1640H).
(Pages 33 to 46 by Petrus Chijarira)
















1710H  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, we can resume now.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, good afternoon.  Before we go back to the witness, I would like to revisit an issue that we said we would revisit today, concerning whether I can have to cross-examine Mr. MABANIKIZA and between cross-examining Witness G.  And it's obvious my cross-examination of Witness G is not going to be completed today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Well, we plan -- we, in fact are going to modify our order.  We plan to address the scheduling issues at close of day this afternoon. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Very well, I will proceed with my cross-examination then.  Thank you. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, you have in front of you the French version of what's been in Tab 164 which has
MR. ROBINSON:
If we can have the witness put on the headphones on, please.  Okay.  I think, Mr. President, I am going to start by offering an exhibit then I will set the K numbers of this exhibit, so give everyone chance to get it. 

From Tab 164, of the Prosecution's binders, I am going to offer three exhibits which are pages from this -- from this Tab, containing an excerpt of a speech addressed by Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So, first of all, the Kinyarwandan text is found in Tab 164, at pages KO144210 going on to the end of that page.  So that's a one page of Kinyarwandan.  And I am going to ask that that particular page from Tab 164 be marked as Exhibit D. NZ22A.  Then turning to the French within Tab 164, there's page K0260673 and 0674, and I am going to ask that that be marked as Exhibit D. NZ22B.  And then the English can be found within Tab 164 at page K0330132.  And I am going to be asking that that be marked as 
D. NZ22C.   So is everybody -- Mr. Webster is on his feet, so --  
MR. WEBSTER: 
Just a point of clarification because we had met -- the parties had met before trial started.  And my recollection is that we agreed for these transcripts, and videos, and audios, that we would simply put in the entire transcript, or the entire audio, or the entire video, and then each party would be free to use the sections of it that they felt were relevant to their case.  I recall specifically that Mr. Weyl had made that suggestion and we all agreed to it.  And if we start now, putting in things peace-meal, it may lead to confusion, and it would be easier and simpler simply to put in the entire transcript, and Mr. Robinson or any other party would be free to refer to those pages that they felt were relevant.  So, I am just asking that for clarification but I thought that was an issue that we actually discussed and resolved. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I think in principle when there's one whole text; we want to have the whole text admitted.  In this particular instance we have intimated relevant and irrelevant material, including speeches by the Accused or members of the joint criminal enterprise.  And on the other hand, commentary by journalists or other people about subjects that may or may not be relevant, so, while in principle we want to have an entire text admitted as opposed to portions of a text.  When it comes to somebody's broadcast where the transcript of a particular day just contains everything that was said over the course of that day, I don't think that is a good principle to follow.  So, we would like to simply admit those portions that are relevant and when the Prosecution wants to ask a witness about some other portion that they think is relevant, they can admit that portion, but I think it is not good to have comments of journalists and other things that are extraneously part of the exhibit. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I would still suggest that that goes to the issue of weight the Court will attach to these various portions.  It's not an issue that governs admissibility and this is something that we did discuss.  And I recall specifically a comment from Mr. Weyl that anything that was said on the tape provides context for any subsequent statements by any other speakers.  So, as a point of evidence, of course, I can respect Mr. Robinson's point of view, but this is something that we all discussed and agreed.  And I recall that there was a discussion on this for ten or fifty minutes when we met prior to the commencement of the Trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I seem to feel that I am called upon both by Mr. Webster and by yourselves.  I cannot remain outside the current discussion.  I think I particularly made the observation that extracts, if there are extracts, they should be tendered as such, if there is no other material of probative value except those extracts.  And when a matter arose concerning video clips which were put end to end and which the Prosecutor was saying to us he needed to have them tendered from such a minute to such a minute, and this allowed for possible manipulation.  And in that instance, I said that they should be tendered, such documents should be tendered as they were.  And then we came into the whole matter of probative value.  But we were already discussing the matter of admissibility of partial documentation.  If we have the integral document, maybe we will need to look at the probative -- but let's not run ahead of ourselves.  We should determine that it is up to each person to convince the Chamber of the probative value of any document or any limitations to such probative value of any tendered documentation. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have two views on this matter.  We don't think that we should order a litigant what exhibit to tender.  On the other hand, we want to have a consistent practice regarding the management of exhibits.  It's obviously more efficient and in the long run, it will refer to all parties if there was a consistent practice to which everybody adhered. 

Now, we think that there's merit in the proposition of the tendering of the entire documentation -- documents.  And I don't know if what would be useful is to have another status conference of an administrative meeting not under record meeting, that one could just see if one could again get consensus on what should occur.  What we would prefer from our point of view is that there's a consistent practice with regard to how exhibits are managed.  

Again, Mr. Robinson, you think I am being ambiguous again.  The basic ruling is that, we are not ordering you what to do at this stage, but we express an interest in having a consistent practice that will be adhered to by all counsel during the trial because we  are looking for efficient eloquent management at this stage. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, I understand that's very clear.  I think at this stage I would like to persist in offering the extracts of this speech and perhaps if it turns out that we charge that practice then that we can offer the remainder of this exhibit at a later time.  At this I would like to offer three extracts containing only Mr. Ngirumpatse's remarks.  And, so, I will renew my offer to admit Exhibits 22A, 22B and 22C.  And if anyone needs the K numbers repeated I can do that. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I am a bit troubled still because although I respect Mr. Robinson's submission, we haven't laid any foundation for the exhibit that he is trying to introduce.  I have heard a question put to this witness about the extracts from Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So, we are trying to be formal and correct about this then we should do it a hundred percent of the way.  So, I mean we can't -- you know, one party can't have its cake and eat it.  We do it the way Mr. Robinson suggested, lay the foundation and then introduce the exhibit or we adopt an administrative procedure that is fair to all parties and moves in the direction of the type of efficiency that the Trial Chamber has always encouraged. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Webster, are you being troublesome or are you serious?  I mean the point is we - I think that the proposition you have put forward has management and frankly I will support it.  I just don't think it's appropriate to make an order at this stage.  Now, is your current objection just to support your original argument?  Well, it doesn't have to be supported in this manner. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
My issue is not with the Court, Your Honour.  I understand the Court would be reluctant to make an order.  I am really raising the issue indirectly to Mr. Robinson because on the one hand he is saying we have to do things the proper way.  We have to lay a foundation for anything that comes into evidence.  There has been no foundation laid for this -- for the exhibit that he wants to put in.  So, I am suggesting that we should all take consistent positions if we are going to lay a foundation, make, or laying a foundational requirement for putting exhibit in and we should stick to it.  I think it makes much more sense to admit the whole thing or to admit all of these tapes or to convene a meeting as the Trial Chamber has suggested and lets resolve all these things.  We can just look at the example of some these transcripts that came in earlier today.  We have a tape, the video that came in through the direct examination, the translations that are coming in peace-meal from Mr. Robinson, because he objected to the admission of the transcripts when they were being sought to be introduced in the direct examination. 

And, now, we have the videotape as a Defence exhibit and the transcripts -- excuse me, the videotape as a Prosecution exhibit and peace-meal admission of the transcripts as a Defence exhibit.  And all these things are coming from the Prosecutor.  So, I would endorse or respectfully endorse the 
Trial Chamber's suggestion that we sit down and we iron this out.  And let's have an administrative session where we resolve all of these matters of exhibits because it makes much more sense to have a transcript attached to a video than have them scattered in a listing of ID numbers, and Defence exhibits and Prosecution exhibits.  So, that's really my suggestion if we can be more organised and consistent in our approach. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am feeling really that Mr. Webster wants me to be somewhat disagreeable.  I am going to be so on two issues.  First, in fact, I have no objection whatsoever.  No objection, I repeat, that 
Mr. Ngirumpatse's speech calling the population to be calm be tendered.  I understand that he is a bit bothered by that.  But the document that we are discussing is the one which comes from the Prosecutor.  So, I therefore do not understand the difficulties that he is -- the obstruction that he is making that a document be tendered, and it's a document which comes from him.  He disclosed it to us.

My second point on which I will be disagreeable is that I need to recall why I protested against measures consisting in tendering documents whose transcription were not exact.  A year and half ago when we tried to have this trial, the first time around, we received documents from the Prosecutor which were incorrect transcripts of documents and we had to spend four days of proceedings.  And we have transcripts of that in order to amend the ferocious presentation which had been made by the Prosecutor when he presented as an integral speech, something which was cut and paste copy.  So, if we are against the tendering of partial documents, I would agree with him, but his objection today is not founded and I believe we need to go beyond that so that we can admit a documents which he himself produced when one of the Accused wants to confront him with that.  I understand that this can be disagreeable to him, but I think that we need to go on and move beyond that objection that has been made, Mr. President, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, just as an aside.  It's not very important.  It's not so bad when counsel become disagreeable, but could you imagine what could result if the Judge got disagreeable?  Now, what could make the disagreeable is time, lack of time economy.  It's now twenty-five past.  We just have twenty-five minutes left, and I would like us to use as much time of this as possible with the evidence.  

Now, in terms of the substantive issue before us, what we have decided is to permit Mr. Robinson to tender his exhibit as he proposes.  And we are going to invite our trial coordinator to convene a session to resolve the matter for the future. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, then may I confirm that Exhibit 22A, B and C are admitted. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit D. NZ22A, NZ22B, NZ22C admitted)
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you.  And may the witness be asked to put his headphones back in The Hague.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, thank you very much for your patience.  You have in front of you a document which contains a statement by Mathieu Ngirumpatse, correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I am just going to try to save time by reading this myself.  And you can follow along and correct me if I say something that is not in the text.  Mr. Ngirumpatse said, "We, within the MRND have made the following contribution.  We sat around the same table with other parties and gave one another constructive advice.  We agreed on the formulation of another government.  It is in my opinion an important contribution because it enables the country to have administrative organs.  For those who want to kill the president, want the constitutional vacuum so that they can concur the country by force.  We know that RPF has been preparing the war for a long time, for several months.  I take this opportunity to urge MRND members to opt for the path of security and that is another contribution.  I maintain that no political party has ever asked its members to indulge in killings.  When the president died, no party had the time to get in touch with its members.  It was like an impulse from the people's hearts.  They acted impulsively.  They acted out of anger.  But the contribution we can give to the administrative organs for now is to ask our members to see other people's security.  The should -- 
A.	Counsel, I am no longer following you.

1730H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Let me slow down and ask you, at the paragraph where -- let's see.  Maybe you don't have all the pages.  
MS. TALON:
The witness now has the document and the relevant pages, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Thank you, Witness.  I'm going to try to start in the middle of a very long paragraph, perhaps that you'll be able to find where I'm reading from, but if not, maybe you could just listen then and that would be -- I can ask you questions afterwards.  

So Mr. Ngirumpatse said that people acted impulsively, they acted out of anger, "But the contribution we can give to the administrative organs for now is to ask our members to see other people's security.  They should leave the roads.  Thieves should stop stealing.  I would, therefore, as the chairman of the MRND, like to ask all MRND members, especially the youths, that instead of doing evil, they should provide security for others, especially the weak ones.  That is our primary contribution.  We have dispatched people to the neighbourhoods in order to free the roads so that they could provide security for others, instead of robbing and attacking them.  We believe that we should fight those who attack us, but we should not fight those who are not armed or who" -- 

Then it goes on to say:  "Our members must know that those infringing on their rights and attacking them are the Inkotanyi.  It is not the ordinary citizen in his house on the hill."  

And so, Witness G, it's true, is it not, that in addition to sending the leaders of the Interahamwe committee to the secteurs to stop the killing, and in addition to issuing a communiqué with four other political parties, that the MRND also, in the person of Mr. Ngirumpatse, got on the radio and urged its members and the other people to stop the killing?  Isn't that true?  
A.	Yes, that's what he asked, according to what you've just read.  
Q.	Now, I would like to direct your attention to the next document, which is found in tab 161, and here we are going to look at a speech of President Sindikubwabo on the 10th of April.  And so on the French version of this document, you'll find at page K0337691 the speech of President Sindikubwabo, and I would ask that that be placed before you.  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I can hear you.  

MS. TALON:
There's no tab 161.  Maybe it went -- there's no tab 161.  Is Mr. Robinson referring to one of his own documents which he faxed to us?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes.  Actually, thank you very much for that.  The tab 161 is not among those documents that were transmitted to The Hague.  So, in fact, for your -- this would be document number 18 of my documents which were faxed to The Hague.  I'm sorry about that.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. Robinson, could you kindly repeat your document number?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, that's document number 18.  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, yes, we have document number 18, but I would like to inform you, Mr. President, that the document is practically illegible because the font is tiny.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, can you move on to something else and correct this tomorrow?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, we can go on to another exhibit and come back to that tomorrow.  And I'll provide this again to The Hague overnight -- I mean, to the registry overnight, and they can re-fax that -- those pages.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, now I'm going to ask that you be directed to a speech of Prime Minister Kambanda on the 10th of April 1994, which is contained in tab 164, which is the tab that we had out earlier when we looked at the address of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  And within tab 164, the Kinyarwandan and the French and the English are all contained in this exhibit, and I'm going to give you the page numbers.  You can give the Kinyarwandan to the witness, and that is K0144213; and the French, K0260677; and the English, K0330134. 
MR. ROBINSON:
And, Mr. President, at this time, I'm going to offer this as an exhibit, and with respect to the Kinyarwandan first, which would be our proposed Exhibit D. NZ23A, it would consist of pages 014213 through 014225.  In the French or -- which would be Exhibit D. NZ23B, it would consist of pages K0260677 through K0260684, as D. NZ23B.  For the English, it would begin at page K0330134, and it would conclude at page K0330137.  And that would be Exhibit D. NZ23C.  So may those documents be admitted?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit Nos. D. NZ23A, D. NZ23B, and D. NZ23C admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, if you have in front of you Exhibit D. NZ23A, which is the Kinyarwandan version of Mr. Kambanda's speech -- 
A.	I have it in French, not in Kinyarwanda.  
Q.	Okay.  That's okay.  Witness G, directing your attention to the speech made by Prime Minister Kambanda, is it true that he's asking the minister of defence to do everything in his power to stop the massacres immediately, and asking the political parties to stop their members from taking part in massacres, and asking the prosecutors to conduct investigation and punish those responsible -- 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, Mr. President, we have a problem.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could you please explain.  
MS. TALON:
We have a problem at The Hague with the sound.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, could you try -- 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, I was saying that we have a problem with the French version of the speech, which is not very legible, and the sound is not clear either.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, how do you propose to address this?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, with respect to the speech, we can try -- I can leave that for a moment, and we can try to fax a clearer copy to The Hague.  The sound, I can try to ask some questions on another subject and see how we do.  
MS. TALON:
The sound is still not clear, Mr. President.  We don't have any sound right now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MS. TALON:
Now, now, yes.  We seem to have sound now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Let's see -- we just have 15 minutes more, and let's see how well we can proceed, use the time as best we could, Mr. Robinson.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Okay.  Witness G, we're going to try to move away from the paper -- 
MS. TALON:
Mr. President, there is interference, and the sound is not clear.  We have a technical problem.  The French sound does not come through clearly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that.  Mr. Robinson, just take your seat for a minute, and I'll ask the registrar to just enquire and see what we can do to manage.  
MS. TALON:
We have absolutely nothing on the French channel.  It's terrible.  The sound is not good at all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are the technicians applying for an adjournment?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President, I would like an adjournment.  I'm tired.  Things don't seem to be going right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, but -- I was -- you see, I thought we were making the kind of progress which would enable us to conclude his testimony before the end of this week, which is really something that we think is a desirable objective.  So I do hope that we don't lose the last 15 minutes of today.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Well, I'm willing to work, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if we can't work, we can't work.  But I think we should just make one last effort to see what the technicians can produce.  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Registrar.  
MS. TALON:
We have sound.  The sound has been re-established.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Mr. Robinson, you don't have eyes in the back of your head.  Mr. Weyl is trying to make an impression on me.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was simply seeking to re-assure the Trial Chamber that as regards time management, following what Mr. Robinson did in his cross-examination, I believe that mine would be much briefer, and I want to re-assure you of that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I'm going to see if we can try one more document, and if not, I'll give up for documents for this afternoon.  But can you look at Exhibit No. 21 in my bundle that was faxed to The Hague.  If you could place that before the witness, please.  
MS. TALON:
There was no problem with the previous document.  The only problem we had was with the sound, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  Let's see if we can move -- go with number 21 still, Mr. Robinson?  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think, Mr. President, at this time I'll go with number 21, yes.  I think rather than going back, it would be better if we could do that.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	So, Witness G, do you have the document 21 that's in front of you that is a speech of Prime Minister Jean Kambanda?  
MS. TALON:
We will make that document available to the witness.  

The witness now has the document, number 21.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Witness G, this is a transcript from Radio Rwanda which contains an address of Prime Minister Kambanda in which he announces the ministers who are to comprise the interim government, and those ministers' names are listed on pages 3 and 4 of that document.  Do you see that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, before that, in the first pages of the text, I think the best thing would be if you could read the first two pages, and before they start giving the names of the ministers, just read that to yourself, so I can ask you some questions about it.  
A.	Yes, I have just read through the two-and-a-half pages.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness G.  And is it then correct that on 10th of April 1994, the prime minister, on behalf of the interim government, urged the minister of defence to do everything in his power to stop the massacres immediately and urged the political parties to stop their members from taking part in massacres?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did he indicate that the préfets would be invited to a meeting and urged to restore security, and that by the end of next week, at least one pacification meeting would be held in each commune?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And did he ask the prosecutors to conduct investigations and punish those responsible for the massacres?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
And at this time, Mr. President, I would offer this as D. NZ -- and I have to ask the registry, because I wasn't sure how far we got with my last exhibit that wasn't received in The Hague, could you tell me what my next number is?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, D. NZ24.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D.NZ24 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Now, directing your attention to your own activities on the 11th of April, the next day after your mission to the secteurs, could you tell us where -- did you stay with your family at the residence of family members during the 11th?  
A.	P. 8, first person, number 1, that's where I went.  On P. 8, number 1.  
Q.	And did you stay there for the entire day of the 11th?  
A.	I do not have a clear recollection, but I think I visited number 9.  
Q.	Do you know whether any other members of the committee continued to tour the secteurs on the morning of the 11th of April?  
A.	No.  I -- I do not know.  
Q.	In any event, did you learn that some Hutus had been burnt alive by the RPF, and the people had resumed killing after that event?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And as it turned out, the killings which had stopped at your request on the 10th were resumed after the RPF's attacks; correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And is it true that as a result of that, the members of the committee, including (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal), were fearful of (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal) security for having gone to the secteurs and asked people to stop killing, only to have the RPF attack?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Pronoun (By order of the Court, this word has been extracted and filed under seal), I order that redacted.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Sorry, Mr. President.  
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	I'll ask the question again, Witness G.  Is it true that members of the committee feared for their security after the RPF burned the people alive and the killings resumed?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And were the members of the committee afraid that people would think that they had been collaborating with the RPF? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And despite your best efforts and those of Mr. Nzirorera, the mission had, in fact, failed to stop the killing; correct?  
A.	Yes.

1800H
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I think I can stop here for the day, if that's okay with you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  I concur.  It is 6 o'clock exactly.   We can take the adjournment now.  Mr. Witness, we can take the adjournment at this time.  I remind you, as I have done previously, do not discuss the case or your testimony in this or any other adjournment.  You are now excused and you may leave.  

There are just one or two scheduling matters that we need to address before we adjourn for the day.  The first matter which I would like to report is that we do have -- I have received communication from the president on the matter raised with regard to Witness GFJ.  I use the pseudonym for ease of pronunciations.  Now, it seems that the matter's quite innocuous, and there is not an -- in our view it is not related to this testimony.  But in the interests of transparency, I would order that the letter the president wrote to me and the report he received from WVSS be disclosed to the parties confidentially.  I think that should resolve that problem.  Oh, we think it is innocuous enough.  I think the disclosure should make that public here.  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, Miss Diagne-Mbaye from The Hague.  Good evening to you and to members of the Bench.  How are we going to get this document in our possession?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the document will be disclosed.  Your co-counsel will receive a copy and I am sure he has a means of communicating with you.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I would rather call upon you, Mr. President, because here in the office there is absolutely nothing.  We are now going to try and see, with the assistance of the registry, to ensure that these documents reach us here in The Hague. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I don't think that there should be a problem with that because, as far as I understand, my order will be implemented by our trial coordinator making the disclosures through the registry, and so that should facilitate delivery to everybody.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, I wish to take to the floor without bothering you too much with these matters of logistics.  At what point in time do you believe this document will be sent to The Hague so that we -- we can have a look at the document at the same time as our learned friends in Arusha?  Because the documents which are sent to us here sometimes reach us only 48 hours later, and it's not very efficient in terms of our response or any reaction we may have.  In the office that we're in, there is no fax machine, there's no computer, there's no telephone, and this makes us practically cut off from the whole world. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, well, I don't think it matters in this case at all.  As I've indicated, these documents do not relate to the witness who's giving testimony now, and in my opinion, and the opinion of the Bench, the documents do not have any impact on the testimony of the witness to whom it referred.  The President's report covers four lines.  We do not think that the problems we envisage here are rare, and we are confident that the order we have made will be implemented and that there will be satisfactory disclosure to everybody who is to get it.  So I think that should close that matter.
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Thank you, Mr. President.  The registrar also wishes to convey its gratitude, Mr. President, 
Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now, the other matters that I wanted to discuss today was just scheduling for the rest of the session.  We have the rest of this week, and we have next week.  In terms of our interests, or what we think is achievable, we think that we would like to start scheduling the completion of the testimony of Witness GFJ, and the schedule of the third Prosecution witness.  

Mr. Robinson, in turn, starting with you, should we -- could we schedule the continuation of Witness GFJ's cross-examination to Thursday morning and Friday morning?  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, I'm willing to start his cross-examination when I'm finished with Witness G, so that's not a problem.  The only question is when I'm finished. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand.  Let's be positive.  You see, we made an order for it to start tomorrow.  We are going to modify that order, but I would like to modify it to the extent of scheduling it for Thursday and Friday morning. 
MR. ROBINSON:
I can't guarantee that I will be finished with this witness by the end of Wednesday, so that's my reservation.  As soon as I've finished with this witness, the next working day I'll be ready to cross-examine Witness GFJ, but I can't promise you I'll finish in time for him to come on Thursday morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, all right.  In the meantime, we will make the order schedule for Thursday morning, because I imagine the witness will have to be notified and other steps taken.  So we modify our order and adjust the continuation of Witness GFJ's testimony for Thursday morning and Friday morning. 

That brings us to the Prosecution, Mr. Webster.  What would be the next Prosecution witness?  

MR. WEBSTER:
Well, Your Honours, realistically I don't think we will finish both G and GFJ by Monday, and if we have to start the next witness on Wednesday morning, we would move forward with Upendra Baghel, who is our investigator.  But that seems to be the most optimistic forecast.  I think Mr. Robinson indicated to me privately that he expected to be another day, at least, in cross-examination of GFJ, which would take us all day Monday.  I don't know -- I believe the other Defence counsel indicated that they would be two days with Witness G after Mr. Robinson completed his cross-examination, which is a day for Mr. Weyl and a day for Mr. Sow.  So it really looks as if we're moving into the middle of next week before we have the prospect of starting the third witness.  In that case we would start with our investigator.  But perhaps the Defence counsel would like to take to the floor and correct me if I have misstated their objections. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl gave an indication a little while ago.  Would it -- if Mr. Robinson completes his testimony -- his cross-examination tomorrow, would that give us enough time to complete the remainder of the cross-examination and the re-examination by Friday midday?  Do you have an opinion, Mr. Weyl and Mr. Sow?  I started with Mr. Weyl since you raised this issue earlier.  You appreciate at this stage we are not -- we have not adopted the practice of making orders limiting the time of examination.  What we want is an indication for scheduling purposes. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, in reply to the trial coordinator, I had told her that it would be necessary for me to have two days for my cross-examination.  I shall endeavour to make it one day instead of two days, because in that way we'll be reducing our intervention, and this would be going along with our original intent of contributing to the proper administration of the trial. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Sow?  
MR. SOW:
Mr. President, in order to save time, since I will be the last to speak, I will take into account, obviously, questions which will have been asked by my learned friends, so I, therefore, may not need a full day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. Well, (inaudible) indication.  I think that's -- I think that's as far as we can go at this stage.  We would take it, Mr. Webster, that the Prosecutor has given notice that the next witness will be Mr. Baghel.  If he is not -- I see Mr. Rapp is back in Court.  Is Mr. Rapp going to be conducting the re-examination of this witness?  
MR. RAPP:
Mr. Morley will be conducting the re-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, is there any indication from you?  
MR. MORLEY:
I thought that was what was occupying Your Honour's mind.  It's going to be a day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is going to be a day.  Thank you for the indications you have given us.  We may revisit the time estimates, but we are grateful for the indications that we have got.  We are going to want to have discussion concerning scheduling for the ensuing trial sessions.  We do have some indications of what is possible, and it seems to us that it is likely that we may be able to schedule sittings from January to mid-March, and from mid-May to mid-July.  This is what seems likely at the moment, but we will want to have an opportunity to have some discussions with the parties just to have some -- give us some information and make some more specific planning for the first part of next year. 

Lastly, the matter that arose today to do with exhibit management, the trial coordinators here have expressed a willingness to try to schedule some sort of meeting to attempt to develop agreed guidelines on exhibit management for the remainder of the trial.  So I presume that when we rise, that she'll meet informally with you and try to establish a time and place where this can be discussed and agreed.  Those are the matters that -- that we have, and are there any other comments that anybody would wish to make?
MR. WEBSTER:
One last major issue which will probably come up with the Trial Chamber coordinator.  We have received the official English translations of two of the speeches that were referred to yesterday.  I just bring it to the Court's attention.  Rather than suggesting a number for them now, I will delay that for the meeting that we have with the Trial Chamber coordinator, but I wanted to bring it to your attention that we do have English translations for Ngirumpatse's speech and Nzirorera's speech on the 7th of November '93, and we expect the last translation of Karemera tomorrow.  So that said, it should be complete.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Good.  Then we can adjourn now until tomorrow morning.
