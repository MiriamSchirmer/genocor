MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings. 
MS. KOUO:  
Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Emile Francis Short and Judge Gustave Kam is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, 29th of June 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Madam Registrar.  

The appearances are the same?  I gather there are certain things that you wish to say.  Was it Ms. Diagne who wishes to speak?  Ms. Hounkpatin?  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Good morning, Mr. President.  The composition has changed, you may have noticed, this morning.  Mr. Ngirumpatse is present in the courtroom.  Mr. Joseph Nzirorera is also present.  This morning Mr. Édouard Karemera is still missing.  

On this occasion, Mr. President, I would like to respectfully present to your Chamber a request by Messrs. Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse, a direct address to you, Your Honour.  They would like to take the floor only through Mr. Ngirumpatse, so as to save Court's time.  This is in order to explain to your Chamber the reasons that led to their absence over a two-day period, and in this motion I would hope it would be accepted by the Chamber, because it is evident we represent them, however, this is, above all, their own trial, therefore, their voices should be heard and when they do ask to explain the causes of a two-day absence from trial, Mr. President, I feel it is very important, and I make this motion respectfully to your Chamber.  If you were to grant this request, and I do not doubt it for a second, this would be a chance to explain amongst ourselves as participants in this project, which in any event will have an important impact for posterity.  And I would hope that the witness who, for the time being, is in the witness box, may be withdrawn from the courtroom because this is a matter that does not yet concern him in terms of what he is speaking about.  And I can guarantee that Mr. Ngirumpatse will be brief.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I would like to be heard on this question.  My understanding of Rule 82 bis is that no explanation of the Accused's absence is required in order for the Court to proceed.  I don't -- I've just re-read the text, and it doesn't appear to be that the Court needs an explanation of why the Accused were absent.  They were represented by counsel.  Counsel expressed their intention to represent the interests of the Accused, and on that basis I see no reason to proceed in the manner suggested by Ms. Hounkpatin.  

My concern is that in giving their explanations, either one of the Accused may state things that rise to the nature of evidence, and if that's the case, their statements to the Court should be under oath and they should be cross-examined.  So I don't wish to deny the Accused an opportunity to participate in their own trial, but the time for that will come, and if they wish to make comments to the Court at this time, then they should do so under oath from the witness box and be subject to cross-examination, if it's appropriate.  So I'll leave the matter in the Court's discretion, but that's the position that I wish to adopt.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, just two words.  My learned friend on the other side recalled Rule 82 bis and said that this rule does not require explanations, but neither does the rule forbid such explanations, and I think that we are people who are courteous and that the request made by the Accused to the Chamber cannot be refused.  They're not here yet in the framework of evidence that they must bring.  At present, we are dealing with the issue of maintaining courteous relations as established between this aisle of the Trial Chamber, the opposing side, and yourselves, and courtesy would require - or, allow that a few words be exchanged.  

They will not renege on their duties when the time comes to present their evidence, Mr. Webster.  And what they are trying to do is also meant to display courtesy towards you, and that is what has driven their request.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, the position of the Chamber starts off from the premise that the explanations given by counsel of the reasons for the absence of the defendants was sufficient for us to accept and understand why they were not in court.  So we did not -- we did not consider that it was necessary for further justification to be given.  

On the other hand, we understand your comments that, as a matter of courtesy, the defendants would wish to give certain explanations and assurances to the Court, and we think that that is a reasonable position to have.  The problem about that is that we think that the assurances could be given by counsel on their behalf because the sentiments which the defendants would wish to put on the record could be adequately done so by counsel on their behalf.  We don't make any assumptions as to what might be said.  We don't know what is intended to be said.  To some extent, we do have some responsibility to control what transpires in our trial and, particularly bearing in mind that the appeal judgement bears upon our own decision in this Chamber, we think it would be most appropriate to ensure that the comments -- any comments that might be made are made by counsel, where we would have a guarantee as to the limitations of the commentary that could be made.  

So, for those reasons, we feel that the comments which the defendants wish to communicate to us should be done through counsel.  So we will invite you, if you wish, to make the statements on behalf of your client.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President, could we have just a few minutes to confer before doing that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson.  

Mr. Registrar, the Court will rise for a couple of minutes.  
(Court recessed from 0937H to 0952H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Mr. President.  I'm going to ask you to try to -- I know you're very reasonable, and try to assist us in making -- keeping a problem as a small problem instead of a big problem.  I think my client has expressed to me that if he's not able to -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Excuse me a moment.  

Yes, Mr. Robinson, please continue.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, my client has expressed to me, and I believe this is also the view of Mr. Ngirumpatse, that if they are not allowed to express themselves in a very small matter -- in a very short manner at their own trial as a result of having a lawyer, then the lawyer becomes an impediment to them under which they prefer to exercise their right to self-representation under Article 24 of the Statute.  And so my client has expressed the desire that I not continue to represent him if, in fact, that's the consequence of his not being able to take the floor on -- which is essentially a very small matter.  So I'm scrambling to read the articles, the rules, and understand my duties in this situation, which had not been anticipated.  And I also have, I think, a very heavy obligation to my client to discuss with him the pitfalls of self-representation.  And that's the situation where I find myself right now, and I think that that's going to take some time for me to properly advise him.  But, in my opinion, it would really be better to hear the Accused, just as a matter of courtesy, nothing else, and so I ask that you reconsider your decision.  And if not, I would ask that we recess for the rest of the week so that I can consult with my client, give him the proper advice, and he can advise you as to whether or not he wishes to exercise his right to self-incrimination -- I mean self-representation, which may sometimes be the same thing.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the -- a major concern that we have is that the Chamber cannot control what is said in circumstances of this nature.  And we are concerned that the trial process could be scandalised if certain types of criticisms are levelled against the Appeal Chamber in relation to a judgment which we wrote.  It is really of great concern to us that any statements made by this Court are made under circumstances where we can guarantee their propriety.  

Now, this is not to make any assumptions as to what will be said, but we still have, as a reasonable Bench, to act in a manner which protects the integrity of our trial, and that is the reason for the decision that we have taken.  
(Pages 1 to 4 by Karen Holm)

























1000H 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well I understand that, Mr. President.  But if the Accused are representing themselves, you will have absolutely no control over that whatsoever.  I assure you that -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, but they are not representing themselves yet. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Not yet, but you are heading us in that direction.  And I assure you that what Mr. Ngirumpatse intends to say will not be scandalous, and he's reviewed with counsel, so it is something that counsel has agreed is appropriate.  But, you know, it just seems to me that in avoidance of problems for a very small thing, if you take our assurance that the comments of our clients, and it is Mr. Ngirumpatse, really, who will be addressing the Trial Chamber on behalf of both Accused, if you take the assurance of the lawyers that the clients are not going to say anything scandalous, I think that ought to be enough for you, other than -- otherwise, we are just going to cause problems.  

And I will tell you that I don't even -- I mean for me, I don't even think that the idea of my client not appearing in court and -- is not -- I don't even agree with that.  It is against my advice.  And the whole situation is just causing problems all the way around.  And it makes my job very difficult.  And I think that the very least that can be done by the Trial Chamber is to, at least, hear the Accused to let them have a small say.  Otherwise, I think it is very -- it becomes very difficult for me to continue to represent my client, and it puts a wedge between the lawyer and the clients in which I don't know if -- if that is going to be -- allow the trial to go forward in a way in which the way that end is in the best interest of everyone. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, my learned friend, Peter Robinson, has submitted a proper summary of the feelings of our clients -- of his client.  I believe that if you had allowed our clients to speak, that would not have taken much time, and you would have been apprised of the contents thereof, which, may I say, will not be scandalous in any way whatsoever.  

It is true that I have been in this case for only one year, but I have been given to understand that in the past the Accused have had opportunity to address the Court.  And that whenever they have done so, it has been with much respect.  That is why I am surprised, in view of the motion which was submitted.  I was confident that the motion would not be dismissed against that backdrop.  

But as my learned friend has also mentioned, I was not aware that we may end up with a problem wherein my client would think that my presence in the case is an impediment to his defence because of an inability to make a statement.  That is why I agree entirely with what my learned friend, Robinson, has just said. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, if I may, I would like to comment briefly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, there are a number of comments that emerge from your representations.  Now, it is normal in courts all over the world, not only international courts, but also in domestic courts, that people who appear before the Court, whether on criminal charges or in civil disputes or constitutional disputes, have their positions presented to the Court through their lawyers.  Nobody ever really considers that the process of that nature is an impediment to the free expression of the litigant.  The ability to speak through counsel does not impede freedom of expression.  It is the method that is normal in court proceedings.  So we don't accept that your client's concern of impeding their freedom of expression is justified.  It may be an instinctive or emotional response to a feeling of disappointment at the moment.  But we are satisfied that, on reflection, they will not continue to think this because it is just not rational. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I understand that, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, with regard to your particular request, we also are in a particularly sensitive position, because we know what is the reason why they did not attend the court.  We know that their non-attendance of court was a form of protest against the judgement of an Appeal Chamber, which overturned our own decision.  Knowing that, if we grant permission for them to speak on that matter in our courtroom, we are going to be professionally embarrassed.  So, that is a reason why we do not think it is sensible, appropriate or reasonable to grant the request.  It is not a situation where we are uncertain about the subject matter of their discussion.  We know what it is they want to say.  And we think that it is not necessary for them to address us any more on the subject.  The comments were made on their behalf by counsel.  We accepted what counsel said without making any adverse judgements against them.  And everything, according to the law, has been properly carried out up to now.

Now, we could understand that, as a matter of courtesy, they wish to give certain explanations and make certain -- you know, I don't even know if the word "apology" is appropriate, but they may probably wish to demonstrate respect for the trial process.  We understand that.  But we think that those objectives can be adequately achieved through their counsel, particularly in the circumstances of this particular matter, where, as a Bench, we will be embarrassed if we permit certain types of commentary to be made.  

Now, again, I have to say, we don't pre-judge, but at the same time, we have our own responsibilities to preserve the integrity of the process.  And although I did not express this as fully in my comments, I thought that what I said was sufficient for everybody to understand that that was the factual background which has prompted the decision that we took.  It is not a denial of the rights of the Accused to express themselves at all.  We have no objection to hearing their voice.  But in the circumstances of this matter, we don't think it is appropriate for them to express themselves on this particular subject at this time.  And that is the problem that we see.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Okay.  Well, I think you have expressed that very clearly.  And if we can discuss with our clients what they would like to do in light of your comments?  And we would like to be able to do that right now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will rise for a short time. 
(Court recessed from 1012H to 1048H) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity of giving us a chance to discuss this with our clients.  

My client has advised me at this time that, if forced to chose, he would like to elect his right to           self- representation at this time.  And I have not had even the time to research all of the advice and litany that I should give him in order to give him advice as to whether that is a course of action that he -- obviously it is a course of action that is against my advice, but I haven't had a chance to fulfill my own professional obligations to him, about all of the things that would be involved in representing himself, including the briefing him on what would be necessary to assume the cross-examination of         Witness XBM, including his having to read the transcripts of my -- of how we have come so far.  

So I think, under these circumstances, I'm asking the Trial Chamber to allow us to recess, at least for the day if not for the week, until I can, first, research myself exactly what I need to advise my client, and then give him that advice and discuss with him fully all of the pitfalls of self representation.  And then if he persist in his request that he represent himself, then to advise the Trial Chamber.  And it will also then necessitate some time for me to bring him up to speed so that he can adequately continue with the cross-examination of this witness.  So, my request is that we recess until Monday and we can advise the Trial Chamber definitively as to whether Mr. Nzirorera will be exercising his right of self-representation. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Mr. President, thank you for giving me the floor for Mr. Édouard Karemera's behalf.  As you have noticed, Mr. President, I haven't spoken this morning because my client is absent.  But he has told me that with the Appeal Chamber's decision, he would like to obtain a French translation before expressing himself.  I know that the request was made last week, and I am aware that your Bench has handled it rather effectively.  But it is obvious that the French version of the decision is not yet available, and that is why my client believes that it would be improper for him to state any position to the Court without being fully apprised of the French version of that decision.  In that position, therefore, Mr. President, and I want to say that I talked at length with Madam Denis this morning, I say again that I'm aware that you take this matter very seriously, and I thank you for it. 

But let me support what my learned friend, Robinson, has said and request of the Trial Chamber leave to return to the UNDF and avail myself of this leave that you have so graciously granted us to discuss the issue with him in my capacity as his counsel.  Mr. President, this situation is getting even more complicated for -- over a very little matter, and that is why I believe if you do grant us the time, we will be in a position to fully discuss the matter with our clients and explain to them the full impact of their decisions.  You were kind enough to allow us time to have these consultations in the adjacent room, but that was not enough, Mr. President.  There are legal aspects of this matter that we need to look into; we have not been able to delve into all of those details.  That is why I am appealing to you to use your usual discretion to grant us more time so that we can discuss in depth with our clients and report back to you according.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I support the same motion in view of my client's needs.  And I would like to have this afternoon and probably tomorrow to explain to my client the consequences of the decisions they are about to take.  I believe that this time is required to delve into the matter properly, because with the time we were given, we have not been able to come up with a satisfactory solution.  You may acknowledge, as well, Mr. President, that we have duties towards our clients, and we need to explain the legal consequences of their action to them, so that whatever decision they come to will be one that is in full awareness of the surrounding circumstances.  

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, I must say that I am a bit disappointed with the way things have gone this morning.  I understand the Accused wish to participate in their own trial, and to express their thoughts to the Chamber, but I also recall that over the past three years I've collected a file which is at least one half inch thick of letters that the Accused have addressed to the Trial Chamber, without going through counsel, on their own initiative, so it seems to me that if the wish of the each of the Accused to express themselves to this Chamber, they could use the channels that they have used in the past and write to the Chamber, which would solve this issue as a practical matter.  And the fact that they have not elected to do so, and they have now presented the Trial Chamber with this present impasse, suggests to me that their application really go to the heart to what this Court has already identified, which is the integrity of the proceedings.  

Now, we have a witness on the stand.  The witness commented during his cross-examination a few days ago that the Defence was taking this Court hostage.  And it is hard to quarrel with that observation given the application that we heard this morning.  It seems to me that these applications echo similar applications from the Defence in the past, that when they don't get their way and when the rulings of this Court displease them, that they will take measures to slow the proceedings down and to threaten to increase their list of witnesses, and to react in a way that really backs this Court up against the wall and gives it an ultimatum.  And I would suggest that we proceed with the witness that is currently on the stand.  To the extent that Mr. Nzirorera wishes to consider his option to represent himself, that is something -- that is a decision that can be made over the weekend, with further consultation with his attorney.  

We are in the middle of a cross-examination.  There is no allegation that his current attorney is doing an improper job or inadequate job with the cross-examination.  This Court can order the cross-examination of the witness to proceed.  And the matter that the Accused seem to think is so important is still one that can be addressed at a later time.  There is no reason to extend the appearance of this witness unnecessarily.  

So my application to the Court, or my submission, is that we proceed with the cross-examination, that Mr. Robinson be directed to continue his examination of the witness, and that this issue of who will represent the interests of the Accused is something that can be addressed at the conclusion of our session today when all of the counsel and the Accused have more time to sit and discuss the pros and cons as they see them.  

But it is clear to me that what we have -- what we are addressing at this time is the authority of this Court and not a simple request for the Accused to be able to express themselves.  So, the matter is left with the Court's discretion, but that is the position I wish to articulate. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, just for my clarification, where are you in your dealings with your client?  Is it that he has, in fact, told you he wants you to withdraw, or is he telling you he is thinking about it, or is he waiting on you to advise him on it?  I know that your communications are confidential, I'm not trying to pry into that.  But we need to know exactly what the status of the position at the moment. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
At the moment, he wishes to represent himself. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
He has told you that?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes.  And I would like the opportunity to discuss that with him further.  And I don't think I have adequately advised him about all of the pitfalls of that.  But if he is forced to proceed today, then he wants to represent himself.  But I hope he won't be forced to proceed today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we would like the Defendant to confirm that that is his position. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Very well.
ACCUSED NZIRORERA:  
Thank you, Mr. President.  I did, indeed, asked Mr. Robinson that if this was the case, if the Chamber cannot allow us to express ourselves, even for just five minutes in regard to an issue that deeply affects us, we thought -- and I personally felt that I would have problems following the ongoing proceedings.  

Secondly, I had the impression that my being represented by Defence counsel is rather a major obstacle to having a fair trial before this Chamber.  This is why earlier on I said to Mr. Robinson, I said, "You have already begun cross-examination of Witness XBM.  He is speaking in Kinyarwanda.  I speak Kinyarwanda.  I would like you to today brief me on what has happened over the last few days and I will proceed with cross-examination of this witness in Kinyarwanda."  And at the same time I will have a chance to express all of my demands, or my opinions when the time comes without having to be limited or restrained, given that the counsel has certain obligations which, contrary to what I believed, do not seem to concord with respect of my rights.  Therefore, Mr. President, I would like you to consider how I can personally defend myself.  

If that is the case, I am convinced that I will be able to do all of that remains; and will, therefore, be able to consider.  He told me this was a dangerous decision I was considering.  I said, it is a pity, but we will have time to discuss before I take my final decision.  Indeed, I do want to discuss this so that he can give me the pros and cons, so that I make a fully informed decision.

Further, then, the discussion we had given that we felt it would be impossible to fully exhaust this topic in the ante chamber where we had our earlier meeting.  Therefore, I said I wanted to take this decision, which I feel is an important decision, that certainly requires an exchange between myself and him.  I do not feel this is too much, asking too much.  He asked me not to be too hasty.  I told him I am not being hasty, because in the end I think it has already been done.  

Mr. President, I would like you to grant me some hours to take my decision.  And if I have to take over the cross-examination of XBM, then Mr. Robinson also has to provide me the material on the work he has done over the last few days.  Therefore, Mr. President, I am asking for your understanding in according me this time to reflect.  And if there is any need, I will be in a position to communicate my decision tomorrow.  

Thank you, Mr. President -- by tomorrow. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, if the Defendant is going to take this decision, the Chamber also has some interests in ensuring that he receives adequate advice on the consequences of it.  And I would think that the machinery that would be appropriate for that is machinery through the office of the registrar.  So we would also have an interest in ensuring that before he commits himself finally that the -- that we would arrange for a communication with the registrar.  We appreciate that a decision of this nature, if it is formally communicated, may have long-term impact on his interests, his rights, and the future conduct of the trial.  And we would want to be satisfied that he has received adequate information before we allow him to commit himself in that manner. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I agree. 
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mr. President, I apologise for interrupting you. 

Thank you, Mr. President.  I would just like to say that this morning we are seeing that a trial is not a long, calm river, and that the incidents that occur are necessary.  You gave Mr. Nzirorera the floor.    Mr. Ngirumpatse is in the same position as Nzirorera.  And before we go any further in deliberations that you must make, I would like you to note that he also needs time, as I had explained to you, to -- just as Mr. Nzirorera expressed --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, we didn't give Mr. Nzirorera the floor for any sentimental or social reasons.  His counsel indicated that Mr. Nzirorera had wanted to represent himself.  And in the interest of ensuring that the proper principles of the trial were conducted, because, as you know, one of the fair trial rights of litigants or defendants before our trial (sic) is the issue of representation by counsel.  And, therefore, if a litigant has decided that he wishes to reject the services which are being provided for him, then it is important that we hear it from the litigant personally.  So it was in regard to that limited position that we heard Mr. Nzirorera.

As far as I'm aware, we have not yet heard any indication that Mr. Ngirumpatse wishes to represent himself.  So there is no reason for us to hear him in that context.  
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Yes, Mr. President, sometimes economy is not good because earlier on when we spoke, following our short consultation, it was the expression of a joint position taken by Mr. Nzirorera and Ngirumpatse was brought up by Mr. Robinson.  And when I asked for a time limit in support of that request, I was articulating a position given that Mr. Ngirumpatse had wanted to express himself, provided that the Court allowed him to express himself courteously.  And he had, indeed, thought of one day having to take up his own defence.  But given the way my friend, Mr. Robinson request was received, we as counsel face a problem and also we are in need of time to explain the consequences of taking such a position.  Now, the five minutes we were accorded in this courtroom are insufficient for such an important decision, given that earlier on you recalled that the registry would need to be informed and that, indeed, such a time limit would be necessary.  So, as I said, perhaps I should not have been so economical with my words.  I should have repeated the exact same explanation given by Mr. Robinson, my colleague. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Hounkpatin, the Bench is not going to be influenced by threats.  If the purpose of this maneuver is to persuade us to change our mind, then it is not going to succeed.  Now, if -- if the litigants are really serious about wanting to conduct their own defence, then they have a right to do so.  But what the Court's interest is in this is to make certain that if they take such a decision, they do it for good reasons, and they understand what the consequences are and that they are really serious about it.  So we have an interest in making certain that they don't just say so out of annoyance or disappointment.  That's our interest, that if they do it, it is for a good reason that will have an effect on the fair trial of the matter.

Now, what we are thinking of doing at the moment is this that we have thought that we should rise now and resume at 2 o'clock.  It will give us a chance to consult with ourselves on what would be the appropriate steps to take if they are serious.  It also gives them a chance to reflect, and to get over what we understand might be a feeling of disappointment that we did not allow the request that they made this morning.  We understand that people have emotions.  But we are -- we are a court of justice, and we try to act on objective standards and principles.  We are not really in the business of trying to be popular with anybody.  We understand that sometimes people don't like our decisions, but they are our decisions and we have to stick with them.

So, hopefully, at 2 o'clock everybody's position might be more clear.  I should also mention that with regard to the translation issues raised by Karemera, Karemera's counsel, the issue of the translation is not a reason for postponing the trial.  He has a right to have the translation done and steps are being made to procure the translation for him, but there administrative and practical steps which need to be taken.  The translation has to be complied, and the translation department, who are working according to standard principles, have indicated the minimum time frame within which the translation could be completed.  And that information, I think, has been communicated to Mr. Karemera's counsel.  And it is impossible for the translation to be done before -- before that date.  And we have decided that that is not a good reason to postpone the trial.  So, we have taken steps to ensure that the translation is produced at the earliest opportunity.  But we don't think that is a reason for postponement of the trial.  So I don't think -- that puts our position as clearly as we can.  And we think that in the circumstances -- 

Yes, Ms. Diagne-Mbaye?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
I beg your pardon, Mr. President.  I have the impression that we are both getting carried away on both sides because you, indeed, are speaking of postponing the trial.  I would like to take the floor again to say at no point was such a request made by Édouard Karemera.  And I would like to explain this at length to say that I had spoken to Ms. Denis, I quite understood the arguments she presented to me this morning, and that I went, as soon as I could, to express them, or I wanted to express this as quickly as I could to Mr. Karemera at the UNDF.  

So even on her part -- or his part, there was no question of postponing the trial.  That is the first observation I wanted to make.  And I also regret the time that has been spent by the Court, as well as the words that have been spoken in court.  Mr. President, you seem to be taking --  talking in terms of hostage -- a hostage-taking situation and time that has been spent; Mr. President, there is no such question.  

Mr. President, I would like to reassure you to tell you that this definitely not at stake.  I do not want us to spoil the good atmosphere that has so far prevailed in the debate.  And in my own regard, as well as my own client's, I think we both understand this.  Mr. President, we are not pressuring your Chamber.  We will never do so.  There is a definite misunderstanding, complete misunderstanding on the part of the Accused.  And our only request to you, and it is not asking too much to be given time to explain the consequences of the positions that have been taken here.  We are also obliged to tell them, perhaps, that this is not a good decision.  Mr. President, you tell us 2 p.m., it is almost midday.  You know that it is not easy to get to the UNDF.

Mr. President, since we have the willingness to conclude the misunderstanding, to end the misunderstanding that has been prevailed, we would just like the time to calmly proceed, and further to reassure you that there is no question of threatening the Chamber.  And if this was the impression that the Chamber had, they were definitely mistaken.  Thank you, Mr. President.

1130H 
MS. HOUNKPATIN: 
Mr. President, the same goes for me.  There is no desire on our part to take the Chamber hostage, no desire to threaten the Chamber.  Basically, if I'm -- were to speak further, I would confound myself in explanations.  There is no such desire.  Rather, there is the desire to continue -- to calmly continue the trial.  And that is why, earlier on, I said that a trial is not a long peaceful river flowing.  That is all I can say.  There is no desire to threaten or to take anyone hostage.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Ms. Hounkpatin, I am rather willing to withdraw the comment I made about threatening the Court.  The point I was trying to make is that our decisions are influenced by our perception of the principles of law and the principles of justice; that there are other extraneous circumstances, and that is the civil point I was trying to make.  

So I -- the only issue now is how much time -- we had thought that we would need about an hour for our -- it's already 12:30 -- it's 11:30.  Yes.  We also needed to find out a little bit of the procedures which were available within the registry for providing consultation -- or, information to litigants who wished to remove their lawyers.  So, we were not exactly aware of the exact machinery which existed.  And it will have given us an opportunity to carry out those investigations if we adjourned until 2 o'clock.  So, we would have had an idea of what -- a better idea of the processes and the machinery that was available if the situation was to develop in this way.  

We still think that it would be advisable for us to come back at 2 o'clock, which would give -- we would be in a stronger position, in terms of our own information base, to continue or conclude our response to the issues that have been raised.  

So, we think we should take the adjournment now and resume at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
