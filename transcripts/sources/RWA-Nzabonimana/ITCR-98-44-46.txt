         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  The proceedings are called to order.  Could 

         3        the Registry introduce the matter coming before the 

         4        Trial Chamber this morning?

         5   MR. KIYEYEU: Thank you, Mr. President.  

         6        

         7        Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal 

         8        for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, 

         9        presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and 

        10        Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, 

        11        today, Wednesday, the 27th of November 2002, for the 

        12        continuation of the Defence case, in the matter of the 

        13        Prosecutor v. Juvénal Kajelijeli, 

        14        Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T. 

        15        

        16        Thank you, Mr. President. 

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu for the registry.  

        18        

        19        May we have the appearance of the parties, starting with 

        20        the Prosecution for the record, please?

        21   MR. FLEMING: If the Court pleases, I am Ken Fleming, senior 

        22        trial attorney.  I appear with my learned friend, 

        23        Ms. Ojemeni, trial attorney and Ms. Marotine, case 

        24        manager. 

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

        26        

        27        May we also have the appearance of the Defence for the 

        28        record?

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS: Good morning, Your Honours, Lennox Hinds, 

        30        representing Mr. Kajelijeli, and I am assisted by

         1        Professor Bompaka and Mr. Emilien Dusabe.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

         3        

         4        Yes, your next witness, please?

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, our next witness is RHU27.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: R --

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: RHU27.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: But, as the preliminary matters, we 

        10        indicated yesterday that in light of Witness MEM's 

        11        testimony, we are again requesting for the Prosecutor, 

        12        pursuant to Rules 66(b) and 68 to disclose the tapes.  

        13        

        14        Now this Court is aware that we have filed several 

        15        motions going back over one year, dealing with the 

        16        Prosecutor's obligations pursuant to Rule 66(b), to make 

        17        those disclosures.  And, I would like to remind the 

        18        Court that this Court ordered on March 12th of 2001, 

        19        most specifically with respect to that time, the 

        20        Defence's request, for either to interview Prosecution's 

        21        witnesses or for a bill of particulars.  

        22        

        23        The Court in its decision stated at Paragraph 11 and I 

        24        quote: "The Chamber notes that in addition to witness 

        25        statements disclosed pursuant to Rule 66(a)(ii) of the 

        26        Rules, the Defence's request for copies of the 

        27        witnesses' interviews, either in the form of original 

        28        tape-recordings and, or transcript tape recordings.  The 

        29        Prosecutor has not responded to the request. 

        30        The Chamber considers this request to be falling under 


                             ICTR - TRIAL CHAMBER II
                                        2



          KAJELIJELI                                      27 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        Rule 66(b) of the Rules, under which subject to Rule 

         2        66(c) and Rule 70 of the Rules, the Defence, upon 

         3        inspecting books, documents, photographs and tangible 

         4        objects in the custody or control of the Prosecutor and 

         5        after it has shown that the said items are material to 

         6        its Defence, and if the Prosecutor intends to use the 

         7        said materials at the trial, the Prosecutor shall 

         8        disclose the said items to the Defence.  

         9        

        10        The Chamber further notes that, pursuant to Rules 66(b) 

        11        of the Rules, if the said items were obtained or 

        12        belonged to the Accused and the Prosecutor does not 

        13        intend to use them for the Prosecution of its case, 

        14        then, the said items could be returned to the Accused.

        15        

        16        Paragraph 12, the Chamber is, therefore, of the view 

        17        that if the Defence seeks disclosure of the said items, 

        18        and if the items are, indeed, in the custody or control 

        19        of the Prosecutor, the Defence could pursue the matters 

        20        under  Rule 66(b) of the Rules".  

        21        

        22        We, then requested as early as last month, again, for 

        23        disclosure of the detained witness statements to the 

        24        Rwandan authorities.  Now, the previous motion we made 

        25        last year was for the statements made by Prosecution 

        26        witnesses.  At that time, they had taken tape-recordings 

        27        and video-recordings, rather.  We were not aware of 

        28        the -- that these recordings were anything more than 

        29        quite frankly -- places and things.  And so, therefore, 

        30        we were not particularly concerned about them.

          KAJELIJELI                                      27 NOVEMBER 2002



         1        Lucasen had testified as you recall and put into 

         2        evidence certain still photographs.  We raised certain 

         3        objections about them and those are in the record, but, 

         4        again, we didn't raise issues concerning disclosure 

         5        under 66 because we were not aware at the time that 

         6        there were any statements, commentary by any witnesses 

         7        that accompanied any of those -- the videos.  We 

         8        requested in October, and this was our motion, to seek 

         9        disclosure of witnesses that we were calling, statements 

        10        that our witnesses may have made and disclosed to the 

        11        Rwandan authorities.  The Prosecutor responded and said 

        12        in particular MEM, Prosecutor said MEM made some 

        13        commentary but it was of no significance.  Therefore, 

        14        they did not record anything.  That is what they said.  

        15        

        16        Our motion was simply summarily dismissed by this 

        17        Chamber and now we find out through MEM that, in fact, 

        18        not only his comments were recorded on the video as they 

        19        were taking them to various sites, he indicated that in 

        20        his statements, he challenged Prosecution witnesses.  

        21        I don't know whether that is on the video. What is more 

        22        disturbing, he said some of the Prosecution witnesses 

        23        who now have already testified and went back to Rwanda, 

        24        their statements are on video tapes.  Whatever 

        25        commentary they made concerning whatever sites or 

        26        matters that they were shown, we made our application 

        27        both under 66(b) and 68.  It is unfair for us to be 

        28        proceeding in this manner if the Prosecution has 

        29        information that we are entitled to.

         1        They said in their response to this Trial Chamber they 

         2        had nothing.  If they had in their possession, 

         3        information that they believe was protected under 66(c), 

         4        they had an informative duty and a responsibility to 

         5        disclose to the Trial Chamber in a timely fashion so 

         6        that this Trial Chamber could conduct an in camera 

         7        review with respect to any matters and in the interests 

         8        of justice, decide on what should be disclosed to us.  

         9        

        10        If there were any particular methods of redacting 

        11        information that maybe relevant to other investigations 

        12        and so on, that should have been done then.  I don't 

        13        know what was the reason for them not disclosing it but 

        14        we now know from Witness MEM that there were tapes and 

        15        commentary was made with respect to those tapes.  

        16        

        17        We are requesting that information be made available to 

        18        us and then we will make further application, if 

        19        necessary, based upon what is shown on it, but we are 

        20        entitled to it under Rules 66(b) and 68 because, I mean, 

        21        I don't know as I stand here whether there is any 

        22        exculpatory information, but I know what MEM said that 

        23        he, in fact, told the Prosecutors and even if the 

        24        information might not have been helpful to their case, 

        25        it certainly is material, that is relevant pursuant to 

        26        Rule 66 -- Rule 68 rather.

        27   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you, Counsel.  

        28        

        29        Any comment, any submission from the Prosecution on this

         1   MR. FLEMING: Thank you, Your Honours.  On the 18th of

         3        Chamber did not dismiss the matter summarily at all, but 

         4        rather, gave it due consideration.

         6        In Your Honours' decision of that day, Your Honours, 

         7        recite what was disclosed in respect of MEM.  It appears 

         8        at paragraph 7 of Your Honours' decision.  

         9        

        10        In the instant case, Your Honours recite the Prosecution 

        11        indicates that the interview with Defence Witness MEM 

        12        was terminated, and on the day of the interview, Defence 

        13        Witness MEM introduced himself and said the following:  

        14        "On 7 April 1994, in the morning at 8:00 a.m., the 

        15        youths of Busogo secteur came running and were shouting 

        16        that they were going to revenge the death of President 

        17        Habyarimana".  

        18        

        19        Your Honours, his interview on that tape was terminated  

        20        at that point, that is, this has been fully disclosed.  

        21        Then, Your Honours, say as though the Prosecution 

        22        disclosed the information reflected on paragraph 7 

        23        above, the Chamber notes that the Defence did not 

        24        demonstrate, "from the appropriate rule how the 

        25        questions posed by the Prosecutor to MEM and his answers 

        26        will be exculpatory to the Accused."  

        27        

        28        Accordingly, Chamber finds that with regard to the 

        29        statement of Defence Witness MEM, the Prosecution has no 

        30        obligation to disclose under Rule 68 of the Rules.

         1        Your Honours, the matter is concluded and what is on the  

         2        tape which is both exculpatory and which may affect the 

         3        credit of the witness has been disclosed specifically 

         4        what MEM said.  

         5        

         6        Now, Your Honours, that occurred at Byangabo market 

         7        itself, and that is where those words were said, that is 

         8        where that interview terminated.

         9        

        10        In respect of any other matter, we have complied with 

        11        our obligation under the Rules.  

        12        

        13        Thank you, Your Honour.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes.

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Court made its decision 

        16        based upon an application made by the Defence.  

        17        We did not know whether or not the Prosecution had any 

        18        information, and so, therefore, we made an application 

        19        for them to disclose all information that was in their 

        20        possession. They came back and they said that the only 

        21        information that they had was, in fact -- and they 

        22        admitted they interviewed MEM and said that MEM made 

        23        statements which were just commentary.  They did not 

        24        consider it of any significance, terminated the 

        25        interview.  Based upon their submission, they said  

        26        nothing was on tape, they didn't say anything of that 

        27        nature.  

        28        

        29        Based on their submission, the Court simply said that we 

        30        had not established any evidence to support our

         1        application that there would be any exculpatory 

         2        information and they did.  We accepted that and we 

         3        proceeded.  Now, the witness has testified and everyone 

         4        here heard what he said.  He said not only was he 

         5        interviewed and video-taped, but others he mentioned 

         6        GAO.  He said these individuals went to particular sites 

         7        and they gave information on video tape.  If the video 

         8        tape exists, the video tape should be produced.  The 

         9        fact that Mr. Fleming stands up and says, "we have 

        10        complied."  With all due respect is not the end of the 

        11        matter.  Why is it the end of the matter?  Because he 

        12        makes a statement that requires -- what is required at 

        13        this point is for the Prosecution to disclose the tapes, 

        14        all of the tapes that they made and that they recorded, 

        15        not only our witnesses whom we have called, but their 

        16        witnesses because they were under an obligation and a 

        17        duty under Rules 66(b) and 68 to disclose it.  For him 

        18        just to stand up and bluntly say, "that is the end of 

        19        the matter, "when there is a witness now who has 

        20        testified and brought to the Court's attention -- it is 

        21        not only to my attention or so, but that not only were 

        22        video tapes made, but the individuals who were 

        23        questioned contemporaneously with the video tapes were 

        24        making comments.  Not only that, but this witness says, 

        25        even the Prosecutor, staff from the Prosecutor's Office 

        26        were also making commentary concerning the credibility, 

        27        perhaps of what some witnesses were saying.  I don't 

        28        even know what's on video.  But that is why we say that 

        29        the Prosecution has to disclose information.  They just 

        30        can't sit with it in their pockets.  What we are

         1        interested in is the truth.  We are interested in 

         2        finding out what finally happened and not for them to be 

         3        hiding anything.

         4   MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Fleming, there was, indeed, some mention 

         5        from the testimony of the last witness about video 

         6        recording of the events that he talked about in the 

         7        testimony of the evidence of MEM.  What do you say about 

         8        that?

         9   MR. FLEMING: First, Your Honours, he confirmed that he was 

        10        interviewed at Byangabo.  He confirmed what he said that 

        11        Byangabo, and that was disclosed.  The other material is 

        12        neither suggesting the innocence or mitigating the guilt 

        13        of the Accused, nor does it affect the credibility of 

        14        the Prosecution witnesses and that is what we say about 

        15        that.  Our obligation to disclose is based upon that 

        16        Rule.  

        17        

        18        Your Honours, he didn't make any comments about the 

        19        credibility of the Prosecution witnesses for example.

        20   MR. PRESIDENT: Who?

        21   MR. FLEMING: MEM. Yesterday at the box as I understand his 

        22        evidence, and certainly confirmed that there was a 

        23        video.  Certainly, he was on the video but that fact was 

        24        well-known in any event, by a disclosure made earlier in 

        25        response to our learned friend's motion.  Now, I feel 

        26        that it does linger in Your Honours' minds.  Now we can 

        27        bring a motion pursuant to 66(c) and Your Honours, can 

        28        review it sitting in camera.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  But that is a possible approach.  You see, we 

        30        just want -- in asking this -- just to see that if there

         1        are no obstacles, why not?

         2   MR. FLEMING: Your Honours, there are obstacles to disclosing 

         3        this material.  That is why it should be done in 66(c).

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  But that would be a different matter.

         5   MR. FLEMING: Precisely, you see, Your Honours, we still say, 

         6        our obligation is to disclose exculpatory material or  

         7        material going to mitigate the guilt of the Accused or 

         8        we have an obligation to disclose material which would 

         9        affect the credibility of the Prosecutor's witnesses.  

        10        We say we have complied with that obligation.  Nothing 

        11        that MEM said yesterday discloses anything to the 

        12        contrary. 

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: We are not going to review the evidence of MEM 

        14        here, but just are talking about the general aspect of 

        15        evidence with regard to disclose the aspect.  For 

        16        example, if you are addressing the provisions of 

        17        Rule 66(b), there are three elements that have got to be 

        18        met here which go beyond, perhaps, reference to 

        19        provisions of Rule 66(8), it could be material that the 

        20        Prosecution intends to use in its evidence or in its 

        21        case.  That is one.  

        22        

        23        It could be also be information or material that could 

        24        be material to the preparation of the Defence case or 

        25        the other party's case.  So those are the parameters 

        26        that have to be examined and considered.  

        27        

        28        So, we are aware, we are not going back to the decision, 

        29        but we are just aware of where we are, those are 

        30        contentions being raised and what could be done.

         1   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honours, in addressing 66(b), one says 

         2        that we may permit the Defence to inspect any books, 

         3        documents, photographs and tangible objects in his 

         4        custody or control:  

         5        1. If I would pause there; which are material to the 

         6        preparation of the Defence.

         7        2. Or are intended for use by the Prosecutor as evidence 

         8        at trial or 

         9        3. Were obtained from or belonged to the accused?  We 

        10        can eliminate 2 and 3 because, Your Honours, you have 

        11        seen the material that we used in the Prosecution and it 

        12        didn't include anything from there and it certainly 

        13        doesn't belong to the Accused.  

        14        So, the only other one point which they could argue, is 

        15        which are material to the preparation of the Defence.  

        16        

        17        Now, Your Honours, they haven't established and it is 

        18        their obligation to do so, that this is material to the 

        19        preparation of their defence.  Nor have they established 

        20        if we go after 68, that it is suggesting the innocence 

        21        of or mitigating the guilt of the Accused, nor have they  

        22        established that it may affect the credibility of the 

        23        Prosecution witnesses.  

        24        

        25        Now, they have that obligation to do so, and they 

        26        haven't achieved any of that simply by extracting a 

        27        little more information from MEM.  And, Your Honours, we 

        28        continue to say we have complied with our obligations.  

        29        MEM has added nothing to their application except to 

        30        confirm what we already knew and that he was

         1        momentarily interviewed on the tape, and that is the end 

         2        of the matter.

         3        

         4        And, Your Honours, if there is a matter beyond that, 

         5        then we will certainly be bringing a motion pursuant to 

         6        Rule 66(c) in respect of it.  But our primary position 

         7        as our learned friends haven't established any of the 

         8        fundamental requirements under either the Rule 66(b) or 

         9        Rule 68.  

        10        

        11        Thank you, Your Honours.

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Yes, before you rule, Your Honours, unless 

        13        you think that I am --

        14   MR. PRESIDENT:  I think we have heard the parties, we would 

        15        like to move on.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we will reserve our decision on this 

        18        matter and we will consider the submissions made by the 

        19        parties.  I hope it will be made available.  We would 

        20        like to look at them very carefully as soon as possible 

        21        and then we will make a decision on this matter in due 

        22        course.  

        23        

        24        All right.  We will now move to the next witness.

        30        how your evidence will be taken here, we will explain a

         1        few essential elements to you before you begin your 

         2        testimony.  You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by 

         3        the Defence who are seated on this side of the 

         4        courtroom.  Thereafter, questions shall be put to you in 

         5        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

         6        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

         7        of you, may also put questions to you to clarify your 

         8        evidence as you continue to testify, if they will have 

         9        such questions to ask you.  If a question put to you is 

        10        not clear or you do not understand it, please say so and 

        11        such a question shall be repeated or explained.  

        12        These are the few essential things we wanted to bring to 

        13        your attention.

        25   A.   Good morning, Counsel.  I wish to inform you that I have 

        26        a problem with my tongue and my throat.  I, therefore, 

        27        would wish to request the Court to allow me to rest 

        28        after every hour for some time.

         1   PROFESSOR HINDS: To give the Court some background 

         2        information. The witness came from ****and has a 

         3        number of medical  problems including problems with his 

         4        mouth, tongue and throat.  He has been taken to the 

         5        hospital on emergency basis last week and over the 

         6        weekend and so, I have not seen him since Sunday.  So we 

         7        know and, I think witness and victims protection can 

         8        certify to the effect of that illness that he has.

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: He wants an hour's -- hourly rest?

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, I don't think he said an hour's rest.  I 

        11        said he wants to have a periodic rest and it may be all 

        12        right within our break period, I don't know -- he does 

        13        not know what the situation is.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  Okay.  We will keep him review as 

        15        we go along.  Another thing, Interpreter, could you tell 

        16        Witness RHU27 to come close to the microphone that might 

        17        help him not to shout.  He is sitting very far away from 

        18        the microphone.  Right.  Yes, Counsel?

        19   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        20   Q.   Witness, I would present to you a document that has your 

        21        particulars on it.  We would like you to review this 

        22        document with a translator -- interpreter and if the 

        23        contents of the document are accurate, we would like you 

        24        to date the document and sign the document and return it 

        25        to me.

        26   A.   Yes, the information on this piece of the paper is 

        27        correct.

        28   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, the Defence submits this 

        29        document and tenders it as Defendant Exhibit 30 and we 

        30        would like it to be sealed because it contains certain

         1        particulars of the witness.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT:  Any objections?

         3   MS. OJEMENI: No objections, Your Honour. 

         4   MR. PRESIDENT:  So let the document containing the personal 

         5        particulars of the Witness RHU27 be admitted as Defence 

         6        Exhibit 30 and the same document shall be kept under 

         7        seal as it contains the personal particulars of this 

         8        witness, who is a protected witness.

         9   MR. KIYEYEU: The registry has taken note, My Lords.

        10        (Exhibit No. 30 was admitted).

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: May I proceed, Your Honour?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, please.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Witness, we are in open session, and I would be asking  

        15        you a series of questions and I would like you to 

        16        carefully listen to the questions and when you answer, 

        17        don't give any information that could reveal your 

        18        identity.  Do you understand that?  And if you have any  

        19        questions, ask me before answering? 

        20   A.   Yes.

        21   Q.   Witness, how old are you?

        27   Q.   Witness, did you attend secondary school?

        28   A.   Yes, I did two years of secondary school education in 

        29        the Republic of Zaire.

        30   Q.   Did you begin your secondary education in Rwanda or did

         1        you begin it in Zaire?

         2   A.   Yes, I started my secondary school education in Zaire.

         3   Q.   And did you attend secondary school education after you 

         4        went into exile?

         5   A.   No.

         6   Q.   Can you tell us when you began your secondary school 

         7        education, what year?

         8   A.   I started my secondary school education during the 

         9        academic year of 1960-1961.

        10   Q.   Witness, are you married?

        11   A.   Yes, I am married.

        12   Q.   Do you have any children?

        13   A.   Yes, I do have children.

        14   Q.   Witness, I would like to ask you a question, but you do 

        15        not tell us, do not give us the name of the place where  

        16        you are.  ******************

        17   A.   ************************.

        18   Q.   And are you charged with certain crimes that have been 

        19        committed in Rwanda?

        20   A.   Yes, that's right.

        21   Q.   Were you given a trial?

        22   A.   ********.

        23   Q.   And what is your sentence?

        24   A.   *********

        25   Q.   Have you been sentenced to death?

        26   A.   *****

        27   Q.   Sir, is your case on appeal?

        28   A.   Yes, I lodged an appeal and my case is being considered 

        29        by the court of appeal. 

        30   Q.   Now, Witness, did you ever confess to your crimes?

          KAJELIJELI                                      27 NOVEMBER 2002



         1   A.   Yes, I made a confession.

         2   Q.   Was your confession accepted?

         3   A.   No.

         4   Q.   Can you tell this Tribunal why your confession was 

         5        rejected or was not accepted?

         6   MS. OJEMENI: Your Honours, please, may the witness be 

         7        reminded in his response, he does not disclose the 

         8        identity of the Prosecution witness because looking at 

         9        the statement, I could see that is likely to happen.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, that is important.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Witness, in your answer do not name anyone except 

        13        Mr. Kajelijeli.  You can mention his name, but you 

        14        cannot mention the name of anyone else in your answer.

        15   A.   Very well.

        16   Q.   So, can you tell the Tribunal why your plea and 

        17        confession was rejected?

        18   A.   The first reason is that I was forced to admit that I 

        19        had killed certain individuals.  The second reason is 

        20        that I was forced to admit that it was Kajelijeli who 

        21        incited me to commit the killings and I refused, hence, 

        22        they were obliged to try me by force and without 

        23        assistance of counsel, the sentence could be nothing 

        24        else but the death penalty.

        25   Q.   Now, can you tell the Trial Chamber who you said forced 

        26        you to name Kajelijeli, if your confession was to be 

        27        accepted?

        28   A.   You told me not to mention any names.

        29   Q.   Yes, you can mention that name and I will tell you what 

        30        names you can mention.  Go ahead with that.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: But I think he can seek confirmation before a 

         2        name is mentioned.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think that is what he is doing and I think 

         4        that is correct.

         5   THE WITNESS:  As the ******************* -- it is 

         6        ************************************************* 

         7        1****.  Furthermore, there are two officers of the 

         8        prosecution's office who forced me to mention Kajelijeli 

         9        and I refused. 

        10        I would like to mention ***** who forced me to 

        11        mention Kajelijeli.

        12   MR. PRESIDENT:  Just a minute.  Can you spell that name? 

        13        And the name before, Interpreter?

        14   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: *************************** 

        15        ************, which is his surname.  Is*******spelt, 

        16        **************************. ************** is 

        17        spelt, ************.  The witness mentioned certain 

        18        locations.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Go on, Counsel. 

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: I think we can deal with that one at some 

        22        stage.  Go on.

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Now, Witness, can you tell the Trial Chamber why you 

        25        refused to name Juvenal Kajelijeli even though you were 

        26        faced with a sentence of death?

        27   A.   It was impossible for me to falsely accuse someone who 

        28        did not commit crimes together with me, and I wouldn't 

        29        know how to explain to that person although it has been 

        30        a long time since we had seen each other.

         1   Q.   Now, Witness, did you kill any Tutsis on April 7th of 

         2        1994?

         3   A.   Yes, I killed some Tutsis and I have confessed that 

         4        crime.

         5   Q.   How many Tutsis did you kill on April the 7th, of 1994?

         6   A.   I killed seven Tutsis on the 7th of April 1994.

         7   Q.   Now, Witness, do you recall meeting with 

         8        Mr. Kajelijeli's Defence in September of last year, and 

         9        don't mention the place do you recall meeting with 

        10        Mr. Kajelijeli's Defence in September of last year, and 

        11        do not mention the place?  Do you recall meeting with 

        12        Mr. Kajelijeli's Defence in last September?

        13   A.   Yes, I recall.

        14   Q.   Do you recall at that time giving Kajelijeli's Defence a 

        15        statement which you signed?

        16   A.   Yes, I do remember.

        17   Q.   Witness, I do remember.  Witness, I would like to show 

        18        you a three page document and I would like you to look 

        19        at the last page and tell us whether you recognise your 

        20        signature on that last page?

        21   A.   Yes, indeed the signature is mine.

        22   Q.   Witness, after you met with members of Mr. Kajelijeli's 

        23        Defence team, did any officials from Rwanda, Rwandan 

        24        judicial authorities contact you?

        25   A.   I don't fully understand the question.  Could you 

        26        repeat, please? 

        27   Q.   Were any attempts made to prevent you to come to Arusha 

        28        to testify?  I know it is leading.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: We would like to get the reaction of the 

        30        witness from a neutral -- can you rephrase your

         1        question?

         2   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Witness, do you have any recollection of being contacted 

         5        by anyone from the Rwandan judicial authorities after 

         6        you met with Defence counsel for Mr. Kajelijeli?

         7   A.   Yes, they contacted me.  At the first contact, you were 

         8        present. 

         9   Q.   Could you tell the Trial Chamber what happened there?

        10   A.   It was on the 25th September, I was to meet members of 

        11        the Kajelijeli's counsel and leaving that meeting, I met 

        12        ********* who came to look for me and told me that 

        13        I should not go to testify in Kajelijeli's favour and if 

        14        I did, I ran a risk of being transferred.  My family is 

        15        threatened.  I said that to the lawyer and the lawyer 

        16        went to see ************ where he was and did not say 

        17        that he was present. On another occasion **************** 

        18        summoned me to the state prosecutor's office and asked 

        19        me if I persisted in my intention to go and testify in 

        20        Kajelijeli's case.  I said that I had to go and testify 

        21        in his favour because I know that he has committed no 

        22        crime.  May continue?

        23   Q.   Yes?

        24   A.   He told me that he knew that what I had done was serious 

        25        and that if my file was in the appeal court, if I 

        26        desisted from coming to testify in Kajelijeli's favour, 

        27        he would do something to get my sentence reduced.  I 

        28        said that I knew that he did not have any power to 

        29        intervene in my file with the appeal court, and that he 

        30        would only harm me further.  We should therefore leave

         1        my case to follow its course before the appeal court who 

         2        would have to  take the final decision as far as I am 

         3        concerned.   I left him and went back.

         4   Q.   Now, were there any other contacts by any officials from 

         5        Rwanda concerning you coming to testify here in Arusha?

         6   A.   No, ************************************* as well 

         7        as ************************************** and 

         8        the latter went as far as not to allow me to leave the 

         9        **************************.  And I should like 

        10        to continue, if I may, please?

        11   Q.   Yes, please.

        12   A.   Moreover, Kajelijeli's counsel came back to see me and 

        13        he was refused permission to see me.  He was forced to 

        14        leave without us having met.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, Counsel.

        16   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        17   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        18   A.   I know him.

        19   Q.   How long have you known Juvénal Kajelijeli?

        20   A.   I especially got to know Kajelijeli in 1980 when he was  

        21        the accountant for Mukingo commune, and I knew him until 

        22        1988.  It was 1988 that Juvénal Kajelijeli was appointed 

        23        bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.

        24   Q.   Now, Witness -- did witness say anything? 

        25   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:  Yes, he said something.  I don't 

        26        know.

        27   PROFESSOR HINDS: Tell the witness to just answer the question 

        28        slowly and let me ask further questions so that we do  

        29        not have him revealing information that may disclose his 

        30        identity or the identity of other witnesses.

         1   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, but that answer -- that last answer 

         2        wasn't complete.

         3   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I just wanted to give those 

         4        instructions because we are in open session.  I do not 

         5        know what he is going to say.

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you read out that answer so that you 

         7        translate it through the system?  I think it has nothing 

         8        to do with names.

         9   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: The witness was saying Juvénal 

        10        Kajelijeli remained bourgmestre of Mukingo commune until 

        11        1993.

        12   THE WITNESS: Agreed.

        13   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        14   Q.   Do you know who replaced him as bourgmestre?

        15   A.   Juvénal Kajelijeli was replaced as bourgmestre by 

        16        Harera.  I will spell that, H-A-R-E-R-A.

        17   MR. PRESIDENT: Thank you.

        18   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        19   Q.   And do you know up to what time Harera -- do you know up 

        20        to what time Harera served?

        21   A.   Harera was bourgmestre until April 1994.

        22   Q.   Now, Witness, do you know whether or not there was an 

        23        acting bourgmestre after Kajelijeli was removed from 

        24        office?  Do you know?

        25   A.   In the mean time, conseiller Ndisetse served as acting 

        26        bourgmestre.  Ndisetse, I will spell it, 

        27        N-D-I-S-E-T-S-E.  Ndisetse.

        28   Q.   Do you know when bourgmestre Harera had stopped being 

        29        bourgmestre in April 1994?

        30   A.   Ndisetse ceased, excuse me.  Harera ceased to serve as

         1        bourgmestre in April 1994, after the death of 

         2        Juvénal Habyarimana.

         3   Q.   Do you know the circumstances under which Harera stopped 

         4        being bourgmestre in April of 1994?

         5   A.   Because of his demise -- because he was dead, he stopped 

         6        being bourgmestre.

         7   Q.   Did there come a time when Juvénal Kajelijeli became 

         8        bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1994?

         9   A.   No.

        10   Q.   Now, Witness, would you be able to identify Juvénal 

        11        Kajelijeli in the courtroom if you saw him?

        12   A.   It would be possible unless he has changed.

        13   Q.   Witness, can you stand up and look around the courtroom 

        14        and see if you can see anyone who is Juvénal Kajelijeli, 

        15        describe what he is wearing, where he is sitting, which 

        16        row and who may be sitting next to him, if anyone?

        17   A.   I see Juvénal Kajelijeli over there.  He is wearing 

        18        glasses, a white shirt, white stripped tie, a jacket.  

        19        He is behind the Professor who is counsel for his 

        20        Defence, Bompaka and in front of Kajelijeli is a screen, 

        21        a monitor like the one I have before me here.  That is 

        22        the person that I would call Kajelijeli from Mukingo 

        23        commune. 

        24   Q.   What row is he sitting?

        25   MR. PRESIDENT:  Yes, I think he has identified the Accused.  

        26        We take note of the position of Professor Bompaka, that 

        27        is co-counsel for the Defence of Kajelijeli and the 

        28        description as well.

        29   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Thank you, Your Honour.  I think we are 

        30        going to closed session because I have to ask him

         1        questions which may reveal the identity of the witness 

         2        as we go into most questions.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, we go into closed session to enable 

         4        counsel to raise questions with the witness some of 

         5        which could have a bearing with his identity.  We regret 

         6        members of the public, but it is a necessary procedure 

         7        that has to be followed at this stage.
