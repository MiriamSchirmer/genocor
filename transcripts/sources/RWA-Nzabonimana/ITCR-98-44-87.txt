WITNESS GFA
Cross-examination by Mr. Roach (continued)	9






P R O C E E D I N G S
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber is now in session.  We shall continue this morning with the cross-examination of Witness GFA, and Mr. Roach shall begin. 

Counsel Roach, are you prepared to begin with your cross-examination of the witness? 
MR. ROACH:
Yes, I am.  Yes, I am, but I understood that there was going to be a change in the order of the witnesses, but I am prepared to go.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, you may proceed.  Indeed, we were wondering if it would be necessary to change the order.  We think at this time it is better to proceed with the cross-examination of GFA.  So you have the floor to proceed with that cross-examination on GFA.  I see two other counsel standing.  I would like for one of them to sit down so that the other can take the floor. 

Counsel Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, thank you.  Good morning, and good morning, Your Honours.  I'm a bit embarrassed  with your indication, and I'll tell you why.  Friday afternoon, we realised we had not finished going through the CD-ROMs that were tendered on Thursday morning.  We thought it necessary to continue that exercise this afternoon so that we could continue to learn of the content of that speech at Ruhengeri.  So to finish -- we need to finish this to be able to prepare our 
cross-examination, and since we did not finish, Mr. Hometowu told us that, after consultation with you, we would begin with Witness GBU before proceeding with the cross-examination of the previous witness until we finish inspecting the documents. For us, we still need to completely verify the content of those CD-ROMs before being able to proceed with our cross-examination because there will be things that we will wish to discuss and prepare that cross-examination after -- on the basis of the content of that CD-ROM.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, you have the floor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President and members of the Trial Chamber, I actually came prepared here this morning to thank you for allowing us to have enough time to cross-examine Witness GFA upon the completion of the exercise of transcribing the tapes and to begin with the direct examination of GBU this morning.  And I received the message on Friday at about noon that you had directed that we would start with Witness GBU this morning, and as a result, I stopped completely my preparation of the 
cross-examination of Witness GFA and took up my preparation of the cross-examination of Witness GBU.  And I'm not prepared today.  I don't even have with me today in the building all of my materials for Witness GFA because I didn't expect that we would see him today.  So I don't think we could work this way, to receive instructions on a Friday and come in on Monday and learn again for the first time that things are changed.  And I would ask that you stay with your instructions and that we hear Witness GBU's direct examination today and we go back to Witness GFA after the tapes have been transcribed and after we understand that that is what we're going to be doing.  

So I would ask you to please go back to your instructions as on Friday afternoon.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution.
MR. WEBSTER:
Yes, I'd like to be heard briefly on this issue as well.  Your Honour, it's our submission that we can -- we proceed with the cross-examination of Witness GFA.  We've already started the 
cross-examination.  It's the Prosecutor's submission that it's in the interests of justice to continue with this witness.  It would be a bit confusing, or potentially confusing, to take the testimony of another witness, particularly since the second witness is going to be testifying on the same factual scenario.  And for a rational and reasonable administration of justice, we would request that we proceed with the cross-examination of Witness GFA. 

Concerning these CD-ROMs, if we look at the content of the witness's testimony on direct, the Court will observe, and the parties, that this witness testified about two minutes of the four or five hours that are recorded on those CD-ROMs.  The whole objective of admitting those CD-ROMs in evidence is to look at two minutes of Habyarimana's speech.  So to hold up and to disrupt his cross-examination because the Defence insists on viewing all six CD-ROMs, in our submission, would be unreasonable.  

Now, I realise that under Rule 85 and under Rule 90, the Court has wide latitude to direct the order of testimony of witnesses and to control the proceedings, and so on and so forth.  But even acknowledging that, Your Honour, I would submit that it's in the interests of justice and it would be a much more rational and appropriate manner of proceeding to go directly into the cross-examination of GFA.  

I'm also a bit confused and I would like some clarity from the Court on the issue of who is representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse, because we started out the proceedings this morning with Mr. Roach standing up and saying he was ready to proceed, and then we went on to Mr. Weyl saying no, we should not proceed with the cross-examination of Witness GFA.  So I think just in terms of administering these proceedings, it would be more appropriate to have one attorney for the Accused take the floor and pronounce itself on any particular issue.  

I notice that Mr. Weyl speaks quite a bit.  I have nothing against the Defence dividing their responsibility, but I think it would lead to a more orderly exchange between the parties if there was a bit more predictability on who was representing and whose word was final on issues such as this.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Counsel Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes.  I had expected not to be going ahead with my cross-examination this morning, but I am more or less -- if I'm ordered to do so, ready to proceed with that.  However, over the weekend I spent a great deal of time going through the testimony of the witness that I expected this morning and had put aside the cross-examination preparation because of what we were told.  So we are sort of destabilised by the change, but being an experienced counsel, I could always, you know, flounder around in the ocean without getting drowned.  But my colleague Mr. Weyl and myself have an arrangement where he was going to be looking at the tapes and dealing with that while I'll be doing something else, dealing with the other witness.  And so this is the reason for that.  I'm sorry if that causes any problems to my friend, but we work together cooperatively, and I don't see that that should cause any problems.  But we are in the hands of the Court, although I say we are somewhat destabilised by the change and we should like to have certain predictable conditions under which we can work. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  So as regards this problem, it is true, Friday, there was hesitation regarding proceeding with the cross-examination of GFA because we were told that you were having difficulty and you could not watch all of the CD-ROMs.  So we were asked that the parties be told to prepare to hear GBU in the case we weren't able to proceed to -- with looking at those CD-ROMs.  But according to the information we received thereafter, said that you saw more than half of the content of those CDs and that apparently nothing would stop us from being able to proceed with the 
cross-examination. 

Of course, what is normal is to continue with the cross-examination of GFA.  Now, since Counsel Roach has told us earlier that he is ready to continue with the cross-examination of the witness, and we are very happy to hear this; to us, for the Chamber, it seems to be the preferable solution. 
So, Counsel Roach, we should like to ask you to continue with the cross-examination and we will ask the assistance of the registry to bring in that witness, GFA.
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Madam President, before we bring in GFA, I have a couple of matters. 

Madam President, first of all, I have to tell you that we received nothing of your expectations on Friday that you've just outlined, other than the instruction that GBU would be called on Monday.  So whatever intentions the Trial Chamber had with respect to continuation of the testimony of GFA were not communicated to us.  And I'm completely unprepared to begin the cross-examination of GFA today because I didn't even bring my materials with me.  So maybe you can hear Mr. Roach, but you won't hear from me because I'm not ready. 

Secondly, in the course of the testimony of Witness GFA, it has come to my attention that the Prosecution has in its possession material which it should have disclosed to us under Rule 68 that was not disclosed, and I call your attention to the testimony of Witness GFA that was elicited by Mr. Webster that the Interim Government did nothing to stop the killings after 7 April.  In fact, in the possession of the Prosecutor and introduced as exhibits in the Media trial, I'm informed there are at least five speeches by President Sindikubwabo in which he implored the population to stop the killing.  Those speeches are of the 10th of April, which I understand was admitted as Exhibit 85 in the Media case on the 27th of March 2002; April 18th, 1994, Exhibit 86, admitted on that same date; the 9th of June 1994, admitted as Exhibit 87 on that same date; the 18th of June 1994, admitted as Exhibit 88 on that same date; and on the 1st of July, another speech by the president, admitted as Exhibit 89 on that same date of 27th of March 2002.  None of these speeches have been disclosed the Defence, and I would like to use them in my cross-examination.  

I call your attention to Rule 68, where it requires the Prosecutor to disclose as soon as practicable the existence of evidence known to the Prosecutor which in any way suggests the innocence or mitigates the guilt of the Accused or may affect the credibility of Prosecution evidence, and this falls squarely within the last phrase of Rule 68. 

Secondly, I'm advised that there are multiple statements of witnesses who have been interviewed about the events at Byangabo market, at Rwankeri cellule and at Busugo parish on the 7th of April 1994 and who have listed all of the people who were there who participated in the killings, and that many of these statements do not include Witness GFA as having been present at any of those sites.  
Indeed, the witness statements that we have received from people the Prosecution intends to call, including Witness GBU, does not include any mention of this witness as being present at any of those sites. 
This, too, is evidence which would affect -- or material which would affect the credibility of Prosecution evidence, should have been disclosed to us long ago, and I ask the Trial Chamber to make an order that the material, the speeches, and that the interview reports or statements of other witnesses to these events be disclosed us immediately.  Thank you very much.
	(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel Diagne. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Madam President, good morning, and good morning to Your Honours.  Madam President, I wanted to speak on behalf of Mr. Karemera as regards the confusion on this issue regarding the order of the witnesses. 

Madam President, the Trial Chamber coordinator was very clear with the parties on Friday.  He came to tell us that the Chamber had decided that, Monday morning, Witness GBU would be heard, and that the Prosecutor would begin with examination-in-chief of that witness.  Madam President, we are put into a situation where we are here before you after working all weekend on GBU's statements.  We are in a situation this morning and we have to deal with GFA.  I would like to remind you, 
	Madam President, of your promise to assure equality of arms between the parties.  It's not normal that GFA should be here at nine o'clock in the morning in the witness box.  That knows (as interpreted) that the Prosecutor knows that GFA was going to testify at nine o'clock.  

We all arrived in this room on our side, the Defence, with our files on GBU.  I don't think there is a better example of the inequality of arms between the parties, and we vehemently would like to denounce that.  We have to find ways to resolve this issue when we were told that the Chamber decided one thing and we conform ourselves with that decision and then to have something else is very difficult.  So I should ask that you bring in Mr. Hometowu to tell the Chamber exactly what he said on Friday, because there was no nuance.  If we knew that we were going to be before GFA this morning, we would have, on the weekend, worked more on his statements. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
I would like to remind the parties that the work that was done regarding GBU is not lost.  You can always take advantage of the work that you did whenever GBU will appear.  As regards GFA, you were expected to prepare yourselves and prepare your cross-examination of that witness.  The only problem outstanding is the CDs, and only two minutes of clips were shown from those CDs, and that's where the Chamber, without in any way violating the rights of the parties, has decided that we can proceed with what we already started on Thursday; that is to say, the cross-examination of this witness. And the person who told us he will begin with the -- continue with the cross-examination has said he is ready to proceed, and that's what we have decided.  
We always lose at least half an hour to one hour every single morning before beginning with the actual hearings, in other words. 

Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
First of all, I'm not -- I'm unclear as to the procedure I'm participating in at the present inasmuch as I don't know whether what I'm saying is translated into Kinyarwanda and is listened to by the prospective witness who sits in the witness box this morning.  If it is being translated, I'd ask that witness to withdraw because I want to say something that I'd rather he didn't hear.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, please remove your headset.  

You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. HOOPER:
I know the witness speaks French.  Wouldn't it be easier for this witness just to stand outside the door?  If you're content with the earphones being off, I'll proceed.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, must I understand that you are going to speak in French?
MR. HOOPER:
Not this morning, no. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  You may proceed.  The witness apparently does not understand English. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  First of all, Witness GBU doesn't, at present, particularly affect my case, but I, together with others, came here this morning expecting GBU to be giving evidence, and your decision has taken us all by surprise.  I lament the time that it's taken to discuss it, but it really isn't our fault that we're losing this time this morning, because we're all voicing a genuine concern.  

My GFA papers are not here; they're in my house in Sanawari.  I'll need to go up there and get them.  I did not come here this morning expecting GFA to give evidence.  We were told not that GBU might be giving evidence but that GBU would be giving evidence on Monday, and that GFA, it followed, would not.  And that's something, Madam President, that I fear this Court hasn't fully appreciated. 

Secondly, in respect of the CD evidence, a considerable amount of time was taken up, as you know, diligently, by all parties, the interpreters, court staff, in trying to access that evidence that came to the Defence, as you know, so very late.  The point is being taken that only two minutes of four or five hours of those CDs have been referred to by the Prosecution and that somehow, because of that minimal reference, it all doesn't matter.  Well, it might do and it might matter and it might matter particularly to other defendants, perhaps even further than it might affect Rwamakuba. 

In fact, having seen and heard some of those CDs, I'm beginning to realise now why the Prosecution have only referred you to those two minutes, and one's been ploughing through these CDs looking for something with bite which is prejudicial to the interests of the defendant and beginning to feel and fear that a wholly false interpretation has been placed on that meeting.  Now, that's a very significant matter that needs to be taken up thoroughly with this witness.  

We reached the point with the CDs where we were coming up to the part of the CD that has actually been put in evidence so far.  The part that has been put in evidence so far is about two minutes of President Habyarimana's address.  Now, the content from which that selection has been taken is very important, but we haven't reached -- we haven't been able to look at the entire context, and we need to do it.  

The rest of the CD has not been a worthless exercise at all; it's been a very significant exercise, as, in due course, Madam President, it might reveal itself to you as being.  But we're now at the point where we're coming to the crucial part in terms of the Prosecution propositions that have been hung on this text.  And with respect, we need to see it. 

The third matter I'd mention while I'm addressing you, Madam President, is this:  I join in Mr. Robinson's request in respect of the five speeches that he has referred to that were made by President Sindikubwabo.  There have also been speeches that have been placed on the radio waves by the prime minister, Kambanda, by Rusatira, by Gatsinzi and others.  They have not been served on the Defence and all of which, as with the Sindikubwabo matters, are, on the face of it, playing exculpatory material.  

You'll bear in mind that despite Defence requests to this Court, we, the Defence, have not received one item of exculpatory material from the Prosecution.  We voice again our deep concern of what appears to be, to us, a failure to discharge its responsibilities on the part of the Prosecution.  And it's a matter that's going to recur and recur and which, in fact, is probably the most fundamental offence against the interests of the Defence in this trial.  
But at present, I invite you, Madam President, and your colleagues, to review the decision that you took, it would appear without discussion, in the interests of the Defence in respect of the witness that's to be taken next.  As I say, if it's GFA, I need to go to Sanawari and get my papers.  I'm grateful. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Mr. Hooper.  
Mr. Prosecutor, please.
MR. WEBSTER:
 (Overlapping microphones)... exculpatory material, Your Honour.  Mr. Robinson made a representation that there are five or six speeches by Sindikubwabo in the context of this witness's testimony.  I believe the question that he was asked was whether he knew of any efforts by the Interim Government to stop the killings.  He answered that question.  There was no follow-up by myself, and perhaps it will come up in cross-examination if he was listening to RTLM throughout the events, but to make the allegation that somehow there's a Rule 68 violation because there are Sindikubwabo speeches, I think is a bit -- first of all, it's premature and it's simply not accurate.  

Furthermore, the Prosecutor has already served all of the RTLM transcripts that we have in our possession.  We've already served all of the Radio Rwanda transcripts that we have in our possession.  That was an agreement that we made with the Defence during an informal meeting of the parties.  The Court itself was aware of that.  There was extended colloquy on the issue of whether there would be -- whether the Prosecutor would serve the entirety of our selection of radio broadcasts or not, and that was done.  So, in fact, if Mr. Robinson or Mr. Hooper were to look through the materials that they've already received, they would find these very same transcripts because, presumably, these media transcripts all have to do with RTLM broadcasts, and the Defence has the entire set of RTLM broadcasts.  

Mr. Robinson went on to address witness statements, where the name of this particular witness was not listed in statements by other witnesses.  Well, that in and of itself is not exculpatory material.  It's not exculpatory, number one, simply to point out the omission or the allegation that this witness's name was not listed among the perpetrators, because we don't know how exhaustive a listing each of these witnesses made, and it's somewhat contradictory to suggest that the Prosecutor has not served this material on the Defence when he's using those very materials, which are the witness statements that we served pursuant to Rule 66, to make his submission.  

So I respect that some of the issues we discuss in the mornings are important.  I think this one is really a disservice to moving ahead with the trial.  These are issues that are more appropriately dealt with at another time.  I would like to proceed.  The witness is on the stand.  Mr. Roach has represented he's ready to proceed.  Maybe we could start with the cross-examination of this witness and take things as they come.  If Mr. Roach finishes his cross-examination early or before the end of today's session, then we could address the issue of what should be done next.  But as a matter of principle, we should go forward, and I'm suggesting or submitting to the Court that we proceed and take this witness's cross-examination.  Thank you. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber is of the opinion therefore that we can continue with the cross-examination, beginning with Mr. Roach, who is ready to proceed, and we shall subsequently see what would happen with the others. 

Mr. Roach. 
MR. ROACH:
I just might say to you, Madam President -- I just might say to you that with respect to one part of my cross-examination which concerns the Ruhengeri meeting, that I needed to do some more consultation before I conclude my cross-examination, with my client.  I had planned to do that on Saturday when I met with my client, but unfortunately we focused on other matters and were not expecting this.  But with respect to the other parts of my cross-examination, absenting the Ruhengeri meeting, I will proceed. 
WITNESS GFA,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.
A.	Good morning.
Q.	Just before we start asking you some questions, I should like you, if you can, to give me short answers and, if possible, yes or no, because we have a lot of ground to cover and many witnesses and we want to proceed quickly.  Is that acceptable to you, Witness?
A.	I shall make an effort. 
Q.	Very well.  I should ask you first a series of questions having to do with the war.  

Now, you told us that there were -- there was a war that was in 1990; is that correct?
A.	Yes, it was in 1990.
Q.	And you told us that overnight, the Inyenzi, or the troops that were invading, overtook Ruhengeri.  Was that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now --
A.	The day on which they attacked, they took the town on the same day.
Q.	Yes.  And where did these troops come from, if you know?
A.	They were coming from Uganda.
Q.	I see.  And do you know if these troops were Ugandan troops?
A.	They were Rwandan refugees.
Q.	And Rwandan refugees who were living in Uganda; is that what you mean?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Now, you told us that there was another war after that time?
A.	Ruhengeri was attacked twice.
Q.	When was the second attack?
A.	In 1993, whereas the first attack on Ruhengeri was in 1991.
Q.	Yes.  Was there another attack after the attack of 1993?
A.	It was around the 13th that we saw the Inkotanyi forces.  What I mean is the 13th of July 1994.
Q.	I see.  Now, was it separate wars or one continuous war?
A.	It was a single war which was continuing.  That is how I saw it.
Q.	Yes.  Now, you told us that at one occasion, upon searching the body of one of the persons that was stopped, that you found Ugandan shillings in his pocket.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's right.
Q.	And you concluded that this person must have come from Uganda because of this?
A.	Yes, indeed.
Q.	Now, do you have any information or do you know if there were troops that came from other countries, like Tanzania, for example?
A.	The fighters came from everywhere.  Their common point was that they were Rwandan refugees living in exile.  These refugees were living in many countries, including Tanzania.
Q.	I see.  Now, are you aware that from 1990 onward, there were troops belonging to the RPF in your country of Rwanda?
A.	I know that RPF forces attacked Rwanda in 1990, but their official arrival was characterised by their occupation of the CND building.
Q.	And their occupation of the CND building, which I believe is located in Kigali, that was what year?  Do you know what year that was?
A.	I do not recall what year it was, but I know that this had been agreed on in the Arusha Accords, but I do not know on what date those troops came to the CND building.
Q.	I see.  But what about troops that were in what was called the demilitarised area; were you aware of that?
A.	All of this was determined by the Arusha Accords.  I do not remember on which date the demilitarised zone was established.  I know it existed, but I don't know from when.
Q.	I see.  Now, you told us that these troops that attacked were called Inyenzi, and you said that those who collaborated with them and these troops were also called -- you told us they were called Inkotanyi; is that correct?
A.	I stated that these troops were members of the RPF Inkotanyi.  Their accomplices bore the same name.  We referred to them by the same name.
Q.	Yes.  And you said that the Tutsi who lived in Rwanda were considered as part of the Inkotanyi; is that correct?
A.	Yes, that's what I said.
Q.	But isn't it correct that those persons who attacked Rwanda also involved Hutus?
A.	Yes, that is possibly true that there were Hutus amongst them. 
Q.	And are you aware also, those people who were defending against the attacks also involved Tutsis?
A.	There were some Tutsis amongst them, yes.
Q.	And if that was the case, why would you be attacking all Tutsis?
A.	I think that question should be addressed to those who ordered us to attack them, whereas they knew that those troops were mixed.  We were only following -- obeying orders.
Q.	Very well.  Do you have a sense of what is right and what is wrong?
A.	At any rate, I'm not mentally sick; therefore, I know that I am in control of all my mental faculties and I can make a distinction between good and evil.
Q.	But then you blame those who gave you orders.  Did you not use your own discretion?
A.	The powers that be were very strong, very powerful.  When one tried to say anything against that government, one was considered an enemy, so we were obliged to obey orders that were given.
Q.	Well, what would happen to you if you didn't carry out orders to kill people who you thought were innocent?
A.	I would have been killed.  When we carried out these activities, we were asked to participate altogether.  All those who refused to do so had to do.
Q.	And who would kill you?
A.	By the Interahamwe and their leaders.
Q.	Well, you were in a leadership role in the Interahamwe.  Did you kill anyone who didn't carry out orders?
A.	I think that, with us, everybody was afraid of the government and no one tried to stand up to it.  All those who tried had problems, and this was the Tutsis because they did not respect the government in place.  If I said that Agathe Uwilingiyimana and the Belgians who were killed during the genocide, do you think that those people would have had any scruples in the face of someone like myself? 
Q.	Well, I'll answer your questions when my turn comes, but now you must answer my questions.  And I'm asking you if you had killed anyone who didn't carry out orders that you might have given them.
A.	Everyone obeyed the orders given by Kajelijeli, Nzirorera and company because we knew them and no one wanted to go against their orders.
Q.	Will you answer my question? 
A.	Counsel, I am answering you by saying that I myself, first of all, did not give any orders.  No one disobeyed the orders given by Nzirorera or Kajelijeli.  Therefore, I didn't kill anyone for having failed to obey those orders because no one disobeyed.  We all obeyed. 
Q.	So then no one was killed because they did not carry out orders?
A.	I'm only speaking about those whom I knew who were working with me.
Q.	Well, in carrying out these orders, you felt you were protecting the country; is that correct?
A.	That's what we were told.  We were told that we needed to defend our country, but most of all, it was necessary to avenge Habyarimana.
Q.	But I'm asking you how you felt.  Did you feel you were defending the country when you made the attacks on various persons that you told us about?
A.	No.
Q.	You didn't feel you were defending the country?
A.	No.  I never wanted to kill anyone.  I was never happy to do so.  I was merely following orders.
Q.	Now, I understand that as you were growing up, you experienced life peacefully with Tutsi neighbours and friends.  Is that correct?
A.	Yes, quite so.  I have always lived in harmony with Tutsis since I was born, until those events came about.  As you say, I wouldn't have been able to put it better than you have.
Q.	Yes.  And you went to school with Tutsis?
A.	Even my mother is Tutsi.  Indeed, I was in school with Tutsis. 
Q.	Did you say that your mother was Tutsi?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Did you tell us in your examination-in-chief that persons who were the children of Tutsi parents or Tutsi women were also targeted for killing?
A.	I said so.
Q.	I see.  Was your mother killed?
A.	She is alive.
Q.	Were any of your family killed?
A.	All my mother's family was killed.  Her sisters and brothers, her parents, were all killed.  She was the only survivor.
Q.	Were any other relatives of yours killed?
A.	Yes, there were some.
Q.	Who were these?
A.	There are very many.  I cannot count them all.  I cannot mention their names, for reasons of security, but if you so wish, I can make up a list of all those who died.
Q.	You told us that your mother's family were killed.  Members of that family, you told us, died during this period.  I asked you whether other relatives were killed, and you said, "Many other relatives were killed."  My question is, who were these relatives, not their names, but how were they related to you?
A.	I can mention cousins -- 
Q.	Yes. 
A.	-- uncles, and many others.  I cannot remember all the relationships that existed between myself and those victims, but if you were to allow me some time, I could do so. 
Q.	No, that's fine.  Thank you.  Some of your relatives were Hutu?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And some of them who were Hutu --
A.	My relatives on my father's side were Hutus. 
Q.	Were any of your relatives on your father's side killed?
A.	No.
Q.	Okay.  So they all survived?
A.	No.  ******************************************, but during the war, they didn't suffer any harm.
Q.	I see.  Is your father alive?
A.	Yes, he's alive.
Q.	I see.  Now, were your father and mother aware of what you were doing when you were killing people, as you told us?
A.	They would see me leave and come home but I made no mention of where I was going.  But they knew what was going on.  They knew that people were being targeted and chased; they knew it.
Q.	Did they know that you were involved?
A.	They knew.  They knew who was responsible and they knew that we respected orders.  Furthermore, they knew that I was doing it somehow to protect one of my parents.
Q.	Which one of the parents were you protecting?
A.	My mother.
Q.	So you are telling us that you went out with other Interahamwe, killing people, to protect your mother; is that your evidence?
A.	Yes, because had I not done so, we were also going to die.
Q.	But why not your father?  Why weren't you protecting your father?
A.	I thought that my father wasn't targeted.  Everyone knew he was a Hutu.
Q.	Now, you told us that, growing up, you lived peacefully with a number of friends and schoolmates up until the time of the war; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Did you kill any of your classmates or your friends who were Tutsi?
A.	We killed people in crowds.  We didn't kill individually such and such a person.  I do know that one of my former classmates died in one of the groups that we targeted and killed. 
Q.	Were you present when your classmate was killed?
A.	Yes, I was.
Q.	Now, you gave us the names of some of the persons that were killed, that you saw killed.  You remember that evidence? 
A.	I do remember.
Q.	And is it correct to say that most of the people who were killed in groups that you belonged to or in your attacks on these groups, you knew their names?
A.	No, I didn't know most of the victims.  I only knew some people of my own age. 
A.	I see.
Q.	I remind you that it wasn't my group.  It was the group of those leaders --
Q.	Yes, but you told us --
A.	-- heading those groups.  I wasn't responsible.
Q.	But you told us that you held ********************. 
A.	I said that.  I said that.  But the group didn't belong to me.  Am I the MRND or the chairman of the Interahamwe?  No, I wasn't.  The Interahamwe were a wing of the MRND.
Q.	But you were ****************************of your subgroup?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And one of your roles ****************was to get the membership out to go on these killing sprees; is that correct?
A.	I didn't give orders to kill.  We obeyed the orders.  We received orders and transmitted those to our subordinates.  We were in the middle, if you will.  The leaders would call us, give us orders, and we would transmit those orders.  We didn't create the MRND.  We didn't issue membership cards.  The group belonged to those men, not to us. 
Q.	Now, were there any Tutsi youth in your group that went out attacking others?
A.	No, there were none.
Q.	Now, in your evidence-in-chief, you told us something about a man by the name of Robert Kajuga.  You know that name?
A.	I didn't speak of Robert Kajuga in my written statement, nor in my evidence, but I do know him.  He was the president of the Interahamwe on the national level.
Q.	Did you tell us that he was at the meeting in Ruhengeri?
A.	Yes, he was at the meeting in Ruhengeri.  I saw him there.
Q.	And who is he?
A.	Kajuga was the president of the Interahamwe at the national level. 
Q.	Did you know that Robert Kajuga was a Tutsi?
A.	I didn't know.
Q.	Before today, did you ever hear that?
A.	No, I've just learnt that now.  I did not know he was Tutsi.  I did know he was president of the Interahamwe.  I believed that he was someone just like anyone else -- rather, that he was a Hutu like everyone else.
Q.	Yes.  Now, did your colleagues and the membership of the group of which you were *******************, did they know that you were of Tutsi origin, that your mother was Tutsi?
A.	I'm repeating, it wasn't my group.  It was the MRND's group.  Some of the people in my group were aware; others had no idea.  But I shall repeat:  It wasn't my group.  That group belonged to the MRND and, more precisely, it belonged to Nzirorera. 
Q.	Now, did you ever hear of a man by the name of Lizinde?
A.	Yes, I heard about him.
Q.	Do you know that he was a Hutu?
A.	Yes, I knew he was a Hutu.
Q.	Did you know that he supported the RPF?
A.	I don't know what he thought deep down.  What I do know is that the Inkotanyi released him from prison.

	1015H 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	You don't know that he supported the RPF?
A.	All I know is that the Inkotanyi freed him from prison.  They brought him within the ranks of the Inkotanyi.  If they free you from prison, you have to like them.  But I don't know what he thought deep down, if truly deep down he supported the Inkotanyi or not.  I don't know.
Q.	Now, Mr. Witness, in view of what you said to us this morning, that there were Hutus who supported the RPF and there were Tutsis who were defending the country from the invaders, isn't it fair to say that these killings were political as opposed to ethnic? 
A.	First of all, I will repeat what I said before.  You asked that if, among the Inkotanyi, there were Hutus.  I said yes.  You asked me after if, within the country, there were Tutsis who were considered as Inkotanyi.  I said yes.  So if those killings took place, it's because the Hutu who were with the Inkotanyi, they were oppressed by Habyarimana's regime.  They didn't have anywhere to go.  If you consider those who went to the ranks of -- to the Inkotanyi Busohaki (phonetic), Bizinde (phonetic), Kanyahuka (phonetic), those were people who were oppressed by Habyarimana's regime.  They didn't have anywhere to go.  They had no choice.  Those were people who had suffered.  So if the killings took place, I can't say if they were political in nature, if they were political killings.  What I can say is that Habyarimana wanted to exterminate all of the Tutsis because the Inkotanyi had attacked the country. 
Q.	Now, this morning you told us you joined in the killings because you wanted to save your mother; is that correct?  I want to establish that very firmly. 
A.	I will repeat my answer.  I was a member of the MRND.  No one in my region could join another party.  You had to join the MRND to be received well.  You had to be ready to kill.  I followed the others so that I wouldn't be killed, so that I wouldn't be considered as an Inkotanyi.  I also wanted to defend my mother, because our region was complicated.  If you weren't from the MRND, you were really under threat.
Q.	I will come back to this question, but you said that in your region, you could only belong to the MRND?  Is that what you said? 
A.	If you were opposed to the MRND, you had to die.  You either had to be a member of the CDR or the MRND.  If you were on the other side, you were the enemy.
Q.	Well, isn't it true that in Ruhengeri, from 1991 onwards, you had the MDR, the PSD, apart from the CDR, you had those parties as well as the PL party and the PDC party?  Isn't that true? 
A.	That is not true.  All that I can say was that once the PSD hoisted its flag in Ruhengeri, I remember that we went there and beat members of the PSD, and we removed that flag.  That means that no other party was present in Ruhengeri, save the MRND.
Q.	What about the MDR? 
A.	I told you that the MDR was not present.  It was like the PSD.  They also hoisted their flag in Ruhengeri.  We were sent over there to take it down and beat the members of that party.  And we did so.
Q.	So let us talk about 1993.  I am putting to you that there were other parties in Ruhengeri in 1993. 
A.	Counsel, let me tell you:  I was in Ruhengeri; you were not.  There were no other political parties.  I gave you the example of two parties, the PSD and the MDR.  We took their flag down and we beat their members, and we gave those flags over to Nzirorera.
Q.	Now, are you talking about a whole city of Ruhengeri?  Is that what you're talking about? 
A.	Yes.  I know very well the entire city of Ruhengeri.  That is where we ripped down the flags.  There was an MDR in Nyakimana, a flag of the MDR in a place called Cabaret.  I didn't see any other flags hoisted in Ruhengeri, save that of the MRND and that of the CDR. 
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about the planning for the massacres and the killings.  Now, you told us that the assassination or the death of President Habyarimana was a surprise; is that correct?
A.	Yes.  We were also surprised by the president's death.
Q.	Yes.  And I gathered for -- from your examination-in-chief, and correct me if I'm wrong, that before the president's death, there was no plan to go out in groups and kill Tutsi people. 
A.	First of all, let me answer by saying that we did not plan the killings, we Interahamwe.  The plan was implemented by the leaders.  I said -- well, I've forgotten your question now, Counsel.  Would you kindly repeat it for me? 
Q.	Yes.  I gathered from your evidence-in-chief that, as far as you know, there were no plans for killing of Tutsis in any mass way?
A.	I said that there was a plan to exterminate the Tutsis, but we didn't do it publicly, as we did in 1994.  We weren't going to kill them openly.  But we would go to kill them, to kidnap them and kill them, but we did it in secret.
Q.	And this started when? 
A.	It began after the first attack of the Inkotanyi at Ruhengeri; early 1991, in other words.
Q.	So from 1991 until the president's death, were you organised in groups going out killing Tutsis or others who supported Tutsis? 
A.	From 1991, the MRND had groups who killed Tutsis in cooperation with soldiers.  For example, Kajelijeli and some soldiers like Hasengineza from Mukamira.  Their group took people and threw them in Rahungura (phonetic), in a grave, or they took them to the communal office.  So the MRND and its men who were defended had a group to go and kill people.  We were given orders and we carried them out.  We never did anything without receiving orders from those leaders. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, are you aware of Hutu politicians being assassinated or killed? 
A.	Yes.  I know that they were killed.  I know some.  I know some who had been killed.
Q.	And are you aware of an incident in which, on one night, a number of Hutu politicians were assassinated? 
A.	I don't know which night you're talking about.  Perhaps you can ask me the names of people who were killed, but I don't know what specific night you're speaking of.  Perhaps you can specify your question. 
Q.	Okay.  You are aware of elected politicians, who were of Hutu background, who were assassinated? 
A.	All I do know is that Agathe, who was a minister, who was prime minister, she was killed.  I know she was assassinated, and I know that she was someone who people admired.  Perhaps other authorities were elected and killed but I don't know them.  Perhaps you can ask that question to the leaders. 
Q.	Now, I wanted to direct your mind to 1993, and my questions were directed to that year.  Were you aware of Hutu politicians who were killed in 1993, and specifically, in November of 1993. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Webster? 
MR. WEBSTER:
I'm objecting to the form of the question, Your Honour.  The witness was asked this question twice already and it's not specific enough.  The question is vague.  So I'm asking counsel to either be more particular in his question or to move on to something else, because he's asked this twice already. 
MR. ROACH:
The witness asked me to specify a date, and I just gave him a date.  I told him in November of 1993. 
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness asked you to specify names.  He did not ask you to specify dates, if I recall the record. 
MR. ROACH:
I think the witness told me to be more specific, and I'm giving him some specific information now. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	On the night of the 17th or 18th of November 1993, at Kirambo, were you aware of a number of elected politicians who were assassinated? 
A.	I have no idea.  Perhaps you can give me their names.  I don't know the names of all the politicians.  I'm not an expert in this area.  Perhaps you can give me their names and I can tell you if such and such a person was killed, but I don't even know the place Kirambo that you're speaking of.
Q.	Very well.  I will give you some names momentarily. 

Now, you told us in your examination-in-chief that mass killings began on the 7th of April because the people were upset by the assassination.  Was that your evidence? 
A.	I told you that on the 7th of April, we were given orders to go and kill all of the Tutsis, to avenge President Habyarimana's death.  That's -- that is what I said.
Q.	I see.  But prior to that time, am I correct there were no mass killings, at least in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes.  The Bagogwe had been killed since 1991.  They were -- there were several waves of killing of the Bagogwe.  They were killed en masse.
Q.	I see.  Now, the Prosecutor asked you if there were any fighting between the government forces and the rebels in Ruhengeri during the time of the mass killings.  Do you recall that question and your answer? 
A.	Yes.  When I was asked if, on the 7th of April 1994, if I had seen RPF fighters in our region, I said that I hadn't seen any.
Q.	But you also told us that there was a government forces encampment in Ruhengeri on a hill.  You identified the location on a hill in one of the photographs.  Do you recall that?  
A.	I wasn't asked about that.  The Rwandan Armed Forces had several positions in Ruhengeri.  I spoke of Ruhehe hill where the Mukamira soldiers were posted.  Otherwise, there were soldiers everywhere, throughout Ruhengeri préfecture.  There were camps for the Rwandan Armed Forces.  There were camps for the gendarmes as well in Ruhengeri.
Q.	Yes.  And where was the closest camp for the armed forces to your dwelling or your residence? 
A.	The closest camp was Mukamira camp in Ruhengeri.  However, there was another camp in Ruhengeri town, in Kigombe, and Kigombe neighboured on my commune of Mukingo.
Q.	And did you, from time to time, visit any of these camps? 
A.	How could I visit a military camp?  I was a civilian. 
Q.	So --
A.	You go to a military camp when one calls you to go there.
Q.	Well, did you ever visit any of these camps? 
A.	No.  I never visited any military camp.
Q.	Yes, Witness, you can answer my questions yes or no, if it's convenient for you.  But you told us that your group had military training; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I did indeed speak of Nzirorera and his group.  So our group did undertake military training.
Q.	But the military training that you had did not involve your going to any of these military camps? 
A.	Some did their military training in Mukamira camp, some of the recruits.  And sometimes we would do our training in front of the commune office in Mukingo.  We could also go to the Gisesero football pitch at a place known as Carrière on Ruhehe hill.
Q.	Yes.  Now, the activities you told us about the Interahamwe group, of which you were a member, those activities of going out on raids or on attack, did not involve any soldiers, apparently; is that correct?
A.	In some of our operations, soldiers were involved, yes.
Q.	So when soldiers were involved, who would lead the operation? 
A.	The soldiers would show us what to do or how to handle some weapons.  For instance, when we went to attack the convent, they showed us how to throw grenades so that we avoid killing ourselves, and we would obey the instructions given by those soldiers.
Q.	So apart from the attack on the convent, were you involved with soldiers in any other attacks? 
A.	No.  I did not see many soldiers in other attacks except that I also saw them at Musumba.  On other occasions, we would arrest someone and hand them over to the soldiers or they would catch someone and hand them over to us.  Otherwise, there was an ex-sergeant who was in the Interahamwe group that we were in, but he was a former soldier.
Q.	I see.  So is it fair to say, then, that the killings of which you were a witness involved persons who were civilians and not soldiers, apart from those two incidents that you told us about? 
A.	But the whole group would work together, be it soldiers.  Even if the soldiers were not present, they would support us.  We were together.  I can give you more details on this matter, if you so wish.
Q.	But it's only on the two particular missions that you told us about that you saw soldiers present?
A.	Yes.  That's what I stated.  But I also told you that even on other occasions, it was possible to arrest someone and to place them in the hands of the soldiers and vice versa.  Sometimes the commune would arrest someone and hand the person over to the soldiers, and vice versa.  So there was a collaboration between the military and civilian authorities and the Interahamwe, because we operated as a single body. 
Q.	Now, who was the military person that you collaborated with?  Who was the leader of that group that you worked with? 
A.	It was General Augustin Bizimungu and the Mukamira camp commander, Bizabarimana, whereas for -- the chief of operations in Ruhengeri was Augustin Bizimungu.  So there were ranks amongst the various bodies.
Q.	And did they speak to you, giving you orders? 
A.	They would give orders to their soldiers, and we had persons who gave us instructions, we as Interahamwe.
Q.	I am asking you who was the military person that you got orders from.  You mentioned Bizimungu but then you told us no, you didn't get direct instructions from Bizimungu.  My question is:  Who were the military personnel from whom you directly communicated and who gave you instructions? 
A.	I can explain that to you.  General Bizimungu and Nzirorera attended all meetings.  The understanding between the two was such that soldiers and civilian authorities and the Interahamwe worked together.  Some of the weapons that we used came from the military camp.  So, you see, the various bodies of the Tribunal worked together.  So it was similar.  Instructions given to the Interahamwe were given by Nzirorera but in agreement with General Bizimungu and others.  One could not shoot someone in military territory without the military themselves being aware.  So they were all involved in the secret and they worked together.
Q.	Yes.  But, Witness, will you answer my question?  I asked you who was the military person that you directly related with and who you communicated with, that you saw face to face and who you communicated with.
A.	But I was explaining to you that General Bizimungu and Nzirorera attended all meetings, and I have said that throughout my testimony.
Q.	So did General Bizimungu give you any instructions, directly? 
A.	Let me remind you:  I was not the leader of our group; there were two others, two other individuals, who were my superiors.  If those two communicated with them, I don't know, but all I can tell you is that the Interahamwe and the armed forces worked together.
Q.	Well, did you know any of the soldiers who participated in any of the raids with you? 
A.	I know, for instance, Corporal Rachel.  There were others but I do not know their names.  I also know that Captain Boniface Hasengineza took away people.  He kidnapped a large number of Bagogwe, and he would kidnap them so that he could later on kill them.  And this happened in broad daylight.
Q.	Now, can you tell us the names of those two persons that you mentioned again, the corporal, and can you spell his name for us? 
A.	Corporal Rachel is spelt R-A-C-H-E-L, Corporal Rachel.  And then there was Captain Boniface Hasengineza, H-A-S-E-N-G-I-N-E-Z-A, Hasengineza.
Q.	And have you had conversations with Corporal Rachel or Captain Hasengineza? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Could you give us a bit of -- could you -- if I may -- I'm objecting to the form of the question, Your Honours.  I'd like a bit more precision in the question, if I may ask.  The question is vague.  He just -- it's open-ended, if he could put when. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Witness, you told us about two soldiers who collaborated with you, presumably in raids on Tutsis or other Inkotanyi, and I am asking you, with respect to these two men, did you speak to them during these raids or did they give you any orders during these raids? 
A.	I said that Corporal Rachel was with us in the attack on Busogo.  I also stated that I knew, with certainty, that Captain Hasengineza would kidnap the Bagogwe in order to go and kill them.
Q.	Have you ever had any discussions of any nature with Corporal Rachel? 
A.	No.  I knew him and I saw him during the killings.  We all met when we would go to Busogo, and that's all I know.  I don't have anything else to add.
Q.	I see.  And with respect to Captain Hasengineza, did you see him take people away?  Or is this what you were told?
A.	No, I saw him do so.  We would see them often, even on board vehicles, and these vehicles sometimes would stop and we could see them, the Bagogwe, in them.
Q.	Now, I have some more information with respect to Hutu political leaders who were killed, and I should like to ask you if you know anything about this.  It was on the night of the 17th/18th of November 1993, and they were members of the party that you belonged to, which is the MRND, and they had been elected in the demilitarised zone.  Now, do you have any information or did you hear about the killings of those politicians? 
A.	But you didn't give me any names.  You haven't mentioned any names for me.  A moment ago you had said that you had more information regarding the names, so I'm waiting for the names and then maybe I'll be able to answer you.
Q.	Well, we'll see if we can help you identify this a little bit more. 
Now, are you aware, in 1993 or early in 1994, that there were United Nations peacekeeping forces in Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I did.
Q.	Did you observe at any time any United Nations peacekeeping forces in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I do not remember having seen them in Ruhengeri.  I know I saw them in Kigali, but those who were based in Ruhengeri were the GOMN forces, the forces who were sent by the OAU, and they were posted not very far from my home.
Q.	I see.  And during the time that you were carrying out the raids that you told us, following Habyarimana's assassination, were these forces present in Ruhengeri? 
A.	The GOMN forces were no longer there because they had been replaced by UNAMIR forces, if I'm not mistaken.  No, they were no longer there.  I wasn't seeing them then.
Q.	You told us you had not seen any UNAMIR forces in Ruhengeri. 
A.	Yes.  That's what I said.
Q.	You said, however, the GOMN forces had been replaced by UNAMIR forces. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Well, did you observe that or is this what someone told you? 
A.	That's what I got to know.  I know that the GOMN forces were set up at ISAE, and at a given moment they left and I got to know that it was replaced by UNAMIR.  But, listen, I wasn't really paying much attention to that.
Q.	I see.  So you didn't make personal observations of UNAMIR forces?
A.	I have told you that I definitely saw them in Kigali, if you can recall.
Q.	Yes.  We are talking about Ruhengeri.  You never saw them in Ruhengeri, is that --
A.	This happened a very long time ago.  I'm not very sure.  I don't really remember any more whether I saw them in Ruhengeri and in Kigali, and quite frankly speaking --
Q.	Okay. 
A.	-- I don't think that would have helped me very much whether I saw them in Kigali or in Ruhengeri.  It was the same for me.
Q.	I see.  So when were you in Kigali?  Did you go there in 1993? 
A.	I would go to Kigali very frequently up until 1994; in other words, until the time when the incident in which the president's plane was shot down.  I was going there very often, just like any other Rwandan.
Q.	Yes.  But following the president's assassination on April 7th, you -- or April 6th, you didn't go to Kigali; is that correct? 
A.	No.  Since the assassination of Habyarimana, in other words from the 7th, I never went back there.  I went there in August -- no, rather, in September 1994, as I was coming back from the Congo.
Q.	All right.  We'll talk about that in a minute, but I wanted to just clarify from you, the raids that you told us about that took place following President Habyarimana's assassination, those raids, were they on a nightly basis?  Would you go out every night with your posse, so to speak, hunting for Tutsis or their collaborators?
A.	After Habyarimana's death, the attacks were carried out during the day.  Once we went and attacked at night and we realised that it didn't help very much and so we postponed the attack until the following day, and from that time on we would attack only during the day.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Apparently, that came from the technicians' booth on that side. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Do the technicians have any problems?  

You may proceed, Counsel. 
MR. ROACH:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	So following the 7th of April, until the time you left Rwanda, were you engaged every day, on a daily basis, in hunting down Inkotanyi, as you call them? 
A.	No.  That was not the case.  The massacres took place on the 7th and on the 8th.  Those were the days on which the most murderous attacks took place.  Subsequently, other persons participated in other operations, but I personally -- I did not take part in those kinds of activities.  But the most murderous attacks took place on the 7th and on the 8th.
Q.	Yes.  Now I should like to ask you some questions concerning your evidence on the rape of women.  Now, did any of these rapes, of which you were witness, were any of them carried out prior to April 7th, 1994?
A.	I only spoke of the rape that I recalled.  Maybe there were others, but I only referred to the one of which I was a witness.
Q.	Had you witnessed any rapes prior to April 7th, 1994? 
A.	I have told you that I did not witness any other rapes.  I testified to the rape of which I was a witness, but I am unable to tell you whether there were any others or not.
Q.	Witness, I'm only asking you what was your own personal observations, and I'm asking you if there were any prior -- that you observed any rapes prior to.  Can you answer that yes or no?  Before the 7th of April, did you  --
A.	No, I've said no.
Q.	Very well.  Now, did you witness any rapes on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, yes.  And I testified about that.
Q.	And how many rapes did you observe?  How many victims of rapes did you observe on that day? 
A.	I said that I saw a girl who was raped, and I said that another one was killed in an atrocious manner and I gave the description.
Q.	So basically there were just two -- or just one rape or two rapes you saw on that day? 
A.	It was one.
Q.	One, I see. 
A.	One -- one person was raped and the other one was tortured.
Q.	Yes.  And then on the following day, on the 8th of April, did you observe any rapes on that day? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So, in all, it's only one rape you observed during the entire time? 
A.	Yes.  I personally only saw those acts on one occasion.
Q.	I see.  Now, you had told us that orders were given to eliminate all Tutsis and their supporters, and by that we understand that they should be killed or put to death.  So I'm asking you if you know what was the reason or motivation behind the rapes.
A.	The rape of women and girls was undertaken in order to show disdain for the Tutsi people.  They were raped during the day, in daylight, in order to demonstrate the disdain held against the Tutsis, that ethnic group.
Q.	And were other Tutsis forced to witness these rapes, as they happened? 
A.	I don't know.  Personally, I didn't see the Tutsis because at that time they were being killed and they couldn't be onlookers and be watching, unless there were Tutsis who were hidden somewhere and were observing the scene from their hiding place.  But I saw that they were being killed and they were being pursued, and I didn't see them standing around looking at the incidents that were taking place.
Q.	So the disdain of which you speak was not a manifestation for other Tutsis? 
A.	They would do that so as to show this to other Tutsis.  The Tutsis were the victims.  After the rape, the victims would be killed.  So the person who was doing the killing was showing his friends that he had disdain for that person, and when such and such person was raped in broad daylight, it was immediately understood that this was a kind of disdain or humiliation of the victim.
Q.	Yes.  Now, I just wanted to know - again, you might have told us but just remind me -- where did this idea come from, this idea to rape?  Was that the rapists' own motivation? 
A.	It was an ideology.  It was inspiration which we had been told since we were in primary school.  We were told that the Tutsis were bad.  And during the training that I mentioned, Kajelijeli would come and speak to us, telling us that the Tutsis were bad, that they had colonised the Hutus, and that they had mistreated, oppressed the Hutus.  And they explained to us that Tutsis women were very beautiful and that they used their beauty in order to seduce Hutus and to make them do bad things, that it was necessary that they should be raped, and the persons who raped them were indeed trying to find out about their beauty.
Q.	So would persons be killed if they didn't rape?  You told us that if you didn't kill, you might be killed.  But suppose they had killed these Tutsis, women, without raping them.  Would that mean they would be killed as well? 
A.	No.  I don't know about that.  All Tutsi women were not raped.  Neither did all killers rape their feminine victims.  I think that the actions were carried out at individual levels.  Each person would act according to his or her own will or according to instructions that they received, but they would carry out these acts in their own manner.
Q.	So you have told us that these rapes were done on an individual basis and persons would act individually.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	No.  What I said was that each person would act individually, depending on his understanding of the training undergone.
Q.	Well, why did you not participate in the rapes yourself? 
A.	I didn't want to.  I couldn't rape someone in public.  I couldn't see myself doing that.
Q.	And were you afraid that if you didn't participate in rapes, there would be retaliation against you? 
A.	No.  I was not afraid, from that perspective.  I think that I had to be present during those activities but not necessarily for that.
Q.	And did you help to hold the -- any of these women to -- who were raped or who were brutally killed in a sexual manner? 
A.	No.  I did no such thing.
Q.	I see. 
A.	But it was done in front of me.
Q.	Now, were there any plans or provisions made for the disposal of the corpses of those people who were killed? 
A.	I know that in our region, the Interahamwe did not bury their Tutsi victims.  Harerimana, Emmanuel, the bourgmestre, supervised the burials of the victims.  I know of no plan to take care or dispose of those bodies.  That was the commune.  But I was not aware of such a plan.
Q.	And did you observe how the bodies were disposed of? 
A.	No.  At that time we were in Musumba.  The burials were taking place on the 8th, in the morning.  We were not present.  We were in Musumba, launching another attack.
Q.	So did you at any time participate in the disposal of any bodies, any dead bodies?  This is either before or after the 7th of April. 
A.	No.  I never participated in such things. 
Q.	Did any of the persons who you carried out the rapes with, were any of them involved in disposal of bodies? 
A.	I have no idea.
Q.	And were you ever given instructions from anyone as to the disposal of bodies? 
A.	But I told you that I didn't do that.  If I had instructions to that effect, I certainly would have done that.
Q.	So I take it, then, that there were no instructions ever given with respect to the disposal of bodies; is that correct? 
A.	I told you that on that day, when the burials took place, we were elsewhere, launching another attack.  I don't know if orders were given or not because I wasn't there.  We were undergoing -- undertaking another operation, another attack.
Q.	Well, it's important for me to have an answer to my question.  I will place it to you again, maybe more clearly.  You told us that you would go with members of your subsection of the Interahamwe and you would be told by some authorities what to do.  My question is:  At any time, did you hear -- did any of the authorities tell you anything about disposal of bodies that -- of people who were killed either before or after April 7th? 
A.	Thank you.  Let me respond this way:  In our region, because I can only speak about the facts in my region, we killed people.  We did not bury them.  Second of all, I told you that on the day when the Mukingo victims were being buried, I was not there.  I was elsewhere.  And so I didn't -- I couldn't be everywhere at the same place.  If orders were given, I was not aware.  I don't know what you want me to say.  I can only answer about things I know.
Q.	Well, will you agree with me, then, that any -- you were never given instructions at any time by any authorities about the manner in which you would dispose of the corpses of persons killed? 
A.	I already answered you, Counsel, three times.  I think that this is enough.
MR. WEBSTER:
The witness took the words out of my mouth, Your Honour.  This question has been asked and answered a number of times.  We need to go on to something else, but the witness has already responded, and I'm suggesting that the Court direct counsel to move on to another line of inquiry.  The witness has answered this question at least four or five times now. 
MR. ROACH:
Madam President, the witness has been argumentative, and I just need a yes or no answer to my question.  And the last question, I say, "Will you agree with me?"  He could have answered yes or no, but the witness tells me that "I was not there."  I'm just asking him about the instructions that were given:  Was he ever given any instructions?  That's what I'm asking.  And if the answer is no, I want to get a clear answer no, or not that "I was elsewhere" or he doesn't know if other persons got instructions.  I was asking him about himself and what the authorities instructed him with respect to the disposal of bodies, because this goes -- this is a very important aspect in our issue of planning or planification, as they called it.  So I want an answer for that question. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the witness has already answered the question.  I don't think that it is accurate to state on the record that the witness has been argumentative.  The Court can make its own assessment of the witness's demeanour and his candour in answering the questions, and I would hesitate -- it certainly is not accurate to characterise his response as argumentative.  And I would ask the Court to take note  -- make its own assessment of the witness's demeanour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you tell us if, on any given day, you received instructions to that effect, on any given day? 
THE WITNESS:
Madam President, I never received such orders. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you, Witness. 

Mr. Roach, perhaps this is a good moment to take the morning break. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Your Honour.  That's fine, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The proceedings are adjourned and we shall resume in 15 minutes. 
	(Court recessed from 1120H to 1145H)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Proceedings are resumed. 

Counsel Diagne, do you have something to say? 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Yes, Madam President.  Pardon me for the interruption.  Before we proceed with the 
cross-examination of Witness GFA, I just wanted to say that today is my last chance to ask for a certification of appeal, and after the end of the cross-examination, I fear that I won't have time to present my application for certification for appeal.  So I would like to do that now, with your leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Very well, in just a couple of minutes. 

Madam President, I will remind you that there was a decision on 29 March 2004.  Your Chamber, in that decision, rejected my preliminary motion for defects in the form and procedure that I had filed on 23 March 2004.  So I am making an application for a certification of appeal, in the sense that the conditions of Article 73(B) haven't been met; for the fair and expeditious conduct of the proceedings, this motion is necessary.  This motion was linked to an objection that I had on the indictment, which concerns my client, Édouard Karemera, here with me today, and I think that when we speak of fair conduct, that condition is met for all questions relating to the indictment.  So, naturally, this can help expedite the proceedings. 

So, sincerely, Madam President, I ask for your authorisation for certification of appeal of your decision on 29 March 2004. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  We have taken note of your application for certification. 

Mr. Roach, you may proceed. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Madam President. 
BY MR. ROACH: 
Q.	Now, just before our brief recess, we were discussing the disposal of the corpses of persons who were murdered, and you told us that that was done by the mayor of the city; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  The burials were organised by the bourgmestre of our commune.
Q.	And his name was Harerimana; is that right?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And he was against these killings; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And he spoke of --
A.	I didn't say the contrary.  I didn't say more than that.
Q.	That's right.  And he spoke out against those persons who were the attackers?
A.	I don't know if he said that he was opposed to the killers openly, but that's the first time that I've heard that, here.
Q.	Did he not make a comment on your group? 
A.	No.  He made no comments.  He buried the bodies on the 8th.  On that same night, he died.
Q.	And what were the circumstances of his death? 
A.	I don't know the circumstances of his death, but I told you there were two versions.  And I don't know the true story.  I don't know the circumstances surrounding his death.  But two stories were given about his death.
Q.	Do you know what was the cause of his death?  Was that said? 
A.	Some said that he had a heart attack after seeing all of the dead bodies.  Others said that he was poisoned.  But I don't know which story is true. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, you told us that --
A.	For me, his death was untimely.
Q.	Yes.  Now, Witness, you told us that -- I believe -- it was 99 per cent of the Tutsis who lived in your area were killed; is that correct?
A.	That's correct.
Q.	Is it true that a number of persons who were of Tutsi origin had fled from Ruhengeri prior to the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes.  A small number had fled Ruhengeri.
Q.	Well, I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong in my understanding, that there were some 100,000 refugees from Ruhengeri after the war of 1991 and before 1993. 
A.	I don't clearly understand your question, Counsel.  What hundred thousand people were you referring to?
Q.	People who were residents of Ruhengeri, who left Ruhengeri after the war began. 
A.	The people who fled Ruhengeri are some people I know.  I don't know if there are a hundred thousand of them.
Q.	Now, some people fled when the war began; isn't that correct?  This would be in 1991 or 1990. 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And there continued to be people leaving Ruhengeri in 1993; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes.  Some of them left Ruhengeri, but I'm speaking of people of the Tutsi ethnicity.
Q.	Yes.  And isn't it true that people who were of Hutu ethnicity also were refugees after the war began? 
A.	Which war are you referring to?  The war with the Inkotanyi? 
Q.	Yes, yes.  I'm referring to the wars that you referred to.  You said there was a continuing war.  And I'm asking you:  Isn't it true that some people who were Hutu also left? 
A.	When the Inkotanyi attacked Ruhengeri was at night.  In the morning, the soldiers started fighting the Inkotanyi.  Most of the people fled, of course, into the surrounding areas.  But after the fighting, the people came back to their homes.  Of course, this was different for the Tutsis.  The Tutsis were searched out, those who fled fled to Kigali, Gisenyi, et cetera.  But it was different.  When the Inkotanyi attacked, the population in Ruhengeri fled at the same time, but for the Tutsis, they fled at the same -- not at the same time.  They fled individually, not in great numbers.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you please observe a pause between the question and answer that you give?  Because the interpreters have to translate what you say and it's -- and have to interpret the question before your answer is given.  We did not get the end of Counsel Roach's question.  That's why we bring up this issue.

1155H
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, Witness, you are aware that there was a problem of refugees from northern parts of Rwanda after the war started and following 1991? 
A.	When the first attack was launched against Ruhengeri, the population fled.  There was fighting between the Rwandan Armed Forces and the Inkotanyi.  The people fled Ruhengeri town and even fled towards my region of Mukingo.  I told you that during their flight -- their flight is different to the matter of Tutsis.  The Tutsis were fleeing because they were being hunted out.  They were being killed one by one.  Those who were able to flee fled towards Gisenyi and Kigali.  Some others went all the way to Goma.  But I can tell you that there were refugees from Butaro; I saw them in 1994.  They came to the Busogo secteur office.  They came from Kidaho and Bisogo.  They gathered in Busogo secteur. 
Q.	So when the RPF attacked in 1990 and shortly thereafter, in 1991, is it correct that large numbers of the population fled towards the south?
A.	Yes, I heard about that.  I heard that many refugees had fled to Nyacyonga and they were fleeing the fighting going on between the Inkotanyi in 1991.  It is true I did hear about that. 
Q.	Yes.  And did you know that there were many refugee camps, internal refugee camps, within Rwanda?   
A.	Yes.  I heard of Nyacyonga camp.  I think it is in Kigali.  I know that that refugee camp existed. 
Q.	And do you know that in those refugee camps there were both Tutsis and Hutus? 
A.	I don't know the ethnic group of the people who had taken refuge in those camps.  It is not near my home.  It is in Kigali, that is far away, and so I can't tell you if both ethnic groups were represented. 
Q.	You told us that you made many visits to Kigali before the 7th of April 1994.  Did you on any of your visits observe any of these camps? 
A.	No.  I never visited those refugee camps.  I would go to see some families.  I would see members of my family who resided in Kigali. 
Q.	Now, before April 7th 1994, is it correct that many of your friends and classmates who were Tutsi had already fled from Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes.  I know some of my colleagues who were Tutsis who had fled Ruhengeri, and who even fled the country.
Q.	And these flights coincided with attacks by the RPF; isn't that correct? 
A.	No.  I didn't say that all of the Tutsis fled.  People fled individually.  That is why I asked you to give me a few names.  If I can answer your question, therefore, they fled after the RPF attack against Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Yes.  Coming back to the question of names that you required, that was in connection with a question that I put to you about persons who were killed in November of 1993, and I can give you some more specifics at this time.  Just one moment, please.  
Now there was an event --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
One moment, Mr. Roach. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Pardon us for the interruption, Mr. Roach.  You may proceed. 
MR. ROACH:
Thank you, Your Honour. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, I should like to describe for you an event and give us some particulars and ask you if you know about or ever heard about this event.  It was in November of 1993 that there had been an election and a number of conseillers --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, it seems the Prosecutor is standing. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the form of question, Your Honour.  Counsel is now testifying on the record.  He is providing the factual -- the information he is providing -- he is providing factual information on the record which he is then going to ask the witness to comment on.  I am suggesting that the questioning is improper.  He can ask the witness about events in November 1993.  He can ask the witness about certain names, but he can't simply lay out a factual scenario and then ask the witness to comment on.  That is an improper way of approaching the issue. 
MR. ROACH:
I have no problem.  It amounts to the same.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	You recall, Witness, that I was asking you about Hutu leaders who were killed earlier? 
A.	Yes.  I said that I remembered that and I gave the example of Agathe Uwilingiyimana's death. 
Q.	And I told you that I wanted to ask you about events in 1993, and you asked me for more specifics, including names of persons.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	All right.  And I am asking you now about an event that took place on the 17th to the 18th of November 1993, in which 37 recently elected politicians who were Hutu were, on the same night, killed, and I can give you a list of the names of these 37 persons, but so far, does this incident refresh your memory on this, on anything?  I might give you some further information:  These were politicians who were from the DMZ, the demilitarised zone.
A.	I don't know anything about events that took place in the demilitarised zone.
Q.	Very well.  Then I will not go any further on that, if you know nothing about events in the demilitarised zone.  

Now, Witness, you told us that at a rally in Ruhengeri in 1993, you saw Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse; is that correct?   
MR. WEBSTER:
Excuse me.  I am objecting to the question.  I don't believe it was the witness's testimony that this rally took place in 1993.  That's a detail that counsel is adding.  So I would rather that the question be reformulated.
MR. ROACH:
It should be 1992.  I misspoke myself there.  In 1992, I should say.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, did you know or had you seen Dr. Ngirumpatse before that time? 
A.	Prior to 1992, I saw him, and that was the first time I had ever seen him.  But I knew him through reading newspapers, by listening to the radio.  He was the chairman of the MRND.  I could not know him. 
Q.	Yes.  And you said that he signed your membership card in the Interahamwe or in the MRND.  Which was it? 
A.	Yes, I had a membership card from the MRND and an Interahamwe card.  He had signed the card.
Q.	Do you still have that card? 
A.	No. 
Q.	What happened to your card? 
A.	I lost it. 
Q.	I see.  And how do you know that he signed your card? 
A.	It was mentioned on the card that the signature was that of the chairman of the MRND, and his name was on the card. 
Q.	Witness, you said his name was printed on the card.  Is that written or printed? 
A.	I don't remember if it was printed or written, handwritten, on the card.  I don't remember. 
Q.	And that card was issued to you in what year? 
A.	In 1992. 
Q.	Well, Witness, I should like you to comment on something I want to confront you with at this time, and that is, I will be presenting evidence here in due course from Dr. Ngirumpatse to the effect that, in 1992, President Habyarimana was the president of the MRND, and that he never became president until July of 1993.  Now, could you comment on that?  Just one moment. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, I am objecting to the form of the question.  There must be a better way to go about eliciting a response on that issue, but to say, "I am going to lead evidence that is going to establish" -- that is certain, than asking the witness to comment, it is improper.
MR. ROACH:
I thought we had some agreement on this.  I thought that my friend had said if we specify what evidence will be presented, with certain specifics, who is going to be the witness and what is going to be said, that would be in order, and this is what I am doing now.  I want to give this witness forewarning so that when we do bring this evidence, it would not be said, well, we didn't ask the witness or we didn't confront the witness with the particular line of cross-examination.  And the way that I am examining this witness is not unusual.  It is traditional in many jurisdictions. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I must say that I am not familiar with this line of questioning.  Perhaps - I don't want to throw things off because the witness is on the stand and I don't want to comment and influence his testimony, but I can -- perhaps if we ask the witness to take off his headphones for a second, I will state exactly what I find objectionable about your question and we can take it from there, unless you want to withdraw the question and approach it in a different manner. 
MR. ROACH:
In the interests of time, I would ask this question in a different way. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, are you certain with the testimony you are giving now, that is, that on your card issued to you in 1992, that Dr. Ngirumpatse was indicated as the president of the MRND?
A.	I have already answered that question. 
Q.	No, you didn't answer that question.  You said his name was on your card.  I am asking you if you are certain. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Could you please answer the question, Mr. Witness?
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I said that I was certain.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Do you know when Dr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse became the president of your party, MRND? 
A.	I do not know the year very well, but I know when the MRND party was renewed and when Habyarimana ceased being the chairman of the party; that is when Ngirumpatse was the chairman of the MRND. 
Q.	If I might ask you, do you know what date it was that President Habyarimana stepped down from the presidency of the MRND party? 
A.	No, I do not recall the date. 
Q.	Can you tell us what the year was? 
A.	I told you that I do not remember the date of the meeting which was held in order to proceed with the renewal of MRND. 
Q.	Witness, you can answer yes or no.  I asked you, do you know what year it was?  You can say no, if you don't know. 
A.	No.  I do not remember the year. 
Q.	Yes.  Now, Witness, were you aware that there were talks or discussions in the city of Arusha, where we are now, with respect to uniting the country and bringing in the regular political system, the RPF forces? 
A.	I would hear mention made of those Arusha negotiations.
Q.	And you were a member of the MRND.  Were you aware that your party was supportive of the Arusha agreements? 
A.	I don't know.  But in principle, in order for one to participate in the negotiations, the parties had to agree.  I don't know anything about that, myself. 
Q.	Yes.  Well, did you have knowledge about the positions of the MRND, your party, on the various political topics? 
A.	No, I told you that our activities depended on instructions received.  You can ask such questions of people like Ngirumpatse.  They were the ones who knew of the various positions of the party, in terms of policy. 
Q.	Witness, I am asking you what your knowledge is.  And would you refrain from telling me to ask other people?  I am asking you what you know.  So if you don't know, it is permissible to say, "I don't know." 

Now, were you aware in 1992 and 1993 that your party was preparing to take part in elections? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And were you involved in campaigning to get members to join your party? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And were you involved in any activity concerning the forthcoming elections? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Now, you told us that the MRND was the only party that could maintain presence in Ruhengeri because of the policies of the MRND to chase out other parties.  That was your evidence; isn't that correct?
A.	I said that the MRND and the CDR had a presence in the préfecture because the other parties had been chased away by those two. 
Q.	Now, do you recognise the name of one Dr. Donat Murego, M-U-R-E-G-O? 
A.	Yes, I know that name. 
Q.	And he belonged to the MDR; isn't that correct?
A.	Yes, indeed. 
Q.	And he was from Ruhengeri; isn't that right? 
A.	Yes, he hailed from Ruhengeri but he didn't live there.  Rather, he lived in Kigali.
Q.	But he was the secretary general for MDR.  Are you familiar with that information? 
A.	Yes, I was aware. 
Q.	Are you familiar with the name of Jerôme Bicamumpaka?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And did you know he was the minister of foreign affairs in April 1994? 
A.	Yes, I knew that.
Q.	And he belonged to the MDR party; isn't that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I would like to add -- well, by your leave, may I add something?
Q.	You can always add if yes or no is not a sufficient answer, in your opinion. 
A.	Yes.  In fact, I wanted to explain that both Murego and Bicamumpaka were members of the 
MDR-Power.  Jerôme Bicamumpaka became minister in April 1994 because a member of the MDR -- what did we say about MDR-Power?  You were there and you heard.  The MDR was a unified party, and at one point in time, it split into two, one faction became the power faction.  That power faction was allied to the MRND, and it was said that the other wing -- the other faction was linked to the Inkotanyi.  So you can say that there was dissent within the party.  And let me also add the name of Basile Nsabimugisha.  All these persons were members of the MDR-Power faction.  

Furthermore, I have already explained that apart from the MRND and the CDR, no other party was concretely established in Ruhengeri, and I am saying this because in order for one to say that a party is well established, that party needs to have an office.  It needs to have hoisted its flag over its territory, and this was not the case with the PL.  

I have told you that Nzirorera had told us to snatch away the flags of the MDR and the PSD, and we have done that.  This means that those people did not want those parties to establish themselves in Ruhengeri.  The only flag that we saw in Ruhengeri was that of the CDR and the MRND.  No other party had any office in Ruhengeri.  So these were personalities of the so-called opposition parties.  In other words, Bicamumpaka and the others, they did not live in Ruhengeri.  Their parties were not well established in Ruhengeri.  They did not have any office.  And when they tried to establish an office somewhere, we were sent to destroy it. 

Furthermore, when you mention the names of these parties before the Judges, kindly make the distinction between the power wing and the moderate wing. 
Q.	So you are saying that Jerôme Bicamumpaka was not a resident of Ruhengeri; is that your evidence? 
A.	The essence is that he was a member of the MDR-Power.  I don't know whether he had a residence in Ruhengeri or not.  All I know is that he hailed from there.  You can yourself wonder why the MDR split into two.  Why was there the MDR, quite simply, and the MDR-Power?  Explain that to the Judges so that they can also understand the reason for this split. 
Q.	Just answer my question. I would be grateful for that, please. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are asking you to kindly answer the questions without challenging the Defence.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, I could give you other names of persons who were members of the MDR, who lived in Ruhengeri, but I will only do so if your position is that they were not members of the MDR, who in 1992 and 1993 and 1994, lived in Ruhengeri.  So would you agree with me that there would be a number of members of one faction, if not both, of the MDR that lived in Ruhengeri? 
A.	Yes, I agree with you. 
Q.	All right.  You know of Harerimana? 
A.	There were many people who went by the name Harerimana in Ruhengeri, unless you give me his first name or place of origin. 
Q.	He was from Ruhengeri and he belonged to the MDR. 
A.	Counsel, you will excuse me but the name Harerimana is very common in Ruhengeri, and it is impossible for me to know to whom you are referring. 
Q.	He was the bourgmestre, or he sometimes uses an "L" there, Harelimana instead of the "R".  The one who died, he was MDR, wasn't he? 
A.	The Harerimana who was our bourgmestre, I knew him.  He was known as Emmanuel Harerimana, but I do not know to which political party he belonged. 
Q.	So you don't know whether he was a member of your party or another party.  Is that what you are saying, Witness?
A.	Yes.  I don't know whether he was a member of the MRND or the MDR.  Harerimana was someone who was very calm.  He didn't speak much.  He even taught me.  It was difficult to know which side of the fence he sat on.  I don't know whether he was a member of those parties or not. 
Q.	Did you know a person from the PL party by the name of Mbonampeka, M-B-O-N-A-M-P-E-K-A? 
A.	I know one Stanslous Mbonampeka.  He was a member of PL and he was living in Kigali.  Furthermore, at a given point in time, he was minister. 
Q.	But he was from Ruhengeri; isn't that correct? 
A.	I do not know where he hailed from.  All I know is that I was in the same class as his daughter. 
Q.	Well, I suppose if you were in the same class with his daughter, you could assume that he hailed from Ruhengeri, where you came from.
A.	No, I knew that they were living in Kigali.  I even knew their residence in Kigali, but I could not just assume that they were from Ruhengeri automatically. 
Q.	Now, do you know a Ruhengeri resident who belonged to the MDR-Power, who actually lived in that city, by the name of Bangamwabo, B-A-N-G-A-M-W-A-B-O?
A.	No.  I don't know anyone called Bangamwabo who allegedly lived in Ruhengeri at the time. 
Q.	And in Ruhengeri, wasn't there an MDR member or organiser by the name of Munyarukiko,
	M-U-N-Y-A-R-U-K-I-K-O? 
A.	I know one Jean-Damascène Munyarukiko.  Are you referring to him?
Q.	Yes, I am referring to him.  And he was an MDR person in Ruhengeri; isn't that correct? 
A.	No, he didn't live in Ruhengeri.  He  lived in Kigali.  I know him very well.  He was from Nkuli commune, spelt N-K-U-L-I. 
Q.	Okay.  And this man is now -- he lives in Rwanda at the present time; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  Munyarukiko is in Rwanda, I know that. 
Q.	And you know that he was MDR?
A.	Yes, I knew that.  I know that, but at the time that we are speaking of, he was not living in Nkuli commune; he was living in Kigali.
Q.	This is during 1992, 1993 or any time in 1994.  You are saying he did not live in Ruhengeri? 
A.	I knew Munyarukiko well before 1990, and during all that time, he was living in Kigali, and even today he is living in Kigali.  He is living in the same town.  He has been living in the same town from that time, and I think you can do what you need in order for you to have that confirmed. 
Q.	Yes.  Just one last question about this man.  Are you saying that he is not from Ruhengeri, he never lived there? 
A.	I said that he hailed from Nkuli commune in Ruhengeri.  I agree with that, but he did not live in that commune.  He lived in Kigali.
Q.	Now, you told us about the separation of this MDR into two factions.  When did that occur? 
A.	When I knew about it, the situation was very tense, and that was in 1994, April 1994. 
Q.	I see.  Now, you told us too that MRND and CDR were working in concert at one point; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, quite so.
Q.	Are you aware that there was a split or a time when they no longer worked together?  Are you aware of that? 
A.	No, I am not aware of that.  I do not know whether that did indeed happen. 
Q.	So as far as you know, they always collaborated together? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, they collaborated.  I am saying that because within the Virunga Force, Amahindure, the Impuzamugambi and the Interahamwe, all these factions received training at the same time. 
Q.	Very well.  Just before I leave this particular area, I just want to get some clarifications to some responses you previously gave me.  I want to go back to Munyarukiko.  Did he have a house in Nkuli? 
A.	I do not know.  I know that that was his native area and that he had relatives there. 
Q.	Now, if I might ask you a question about Nzirorera, this is just one question.  Nzirorera's counsel would be asking questions about him, but I just want to ask you one question about Nzirorera.  Was he a resident of Kigali or was he a resident of Ruhengeri? 
A.	Nzirorera lived in Kigali.  From time to time he would come to visit his mother and he would spend the night there.  Often he would do that over the weekend; during the week, he was in Kigali.
Q.	And cannot the same be said for these other politicians of the MDR that we spoke about, who you said lived in Kigali?  Wouldn't it be that they would be in Kigali but they would also come home to Ruhengeri from time to time? 
A.	I don't know about that.  All I can do is speak about Nzirorera for reasons I have already mentioned. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, are you aware that when President Habyarimana was assassinated, he was coming back from a trip outside of the country? 
A.	Yes, I knew that.  Maybe he was coming back from Arusha, if I am not wrong. 
Q.	Well, I don't want you to guess, and I believe you are wrong, but just answer what you are certain about or you believe is common knowledge.  

Now, were you told, or was the population in your area told that President Habyarimana was coming back together with the President of Burundi from peace talks?
A.	Yes, I heard that he was in the company of the President of Burundi. 
Q.	And on the morning of the 7th of April, you said you heard of the president's death, and I believe you first heard that on the radio; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, I heard it on the radio.
Q.	And did you hear that the president's plane was shot down? 
A.	I don't really remember the wording of the announcement.  However, the message was that the president had had a plane accident.  I think it was from the day -- the next day, the following day, that it was specified that the aircraft had been shot down. 
Q.	Now, were you told, or were the people told, that the president's plane was shot down by the RPF? 
A.	That is what was said.
Q.	And did you believe that?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection, Your Honour.
MR. ROACH:
On what basis?
MR. WEBSTER:
On relevance. 
MR. ROACH:
I would say that the beliefs of this witness is essential to his credibility and we should know if he was motivated by true beliefs or not.  So I submit that his beliefs were important at the time and important to us now. 
MR. WEBSTER:
This witness has consistently testified that he was following orders, that everything he did was in response to orders.  He did not say anything about what he himself believed, and at this point I am suggesting that it is irrelevant.  It is going to lead us down a blind alley, and I would respectfully request that the Court direct this line of questioning to other areas. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber sustains the objection because what it means is, in fact, asking of the opinion of this witness. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Now, Witness, you said that you heard on the radio that the RPF were responsible for shooting down the president's plane, and you said this came over some -- maybe some two days following.  I want to ask you this:  You know from your experience that there were certain things broadcast on the radio that was not true; isn't that correct? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Maybe I misheard, Your Honour.  I don't recall the witness testifying that he heard on the radio that the RPF shot the plane down.  He was asked two questions:  When did he learn about the plane coming down?  He said he had heard it on the 6th that there was an accident, and that, on the 7th, he heard that the plane had been shot down.  He did not say anything about who was responsible for shooting the plane down.  So could Mr. Robinson (sic) break his question down into smaller pieces so that he does not incorporate information in the question that the witness has not himself testified to?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Chamber unanimously repeats what it heard, and this was that the following day, the witness heard it said that the presidential plane had been shot down by the RPF.  That is what has been said by the witness. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, you recall -- 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am sorry.  Just a clarification.  My objection was not that the witness didn't hear who was attributed the responsibility of shooting down the plane.  Whether he heard that on the radio or not, that was the portion of Mr. Roach's question that concerned me.  Thank you.
MR. ROACH:
Perhaps I might just approach this differently. 
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	Witness, where did you hear that the president's plane was shot down by the RPF? 
A.	I heard Kajelijeli and his friends say that on the 7th, in the morning.  The other ones who told us it was the Inkotanyi who had shot down the president's plane. 
Q.	I see.  Now, did you hear that on the 7th of April the RPF had renewed the war or had renewed an attack on the country? 
A.	I also heard that. 
Q.	And, in fact, the attack by the RPF was sustained and it was eventually successful in overcoming the Rwandan forces; is that correct?
MR. WEBSTER:
Objection to that question, Your Honour. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I am objecting to the question.  The question -- this is too broad an issue to encapsulate in a 
one-sentence question, whereas the Defence counsel is characterising the entire series of events between the 6th of April to the 17th of July as an attack that was successful.  

The question -- I object to the form of the question, and I am wondering where this is going in terms of probing the issues that were covered on the direct examination and getting to the meat of the issue, which is the substance of this witness's identification of the Accused and their connection to the crimes that they are charged with.  So if we could look at the question for its relevance, to the form in which it was asked, on those bases, I am objecting. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Roach, do you want to respond to the Prosecutor's objection?
MR. ROACH:
I would.  Madam President, I can put my question in a piecemeal fashion rather that in the omnibus fashion that my friend objects to. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well, Counsel.  Please proceed.
BY MR. ROACH:
Q.	You told us that you had heard that the RPF had attacked on the 7th of April.  Now, I am asking you this: In Kigali -- in Ruhengeri, rather, where you lived, did RPF troops enter that city at some point after the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes, they got there on the 13th of July 1994. 
Q.	And were you present at the time the troops arrived?
A.	When they were sending shells on to Byangabo where we were, I was there.  At that point in time, we fled together with the inhabitants of Ruhengeri because the inhabitants of Ruhengeri fled mainly from the 13th. 
Q.	When did you leave Ruhengeri, yourself? 
A.	On 13th of July. 
Q.	Now, were there any FAR or Rwanda government troops in Ruhengeri on 13th of July and immediately before that time? 
A.	Yes, there were there, but on that day, I saw them flee together with us on that day of the 13th. 
Q.	I see.  At any time, Witness, were you ever asked by anyone to be a member of the army? 
A.	No, never. 
Q.	And did Kajelijeli ever suggest to you, or to anyone in your presence, that members of the Interahamwe should go to the front where the fighting was taking place? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And at the time, was there any mandatory military service required by the government of Rwanda? 
A.	What I recall is that all the members of the population had to undergo military training, and they needed to be armed with firearms, such that even in their work in the fields, they would be able to shoot at the enemy whenever they discovered such enemy and continue to work.  That was published publicly by Kambanda.
Q.	I was asking if at any time before the 7th of April, conscription into the military force was mandatory for the young men, that is. 
A.	No.  That was not the case, as far as I know. 
Q.	I see.  So how would one join the army? 
A.	I think they, the army, would post out an announcement for anyone who was interested in joining the armed forces.  The youths would come to the relevant military camp, and I think there was an exam, and those who passed would be recruited.  I think that must be how it happened.
Q.	So as far as you know, the army was an army of volunteers?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, the question that I asked you about the attack by the RPF was a renewed attack on the 7th of April.  And do you know whether there was a continuous war from the 7th of April until you fled on the 13th of July? 
A.	I told you that I got to know that the RPF had launched an attack on the 7th of April.  The Inkotanyi reached our home on the 13th of July.  I therefore believe that the RPF continued to fight from the 7th of April until Kigali was taken.  I think it was when Kigali was taken that they came to our area -- our region and elsewhere. 
Q.	And did you, yourself, fight against the RPF forces? 
A.	No.
Q.	Did any of your colleagues in the Interahamwe fight against the RPF forces? 
A.	Those who were soldiers, because amongst the Interahamwe, there were former soldiers.  But the youths from Byangabo did not fight the Inkotanyi. 
Q.	So I take it that you had no instructions from anyone to fight against the RPF or Inkotanyi invasion?
A.	I must explain that the Inkotanyi had support of all kinds.  The RPF had an army, that we never confronted that army.  What we were asked to fight against were persons who were considered to be RPF accomplices, but we never ever fought the RPF forces per se.  But those who were considered to be members of the RPF, we killed them, yes. 
Q.	Now, remember you told us that steps were taken after the first war when Ruhengeri was overtaken in one night, steps were taken to build the civil defence.  You remember that civil defence evidence that you gave?
A.	I said that, but that took place after the second attack on Ruhengeri.
Q.	Yes.  Well, apart from the civil defence of the Interahamwe that you told us, what other aspects did this plan for civil defence entail?
A.	Civilian self-defence meant, according to explanations we were given, that the members of the population needed to ensure their own security.  Civilian self-defence needed to operate in the following manner: The inhabitants of Nkuli and Mukingo who were supposed to be trained so as to protect themselves against any attack or any activities carried out by the enemy. 
Q.	And I just want to understand this clearly.  There was no defence whatever of the city of Ruhengeri when the RPF approached, this would be around the 13th of July and those days immediately preceding it? 
A.	All I know -- you are asking me to give you explanation, but all I know is that when the Inkotanyi arrived in Ruhengeri on the 13th of July 1994, it had become clear that they were much stronger than the ex-FAR.  And when it was said that the Inkotanyi had reached such and such an area, the ex-FAR would flee immediately.  In order to give you an example, they took Ruhengeri on the 13th, and they took Gisenyi on the 17th.  I didn't see them fight.  I didn't see the armed forces.  What I am saying is that even the préfet, Basile Nsabimugisha, had asked the people to flee at the same time.  I don't know whether the Rwandan Armed Forces had tried to resist somewhat.  Well, in any event, it was clear that the RPF was clear.  It had already taken Kigali.  The radio was broadcasting from one place, and it was clear to us that the Inkotanyi was much stronger. 
Q.	On a few responses ago, you told us that the RPF had all kinds of support.  I want you to explain what you meant when you said that. 
A.	We were told that; that's what we were told.  We were told that the RPF is supported by various categories.  It was said that all the Tutsis supported RPF and even Hutus who were married to Tutsis were amongst those who supported the RPF.  It was that whole group which was designated as Inkotanyi. 
Q.	Were you also told that Uganda, the country of Uganda, was supporting the RPF? 
A.	Yes, we were told that, and we were also told that Uganda was the backdrop and that that country was arming the RPF. 
Q.	Very well.  Now, I want to ask you some questions about your own flight and the flight of the people from your homes in Ruhengeri.  

Now, you recall that you said on the 13th of July you fled and the mayor asked people to leave and --
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Excuse us please, Counsel.  I think that we needed to have some information regarding the possibility of having a room available this afternoon in order for us to continue that exercise that we were involved in.  No.  Apparently, no one is here to provide us with that information.  But maybe 
Mr. Ortega -- maybe you are aware of what is happening regarding this afternoon.
MR. ORTEGA:
Madam President, may I inform you that, unfortunately, we have not been able to have a room this afternoon to continue with that exercise.  That is what I have been told by Mr. Hometowu earlier on.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  Thank you.  Do excuse us, please, Mr. Roach.  Are you still going to be at it for a long time with this witness?  Do you think that it wouldn't be a good moment now to take the lunch break?
MR. ROACH:
Just one moment, please.  Yes, there is some problem in the translation here.  I heard lunch break.  I am always in favour of lunch, but I thought that we were going to conclude the procedure and hang around for some dinner as well.  But may I just let you know that I have two other areas that I want to cover, and I think that I can be through in another -- not more than two hours, I am sure, but that depends on the brevity of the answers and the lack of objections from my friend. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
There aren't many objections to make, Your Honour.  I think we made very good progress.  There have been very few objections.  But when it is appropriate to make an objection, I will continue to do so.  But before we conclude -- I get the sense that the Court is bringing things to a close today and there are things that I would like to discuss before we actually adjourn.  It is a small matter, but I am sure Mr. Robinson will be very anxious to hear about the status of his nine witness statements which we are faced -- I do want to put that information on the record before we break today.  

When we discussed Witness GFA statements, Mr. Robinson referred to a Defence motion in the Kajelijeli case.  That was a motion about rebuttal evidence.  The Prosecutor wanted to bring rebuttal evidence.  The Defence opposed it, but in opposing it they also asked that previous witness statements of the potential rebuttal witness be made available, and in that Defence application, there was a listing of nine specific witness statements that were attributed to this witness.  

We have no way of knowing if those nine witness statements actually exist.  The reference to them was made in an affirmation and in a Defence application.  So we are just going by what the Defence in the Kajelijeli case tells us about what they think exists in the files of the Ruhengeri prosecutor.  

As the Court and the parties know, I have made several efforts to obtain previous witness statements of all of our witnesses that are detained in Rwanda or who had had some interaction with the Rwandan justice system.  And last week I received a big box of material with thousands of pages.  I was able to go through that box this weekend, and I put aside all of the statements that were coming from Ruhengeri.  After doing that, I went through the Ruhengeri statements and I attempted to identify those statements from our potential witnesses, including GFA.  In so doing, I have come across eight statements.  They are not the same eight statements that are listed in that Defence application in the Kajelijeli trial.  I can go down a list and tell you exactly what statements I have.  There is one in the Kajelijeli motion.  Nine are listed in chronological order.  The first is one of the 3rd of April 1995.  That statement I do have; it was contained in the materials I received last week.  The second one is a statement dated the 4th of April 1995; that as well, I also have.  

The third statement that is listed is a statement dated the 12th of April 1995; that was not contained in the materials that I received.  The fourth statement, that dated the 27th of April 1995, was in the material, so I do have that statement.  

The fifth statement that was listed is a statement of the 30th of July 1997.  That also was included in the materials.  The sixth statement, according to the list in the Kajelijeli motion, is a statement of the 10th of December 1997.  That statement was not included in the box of materials that I received.  

There was an additional statement one dated the 8th of June 1998.  That statement does not appear on the Kajelijeli motion, but it is a statement that I discovered in the materials, so it would be made available to Mr. Robinson, but it does not appear on the list that he was referring to.  

The seventh statement on the list -- and again, I am referring to the Kajelijeli list -- is a statement of the 8th of July 1998.  That statement was not included in the materials.  

There is an additional statement of the 24th of August 1998; it does not appear on the Kajelijeli list but it does appear in the materials that I received, so that statement would be made available to the Defence.  

The eighth statement on the list is dated the 20th of October 1998. That statement was included in the materials, and a copy would be made available to the Defence.  The ninth statement on the list is a statement of the 29th of December 1999.  That statement was included in the materials that I received, so that also would be made available to the Defence.  

So simply to summarise, six of the nine statements that were listed in the Kajelijeli application were discovered, so I have those six statements.  Two extra statements were included in the materials.  So all together there are eight previous statements by this witness to Rwandan authorities that the Office of the Prosecutor can make available to the Defence.  The only problem is that all of these statements are in Kinyarwanda.  Only one of these eight statements has been translated into French.  That is a translation that was provided by the Rwandese authorities, so it is not an official ICTR translation.  All of those materials can be made available to Defence this afternoon.  Mr. Robinson can make arrangements to collect them from my office if he does not want to wait for CMS to distribute them.  
The Office of the Prosecutor should not undertake the responsibility to translate these statements.  Translation is the responsibility of the registry.  I have instructed our case manager to make a request to the language section for expeditious translation of these materials, but there is no guarantee that they will be translated for tomorrow or for the day after tomorrow.  It is really a function of their workload and the priority that this Court may place on the translation of these statements.  So I believe we have fully complied with the Court's order to make best efforts to provide these statements.  We have done that.  There are eight statements.  They should be available this afternoon, but we cannot provide them in English or in French translation.  All we can do is give you what we have.  These are really the latest developments because we took the entire weekend to go through these materials and locate the statements in question.  We have made best efforts.  I think we have complied with the Court's order, and the statements can be made available this afternoon, if 
Mr. Robinson cares to drop by and pick them up. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Prosecutor, for this information.  

Mr. Robinson, do you wish to speak? 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes, Madam President, very briefly, I will.  Firstly, I express my appreciation to Mr. Webster for his efforts.  I thank him for that.  I will avail myself to obtain these statements as soon as possible.  I will be there at his office this afternoon.  

The question remains, what I am able to do with these statements in terms of my cross-examination of Witness GFA.  I don't think it is even remotely feasible that I could cross-examine Witness GFA this week, even if I get the statements today, but I would leave that for you to discuss at a later time, if you prefer.  But for now, I am happy to receive the statements, and we will go from there. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Robinson. 

Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, I would like to reassure my colleague Mr. Webster.  I am not going to substitute 
Mr. Roach in the defence of Dr. Ngirumpatse.  I just want to comfort him.  I want to come back to my obsession regarding the CDs.  You had indicated to us that the exercise was not possible this afternoon.  

My colleague Mr. Roach indicated earlier that for part of his cross-examination, he wanted to use the rest of the materials that haven't been seen yet.  So we are confronted with the consequences of receiving those materials late and Mr. Roach would like to use them.  These are necessary elements. They have not been gone through in the CDs.  And I should specify that the two minutes that we saw are very selective clips and we have not yet been able to see the context around those.  There is one and a half hours remaining, and the two-minute clips, it seems, are contained in that one and a half hours that we have not yet gone through -- that we need to go through before the end of the cross-examination led by my colleague Mr. Roach. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, I think that the witness may be brought out of the room at this point whilst we deal with these issues.
(Witness stood down)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Very well.  The Chamber -- since there is no other solution, this is the only Chamber that may be available in the morning.  What we are going to do is that we are going to continue the exercise tomorrow at 8:30 in the morning.  And we believe that since there is one hour and a half remaining, perhaps two hours of work remaining, and given the problems that may arise, we can begin hearings at 10:30 in the morning with the continued cross-examination led by Mr. Roach.  Do you agree?  

Yes.  Very well.  The parties shall meet tomorrow morning at 8:30.  Yes, if there is there any problem?
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe the time would not be adequate, because if you say one hour and a half, that would be a straight run but not any repetition of portions.  Sometimes we need to listen to portions once or even twice over again.  So I do believe that the time allocated may be a little short.   I simply wish that you took that into account as you decide. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, we said one and a half hours to two hours, so at 10:30.  We can begin the proceedings at 10:30.  Tomorrow morning we shall have two hours. 
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
I think that might not be enough because there is one and a half hours of recording still.  Only listening will take one and a half hours, without listening uninterrupted, without going back through them or interpreting them, just the listening portion is one and a half hours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea. 
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Madam President.  A proposal.  The interpreters have some experience of the exercise now, having gone through it with us in the first few CDs.  Would it not be possible for interpreters to go through the remaining part of the CDs by themselves this afternoon and then we can just listen to the product of what they have done tomorrow morning, or alternatively we can listen to the product they have done on a cassette?
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, that seems to be one proposal that could be interesting. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Madam President.  The problem is that we don't have a room and someone who can give us the equipment to be able to do such a task.  We would also need the assistance of the technicians and a room.  We have to be in an area where we can watch, listen and have available a system for simultaneous interpretation.  If it's an audio CD, that would have been possible, but this is also a video CD. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Can the technicians help us with this?  Is it possible to find a room where the interpreters could gather to go through the CDs, technicians? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The technicians seem to be indicating no.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, no doubt, because this was your proposal, but it seems that your proposal is the most pragmatic, even if it makes us have to delay the proceedings.  It is a function of the time it will take to go through the CDs.  I think the best solution is for us to gather at 8:30 in the morning and to finish the exercises.  And once we finish the exercises, we are available to continue the proceedings for the Chamber.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. O'Shea.
MR. O'SHEA:
We can perhaps assist a little further and say that we can provide a laptop to the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  It seems as though the Kinyarwanda interpretation is the first leg of the journey and the most important one.  That interpreter can work from a laptop and then, perhaps, the other interpreters can follow suit afterwards.  I don't know what the interpreters think of that. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, once again, I ask the interpreters in Kinyarwanda, what do they think?  Are you able to do this exercise?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam President, we don't think that is practicable.  We need to be seated in booths like these and the computer will have to be linked to simultaneous interpretation system.  Otherwise, it won't be possible. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl. 
MR. WEYL:
Madam President, it seems you want to improve your suggestion, if that is possible.  According to my experience with regard to those first CDs, is that it is not a waste of time to go through them.  One of my motions will be for the Chamber to spend some time, its precious time, to become aware of the exhibit that is tendered on the record that is very rich, even if only excerpts.  So tomorrow morning, before we end the exercise, perhaps the Chamber can join us to share that impression that I have made in the sense that it would be interesting for the Chamber to consult these materials.  Because a meeting cannot be understood just by a few excerpts, but it is the result of looking through those that you can understand in context the meaning.  Perhaps the Chamber can associate itself with our exercise to become aware of how wealthy, how rich, the materials on such CDs are. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Just trying to put things in context, Your Honour, because the reason that the Prosecutor disclosed these six CD-ROMS to the Defence was because we wanted them to have as complete a record of this meeting as possible.  But there is nothing that I have covered with our witness in direct examination that will lead anyone but to believe, or even the parties to believe, that they were characterising this meeting as an inciting meeting.  That was not the purpose of introducing that testimony.  We were interested in two minutes of Habyarimana's speech, because it is those two minutes that generated a wave of protest across the country in Rwanda or a wave of publications in newspapers and things of that sort, and it marks a point in time.  So it serves historical purposes of orienting a witness of when events took place, before that meeting or after that meeting, and that portion of Habyarimana's speech is what generated the wave of opposition.  It doesn't advance things for us to go over six hours of a meeting that no one is arguing about.  No one has ever characterised Ngirumpatse's speech or Bizimungu's speech as being inciting for that meeting.  The only thing -- the only aspect of that meeting that ever generated any notice whatsoever was perhaps two minutes of what Habyarimana said, for good or for bad.  So to take so much time to discuss something that is so basic, it seems to me a misdirection of our resources, but it is clearly in the -- the Defence has a right to go through this material.  I am simply wondering, is it really the best way to approach it? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We think that we have listened to all of the parties, and that it would be a good idea for the exercise to continue tomorrow.  

As we have already said, we will recommence the proceedings at 10:30 in the morning.  I have already reminded the parties to try and select what is of interest to them in the CDs, apparently, what is of interest to you.  Apparently, you want to go through all of the CDs.  Very well, the Chamber as such accepts for you to continue that exercise and that shall continue at 8:30 in the morning tomorrow.  We will have the transcripts and we will know what the content of those CDs are, and if need be, at a later stage, we will consult those CDs.  

Very well.  We adjourn, therefore, until tomorrow.  The parties shall meet at 8:30 for the exercise.  Thank you. 
	(Court adjourned at 1339H)
