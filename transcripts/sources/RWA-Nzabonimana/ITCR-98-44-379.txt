MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings please.  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Thursday, the 19th of November 2009, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

The appearances are the same.  

Yesterday we were considering the oral applications made by Mr. Robinson.  And, Mr. Webster, we don't recall whether you indicated your position.  
MR. WEBSTER: 
I have no -- no opposition to the Chamber ruling on these matters orally, Your Honour.  

With respect to the second half of his application, I do recall that we did not oppose -- oppose his motion concerning the witness who has died.  

With respect to (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and kept under separate cover), I think the first one was, I don't have a recollection of that.  I didn't go back and check my notes, quite frankly.  But if we rely on Mr. Robinson's representations, the Chamber has already decided that, I think.  Mr. Robinson can clarify that.  And if everything is in order, there's no opposition to an oral ruling.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

We will probably do that immediately after the mid-morning recess.  

And we also would defer the discussion on scheduling until after break at mid-morning -- at midday.  
Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin your evidence, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will assist you to do that. 
(Declaration made by Witness Jean Damascène Niyoyita in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You'll give your testimony by responding to the questions put to you by counsel, and you'll respond first to Mr. Robinson, counsel for Joseph Nzirorera. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President, and good morning.  

Mr. President, the witness before you is named Jean Damascène Niyoyita.  He has not previously testified at this Tribunal.  He has not been the subject of any protective measures orders, and he wishes to testify under his true name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Madam Registrar, could you draw the curtains. 
JEAN DAMASCÈNE NIYOYITA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Niyoyita, we have placed before you a personal information sheet.  Have you been able to verify that the information is correct?  
A.	The information contained in this document is correct.  
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Mr. President, I would offer that as Exhibit D. NZ683. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you. 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ683 admitted) 

BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Niyoyita, were you the president of the MRND party in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	And what other positions did you hold in Mukingo commune between 1992 and 1994?  
A.	I was an inspector of schools, and I was also the assistant of the bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	When did you begin becoming the assistant bourgmestre, on what day?  
A.	I occupied a position of assistant bourgmestre of the Mukingo commune in April 1993. 
Q.	And who was the bourgmestre that you worked under? 
A.	Emmanuel Habimana (sic). 
Q.	That's Emmanuel Harerimana? 
A.	Yes, Harerimana.  
Q.	Prior to the death of Habyarimana, were there Interahamwe in Mukingo commune? 
A.	In fact, there were no Interahamwe, as such, in the Mukingo commune. 
Q.	Do you know some youths from Mukingo named Michel Niyigaba and Alexis Rukundo? 
A.	I know them. 
Q.	Were they ever members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you ever have any plan to create some -- an Interahamwe or a youth wing organisation of the MRND in Mukingo commune? 
A.	During the MRND congress a proposal was made to the effect that a section of the Interahamwe be created during the national congress, but that idea was never followed up on in the Mukingo commune, which was a commune that was in a region where there was fighting.  So we were expecting to do that subsequently when the situation would lend itself to it more. 
Q.	Did you ever have any conversations with Joseph Nzirorera about setting up the Interahamwe in Mukingo? 
A.	The idea of starting an Interahamwe -- an Interahamwe group came up during the national congress.  And when I went to Kigali, I was able to discuss with Nzirorera, who told me that we needed to go about things slowly and that we shouldn't be in a hurry in implementing that instruction. 
Q.	Now, to your knowledge, was there an Interahamwe structure in Ruhengeri préfecture, at the level of the préfecture? 
A.	There wasn't any either. 
Q.	Was there any individual who was designated as the president of the Interahamwe for Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	I know of no such person. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not there were Interahamwe in any other communes in Ruhengeri préfecture? 
A.	I know nothing of it. 
Q.	Did you attend the rally at Ruhengeri stadium on the 15th of November 1992 at which 
	President Habyarimana appeared? 
A.	Yes.  I attended that rally.  
Q.	And that was in 1992, correct? 
A.	I don't quite recall the year.  Yeah, it is true that that meeting took place in 19 -- that rally was organised in 1992.  And that is the only rally that was held in Ruhengeri. 
Q.	Were there Interahamwe at that rally?  
A.	There was a section of the MRND youth group that came from Kigali that was present at the rally, and their leader, Robert, took the floor on that occasion. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  Now, did the MRND have an office in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Actually, there was no office, but I had requested from the bourgmestre of the commune to make available to me a room in the building in which we had the development -- community development centre and continuing education, and that is where I used to receive some visitors. 
Q.	Did the MRND have an office at the Isimbi building? 
A.	No.  As far as that matter is concerned, there are people who give information that may be misleading.  Opposite that Isimbi building there was an MRND flag that was hoisted there.  And I had asked the various authorities at secteur level to try to identify places where the MRND flag could be hoisted, and I had insisted that such places should be preferably -- should be locations that are often visited by the general public, preferably. 
Q.	And do you know who it was who put the flag of the MRND in front of the Isimbi building? 
A.	Aloys Buhire is the person who did that, and he was the president of the MRND in Busogo secteur.  And we had made the same request with the responsables of the MRND -- with officials of the MRND in the other areas of the commune so that they could identify locations where the MRND flags could be hoisted.  And Aloys Buhire had identified that location opposite the Isimbi building where the MRND flag was hoisted every morning. 
Q.	Were there members of the MDR party in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes, there were some, but I am not in a position to give you their names. 
Q.	And were there some members of the PSD party in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes, there were as well. 
Q.	Did you ever hear of any incidents in which the flags of either the PSD or MDR parties were taken down by the youth of Mukingo commune? 
A.	I will start by telling you that there was no youth wing of the MRND party in Mukingo commune.  And then, since the PSD didn't have many members in the commune, there wasn't -- or the flag of that party was not hoisted in Mukingo commune.  So such incidents never occurred.  
Q.	And did you ever hear of any incident in which youth from Mukingo commune went to other communes and assaulted the president of the MDR in those communes?  
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  I have been told of the MRND party, and you're telling me that it is the youths from Mukingo commune that allegedly attacked the president of the MRND in other communes?  Is that what you said?  Can you please repeat your question, Counsel?  
Q.	I think we have a translation error.  I'll try again.  Did you ever hear of any incident in which the youths of Mukingo went to other communes to beat up the president of the MDR party? 
A.	Well, those are fabrications.  Such incidents never occurred. 
Q.	Now, after the war started in October 1990, how often did you see Joseph Nzirorera in Mukingo commune? 
A.	It would be difficult to say.  Are you asking the number of times that I might have seen him?  Well, Nzirorera was a native of Mukingo commune, and as required by Rwandan culture, he used to visit that locality and the population thereof, as well as his parents. 
Q.	And can you give us any idea of the frequency with which he would come to Mukingo commune during that period after the war started?  
A.	I think that in 1990, during the war, Nzirorera was probably occupied elsewhere in the administration of the country, and he could make his own contribution.  In that respect, you should understand that he didn't come frequently.  I heard -- I read somewhere that he used to come every weekend, but that is not true.  I know that he used to come from time to time, but I cannot give you the frequency in which he came.  He had a residence in Kigali, and from time to time he would come to visit his family and friends.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  And when Joseph Nzirorera did come to Mukingo commune, would you yourself meet him?  
A.	While I was the president of MRND, I used to meet him when he came to Mukingo commune.  Not on all occasions, of course, but each time that I needed to see him, I would do so.  And he would provide me with advice, especially during the period in which he was secretary general of our party.  I used to meet him and he would give me advice.  
Q.	And where did you meet him?  
A.	No, this is an important personality, and I would do everything to meet him at his home.  
Q.	Did you ever attend any meetings at the home of his mother with Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I know of no meeting that might have been held at the residence of Nzirorera's mother.  But people are exaggerating things.  Why hold a meeting in Nzirorera's mother's house?  
Q.	Can you describe for us what would happen when Joseph Nzirorera arrived in Mukingo commune?  Would the population know about his arrival, and what would they do? 
A.	Nzirorera was a militant from Mukingo commune.  He loved the members of the population and 
	vice versa.  Almost every time that he came I was informed about this.  And Nzirorera used to listen to the grievances of members of the population.  And, by the way, anybody who came to his residence was welcomed properly.  
Q.	Did Joseph Nzirorera contribute money to members of the population for different things?  
A.	I have told you that at some point in time I held the position of an inspector of schools, and I think that he used to give assistance to people in various areas.  And I know that thanks to his contribution, I was able to build certain classrooms in Mukingo commune.  Given the type of soil that we have in our region, it is not easy to build houses, so one had to go and look for good soil a bit far, and you need -- you needed means of transportation.  And Nzirorera assisted various persons in various areas.  I know several students whose fees he paid, especially those who attended -- or who went to school to ISTE.  Thank you.  To ESTE.  
Q.	Now, were you ever aware of any meeting that Nzirorera held with Michel Niyigaba or Alexis Rukundo? 
A.	That is rather surprising.  I have never learned that such a thing happened.  Actually, Nzirorera is a national personality.  Even I, at my level, I couldn't have held a meeting with that person, with such individuals.  That never happened.  That is information that has just been made up.  
Q.	Now, I want to ask you some questions about the MRND cloth, the kitenge.  Was that distributed to people -- to the population in Mukingo commune at any time? 
A.	I thank you.  There was a -- the kitenge fabric, there were ties, there were watches and even caps.  Most of the time I am the person who distributed them.  I sought to go and procure the caps in Kigali, and I would sell those items to the members of the population at a cheap price. 
Q.	Were any of those items available for sale at markets or at places within Mukingo commune? 
A.	That is correct.  Later, we gave the authorisation for the items to be commercialised and then businessmen sold them. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did Joseph Nzirorera ever distribute the kitenge to ******************, 
	******************** or members of their group? 
A.	I didn't witness any such thing.  But what I can tell the Trial Chamber is that in Rukoro cellule, which is not far from Nzirorera's residence, I met people who were wearing proper attires, and I felt that he might have helped those people to acquire the attires.  Now, insofar as ********* is concerned, he is a native of *********, while *********** is a native of ******************.  Well, I do not know if those two persons obtained the kitenge fabric under those circumstances, but I don't see any problem there.  All we wanted is that the members of our party should avail themselves of the attire made from that fabric.  And whether this is good or bad, all we wanted is that our members should wear attires or should wear that uniform.  
Q.	Now, did the MRND have membership cards? 
A.	All the members of the party were issued cards, and I am the very person who distributed those cards.  The leaders at the secteur and cellule levels brought me registers, and I would issue cards.  And when I wasn't sure about this name or the other, I would summon the person, and I will give the card to the person in question after having verified everything.  So, in short, I'm the person who distributed those cards to the members of our party. 
Q.	And were there ever any membership cards for the Interahamwe in Mukingo that you know of? 
A.	No.  As I have told you, we didn't have a youth wing of the MRND party in Mukingo.  The cards we are talking about are membership cards, that's cards of members of the MRND party. 
Q.	Were there ever lists of Tutsis compiled in Mukingo commune that you know of? 
A.	No, no, no.  Not at all.  That never happened. 
Q.	Did there come a time after the war started that night patrols were instituted in Mukingo commune? 
A.	That was necessary.  
Q.	Can you recall approximately when that started? 
A.	When the war broke out, I was hospitalised.  And when I left the hospital in 1991, the night patrols continued to be organised.  And even today, I know that the members of the population are at it.  
Q.	And what were the purpose of those night patrols? 
A.	You talked about the situation of war.  And those night patrols were organised in order to arrest the RPF infiltrators.  And, as you know, and even the RPF has admitted this, that is, that the RPF had resorted to the war tactics referred to as the guerilla warfare. 
Q.	Did the MRND have anything to do with the night patrols? 
A.	Frankly speaking, the MRND, that is, the national revolutionary movement for development and democracy, no longer had any authority.  And it were the bourgmestres and the conseillers who took charge of this.  I asked the bourgmestre to exempt teachers, and it is teachers who did not take part in those night patrols; otherwise, everyone else took part in the night patrols. 
Q.	Was there any military training of youth in Mukingo commune prior to the death of 
	President Habyarimana? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did some members of the population who participated in night patrols carry weapons? 
A.	On the 23rd of January 1991, the RPF had made an encroachment in Ruhengeri town and opened a Ruhengeri prison.  And when it passed through Kinigi commune, it killed many people.  And I know that subsequently members of the population refused to conduct these night patrols because it was saying that the enemy was attacking them.  And I think, unless I'm mistaken, that a decision was taken by the government to the effect that the members of the population be availed of firearms so that they could defend themselves when the enemy attacked them.  
Q.	And where would those people who were doing the night patrols get the firearms, and what would they do with them when the night patrol was finished that day?  
A.	Actually, I can only address the situation in Mukingo commune.  On a hill not far from there, there was a military position.  And in the evening, the members of the population who had several responsibilities in the cellule -- well, these were people who had operant behaviour or conduct -- of good conduct who will go and take firearms, which they would use during the night, and in the morning, they would hand over those weapons to the military positions.
(Pages 1 to 7 by Sherri Knox)





0950H
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	And what was the name of that hill where the military position was located? 
A.	It was a hill called Ruhehe.  When I started, I said that Mukingo commune was situated in the area referred to as the red zone.  That is not far from the volcano.  It was on that volcanic hill that you had the RPF positions.  That position was there in order to protect the localities against attack. 
Q.	Were there any weapons distributed to the youth of Mukingo prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	Not at all.  That never happened.  And even those persons I have mentioned who used to receive firearms, well, these were people that had to be chosen from amongst wise persons who were known for their good morality or good character, and it was normally from within the cellule committee that they were chosen. 
Q.	Did you know a person named Makoni in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I know Makoni.  He ran a bar in the Busogo secteur, but he is no longer there. 
Q.	What were the circumstances of his death as far as you know? 
A.	I think that Makoni was killed by an inhabitant, by a citizen.  I think it was a matter of settling scores. That was after the death of the president, around the month of May. 
Q.	And was the person who killed Makoni a civilian or a soldier? 
A.	From what we heard, it was a soldier.  Certainly, that soldier had a quarrel with Makoni and it was being said that Makoni was used to throwing stones at his house.  And in the meantime the soldier in question was at the war front and when he returned, when he was given leave of absence from the front -- from the war front -- he killed Makoni with a gunshot.  That is what was being said at the time so far as that incident was concerned. 
Q.	Did the youth of Mukingo commune kill any Tutsis before the death of President Habyarimana to your knowledge? 
A.	No, I don't believe so.  Actually, the youths that you are referring to, well, I don't know, but I confirm that that never happened.  And the Gacaca courts came and confirmed what I am saying. 
Q.	Were any meetings held at the commune office or any other location in Mukingo in which members of the population were urged to hunt down and kill the Hutus prior to the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	No, that never happened. 
Q.	Can you tell us how you learned of the death of President Habyarimana? 
A.	I heard the news over the radio.  That was very early in the morning, when a communiqué was read over the radio to the effect that the head of state had died.  That is how I heard the news. 
Q.	And did you leave your home that day, the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	I remained at home up to about 10 a.m.  And I had a relative in the Nyakimana commune.  And since I was uncertain about things, I went to meet that relative to ask him some advice.  And when I got that cellule, that is, the Munyanika (sic) cellule, it rained throughout the rest of the day and so I remained there only -- came back at about 3 p.m.  And that is when I returned to my home. 
Q.	Did you pass by Byangabo at all during that day? 
A.	No.  Actually, I went to the opposite direction, vis-à-vis Byangabo, so I didn't set foot in Byangabo on that day. 
Q.	After you returned home on the 7th of April, did you learn about any killings that had taken place in Mukingo commune? 
A.	Yes, when I arrived at home I found my wife who had just come home from the burial of a relative called Semisabike.  This was a cousin that had been killed, and I was under consternation with respect to what had happened in the Busogo commune.  So I went to bed because I wasn't feeling very well.  And my wife told me that Semisabike's killers had also prevented people from burying his corpse.  And the following day I went to look for Mr. Harerimana who was the bourgmestre, so that he could avail me of a vehicle that I would use in the exercise.  But I was unable to meet the bourgmestre because he had gone out.  So I had to return to my home.  And at about 2 p.m., when I was already at home, that is when I learnt that the bourgmestre, Harerimana, himself had just died. And we were all taken aback. 
Q.	What did you do then after the death of the Bourgmestre Harerimana? 
A.	We were all saddened and we went to his residence.  He had died on Friday and we had sought to go and do an autopsy in Ruhengeri, but when we got information from the soldiers, that we heard that the Inkotanyis were already in Ruhengeri town, and so we proceeded with the burial -- with this burial. After that I remained in the Harerimana's house, as was customary in our culture.  And it was only later that I returned to my home on the 13th of April 1994.  Apart from that, prior to that date we had remained in Harerimana's house in order to give comfort to the members of his family. 
Q.	And who served in place of Harerimana as the acting bourgmestre between the time of his death and the 13th of April? 
A.	As provided for by the law governing commune administration from 1973 (sic), the person who had to replace the bourgmestre was the conseiller of the secteur in which the commune office was built.  And during that period, therefore, Harerimana was replaced by the conseiller, Assiel Ndisetse. 
Q.	Now, were you, yourself, ever appointed to be the acting bourgmestre? 
A.	Yes.  The ministry of the interior requested me to act, and I think this was done on account of the prevailing situation.  But in the interim, the council of communal development did not accept this proposal.  They proposed that elections be held immediately.  And I personally requested a préfet who brought this information to the members of the population -- to accept this request from the members of the population so as to organise elections. 

I, therefore, announced that I was not ready to continue acting as assistant bourgmestre.  There were three candidates, Kajelijeli, a census officer and one, Semahane, who was elected to the position.  I think Semahane was subsequently replaced as bourgmestre by Kajelijeli.  When the council of communal development rejected my nomination, I did not like it.  And from the 23rd of April 1994, I no longer went to the communal office. 

You will understand that for a person such as myself, who had been an inspector of schools and who had been an assistant bourgmestre, it was very difficult to understand that the people were opposed to my appointment as bourgmestre.  That is why I was no longer interested in what was happening at the -- in the local administration, communal administration. 
Q.	Now you say that you received -- there was a letter from the minister of interior designating you as acting bourgmestre.  Approximately, when was that letter sent? 
A.	This letter was sent on the 13th April 1994. 
Q.	And did you have anything to do with soliciting that letter? 
A.	No. 
Q.	How did you find out about that letter? 
A.	The letter was copied to me, the sous-préfet forwarded to me.  So, I was able to read the letter.  But, unfortunately, I lost all my documents and I do not have a copy of that document today.  I, therefore, read the letter, and the council of communal development also had a copy of the letter.  And one of the reasons put forward to reject my appointment was that the seal of the ministry was not on the letter. 
Q.	Now, was there a time shortly after you received that letter that the sous-préfet came to Mukingo and attended a meeting of the communal development council? 
A.	Yes.  I overlooked giving that detail.  But on the 15th April the sous-préfet came to inform the communal council about this decision, and the members of the council insisted that a meeting of the council be convened.  The sous-préfet went to the office because the préfet was not yet in position. But Basile, when he was appointed to the position of préfet, came to explain the content of the said letter.  And I told you what the reaction of the communal council was and what followed. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, to interrupt.  Mr. Robinson, could you request the witness to give you the name of the sous-préfet. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Can you do that, Mr. Niyoyita? 
A.	His name was Ntarwanda. 
Q.	Now focusing on this communal development council, can you tell me who the members of that council were? 
A.	It is difficult for me to give you the names because that was a long time ago.  I can only tell you about the officers that were represented. 

The council was made up of the conseillers des secteurs, including members of the technical committee of the commune.  It comprised also the assistant bourgmestre as well as the head of services at the communal level.  There were also those in charge of the centres establishing the communes and representatives of religious bodies and political parties.  And in this particular council there was a representative of the MRND, NDR (sic) and PSD.  I recall that, in all, the communal development council was made up of 28 members, and I'm not able to give you those names today.  Let me add that each office was represented within this communal council. 
Q.	Was Joseph Nzirorera a member of the communal development council of Mukingo commune? 
A.	I have already told you that Nzirorera was a member of the influential party, and he was a member of the technical committee of the commune.  But on this 26th April 1994, Nzirorera was not present at the council's meeting. 
Q.	Was he present at the meeting of the 15th of April 1994? 
A.	No.  This meeting of 15th April brought together the conseillers des secteurs, and Nzirorera was not present at that meeting. 
Q.	Now, between the 15th and 26th of April, who carried out the duties of bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	It was the conseiller de secteur, Mr. Assiel Ndisetse. 
Q.	Now, on the 6th of April at the meeting of the communal development council, who presided over that meeting? 
A.	It was Simon Kagano, who was at the same time president of the technical commune (sic).  But the préfet, Basile, himself was not present at this meeting.  The person who welcomed the participants -- and Basile himself was the chairman of the technical committee.  And this chairperson of the technical committee convened this meeting on the request of the préfet, Basile. 
Q.	Can you tell me, your answer was a little bit confused, was Basile present at this meeting or not? 
A.	On the 26th April 1994, Basile attended the meeting of the communal development council.  But Basile had requested the chairperson of the technical committee to convene this meeting.  So it was that chairperson, Simon Kagano, who was an agronomist and also chairperson of the technical committee, who presented the agenda of the communal development council.  And he gave the floor to the préfet, Basile. 
Q.	And what was the result of this meeting? 
A.	During this meeting the préfet informed the participants that he came for a single reason:  That he wanted to introduce Niyoyita who had been appointed to the position of bourgmestre.  And the participants at the meeting said they were not in agreement with this procedure and that there was need to organise elections. 

Several persons took the floor on this issue.  And when I realised that we were not making progress, I requested the préfet to accept the proposal of the participants and accept to organise elections.  But since there was a problem, the threat from the Inkotanyi, I requested that the procedure be -- that we hurry the procedure so that we have somebody to coordinate activities at the communal level.  I even requested the préfet to allow me to withdraw my candidature.  And, subsequently, I went out. 
Q.	And after that meeting of 26th April 1994, did you ever go back to the commune office? 
A.	Subsequently, I realised that I had lost the confidence of the people.  I was inspector of schools for eight years and I had been an assistant bourgmestre and that affected me a lot.  I, therefore, decided to work as a private person, and not to be at Byangabo.  I had a shop in Byangabo and I decided to work in this shop for myself. 
Q.	To your knowledge, was there ever an occasion when the préfet, Basile, was introduced to the members of the population at Gisesero? 
A.	What I know is that he came on that date and that he organised a meeting, but I do not recall that Basile was presented -- was introduced to the people who were in a war period. It was wartime, and it was a difficult period and Basile was not introduced to the people. 
Q.	And do you know who was subsequently appointed to be the bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	From among the three candidates, one was selected.  And it was indicated that the two candidates had problems which would not enable them to occupy that position, and it was Semahane who was selected.  And he occupied that position until June.  And from the 26th June 1994, Semahane was replaced in this position by Kajelijeli who remained in the position of bourgmestre until when we fled to go to Zaire.  That is what I heard because I was not playing any role in all that. 
Q.	Do you know who received the most votes in the election of the communal development council? 
A.	The results were announced.  Kajelijeli got the highest vote, and then there was the census officer and Semahane was in third position.  I think he got only eight votes. 
Q.	And do you know why Kajelijeli was not immediately appointed to the position since he had received the most votes? 
A.	I have already explained to you that it was said that there were some reasons that prevented Kajelijeli from occupying that position, and the same thing was said about the census officer, Innocent.  So it was Semahane, in spite of the fact that he was in third position, was appointed to that position because, apparently, there was nothing preventing him from occupying that position. 
Q.	And what was your understanding of the things that prevented Kajelijeli from occupying the position of bourgmestre after receiving the most votes? 
A.	In actual fact -- and as I told you earlier -- I was no longer interested in this process.  But during the long period that we spent in prison I managed to get information from the co-detainees.  I learned that the Bourgmestre Kajelijeli was suspended from his position by presidential decree, and the communal development council relied on that document and considered that suspension as a reason preventing Kajelijeli from occupying the position of bourgmestre.  That is what I got to know when I was in prison. 
Q.	Do you know whether Joseph Nzirorera had any role in who was going to be appointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune? 
A.	I think if Nzirorera had played any role, I'm the one who would have been appointed, because I was the president of the MRND in that commune.  And Nzirorera was the secretary general at the national level.  I'm therefore saying that Nzirorera did not play any role in this procedure. 
Q.	Did you attend the swearing-in ceremony of Juvénal Kajelijeli? 
A.	My candidacy to the position of bourgmestre was not accepted, so it is obvious I could not have attended the swearing ceremony, be it Kajelijeli's own or Semahane's own.  I could not attend that ceremony. 
Q.	Can you tell us approximately when you left Rwanda? 
A.	I left Rwanda on the 13th July 1994, and I went in the direction of Zaire. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the Kinyarwanda booth is requesting that the witness be requested to repeat the date, whether it was 13th or 16th.  The booth said they did not quite hear him well. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Was it the 13th of July 1994? 
A.	Yes, I made reference to 13th July 1994. 
Q.	And when did you return to Rwanda? 
A.	I came back to Rwanda on the 16th December 1996. 
Q.	When were you arrested? 
A.	On the 16th December -- on the very day, 16th December 1996. 
Q.	Did there come a time when you went to Ruhengeri prison? 
A.	After a long period of detention in the communal cell, waiting for somebody to come and accuse me, I was transferred to the Ruhengeri brigade posts on the 15th May.  Subsequently, I was transferred to prison on the 22nd May 1997.  And I'm still in detention up until today. 
Q.	Now, during the time that you have been in Ruhengeri prison, was there ever an occasion when some authorities were isolated from the other members of the population? 
A.	Yes, that did happen.  Those who occupied positions of responsibility such as Basile and the bourgmestre, were transferred to block number 9.  And that is where they would spend the day.  And they only got out to go to church.  I think that practice lasted at least one year. 
Q.	Were you among those who were isolated? 
A.	No.  I was lucky.  I was detained in a block called "Special".  And I was not separated from the other prison inmates, so that gave me the opportunity to be able to greet some of my co-detainees because I knew several of them. 
Q.	And prior to the separation of the authorities, was there a meeting that was held among the prisoners to explain the procedure for a confession and guilty plea? 
A.	Such meetings took place often.  And, normally, at the end of the year the director of public prosecutions and other civilian servants would come to the prison to explain this procedure. Particularly, since the Ruhengeri prison was among the last prisons in Rwanda to use the procedure for confession and guilty plea.  And the person who is the prosecutor today, who is today minister of justice, Tharcisse Karugarama, he used to come to the prison with his assistants to explain to the detainees that they absolutely had to denounce those who urged them to commit their offences so that they can be released, because the detainees were ordinary members of the population.  But that continued.  Some former leaders -- some former authorities who were transferred to the Gisenyi prison -- they were transferred to the Gisenyi prison because it was being alleged that they had confessed to their crimes as had been requested of them by the judiciary of Rwanda. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry, to interrupt.  It could make the whole process more efficient if Mr. Robinson could ask the witness to tell us when approximately certain persons were isolated from the rest of the population; and when approximately this procedure of confession and guilty plea started; and when approximately there was some sort of address by Karuga -- by the person who became minister of justice. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Yes. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Niyoyita, if you could answer those questions, that would be good? 
A.	Personally, I was not interested in the procedure for confession and guilty plea.  But that started when the genocide trials started.  And I'm not able to give you the exact date.  Karugarama was the prosecutor from 1997.  When I got into prison he was the director of public prosecutions.  And in December 1999, towards the end of the year, these statements were made in the Ruhengeri prison. But I must say that I did not note the exact date.  And when he made the statement, I was not concerned by this procedure.  But it is obvious that I was among those persons that he was sensitising to revert to this procedure.  But I'm not able to give you the exact date because this event was a long time ago. 
Q.	Now, it's one thing for someone to confess and talk about things that they know are true.  And it's another thing for someone to falsely accuse someone else.  Which of those two were the prisoners being encouraged to do? 
A.	I was not saying that they were sensitised.  They were virtually being coerced to revert to the procedure of confession and guilty plea.  And the detainees were asked to accuse former authorities so they would bear the responsibility.  And at the same time, they were telling these detainees the advantages that they would draw from accusing these authorities. 
Q.	And what were those advantages? 
A.	There were several advantages:  For example, that somebody who had been detained for a long period could go out of prison in civilian clothing.  Some people could be transferred to the kitchen where they could have a bigger ration of food.  And others could be team leaders outside the prison. 
At the time, those who used the services of the detainees would give them food.  And those who used this -- reverted to this procedure for confession and guilty plea could receive their visitors in a private area, where others who did not would receive their visitors in public places.  In 2003, it was said that those who used the procedure on the basis of the template or the format that was provided could be released.  These were the promises made to the detainees to convince them to revert to the procedure of confession and guilty plea.  But in actual fact, the confessions could not be accepted if the person writing the confessional statement did not accuse the former authorities. 
Q.	And were detainees also convoked to the office of the prosecutor for meetings? 
A.	It is the prosecutor who put people in detention.  And he had the right to summon detainees.  But since I was not present during those interviews, I would not be in a position to talk to you about the purport of the interviews.  But I know that detainees were often summoned to the office of the prosecutor. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, would you like to take our morning recess at this time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much more time, do you think? 
MR. ROBINSON:
About 30 minutes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

We take our mid-morning break now. 
(Court recessed at 1030H) 
(Pages 8 to 15 by Eleanor Bastian)














(Court resumed at 1059H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
As promised, the oral decisions will be given now, and the decision will be delivered by Judge Joensen.  
JUDGE JOENSEN: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

And the decision reads as follows:  The Chamber has previously, by confidential decision of 27 October 2008, ruled that the transcript of LM1's testimony in the Bagosora et al. trial, attached to Nzirorera's original motion is admissible pursuant to Rule 92 bis (D) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  In a confidential motion of 2nd November -- 2nd October 2009, Nzirorera now moves the Chamber to admit the transcript.  

The Chamber has also previously ruled, by a decision of 15 July 2009, that the written statement of Defence Witness 75 is admissible pursuant to Rule 92 bis, subject to certification.  

In a motion filed on 11 November 2009, Nzirorera now moves the Chamber to admit the statement pursuant to Rule 90 -- 92 bis (C), providing documentation that the witness has died.  The Prosecution does not oppose the motions.  

The Chamber grants both motions and requests the registrar to assign -- assign exhibit numbers.  

The Chamber also orders that the reference to the names of the two witnesses be redacted from today's and yesterday's transcripts.

The Bagosora transcript should have two exhibit numbers, one for open session and one for closed session and the Witness 75 only one number.  

Madam registrar. 
MS. NGOWI:
The exhibit number will be D -- D. NZ684 up to 687 (sic).  Thank you. 
JUDGE JOENSEN: 
So that would be 684 for the open session of the Bagosora transcript, 685 for the closed session transcript, and 687 for Witness 75.  Thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I think there's a small mistake.  I think we maybe missed 686.  It should be 684 for the open session, 685 for the closed session, and 686 for the witness statement. 

JUDGE JOENSEN: 
Yeah.  I tend to agree with Mr. Robinson.  So there will be no 687.  Thank you. 
 (Exhibit No. D. NZ684 admitted) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ685 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. NZ686 admitted) 
MR. ROBINSON: 
And, Mr. President, the witness statement itself is -- the witness has never been the subject of protective measures, the one who has died, and I think that it's okay to use his name.  And his name was mentioned all along.  So in that particular instance, I don't think it's necessary that there'd be any redaction of his name. 
JUDGE JOENSEN: 
Well, the confusion arises out of you using a number in -- in -- on your witness list.  So we more or less assumed that there would be a motion for protection order.  

But since that is not the case, the redaction order will only go to the name of Witness LM1. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Judge Joesen. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You may continue now with your examination. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Niyoyita, while you were at Ruhengeri prison, did you have any occasion to discuss with ****************** what the detainees were doing -- or some detainees were doing in connection with their confessions and accusations of -- against authorities? 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Actually, before the witness responds -- I think the -- the -- the use of the word "authorities" is a little problematic, and I've raised this point before.  But it would greatly assist if Mr. Robinson could break that down a bit and make a distinction between conseillers and bourgmestres and national authorities and somehow get the witness to explain exactly what he means by the "authorities". 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I can do that. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Niyoyita, let me ask you a different question then.  You've told us about incentives that detainees had to accuse authorities.  Can you explain what -- by "authorities", what do you mean? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Authorities are considered -- are the conseiller de cellule (sic), bourgmestre, and that goes all the way up to members of government and the president.  This also includes officials of political parties from the communal level up to the national level:  The préfet, the sous-préfet, and so on and so forth.  

In relation to the Ruhengeri prison, those who were in unit 9 included the conseillers communaux, the bourgmestres.  I think I remember the bourgmestre of Nyamugari and bourgmestre of Nkuli, the bourgmestre of Cyeru, the former bourgmestre of Ndusu, former bourgmestre of Nyamutera, and the former bourgmestre of Kigombe.  There was also the préfet, Basile, in that unit, that specific unit.  The other persons who were in that unit 9 were people who had been sentenced to -- to life imprisonment and capital sentence. 
Q.	Do you know whether or not any effort was made to get detainees to accuse people who were being held in Arusha? 
A.	That is all we did.  That is the truth.  I think even the judicial authorities do not think that they had committed any offence.  

Let me give you an example.  When they had to examine the cases of the Mukingo authorities, they brought a list of intellectuals or people who occupied positions of authority.  There were people like Gato, Gakuru.  There was a team from Gitarama.  And I was called.  

There was some coercion.  You know, in the prison there are people who are appointed as policemen.  So they took me by force and interviewed me.  And these people would report to the prosecutor general.  They asked me under duress to confirm what those two persons had stated.  And I recall that these persons who were requesting me to do this were angry with me, and they put me in cell for that reason (sic).  

But -- but there was an outcry from the people who said it was unfair.  And I was brought out of the cell.  So that practice did exist in Rwanda. 
Q.	Was there ever a time when you were contacted to charge Juvénal Kajelijeli by a lieutenant of the gendarmerie? 
A.	Yes.  It was a lieutenant of the gendarmerie called mwene Nteri.  He came and asked me to testify against Kajelijeli.  And he promised to speak to the minister to secure my release.  

We had known each other for a long time.  He's somebody I had known for -- since 1990 -- 1975, 1976.  But I told him that I was not ready to talk about events that I did not witness.  

He was not the only one.  There were other persons who worked in this Tribunal, but I did not see their complimentary cards.  

I know that there was one Malian who asked me to testify against Casimir Bizimungu.  He came -- he was with an interpreter who was interpreting into French.  And I understand French quite well.  And I was requested to testify against Casimir.  When I refused, he got angry.  

I will, therefore, say that this practice is current practice in Rwanda.  If you -- if they come and you are not strong, then you fall for this temptation. 
Q.	Now, can you tell us if you ever discussed with ****************** what the detainees were doing with respect to making accu -- allegations against people in Arusha.
A.	Regarding this young man called *******************, he was in charge of security within the prison.  I used to have discussions with him often, and he mentioned this to me.  But I don't think he came to testify against these persons in Arusha.  

He used to tell me that we -- in their team, this practice was very -- very current.  He said they used to meet in the locality of the person who in the group was referred to as the capitaine.  I know somebody called Bagidi - Bazimiyaga (sic), Gato, Gakuru, and so on and so forth.  These people would meet regularly and will agree on the charges to bring against the detainees in Arusha.  ******************* spoke to me about this regularly. 
Q.	Now, were you yourself tried for crimes committed in Mukingo commune?  
A.	My trial was surprising.  I told you that there were no accusers, as you can see from the report of the substitut Rukira.  I remained in detention for a long time.  And in 1999 the parquet requested the prison inmates to meet.  And these people testified in my favour.  But I was not released.  

When the Gacaca courts started my case, as well as the cases of the various co-detainees who were transferred to the Gacaca courts -- and at one point in time, all the cellules demonstrated that I did not commit any crime in the various con -- cellules.  A decision was taken to release me.  The department of public prosecutions was asked where they got the evidence to support my charges.  And surprisingly, my name was placed among the accused persons on the instigation of the substitut of the department of public prosecution, called Gaspard.  At some point in time, there were people who testified in my favour.  This procedure continued until 2007.  

And as the rules in force provided for, I wrote a letter for all the people to be convened.  All the survivors were invited; the president of the court of first instance, Rudatinya; more than 72 persons, wise persons, of the region from all the cellules.  

And the Busogo Gacaca court was asked to examine my case.  On 16th October 2007 this committee examined all the allegations.  But it was realised that I had not committed any crime, apart from the fact that there were fabricated allegations against me.  They convened Épimaque, Samvura and his surviving brother and those persons who fabricated false evidence.  On that day these people said Niyoyita and Assiel still had not committed any offence.  And later on there was a general meeting of the Busogo Gacaca courts which confirmed that I had not committed any offence in Busogo or anywhere else in Rwanda.  

In their deliberations the general assembly decided to transfer my case to the national level of the Gacaca courts because my case was a -- a difficult one, and it was -- and my case was decided -- was determined by one Fayizari.  He examined my case.  He did his work together with one Uwizeyimana, Agnès, who is a lawyer.  And these people determined that we had not committed any crime.  All these bodies requested the Gacaca -- the Busogo Gacaca courts to order my release.  

From that time on we remained in detention.  I tried to contact everybody concerned.  
Agnès Uwizeyimana came and told us that he had been asked not to forward this decision to the 
prison authorities.  

After 15 months my case was transferred to the Kicukiro Gacaca courts.  That was over a distance of over 100 kilometres.  And 29th April 2009 I was convicted in this -- in that court.  And it was with sadness that I honoured that invitation.  

Once again, the same allegations were brought up.  And I was surprised because I had already been acquitted in respect of those allegations.  And now they had been brought before another Gacaca court.  I see -- I saw that there were lawyers trying to defend the persons accused with genocide in the country.  And I think there was a -- an officer of the Tribunal called Okali with an interpreter called Hélène, I think.  

And this court which had convinced me sent -- con-- sentenced me to life imprisonment.  They found me guilty for illegal possess -- possession of firearm, incitement to commit genocide, and other allegations.  

I appealed the decision.  Most of the judges in that court are survivors, who normally are not happy when they are sitting on the case of a person accused with genocide.  And they upheld the decision of the Gacaca courts which sentenced me to life imprisonment.  They even added that I had to be imprisoned in isolation.  

I know that the coordinator of the Gacaca courts in the Musanze district in the Busogo area played a role in what happened to me.  Briefly, this is what happened in relay -- in relation to my case. 
Q.	And are you now seeking review of that decision? 
A.	Yes.  I have written to that effect, and I tried to quote the laws that were breached.  The president, Festus, answered me, saying that he did not have the authority to decide on my ques -- my issue -- to determine my issue.  He -- he advised me to write a letter to the Kicukiro Gacaca appeals court.  

And following the directive of the coordinator of the Gacaca, the national -- the Gacaca court at the national level, it was decided that this same Gacaca court -- it should review the trial.  When -- and they tell you about honest judges, in actual fact, it is the coordinators who direct these procedures.  And they want to ensure that it is the Kicukiro court that tries me because they want me to be found guilty.

These are the circumstances under which I was tried.  I don't know what the international community can do to assist me and to bring my trial to an end.  Thank you. 
Q.	Did -- have -- did you commit any of the crimes that you were charged with? 
A.	I'm telling you the whole truth.  The investigations began on the 13th March 1997, and they lasted until the 9th October 2009.  And all these investigations proved that I did not commit any crime in the Busogo area.  There are documents to this effect.  There are local residents who were present.  I was not implicated in any of the acts that were committed in that region.  Thank you. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Niyoyita.
MR. ROBINSON: 
And I have no further questions, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  

Do any other -- of the other Defence teams wish to examine this witness?  

No.  Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, you now have to respond to questions from the Prosecutor, who will now begin his cross-examination of you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
I'm used to Mr. Home -- Hometowu jumping to his feet at this moment, Your Honour. 
MR. HOMETOWU: 
Yeah.  The examination-in-chief lasted 1 hour, 34 minutes.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
Your Honours, as usual, I start by saying that it's unlikely that I'll be able to contain my examination to 1 hour, 34 minutes, but we'll address that issue at the appropriate time. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.  You may -- you may start. 
MR. WEBSTER: 
All right.  I'd also state for the record that I've compiled a bundle of potential exhibits.  And I've already distributed them to the Defence teams.  And there are copies with the registry for the -- for the Judges and a copy for the registry.  Language section already has theirs as well.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Let me begin by wishing you a good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
Q.	Could you begin by telling us a little bit about your relationship with Joseph Nzirorera.  Did you know him personally?  Was this someone that you regarded as a friend?  
A.	I have known Nzirorera for a long time while I was schooling at the Busogo primary centre.  That would be Busogo II primary cent -- school centre.  And that centre was located near the plot that was farmed by his father.  

The first time that I saw him, he was the leader of the students' union in Busogo.  And we could see him during festivities or functions organised by that association.  Subsequently, I continued to know him when I was teaching at the Busogo centre.  And then I was later appointed inspector of schools.  And I got to know him better.  

I also held the position of assistant bourgmestre.  And so I continued to be in touch with Nzirorera.  So I know him quite well.
Q.	And how far away from his mother's house, the house of Nyiramakuba, do you -- were you residing in -- during the period 1992 to 1994? 
A.	I didn't live very far.  Her house was at the border with the Ruhengeri (sic) border while I lived in the Mugogo cellule.  Between the two houses there was a distance of about 2 kilometres or so. 
Q.	Nyiramakuba's house was not within eyesight of -- of your house, was it?  In other words, if you were at home, you wouldn't be able to see clear across to Nyiramakuba's home.  
A.	From my house I could not see near Nyiramakuba's house.
(Pages 16 to 22 by Tanya West)









1130H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	And could you tell us -- or, try to explain where your house is located in relation to the Byangabo centre and Nyiramakuba's house.  In other words, was it on the other side of the Byangabo centre going towards Gisenyi, or is it going in the direction of Ruhengeri town, or in the direction of the Busogo parish church?  I'm just trying to get a picture, graphically, of where your residence was located in relation to Nzirorera's mother's residence. 
A.	When I passed in front of that lady's residence, I continued towards Ruhengeri.  And at the 
Petrorwanda petrol station, I would take a -- a road that forked off to the left, and then I'll pass by the Mugogo hill where there was an antenna.  And from that hill, I would cover 500 metres.  So I stayed in a locality that was located some 500 metres from that antenna. 
Q.	Anyway, thank you very much, Mr. Witness.  You'd agree with me, wouldn't you, that Joseph Nzirorera was a very highly influential figure in Ruhengeri during the period 1990 to 1994?  
A.	I do acknowledge that Nzirorera was an influential person.  
Q.	And you were aware back in 1994 and back in 1993, when he was elected the national secretary of the MRND party, you were aware of that fact back in that period of time?  It's not something that you learned only recently; is that correct? 
A.	I am among those who elected me (sic) into the position.  Nzirorera was elected, and I am telling you that Nzirorera was a person who was much liked and appreciated.  And that is one of the reasons wherefore he was elected to the position of secretary general of the MRND at the national level.  
I was even present during the elections that took place at the stadium.  Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	Are we talking about the elections at the MRND national congress in Kigali, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes.  It was during this election that he was elected national secretary of the MRND, and I think that was in 1993.  
Q.	Did you also attend the MRND congress of 28 April 1992 when Mathieu Ngirumpatse was elected national secretary? 
A.	No.  He was the executive secretary, yes, and I took part in that congress.  
Q.	Okay.  That's essentially what I wanted to find out.  So you took -- you participated both in the 
MRND congress of 28th April 1992, and the one that was held in early July 1993? 
A.	Yes.  I participated in those two congresses because, as the president of the MRND in the commune, 
I was -- I had the mandate and the powers to participate in those two congresses.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  And you'd agree with me that Joseph Nzirorera is probably the most powerful MRND official from Ruhengeri préfecture -- or he was in 1994.  That in 1994, that he, of all of the members of the MRND, was probably the most significant figure -- the most powerful figure from Ruhengeri? 
A.	When you talk of influence -- well, you have your own understanding of that concept, Mr. Prosecutor, but I would like to tell you that in Ruhengeri préfecture, the president was Casimir Bizimungu.  You, therefore, cannot consider him as an ordinary member of the population as compared to Nzirorera.  There were many party members that were well appreciated in that region. 
Q.	Well, thank you for that, Mr. Witness.  But between the president of the MRND at the level of Ruhengeri préfecture and the national secretary of the MRND, wouldn't you agree that the 
national secretary was a much more powerful office within the party? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  Within the MRND and even in the Ruhengeri préfecture, we did not encourage the concurrent holding of our positions.  We gave Nzirorera's candidacy and when he was selected, we did not think that he had to be more powerful than this or that other members of the party.  In him, we saw a person who could represent the MRND, but that did not mean that there weren't other persons that could have held that position.  
Q.	Okay.  But at least we're agreed that both Nzirorera and Casimir Bizimungu were very significant or powerful persons within the MRND party.  
A.	I would like to confirm to you that these were influential personalities.  And I would even tell you that there was another example.  Take the example of Baributsa.  This was a national referee and he was a university lecturer.  I, therefore, confirm that we had members of the party who were influential and who were in good stead to lead the party, either at the préfectoral level, or who could represent the party even at national level.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you very much, Mr. Witness, we'll move on to something else.  You'd agree with me, would you not, that Nzirorera -- Joseph Nzirorera had a very -- a very big family.  He had 
seven or eight siblings from his mother, Nyiramakuba, and his father Bitihuse, and probably as many as 20 siblings in all if you were to include his father -- the children from his father's other wives.  Can we agree on that? 
A.	Regarding the brothers or sisters of Nzirorera, I am not in a position to give you a precise figure.  I know them in general terms, but I cannot talk to you about all his brothers and sisters.  All I know is that he was part of a large or extensive family.  
Q.	You know Dusabimana, do you not?  Dusabimana was Nzirorera's brother.  I think it was a younger brother.  
A.	Yes, Dusabimana was my student.  This was a young man.  I think that he was a sergeant or a 
first sergeant in the army.  He was Nzirorera's younger brother.  
Q.	You also know Noeli Ndayisaba who was his nephew.  
A.	Did you say his nephew? Ndayisaba was Nzirorera's brother's son.  And in our language, we would consider him as the very son of Nzirorera, even if his biological father was Mutima.  
Q.	What about Muhombo?  Do you know that person as well? 
A.	Muhombo is Ndayisaba's younger brother.  Mutima had a first wife, but they were separated later, and from that marriage he had two children.  
Q.	Okay.  What about Bagabo? 
A.	Bagabo was a child that I used to see there.  I taught him in his seventh year -- in the seventh year, but I can't give you any more ample information regarding his behaviour.  I think he went to study in the Karago commune, and I think that he continued or pursued his studies in Zaire.  
Q.	And when you say you used to see him there, you're referring to Nyiramakuba's house, the house of Nzirorera's mother; is that correct? 
A.	Are you talking about Bagabo?  Bagabo was my student in 1981-1982 when he was in his 
seventh year.  So when I say that I was used to seeing him, I meant that I used to see him at the Byangabo trading centre.  
Q.	Do you know if he was related to Joseph Nzirorera? 
A.	I know nothing of that.  
Q.	Okay.  What about Gapfobo? 
A.	Célestin Gapfobo is today in detention in the Ruhengeri prison.  He's also a member of the population of that locality that were used to being at the centre.  In fact, he was a roving trader.  
Q.	One of the witnesses in this trial, a -- another witness in this trial, Mr. Witness, someone who testified fairly recently, has characterised Gapfobo as Nzirorera's cousin.  Do you have any reason to dispute that characterisation? 
A.	I can neither confirm or deny that because I didn't carry out any investigation on that matter.  
Q.	All right.  I -- I only want you to give us information based on your knowledge -- or on what you have seen or heard, so that's fine.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  

Would you agree with me that even today, even though Mr. Nzirorera is here in custody -- here in custody in Arusha, and his mother is deceased, there's still a wide network of Nzirorera family members in Mukingo commune?  That he has an extensive family network that still lives in Mukingo commune?  Would you agree?  Or if you don't, you can explain why.  
A.	I haven't quite understood your question.  You mentioned a network, but I didn't quite understand what you meant.  When you talk of a network, I do not understand what you want to say.  So please kindly repeat your question.  
Q.	Would you agree that Joseph Nzirorera still has a lot of family that are living in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I don't agree with you on that point.  Many members of Nzirorera's family are dead or are deceased.  And I think that today, there are only two children of Ntamakemwa, and I should say that the mother, Uzamukunda, died recently.  There aren't any other relatives of Nzirorera in Mukingo commune, but there are probably other relatives who do not live in Mukingo commune and who might still be alive.  But to my knowledge, in Busogo, I know of no other relatives of Nzirorera who are still alive, apart from those two children that I just mentioned.  
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  Can you tell us, if you know, if Juvénal Kajelijeli and Joseph Nzirorera were good friends back in 1992, 1993, 1994.
A.	I would merely tell you that there was no problem between the two of them.  Nzirorera and Kajelijeli were both members of the MRND, and I know of no dispute between those two persons.  
Q.	Wasn't Kajelijeli working in the school that was either operated or funded by Joseph Nzirorera in the early '90s? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  It is true that Nzirorera was the chairman or president of the association that had founded that school, but we, the other members of the population, also took shares -- took out shares in that school.  But the school, in itself, had a principal or a director and those, who were not aware of the truth and who saw Bourgmestre Kajelijeli pass by, could be mistaken as to what he represented.  

Now, after the death of Father Flavien, it is Kajelijeli who somehow supervised the school.  And today it can be said that, at the time, he was the director or principal of the school, because there were people who held various administrative positions in that school.  So to sum up, Kajelijeli was never the director of that school -- that is, ESTB. 
Q.	I'm not suggesting to you that he was the director.  I'm suggesting that he was an employee; that he worked there as an accountant, and that he was put in that position by Joseph Nzirorera.  So if you could say yes or no or comment very briefly on that, because I think we're -- we're spending a bit too much time on these issues.  Just be very brief if you want to comment on that last statement from --
A.	I thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  All associations -- and this doesn't appear only in Rwanda -- but all associations have structures.  There was a management committee in that school, and if Kajelijeli was part of that structure, it wasn't because of Nzirorera, because all of us had our say insofar as the running of the school was concerned.  Obviously, he was more influential, but he could not take any decision without our knowing about it.  

I am saying that Kajelijeli could have been a part of the structure of that school because he was a bourgmestre of the commune in which the school was built.  For instance, I would tell you that I, myself, was an auditor in that school.  
Q.	Thank you.  We'll go on to something else now, Mr. Witness.  Have you ever heard the term Uruyange? 
A.	Oh, yes.  Uruyange was a term -- our name used to refer to an association that existed in the commune and that was led by Niyigaba, Michel.  But that term wasn't used for a long time, and it is known only to some members of the population.  So I would like to point out that that association was an association that was engaged in agriculture or farming.  
Q.	Was it an association that was sponsored by the government? 
A.	Thank you, Mr. President -- Mr. Prosecutor.  Prior to 1994 in Rwanda, all initiatives started up at commune level, so there was an association in each secteur.  And in that association, you could find both the young and the old.  
Q.	I'm going to try to be much more brief in my questions, and I'm going to ask you to try to be much more brief in your responses.  Okay?  I don't need the entire --
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...very well, I'll try to be brief.  
Q.	Listen to the question and answer it as concisely as possible.  Was Uruyange sponsored by the government?  You can say yes or no, and then we can move on to the next question.  
A.	The answer is no.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, we've had testimony in this trial from a significant member of the Uruyange group, someone who claims to be one of its leaders, and he claims that it was sponsored by the government, and he claims that there was even a government ministry under which it was organised.  What do you think of that information? 
A.	That witness probably does not know the distinction between the government and the commune -- the communal administration.  If we take the communal administration -- well, it did avail that association of a plot of land that it could farm.  The ministry had a representative that was -- that supervised such associations.  So even if you had asked me to answer by a yes or no, we should try to draw the distinction between communal administration and the government.  And as far as I'm concerned, when you talk to me about the government, I don't understand by it -- a communal administration or a funding agency.  

But insofar as associations are concerned -- associations operated.  And there was a civil servant at the commune level that monitored all the activities of such an association and to which the communal administration could provide some assistance.  
Q.	Can you give us an estimate of how many members there were in the Uruyange association in Mukingo commune back in 1993?  An estimate?  I don't expect you to have a -- an exact number.  
A.	Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  I have said that there was a young monitor who was responsible for the functioning of such a youth association.  But on my part, I -- I'm not in a position to tell you the number of members.  There was an association for women, for men, for youths, et cetera.  I would be lying if I ventured to give you a figure.  
Q.	Okay.  Can you approximate it?  Was it more than 10, more than 20, more than 30?  In one sentence.  If you cannot, just say so, and I'll move on to the next question.  
A.	I think there were standards in force that governed the setting up of a cooperative, but I really don't have that -- I can't remember. 
Q.	Okay.  In any case, Mr. Witness, a person, who identified himself as a leader or a president of the Uruyange, testified before one of the Trial Chambers in this Tribunal, and claims that in February of 1993, members of his association were organised into the Interahamwe, affiliated with the MRND party, and that you were the person that approached him and sought to organise the Uruyange as the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the Court's benefit, I'm referring to an Exhibit P. 355 that was entered into evidence a few weeks ago from Witness 6.  

THE WITNESS:
I thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.  As I have already said -- or as I said at the beginning of my testimony, we had not yet set up a youth committee for the MRND.  If that witness is still alive, did he tell you who was the president of that Interahamwe group in Mukingo commune?  There was never any such thing.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, his previous testimony from years ago, claimed that you, as the MRND president in Mukingo commune, approached him and that 31 members of his organisation then became the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune.  And that you were the catalyst.  You were the one that approached him on behalf of the MRND party.  That's the testimony he gave under oath at a time when he thought he was giving evidence favourable to the Defence in that case.  
A.	In any case, that witness told a lie.  I never sought to create an Interahamwe youth committee in Mukingo commune.  The idea was there, but you're probably pretending to forget that the war was raging in that commune.  There were displaced persons from the war that had come from all areas 
and -- that were there.  The Mukingo commune is neighbouring the volcanic area, and I'm telling you, as I've already said, even if the idea was there, we never set up a youth -- an Interahamwe youth committee in the Mukingo commune.  
Q.	Okay.  But you would agree with me, would you not, that if you, as the MRND president at the level of the commune, had taken that initiative to set up the Interahamwe in Mukingo, that that would have been consistent with the resolution that was read at the MRND congress in April of 1992, when Mathieu Ngirumpatse told all of those that had convened, including you, Mr. Witness -- and I'll read it for you, "The members of the national congress commends the founders of the Interahamwe and requests that this organisation should be established in all préfectures and even communes, if possible, and affiliated with the MRND party."

Didn't you hear Ngirumpatse read that to you at the national congress back in April of 1992? 
A.	It is very clear -- and I've already said that it was a good idea -- where we needed Interahamwes urgently was Kigali and that is where they also had the means.  But as I said, regarding our locality we were careful; we proceeded cautiously.  We had the idea in mind, and you should remember that we were in an area which was referred to as the red zone.  So the establishment of the Interahamwe was not urgent.  We easily recruited members for our party and we had, more or less, a reserve.  So our party had no recruitment problem -- membership recruitment problem.  
Q.	Okay.  Well, thank you.  
MR. WEBSTER:
And for the benefit of the Court and the record, I was referring to D. NZ006 at page 3 in the English text.  
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, in 1993 and all throughout 1994, Joseph Nzirorera was the national secretary of the MRND party.  And I'm sure you'd agree with me that that was the only national office within the MRND where the incumbent was provided with an office, a secretariat, a car, a driver, and had the responsibility for the day-to-day management of the MRND party nationally, which included its 
youth wing.  
A.	I accept that.  
Q.	And you'd suggest to this Court that in his home commune of Mukingo, the national secretary of the MRND party would be so negligent as to not have ensured that the party's youth wing was represented in his own backyard? 
A.	No, that is not what I wanted to tell the Chamber.  I think at one point in time, on -- when I went to Kigali, I discussed this with Nzirorera.  Nzirorera said that if you don't find the need to establish the Interahamwe, you can proceed more slowly in relation to the other regions of the country.  In our locality, the establishment of the Interahamwe was not an emergency.  
(Pages 23 to 29 by Jean Baigent)


























1200H 
BY MR. WEBSTER:
Q.	All right.  Let's move on to something else, Mr. Witness.  

A person who has characterised himself as the vice-president of the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune testified recently that the Uruyange was a militia that was organised well before the November 1992 MRND rally in Ruhengeri and that they were known to have beat up Bagogwe Tutsi that they would find on the street and that they were involved in political violence in 1993, under the leadership of 
******************.  And when that person was giving that evidence, he was under the impression that he was giving evidence that would be favourable to the Defence.  What do you have to say to that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Honestly, this person lied.  It is possible and people do not tell truth under certain circumstances.  That never happened.  No youth group affiliated to the party was organised in the entire Mukingo secteur, and I will even go further to say that in the entire Ruhengeri commune. 
Q.	Okay.  There's a conseiller de secteur from your commune, Mukingo, who testified under oath that sometime in November 1992 after the MRND rally in Ruhengeri there were youths that had gotten together and called themselves Interahamwe.  I'm not suggesting to you that he claims that the Interahamwe were set up by the party.  But in his testimony, which he also believed was favourable to the Defence, he said that the youth got together and called themselves Interahamwe back in 1992.  What have you to say to that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	I thought he would have given you further information on that.  And I will urge you to ask him.  I'm telling you that today, what is the meaning of the word "Interahamwe"? It is different from what was referred to as Interahamwe in those days.  During that rally, he explained the word "Interahamwe" and he said that it is a youth group of good morals and it's a youth group that was established to participate in the election campaign which had been scheduled.  So today we cannot say that it was a youth wing of the MRND.  I'm sorry, Prosecutor, you asked me to be brief. 
Q.	Okay.  All right.  Well, tell us this:  Was there a group that called themselves the Interahamwe?  I'm not asking you if the MRND party set it up.  But are you aware -- were you aware in 1992 and 1993 that there was a group of youth that referred to each other as "Interahamwe" in Mukingo commune? 
A.	I did not hear any such thing.  If we would have heard it, we'd have punished those persons. 
Q.	When you say you would have punished those persons, there's where I'd like you to be expansive, Mr. Witness.  What do you mean? 
A.	We would have informed the communal authorities and the authorities would have sanctioned them.  Because they would have assumed -- they would have wrongly assumed a name, that is, the Interahamwe, which they are not.  We intended to set up the Interahamwe and they, as a group, assumed that name.  It was not proper.  It was illegal.  
Q.	And you would agree with me that Joseph Nzirorera, as national secretary of the MRND party, would have been duty-bound to make sure that anyone that was masquerading as Interahamwe in his home commune would have received swift instructions that it was inappropriate to do so; right? 
A.	Even without talking about Nzirorera, if even I had been informed, I would have gotten -- I would have made sure that those people were sanctioned. 
Q.	All right.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Now, you attended the rally where President Habyarimana addressed the people of Ruhengeri on the 15th of November 1992; right? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you were there when Casimir Bizimungu, the president of the MRND for Ruhengeri préfecture, opened the gathering and thanked those who had participated.  
A.	Yes, I was present.  Apart from the fact that I cannot recall everything that Casimir said.  I do not recall the content of his address.  What I recall is what the president of the republic said regarding the 
	MRND youth group.  
Q.	Well, fortunately, we have a videotape of what the president said and what Casimir Bizimungu said.  But you would agree with me that Casimir Bizimungu, as the president of the MRND in 
	Ruhengeri préfecture, should be able to distinguish real Interahamwe, those who were affiliated with the MRND party, from those who would have been masquerading if they had called themselves Interahamwe? 
A.	But you are talking about Casimir.  Let's leave Casimir aside.  Even I could have done it.  I don't know if Casimir mentioned the presence of the Interahamwe in the course of that rally in the 
	Mukingo commune.  He introduced Interahamwes from Mukingo.  And then you can produce the evidence.  I know that Robert was introduced to the participants at the rally.  If there were Interahamwes in the Mukingo commune, we would not have made a mistake of not -- of leaving them behind.  We would have brought them and introduced them to the president of the republic. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I put it to you that that's exactly what you did.  Because in the video that we have from that event, which is in evidence in this case as P. 11, there is an excerpt where Casimir Bizimungu is opening the event and he's thanking those who arrive.  And he says as follows:  "I wish to thank Télesphore Munyaruyenzi, MP, for organising this event, the MRND committee for 
	Ruhengeri préfecture, the Inkeragutabara-Urusengo troupe from Nkumba, the Interahamwe and all of you who have come from all corners of Ruhengeri préfecture as well as the other préfectures in Rwanda to attend this rally."

So I'd suggest to you, Mr. Witness, that based on the transcript that we've admitted in this case as 
P. 354, Casimir Bizimungu was welcoming and thanking the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri on the 
15th of November 1992.  How do you -- do you have anything to say about that?  
A.	You have just said that he congratulated the Interahamwe who attended.  But I admitted that there were Interahamwes from Kigali who attended that.  I don't know if he congratulated the Interahamwe from Ruhengeri.  I have told you that there was no Interahamwe in the Mukingo commune, within the meaning of the word "Interahamwe" that we have.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, what I'd like to do is direct you to another exhibit in this trial.  It's P. 368.  We have it in all three languages.  It's a letter dated the 28th of October 1992.  And it went out under the name of Casimir Bizimungu, although I believe it is signed by his assistant, the executive secretary for the MRND in Ruhengeri préfecture, who was Karoli Hategekimana.  Do you know that name, Mr. Witness, Charles Hategekimana? 
A.	Yes, I know this person. 
Q.	Well, this is a letter that bears his signature, the MRND party's seal, written in Kinyarwanda, dated the 28th of October 1992, stamped as having been received by someone on the -- looks like the 
	31st of October 1992 -- where he refers to the militant.  He's writing to MRND chairpersons in all of the communes of Ruhengeri.  And I believe the salutation at the time was militant or militant.  And I'm not going to read all of the contents of the letter.  But essentially, he's asking the MRND chairman at the level of the commune, which would include you, Mr. Witness, to help assist in the preparation of the rally that would be upcoming on Sunday the 13th of November 1992.  

And he says:  "Dear Militant, I urge you to convene meetings and display the press releases of the attached to this letter across the commune so that the MRND militants can take the necessary steps to be ready on that day", of course referring to the 15th of November 1992.  And this letter is copied to "Interahamwe president in the communes (all of Ruhengeri)."

If you'd like to see it, I can have it displayed to you.  But this is a letter from the president -- 
A.	It's not necessary, Counsel.  I know that letter.  Counsel, it is true that that letter was written.  It's a letter of a general nature.  You see that it was copied to the president of the party in Mukingo.  I told you that that was the idea of setting up the youth wing of party during the national congress.  Where it was possible, these committees were set up.  So when this letter was being written, it was copied to all the interested party.  But in the Mukingo commune, we could not have done what we did not need.  I told you that we did not need to set up Interahamwe committees.  Otherwise, I know that this letter exists.  And I think Bizimungu explained it during his trial.  

You asked me a question at some point in time to know if there were Interahamwes in this or that commune of Ruhengeri and I told you I did not know.  Maybe there were people who set up these 
youth wings in relation to their needs.  What I know is that at that time in our commune, in 
Nkuli commune, we did not set up the Interahamwe committees in those two communes.  Thank you, Counsel. 
Q.	All right.  Well, I thank you for your response.  It's good to know that you actually were aware of this letter and that you don't dispute its contents.  But for your information, I'll just let you know, 
	Mr. Witness, I don't think Casimir Bizimungu talked about this letter in his trial because we received this letter in the Office of the Prosecutor only within the last several months and Mr. Bizimungu's trial had already finished.  

I'd also like to suggest to you that we have other letters that take the same form, that are signed by Karoli Hategekimana under -- you know, for Casimir Bizimungu, which are dated prior to April of 1992.  Routine letters going out.  And in those letters they are not copied to the Interahamwe presidents at the level of the secteurs.  And I can bring one in and show it to you on Monday.  

So what I'm suggesting to you is that the reason that this letter is copied to Interahamwe presidents at the level of the secteurs is because after April of 1992, all throughout Rwanda, MRND presidents, such as yourself, at the level of the commune, were mandated to create Interahamwe in your home communes and you did that.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  Michel wrote this letter on the instructions of Bizimungu and he copied the president of the MRND at the commune level and not at the secteur level.  But, you see, I don't know if you have that letter.  

There's a letter in which reference was made to newspapers and that was a rally that the president of the republic was going to attend.  Maybe Michel was aware of the presence of the Interahamwe here and there, but that is for him to say.  Thank you, Counsel.  
Q.	You testified earlier, in direct examination, that you did not know of incidents where Interahamwe from Mukingo committed acts of violence against other opposition political parties.  And I'd like you to refer to another exhibit that we have in this trial.  It's identified as P. 371.  It's a letter that was written by the sous-préfet, Gaetan Kayitana, who was the interim bourgmestre in Nyakinama.  It was addressed to the préfet of Ruhengeri on the 18th of January 1993.  And he's forwarding a report on meetings that were held in his commune during the preceding year.  And on the last page of the report that he's forwarding, there's an entry that he makes.  And I'm going to read it now.  It's paragraph 5.  And he's addressing -- he's providing information about the PSD.  

And he says in this report:  "The PSD held a meeting in Kabare commune on the 
	11th of October 1992."  And then he provides the information as follows:  "No conflicts between 
	political parties and no speech delivered that could have been the origin of conflicts, except a group of people from Mukingo commune in Interahamwe attire who came to threaten MND party leaders in Kabare 1 and Gitabura secteurs on the 27th of September 1992 during the day and the 
	prosecutor's office is handling the case."   

So what I'd like to ask you, Mr. Witness, is wouldn't a report like this being forwarded to the préfet by the sous-préfet in relation to meetings being held throughout the préfecture in the various communes, wouldn't this suggest to you that persons who were referring to themselves as Interahamwe, or styling themselves as Interahamwe, were committing acts of political violence against other 
opposition parties -- parties that were opposed to the MRND?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  When I answered questions put to me by counsel for the Defence, I asked -- I said that that was not true.  You are relying on a report written by a sous-préfet.  But I think you should, first of all, determine if this report was transmitted within the MRND.  And I'm saying that, personally, I'm not aware of this incident.  But I should -- I need to be cautious about this because the préfet is a human being and he can -- he's free to choose the materials he pleases to inform members about this incident.  But I did not receive a copy of that letter.  But he informed other members -- other presidents of the MRND so that we could monitor this incident.  

And I'm telling you that if I were informed, I certainly would have requested the authorities to examine that because we had the intention of establishing the Interahamwe and they should be above reproach.  And you'll understand that in this particular case we would have taken the appropriate measures. 
Q.	All right.  Well, Mr. Witness, I'm going to show you another exhibit.  It's the first time that we're looking at this in this trial.  It's document number 6 in my bundle.  You know the names of the following individuals; don't you?  Donet Murego; Shingiro Mbonyumutwa; Karamira, Froduald; 
	Nsabimana, Alexis.  You'd agree with me that these are all leaders of the MDR party; right?  Nationally, back in 1992.  
A.	It was not my party and I cannot confirm what you are saying totally. 
Q.	So your answer is that you don't recognise those names as being leaders or members of the 
	MDR party back in 1992?  Names that -- 
A.	I was not under any obligation to know the leaders of that party.  But I would say that I would know Murego and I got to know Karamira recently when he was executed.  But, briefly, I do not know these persons whose names you have mentioned.
Q.	Okay.  Well the point is that you've heard of them.  And what I would suggest to you is that these were national leaders of the MDR party, one of the opposition parties in 1992.  And back on the 
	16th of March 1992, they held a press conference in Brussels based on information that was supplied to Alexis Nsabimana in Brussels but the information was coming from these national leaders in Rwanda.  

And at page 3 of the document that was distributed, they provide the following information, Mr. Witness.  And I'm going to read it in French.  It's a document that we only have in French.  I'll start now.  

"The last few months have been characterised by extensive insecurity.  Residences of political leaders were regularly attacked by armed groups with grenades and guns.  Soldiers in uniform carried out attacks and thefts.  The MRND militia (the MRND) carried out excessive -- violent acts, particularly in Rubavu, Karago, Satinsyi, Nkuli, Mukingo, Kigombe communes."   

But the point I'm making to you, Mr. Witness, is as far back as March of 1992, information was being spread not only in Rwanda but internationally, coming from the MDR party, complaining about attacks on them in Mukingo and Nkuli by the MRND militia, which they characterised as the Interahamwe in Ruhengeri.  How do you respond to that?  
A.	Counsel, I'm not going to dwell on that.  At the time MRND was using all possible means to drag the name of the MRND into the mud.  If this information -- if these acts were true, they would have mentioned the names of the persons who carried out the attacks in the Mukingo commune.  Thank you.
Q.	Well, Witness, I notice the time and I believe we have to break at this point.  But I'd ask -- suggest to the Chamber that this is an appropriate time to break.  But we'll come back to this exhibit and continue with your cross-examination on Monday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, we have to take our adjournment now and we will resume on Monday -- Monday morning, at the usual time.  

I should inform you that during this, or any adjournment while you are still a witness, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  You may leave now.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
In terms of the calendar.  We had more or less -- we can more or less indicate, we will also issue a formal order, that we are inclined to accept the proposal to start on the 18th of January and then sit through to approximately -- I think it's the 16th of March.  As presently advised, we are still computing on the basis of the same kind of schedule as we have during this trial session.  Okay.  So we can take our adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1232H)
