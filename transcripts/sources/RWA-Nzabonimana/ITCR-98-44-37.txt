         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

         3        Interpreter, could you please tell Witness RHU30 that 

         4        the Trial Chamber reminds him of the solemn declaration 

         5        he made yesterday, and that he will continue with his 

         6        evidence today on that same solemn declaration.  

         7        

         8        Okay.  Yes, Mr. Fleming, you may continue your 

         9        cross-examination, but yesterday when we adjourned, we 

        10        were in closed session.  I don't know whether you still 

        11        need to address issues in closed session. 

        12   MR. FLEMING: Yes, Your Honour.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  All right.  In that case we'll go into 

        14        closed session to enable counsel to raise questions, 

        15        even those which have a bearing on the identity of the 

        16        witness.  Registry, can you see to it that that is done.

        17   MR. KIYEYEU: We are going to do so, My Lord.  Just a few 

        18        minutes.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  And, Interpreter, while this is being 

        20        done, can you tell Witness RHU30 that we are going in 

        21        closed session and that he can feel free to mention 

        22        names of people and places, even those which have a 

        23        bearing on his identity as the public is excluded.

        24        Okay.  Right. 

        25   MR. KIYEYEU: We are now ready, My Lord.

         1         (Witness RHU31 sworn in Kinyarwanda)

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  Witness RHU31, you have just made a 

         3        solemn declaration.  In case you are not familiar as to 

         4        how your evidence would be taken here, we'll explain a 

         5        few essential things to you before you begin your 

         6        testimony.  

         7        

         8        You will be led in your evidence-in-chief by the 

         9        Defence, who are seated on this side of the courtroom.  

        10        Thereafter, questions will be put to you in 

        11        cross-examination by the Prosecution, who are seated on 

        12        this side of the courtroom.  The Judges sitting in front 

        13        of you may also put questions to you to clarify your 

        14        evidence, if they will have such questions to ask you.  

        15        If a question put to you is not clear or you do not 

        16        understand it, please say so, and such a question shall 

        17        be repeated or explained.  Yes, these are the few 

        18        essential things we want to bring to your attention 

        19        before you begin your evidence.  

        20        

        21        Yes, Professor Hinds, please.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

         1   A.   As for my illness, I feel more or less okay.

         2   Q.   And, Witness, we are now in open session and anything 

         3        that you say which may reveal your identity will be 

         4        heard.  So, if you need to conceal your identity based 

         5        upon any question I may put to you, you should raise 

         6        your hand and the President of the Chamber will advise 

         7        you on how to proceed.  Do you understand that?

         8   A.   It's okay.

         9   Q.   Witness, I am going to show you a document and I'd like 

        10        you to look at the information on it, if is accurate; I 

        11        want you to sign and date it and then return it to me.

        12   A.   Okay, Counsel.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, we would like to tender this 

        15        document as Defendant's Exhibit 25.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Any objection? 

        17   MR. FLEMING: No objection.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: No objection.  Yes.  But the witness, has he 

        19        said something about the contents of that document?  Not 

        20        yet. 

        21   PROFESSOR HINDS: No, I asked him to examine the document and 

        22        if the contents are accurate, he should sign and date 

        23        it.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.  Okay.  Yes.

        25   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, I am going to ask the witness 

        26        some basic information concerning his background.  And 

        27        so, therefore, we should go into closed session so that 

        28        his answers would not reveal his identity.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, as Counsel is going to deal with 

        30        questions touching on the -- which could touch on the

         2        to enable counsel to raise those questions to the

         6        we do that, I understand that Mr. Kajelijeli's screen is 

         7        totally black.  He can't see nothing on the screen -- on 

         8        his --

         9   MR. PRESIDENT: Can the technician attend to that, please?  

        10        Registry.

        11   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lord, we are going to do so. 

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: There is nothing at all, it isn't a matter 

        13        of reflection or angle of the screen.

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: Even the nearest? 

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: Nothing at all.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: The nearest screen? 

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Both of them are out.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: And the back?  But that would be too far.  At 

        19        the back.

        20   PROFESSOR HINDS: They are working at the back.  The only 

        21        problem is communication between us and --

        22   MR. PRESIDENT: Anyway, what we can do, if it takes time, they 

        23        will make sure we have about 20 minutes, and then we can 

        24        -- during the break, if they cannot do it now.  How long 

        25        has it been so?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, he said we could go forward until the 

        27        break.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Until the break.  Has it just gone off right 

        29        now or it has been like that for some time?

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS: I just notified it.  Yes, since the

         1        beginning of the closed session.

         2   MR. PRESIDENT: All right.  We'll have it fixed then.

         3   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         4   Q.   Witness, you have before you two photographs -- or does 

         5        the witness have the photographs?  I'd like you to look 

         6        at photographs 10 and 11, and tell us whether you 

         7        recognise starting with --

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: Ten and 11?

         9   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, starting with 10. 

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Okay.

        11   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        12   Q.   Do you see photograph number 10?

        13   A.   Yes, Counsel.

        14   Q.   Can you tell us if you can identify that building, and 

        15        if so, what is it?  Do you need to take the photograph 

        16        out of the screen so that you can see it better or out 

        17        of the plastic?

        18   A.   Not necessary.  I have already recognised the building 

        19        on photograph 10.

        20   Q.   And what building is that, sir?

        21   A.   That building, at least, the central part of it, is the 

        22        office of the commune of Mukingo.

        23   Q.   Is this the place that you worked in from 1976 to 1994?

        24   A.   Yes, that is where I worked from 1976 to 1994.

        25   Q.   What offices, sir, were contained in this building?

        26   A.   There were three offices in that building.  There was 

        27        another hall or room in that building, it was an office, 

        28        a store, office for the accountant.

        29   Q.   Could you describe on this or show on this picture where 

        30        the bourgmestre's office was located, which side of the

         1        building?

         2   A.   Yes, I can point it out; namely, where the bourgmestre's 

         3        office was located.

         4   Q.   Yes, can you tell us which side of the building?

         5   A.   When one is at the communal office and when you are 

         6        looking or facing the tarred road, the bourgmestre 

         7        office is on the left of this building.

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: The photograph could be screened, Counsel, 

         9        maybe for the witness to be able to point out to 

        10        everybody. 

        11   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes.  Is it possible to project the picture 

        12        on the --

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes. 

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Okay.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Only that you have to draw the curtains to 

        16        enable the witness to go to the projector.

        17   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   Okay.  Witness, could you remove the photographs 10 and 

        19        11 from the screen or maybe you could be helped by the 

        20        registry to remove those photographs?

        21   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, could you, please, project photograph No. 

        22        10 from exhibit -- Prosecution Exhibit No. 7. 

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Now, Witness, you have to go to the screen there, and 

        25        maybe there is pointer that you can use to describe what 

        26        you were describing before.  Okay, Witness, you now have 

        27        the photograph in front of you.  Can you point out where 

        28        the bourgmestre's office was in 1994?  

        29        

        30        Okay.  And do you know who occupied the office right

         1        where the -- looks like a woman in a tank top, if my 

         2        glasses are holding up.  You see to the left of that 

         3        location, were there offices to the left where the 

         4        person is standing?

         5   MR. PRESIDENT: Maybe before that, Counsel, can you put on the 

         6        record where he has pointed as --

         7   PROFESSOR HINDS: He has pointed -- 

         8   MR. PRESIDENT: The spot he has pointed out as being the 

         9        office of the bourgmestre in 1994.

        10   PROFESSOR HINDS: He is pointing to the right side of the 

        11        building where there are four windows in that structure, 

        12        and he is pointing to the second window to the left.

        13   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        14   PROFESSOR HINDS: Or the third window from the right.

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: Well, the second window from the right, I 

        16        suppose. 

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, second window from the right.  

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.  As being the spot where the office of 

        19        the bourgmestre was in 1994.  So, let the record so 

        20        reflect.  You don't have to come back to that again.  

        21        Go on, Counsel. 

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes. 

        23   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        24   Q.   Witness, to the left of that area, there is someone who 

        25        seems to be standing in a tank top; I thought it look 

        26        like a woman, but maybe not.  Can you tell us if there 

        27        was an office located there?

        28   A.   Yes, I know the one -- the person who occupied that 

        29        office.

        30   Q.   Who occupied that office?  What was that office used

         1        for?

         2   A.   It was the office of the secretariat of the commune.

         3   Q.   And within the commune office, within this building, was 

         4        this the place where meetings were held?  Was it within 

         5        this structure or some other structure?

         6   MR. PRESIDENT: Do you have a specific place where you are 

         7        referring to, Counsel?   

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Well, I want to know from the witness 

         9        whether within this whole structure within the building, 

        10        whether meetings were held in there.  I'm not pointing 

        11        to any place.  Based upon what he tells me, then we'll 

        12        know.

        13   THE WITNESS: There was another venue that was intended for 

        14        that purpose.

        15   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

        16   Q.   Witness, are you saying that there were -- meetings were 

        17        not held in this particular building; is that correct?

        18   A.   Well, that would depend on the number of people who were 

        19        invited to the meeting.

        20   Q.   But can you tell us what size meetings were held in this 

        21        building, and if there was another venue for larger 

        22        meetings, where would that be?

        23   A.   Within that building, there was another large room which 

        24        was used for meetings, but that room cannot be seen on 

        25        this photograph.  What we are seeing are offices, the 

        26        various offices of the building.

        27   Q.   Now, is there -- and can you see the entrance to the 

        28        building from this photograph?

        29   A.   No, this photograph does not show the entrance to the 

        30        building.

         1   Q.   Would the entrance be to the left or the right of this 

         2        photograph?

         3   A.   It's here.

         4   Q.   To the left? 

         5   PROFESSOR HINDS: Indicating that the witness is pointing to 

         6        the left, extreme left of the picture. 

         7   BY PROFESSOR HINDS:

         8   Q.   Now, Witness, in 1994, in April of 1994, who was the 

         9        bourgmestre who occupied the office that you earlier 

        10        pointed out?

        11   A.   It was a certain Harerimana, Emmanuel.  Harerimana is 

        12        spelt, H-A-R-E-R-I-M-A-N-A.

        13   Q.   And in April of 1994, did this building look as it looks 

        14        now?

        15   A.   Yes, it was the same building right up till today, but 

        16        just that we can't see the entire building on this 

        17        photograph.

         2   Q.   And in April of 1994, did this building look as it looks 

         3        now?  

         4        Yes, it was the same building right up to today but  it 

         5        is just that we can't see the entire building on this  

         6        photograph.

         7   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS: Your Honour, can we have the witness, 

         9        project No. 11 from Exhibit 7, Prosecution exhibit 7?  

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel, we plan to take a break at 11:00.  

        11        So, you may plan your questions in such a way to see 

        12        which is the most convenient place --

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: How much time we do still have?

        14   MR. PRESIDENT: We still have about three or four minutes.

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS:  Okay, that is the set up.

        16   MR. PRESIDENT: Picture No. 11.

        17   PROFESSOR HINDS:

        18   Q.   Witness, do you recognise this picture?

        19   A.   Yes. 

        20   Q.   And what is this picture?  And can you describe what --

        21   THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: Did witness answer?  

        22   MR. PRESIDENT:  We are waiting for the translation, Witness. 

        23   THE WITNESS: This photograph is the building of the communal 

        24        office.  There is also a courtyard, you can see the 

        25        courtyard that is around the courtyard.  There is  

        26        another building which at the time was known as CCDFD.  

        27   Q.   Witness, can you point out the communal building with 

        28        your pointer?  And that is the structure to the right as 

        29        indicated on this photograph.  Can you point out the 

        30        entrance to this which you call the communal building?

         1        That's the entrance.

         2   A.   The picture is your not clear.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, counsel.

         4   PROFESSOR HINDS: Witness is pointing to the area, Witness 

         5        where you are pointing, that area where the entrance is 

         6        a located.

         7   A.   Yes. 

         8   Q.   Okay and can you point that area again so that I can try 

         9        to describe it?  Okay almost in front of the person with 

        10        the ambulance in the photograph.  Can -- could you 

        11        remove the pointer?

        12   MR. PRESIDENT: Counsel he started from below and then he went 

        13        up.  Is that the -- the whole thing is what the  

        14        entrance or what?

        15   PROFESSOR HINDS: I think the witness is pointing to the area 

        16        where the entrance is located in the building and it is 

        17        approximately in line with the person with the umbrella.  

        18        That is what I am trying to locate it.

        19   MR. PRESIDENT: You can't see it there are many people, there 

        20        is simply a lot of people in front of that building 

        21        and --

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS; but it's in the location of the ambulance 

        23        that is the closed, I can get the person with the 

        24        ambulance.

        25   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, but it is not distinct.

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, I think that given -- the photograph 

        27        has given the general direction of the entrance without 

        28        any particularity.

        29   MR. PRESIDENT:  The entrance itself is visible on this 

        30        picture.

         2        take break before we go on the next structure.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: We will take a break and come back at 11:20 to

         9   MR. KIYEYEU: Yes, My Lords, Kajelijeli's screens are working 

        10        perfectly.  The problem was that if they step on the 

        11        wires -- if they can avoid stepping on the wires.  Thank 

        12        you, My Lords.

        13   PROFESSOR HINDS: Thank you, Your Honour.

        15   Q.   Can the witness go back to the overhead projector 

        16        please?  I think, now we have -- with the help of 

        17        Mr. Fleming, zeroed and projected.  We have zeroed and  

        18        projected one of the two buildings and I would now like 

        19        to ask witness whether he can point out where entrance 

        20        to the building is located?  Your Honour, it looks like 

        21        it 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5th.  I don't know how we describe 

        22        that?  It seems either looks like a window or some sort 

        23        or brick in the main swing?

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: It is in there -- can we just say the spot on 

        25        building just -- can we make use of the umbrella again?

        26   PROFESSOR HINDS: Just what I thought, it is back to the 

        27        umbrella.

        28   MR. PRESIDENT: Just over the -- that is the entire umbrella 

        29        this covered by the pointing instrument.

        30   PROFESSOR HINDS:  The entrance is located somewhat in the

         1        front of the person with the umbrella or behind the  

         2        person with the umbrella.

         3   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, general by that is the direction.  I 

         4        think  that would be sufficient.  Let the record so 

         5        reflect.  Mr. Fleming, are you with us and the 

         6        Prosecution team?  We are trying to put the general 

         7        direction of the entrance to the building.

         8   PROFESSOR HINDS:  If they have any other recommendations, we 

         9        will accept that.

        10   MR. PRESIDENT: Can you state what you have just meant, 

        11        counsel, the comments you have just made counsel?

        12   PROFESSOR HINDS: Yes, what I have said is that witness is 

        13        pointing to an area either just in the back or in front 

        14        of the person with the umbrella. 

        15   MR. PRESIDENT: On the building.

        16   PROFESSOR HINDS: As to where the entrance of building is 

        17        located.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT:  Okay.

        19   MR. FLEMING: Your Honour, we don't agree with that but we 

        20        agree with the description which our learned friend has 

        21        just given.  We don't necessarily agree with where the 

        22        entrance is.

        23   MR. PRESIDENT: It is with regard to the pointing out being 

        24        made by this witness.  So let the record so reflect.

        26   Q.   Witness, can we now project the two structures, can we 

        27        now project there is another structure to the left, can 

        28        we now look to the total.  I like both structures to be 

        29        shown. Witness what sort of activities take place in the 

        30        building to the left of the commune offices?

         1   A.   In this building, there are training session for members 

         2        of population.

         3   Q.   When you say training sessions for what sort of 

         4        training?

         5   A.   By and large, literal session for people who could read 

         6        or read or literal session, people learned various 

         7        occupations there.

         8   Q.   Now, were you aware of any activities that took place in 

         9        front of the commune building shown in the photograph 

        10        between 1992 and 1994?

        11   A.   The area you can see here is the courtyard of the 

        12        commune.  So no activities were held in the courtyard.

        13   Q.   Between 1992 and 1994, were you aware of any training of 

        14        youth in military arms, military training taking place 

        15        here?

        16   A.   No. I am not aware of any such activities taking place 

        17        there.

        18   Q.   Were you aware of any military training or military of 

        19        youth either there or any other area around the commune 

        20        office between 1992 and 1994?

        21   A.   No, I am not aware of any military training taking place 

        22        in this area.  What I do know is that you had a military 

        23        base at the hill opposite the bureau commune.  It is 

        24        Colline of Ruhehuhe.  Let me spell Ruhehuhe, 

        25        R-U-H-E-H-U-L-E.

        26   Q.   Witness, I would like you to look at Exhibit 60 of 

        27        Prosecutor's Exhibit 7, and could we project that on to 

        28        the screen also?  Witness, you have before you what has 

        29        been described as Prosecution Exhibit 7, photograph 60 

        30        in that exhibit.  What is that structure before us, not

         1        the car?

         2   A.   I can see the tarred road on the photograph.  I can also 

         3        see Ruhehuhe that I have just mentioned.  On to this 

         4        photograph, I can also see a kiosk which is found in 

         5        front of the commune office.  I can also see the 

         6        residence of somebody who goes by the name of Nzabanita.  

         7        Let me spell that name, N-Z-A-B-A-N-I-T-A, Nzabanita. 

         8   Q.   Now, can you point out where this military location was? 

         9   A.   From where the vehicle is parked, one has to go beyond 

        10        the water tower beyond the lower part of the hill.  So 

        11        now the military position is found on top of the hill.

        12   Q.   Can you point to that location on top of the hill where 

        13        you say the military location was?  Pointing to the top 

        14        of hill, I would take the Court's direction in terms of 

        15        the location, but I say one third from the left of the 

        16        whole structure of the hill, one third of the hill, one 

        17        third of the distance.

        18   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes, about that, the witness points at the top 

        19        of the hill, one third from the left as being the place 

        20        where military establishment was located.  Yes, that's 

        21        about it.  So let the record so reflect.

        22   PROFESSOR HINDS: The witness can take a seat now.  I don't 

        23        think I can go to be with the photograph for a while.

        24   MR. PRESIDENT: Yes.

        25   BY PROFESSOR HINDS: 

        26   Q.   Witness, do you know a place called Esimbi house?

        15   Q.   Do you know whether or not there any other activities 

        16        that took place in that house in the time being?

        17   A.   No, I don't know any other activities which took place 

        18        in this house apart from the business that I have 

        19        indicated earlier on.  There was a pharmacy and I do not 

        20        know any other activities that took place there.

        21   Q.   Between 1992 and 1994, did you see any military 

        22        training, military training of the Interahamwe youth in 

        23        front of this Esimbi house?

        24   A.   You have put the question relating to the activities, I 

        25        would have seen in this area and I have answered by 

        26        saying this housed a pharmacy.  If there were other 

        27        activities taking place there, I could have told you.

        29        and I am asking whether or not during the period between 

        30        1993 and 1994 whether you saw any training of youth,

         1        military training take place outside that house Esimbi?

         2   A.   No.

         3   Q.   Sir, when did you first learn of the crash of the 

         4        president's plane?

         5   A.   I learned about this news on the 7th in the morning.

         6   Q.   And where were you when you heard of the news of the 

         7        president's plane crash?

         8   A.   I was at my place of residence.

         9   Q.   And around what time was that?

        10   A.   After waking up around 6:00 in the morning, I heard 

        11        people using the path in front of my house, they were 

        12        talking about the crash, so I heard the news from 

        13        passers by.

        14   Q.   When you learned about the crash of the president's 

        15        plane, how did you feel on hearing of that news?

        16   A.   I did not have any particular reaction.  I thought that 

        17        disaster had hit the country because the head of the 

        18        country had died.

        19   Q.   Who were you home with at that time in April of 1994, 

        20        who was home with you, if anyone?

        21   A.   I was at home in the company of members of my family.  

        22        There were no other persons apart from those.

        23   Q.   Now, that morning, did you hear any gunfire or  

        24        explosion from the location where you were at home?

        25   A.   No.

        26   Q.   What did you do after you heard of the news of the death 

        27        of the president?

        28   A.   I didn't do anything special.  I stayed in the house.  

        29        Afterwards, I went to the communal office where I 

        30        normally worked.
