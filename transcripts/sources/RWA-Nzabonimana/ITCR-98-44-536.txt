MATTHIEU NGIRUMPATSE,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, good morning.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	How are you doing today?  Were you able to rest over the weekend? 
A.	Not really.  I was working.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, we are going to continue.  As you know, on Friday morning we stopped the proceedings -- or we stopped at a point where we were talking about the constitution and the Interahamwe za MRND movement.  Perhaps we could -- you could start by telling us who, to your knowledge, was in charge of that movement and under whose authority the young people of the MRND fell.  
A.	The young people of the MRND had an autonomous organisation.  They had their national committee -- a provisional national committee because they intended to meet young people and elect a permanent committee, prepare their constitution -- or draft their constitution, and ask for an affiliation or integration within the party.  So they were autonomous.  
Q.	To your knowledge, who were members of the national provisional committee?  And was the composition of that committee based on ethnicity? 
A.	To my knowledge, no.  The president, Robert Kajuga, was Tutsi.  I had thought he was of mixed ethnicity, but following further reliable information, I realised that he was Tutsi.  

There was another Tutsi, I believe his name was Kanimba.  There were people from the south and also from the north.  There were people who had marital or links -- family links with the Tutsi.  I pointed this out on Friday.  Many of them lost members of their extended families as a result of these marriage alliances.  In fact, on both sides people lost members of their extended families.  
Q.	Beyond the composition of the national provisional committee, the youth movement itself, were the young people recruited on the basis of ethnicity? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness -- Witness G testified before this Court that, while initially the 
Interahamwe youth movement was comprised of people from various ethnic backgrounds, from 1992 the participation of Tutsis in that movement changed because they went to register with the 
PL youth movement.  Do you have any comments on that? 
A.	I am not aware of that phenomenon.  As you know, Witness G told so many stories that it is very difficult to believe what he says.  I will take this opportunity to state that he is the same witness who created and spread rumours about regionalism within that youth movement.  I would not like to believe what he says.  Perhaps some people went to register with the PL party youth movement, but this was not a widespread phenomenon.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, those who initiated the Interahamwe za MRND movement, were they answerable to you?  Did they report to you? 
A.	No.  As I said on Friday, I did not participate in creating that movement.  I became aware of its creation later on.  Perhaps, two months after its creation -- between one or two months after their inception, but I was not one of those who created the movement.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, to your knowledge, did they -- or did they come under the control of other supervisory organs of the MRND? 
A.	No.  There is something I would like to explain to the Bench.  When you have a political party and when there are young people interested in that party, you have to encourage them.  And that is all we did.  There is no political party anywhere in the world which doesn't have young people.  If that is the case, the party will disappear after one generation.  

You cannot talk of a party without young people because, when you create a political party, you would think in the long term.  You are not thinking of one or two years or an electoral campaign.  You think of a party of an indefinite duration.  This is part of the democratic struggle -- part of the political struggle.  That is all.  But, otherwise, those young people did not obey instructions from any institutional organ of the MRND.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, even -- even before you considered your relations with the youth wing of the MRND at the national level, did you, in any manner whatsoever, participate in the creation of that youth movement when you were -- when you had some duty -- when you had some authority at the préfectoral level, at the level of the préfectoral committee of the MRND in Kigali town? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Did you attend meetings during which the organisation of the MRND youth movement was set up in Kigali? 
A.	No.  What I can say is that they came to tell me that they were existing -- that they had created a movement, and it stopped there.  That's all.  I was informed of their existence, yes.  
Q.	In any manner whatsoever, were you their coordinator? 
A.	Not at all.  
Q.	Were you their sponsor, promoter at national level -- or at the level of the préfectures? 
A.	No.  At national level and in the préfectures, they didn't have any structure.  The only structure or organ they had within the country was their organ in Gisenyi.  I was not the one who created it.  It was the national provisional committee of the Interahamwe which went to Gisenyi, at least some of them, and they set up that organ there.  There is no member of the bureau of the party who was involved in the creation of that organ of the Interahamwe in Gisenyi.  
Q.	Were you their mentor -- their protector, as it were? 
A.	I do not understand what you mean by "protector".  All citizens are under the protection of the state.  In speeches, of course, because they were persecuted, I defended them.  But as to protection, as such, I did not have any power to protect them.  The forces that are in charge of the protection are the forces of law and order.  It is the forces of law and order who were in charge of that aspect of national life in Rwanda.  
Q.	Did they report to you? 
A.	No.  Moreover, I do not see what they would have been reporting to me on.  As a member of the -- as members of the party, they followed the directives of the party, but there was never any instruction or any directive. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, the Prosecution has often stated that committees of the national provisional committee used as their address the address of the MRND headquarters.  
What are your comments on that point?  Can you tell the Court whether, depending on those circumstances, you had some authority or some control over the decisions they took. 
A.	No.  That argument is not sufficient.  First of all, they did not consult anyone.  They said they were members of the party and that they could use the postal address of the party.  That did not mean that we read their mail.  When they came to collect their mail, we gave them their mail.  And any member of the party may have asked -- or may have even told their -- the person, who they were corresponding with, to send their letter through to our mailbox.  That did not mean that we checked or vetted the mail that was put in that mailbox.  

I, therefore, think that this is -- this argument is insufficient to establish any authority of the party over them.  
Q.	Were you the one who wrote the correspondences or the communiqués written by the 
provisional national committee? 
A.	No.  And that, for several reasons, first of all, I did not have time to do that because, be it when I was national secretary -- or at the time when I was national chairman, I was so occupied.  I was so busy.  

Secondly, there were great intellectuals in that movement who had been to university, who had written theses and who were, therefore, capable of drafting their correspondence without my assistance.  
Q.	Did they, nevertheless, show you their correspondence for your opinion -- or for your approval? 
A.	No.  It could only happen that a member would ask me whether, if he did this or that thing, it would not be against the party.  Because they were members of the party, they could do that, but they did that on very, very rare occasions.  They would do that when their action could lead to disorder or hurt the party, they could ask our opinion.  

But that was the case also of any other member of the party.  Any member of the party could ask us whether the interests of the party would not be undermined by what they intended to do.  Otherwise, if they wanted to demonstrate, it was not the party who gave the green light.  It was the préfet.  They would contact the préfet for the organisation of their demonstrations.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you ever receive members of the provisional committee -- or did you ever receive young Interahamwe members in your office, be it your ministerial office or some other office? 
A.	In the ministry, no, never.  On the contrary, as the national secretariat of the party, I believe that was possible.  When someone had a problem, they would -- could come and consult me or ask for assistance, yes, but that was not only the case of young people.  Even people of the 
national committee -- members of the national committee or ordinary citizens could consult me.  

When I was national secretary, they could seek my opinion.  Otherwise, I never made confusion between matters of the party and matters of the ministry of justice.  These were matters that were entirely different and separate.  
Q.	Did you ever receive them in your law practice? 
A.	Once or twice they wanted to talk to me about a problem -- perhaps we may deal with that later on.  
Q.	Did you ever receive them in your residence? 
A.	Never.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, is it true that you signed membership cards for the Interahamwe as one of the Prosecution witnesses testified before this Court? 
A.	Never.  Membership cards for the young people were signed by the chairman of the 
national provisional committee, Robert Kajuga.  I was not the one who signed those cards.  Even membership cards for party members were not signed by me.  And, if that be the case, how could I have been signing membership cards for young people who were members of an autonomous movement? 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, the young Interahamwe youth movement, was it kind of appropriated after its creation?  Was it appropriated by the MRND, as the Prosecution alleges? 
A.	Mr. President, you appropriate a movement to yourself to do something with it.  I am saying that these young people were already members of the party.  There was no reason to appropriate them -- to do what with them?  They were members of the party.  So, in my opinion, that was sufficient.  There was no reason to appropriate them to ourselves; otherwise, to do what with them?  So my answer is no.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, with time, did the objectives of the Interahamwe za MRND evolve?  In what direction?  In a positive or a negative direction? 
A.	People always evolve in their political thinking, and depending on the circumstances, people always evolve.  But I believe that their fundamental objectives remained unchanged.  They did not change their objectives or goals, nor their conduct.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, just like we did in -- regarding another matter we discussed earlier, I would now like, in light of what you told the Court, to review with you statements that some Prosecution witnesses made.  And you will tell us whether you agree with those statements, whether you refute them.  Your answer will depend on every question.  You will see whether you have to refute the statements in detail or whether you have to refute them briefly.  You will -- your answer will depend on the question.  
You will -- you will determine whether you should answer with a simple yes or no, as Mr. Webster sometimes likes to hear you say.  

Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness G, UB, AWD, the idea of creating an MRND youth movement came from the central committee of the MRND, and that was around the month of November 1991.  What is -- what do you say to that? 
A.	That is wrong.  The sponsors -- the real sponsors of that movement themselves do not admit that.  That idea -- the idea of creating the movement did not come from the central committee of the MRND.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness GOB claims that when the party decided to create a youth section, it was to counter insults emanating from other opposition political parties, and, according to that witness, you were the one who coordinated that action.  
A.	I would simply say that is ridiculous.  It's ridiculous when the sponsors of a youth movement say the circumstances under which they created the movement we should believe them.  We should not believe a witness coming from Kigali who tries to save his skin, because we do not often take into consideration this element of fear which characterises witnesses coming from Rwanda.  So his allegation is false.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness GOB holds that, during the discussions leading up to those decisions, it was decided that the experiment would be initiated with children of MRND, current and past members, including, for example, the children of the chairman, or the children of Aloys Simba or your own children.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  Those who informed me of the existence of the movement were members of the provisional transitional bureau.  So I do not know how this movement came into creation, and those allegations are false.  
Q.	According to the same witness, some money was given to the youth, and they were assigned to silence the youth of other political parties who had been insulting the president or threatening MRND members.  Are you aware of any such facts? 
A.	Nothing could be further from the truth.  Up until 1993, the youth of other opposition parties continued to insult the president.  I, therefore, do not know how or what he meant by silencing them.  
Q.	Another witness talked of a meeting allegedly held in September 1994 -- 1991, rather, at the préfectoral level at which you, yourself, declared that the mission to silence youth of other parties had been fully accomplished and that the time had come to move on to see how the youth could extend or expand their activities to areas surrounding Kigali and increase their numbers.  
A.	Did you say 1991?  
Q.	Yes, that was the witness's testimony.  
A.	By 1991, nothing had been achieved.  It is generally accepted that the movement was created in November.  So I could not have said that a mission had been accomplished in 1991; whereas, they were barely beginning to come together in November 1991.  Therefore, that allegation is false.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, in 1991-1992, at that time, did you know one Ahmed Napoléon Mbonyunkiza?  Spelt M-B-O-N-Y-U-N-K-I-Z-A.  
A.	No.  Maybe he knew me, but I did not know him.  
MR. WEYL:
Napoléon, for the purposes of the transcript is spelt...
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In fact, Napoléon claims that he was appointed on 19 December '91 and 5 January 1992 to the position of chairman of the JMRND in PVK and as a member of the MRND Nyarugenge communal committee.  Does that ring a bell? 
A.	No.  The simple reason is that as chairman of the MRND in Kigali and minister of justice, those are issues that occurred at levels which I could not be aware of.  So I am not aware of it.  I did not know that category of person. 
MR. WEYL:
Before I proceed to the next question, Mr. President, I would like to ask Mr. Issa to assist us.  It is freezing in here.  There is an air-conditioning problem, and I am having difficulty proceeding under such freezing conditions.  I am sorry to have to give priority to my comfort at this point, but it is a little bit difficult for me to proceed.  

I thank you, Mr. Issa.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, Napoléon testified that he submitted his resignation letter to you on the 9th of June 1992 while you were the national secretary of the MRND.  And the document is in evidence under Exhibit number P. 4, tendered by the Prosecutor.  

Question:  Did you receive a resignation letter in June 1992 or at any other date from Napoléon Mbonyunkiza?  
A.	No.  I do not remember signing or acknowledging receipt of any such letter.  You see, when such a letter is submitted, an acknowledgement of receipt is issued either from the secretariat or from the person to whom the letter was addressed.  I have no recollection of such a letter.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witnesses GOB, G, T, Napoléon and AWE, together, all asserted that you attended the first meeting at which the Interahamwe za MRND were created. 
A.	That is false.  I have already specified that I attended a meeting at which they came to introduce themselves to the party in Kigali-ville préfecture after the election of their national provisional committee.  I wished them well and success in their organisation, which was to be structured.  And that was it.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness T testified that between November 1991 and April 1992, all Wednesday meetings holding at Mr. Rubangura's house -- R-U-B-A-N-G-U-R-A -- were attended by you on a regular basis in that he actually saw you.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I am not surprised because all the meetings were held at that location.  Even party meetings were held at that location.  So I would not be surprised that he saw me at party meetings there.  But to claim that I attended Interahamwe meetings exclusively would be incorrect.  All party meetings were held at that location. 
Q.	Did you attend all the Wednesday meetings as he alleges, the purpose of which was to create, organise and structure the Interahamwe za MRND youth wing? 
A.	No.  It was impossible, by the way, to attend such meetings every Wednesday.  You see, particularly as I was minister of justice, and cabinet meetings were held on Wednesday at the time.  It, therefore, was not possible for me to leave the council of ministers's meeting to attend that kind of meeting.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness Mbonyunkiza testified that you chaired all those weekly meetings, and that you convened the ten members of the national provisional council of the Interahamwe to those meetings.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is a false accusation simply because that -- that gentleman was not a member of the 
provisional committee.  So how does he know about that?  Was he one of the invitees?  This is a pure fabrication, and coming from Napoléon, that does not surprise me.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness HH testified that the first time he attended one of those meetings for the creation of the Interahamwe at Védaste Rubangura's house, at Technoserve, you were allegedly present and you introduced the members of the Interahamwe organisation to those in attendance.  
Is that correct? 
A.	No.  That is incorrect.  When those youth were setting up their organisation, they did not do so in the premises of the party.  They came to introduce themselves to the party well after the movement had been created.  So to claim that the movement was created within the premises of the party would be incorrect.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness AWE held -- or holds that the constituent meeting of the Interahamwe took place at Védaste's home between 1992 and 1993, and that on that occasion you allegedly took the floor.  What is your reaction to that? 
A.	That is false.  I have the same answer to this question as to previous questions.  This movement was not created in the party premises at Rubangura's house.  By the time I met these youth, they already had a national provisional committee in place.  So that allegation is false.  
Q.	The witness goes on to mention that you allegedly stated that, the enemy of Rwanda was the Inkotanyi who had attacked the country and that people had to be vigilant and watch out for what Tutsis were doing; and that whenever someone talked about the Inkotanyi on the -- or the Inyenzi, those in attendance -- or those listening to those words, did not distinguish them from Tutsis.  

Did you, at any time whatsoever, during a constituent assembly meeting of the MRND za -- the Interahamwe za MRND youth, did you make any such statement? 
A.	No.  I think it was on Friday -- well, I've been testifying for a number of days now, and I don't remember which day it was, but I testified that I mentioned the name Tutsi on the 15th of November 1991 at a rally in Nyamirambo, and I told you the circumstances in which I mentioned that word.  

Now, for any other consideration, you can look into my speeches, everything that I have written.  You would not see any mention of it.  So that is incorrect.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness Mbonyunkiza testified that, after a first meeting held in February 1992, you allegedly chaired a second meeting in February or March 1992.  Is that true or false? 
A.	False.  
Q.	You allegedly said that the Inkotanyi and members of the opposition were continuing to provoke the MRND; true or false? 
A.	That amounts to calumny. 
Q.	That the Interahamwe were to chase and kill the enemy, namely, the Tutsi as well as members of the opposition.  
A.	Mr. President, I don't know whether this witness was truly aware of what he was testifying to before the Trial Chamber.  When you talk about eliminating members of the opposition, what are you really talking about?  One of my elder brothers was a member of the MDR.  Was I going to kill members of my own family, to take that as an example?  

So when one talks about members of the opposition, I would like to say that, within the same family, it was possible to see half of the members in one party and the other half in another.  So I think that this was an exaggeration by this witness in an effort to make himself credible.  But such a thing, I must say, never existed.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, the witness testified that you are the one who gave the name Interahamwe to the organisation during that meeting.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is false.  It is false, indeed, because by the time I became aware of the existence of that movement, they were already bearing that name.  I am not the one who gave them that name.  
Q.	The witness went on to say that, during the meeting, you presented weapons and machetes and hoes to those in attendance.  
A.	Oh, now I can remember.  I now see when he testified that the -- those in attendance were asked to test the weapons or to test the machetes and see if they would cut properly.  Well, I don't know, but I -- I must admire the courage of those who listened to these things to the very end. 

You see, what he has testified to is testimony that can only come out -- or that -- or that can only relate to what a mad man did.  And to this day, I don't think I am mad yet.  I cannot take hoes and axes to a public meeting and declare there that they were supposed to be used to kill Tutsis.  

I have already testified that if I had made any such statement, I would have been dismissed from the party the very next day.  I would have been dismissed from the government the very next day, because you may want to know that the prime minister, Sylvestre Nsanzimana, and the president would never have tolerated any such activity.  

So I am surprised -- I am surprised that it is only that witness, Napoléon, who narrates such a story coming out of Kigali and -- relating to all types of meetings and rallies.  I am rather surprised that he would be the only one to make that kind of accusation.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, to make your testimony absolutely clear, when you say that you are surprised that he is the only witness, are you saying that there may be other witnesses who could testify to the same facts? 
A.	No.  What I am saying actually is that, if his testimony were true, it would at least have been corroborated by one or other witnesses.  No other witness has ever made such an allegation relating to bringing weapons to a meeting and declaring that they were to be used to kill Tutsis.  
This actually just beats me.  
Q.	He also stated that you introduced Simon -- Simon Bikindi.  
A.	What was your question, Counsel?  
Q.	The question was:  He stated that you had introduced Simon Bikindi.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is false.  Bikindi was a very well-known musician across the country -- or throughout the country, and to this day, his music is still being played in Rwanda.  And he did not need to be introduced.  The allegation is false.  
Q.	The same witness goes on to testify that Tumbatsembatsemba, that song, was launched at that occasion.  
A.	I never heard that song.  And we did not sing at all meetings or all rallies.  We sang at a number of rallies, and I have already told you which songs we sang at the rallies:  The national anthem at the beginning and the anthem of the party at the end of the rally.  But in meetings held in rooms, such as the one being referred to, there was no singing.  

I chaired political bureau meetings and préfectoral committee meetings for Kigali préfecture when I was still chairman of that préfectoral committee.  In those meetings, we did not sing.  We sat down to serious discussions, and then we broke off.  So we didn't sing.  And that allegation, therefore, is false.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, during the examination of Witness Napoléon Mbonyunkiza, he provided a list of persons whom he alleges to have been present at that meeting.  And he mentioned, among others, the name of Gaspard Munyandinda -- M-U-N-Y-A-N-D-I-N-D-A -- and also stated that you arranged for that person to be assassinated later on or subsequently.  What do you say to that?  And what do you know about that? 
A.	It is absolutely false.  It is, indeed, a ridiculous accusation.  As far as I know, Mr. Gaspard Munyandinda is still alive.  He lives in France.  He has French nationality, and he is still alive.  So this witness simply lied.  And I don't have any much more to say about his testimony.  Munyandinda is alive.  If you wish, you can go to France, and I am sure it would not be difficult to meet him.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Napoléon went on to testify that, in your capacity as chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture, you allegedly organised, encouraged and prepared appointments with the party, with President Habyarimana, for members of the national provisional committee.  What do you know about that? 
A.	Well, I learnt that they had met the president of the republic, but I am not the one who made arrangements for that appointment, and I did not go along with them.  So the statement is incorrect.  It is false.  By the way, I think it is Mr. Murenzi who headed their delegation to meet the president of the republic.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness T, testifying before this Trial Chamber, stated that the Interahamwe were under the supervisory authority of the MRND in general terms and in specific terms under your personal supervisory authority.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is false.  I have said already that these were -- these persons were members of the party, but they were not under a supervisory authority.  The answer I have given you already proves that there was no supervisory authority.  

Those persons, for example, went to see the president of the republic because they wanted the party to have -- the president's party to have a youth wing.  So there was -- and they went on their own.  If there had been any supervisory authority in place, I would have been the one to lead that delegation to the president.  The allegation, therefore, is false.  
Q.	Witness TEG (sic) alleges that they had been asked to invite their friends to join the movement; and then from 1991, to recruit unemployed youth; and then after 1991, the Interahamwe were allegedly invaded by the reservists from the army who had now become Interahamwe members at préfectoral level.  

Are you aware of any such instructions, any such requests, any such facts? 
A.	No.  That is entirely false.  Entirely false.  Now, I cannot say that there were no reservists in any political party to the extent that youth reservists are entitled to join any party of their choice, but that was not something that I spearheaded.  It is a simple natural occurrence that may take place.  

What I did -- what I said is that, when they came to ask to be integrated to the party, I told them that they had not proven themselves sufficiently to be taken as a credible organisation.  So I told them to go into the remote parts of the country to make themselves known, to develop their constitution, to gain recognition under the law of the state, and that at such a point, it would then become possible to have a discussion.  

But so long as they were contained, so to speak, in Kigali and didn't have any national coverage to show that they were supported by other persons, it was not possible for any leader of a political party to endorse or accommodate such an organisation.  

In any event, whatever was said is false.  I particularly stood for membership in my -- in the party to be of people in good standing.  It would not be a good thing to take rogues and bandits into an organisation simply because they wanted to join the organisation.  If one were to do so, managing one's party would then become an impossible assignment.  
Q.	Witness HH testified that Interahamwe meetings were held in one of the halls or rooms of the 
ministry of planning because the minister at the time was of the MRND party.  Were you aware of that fact? 
A.	No.  I was not informed of it.  I was not aware of it.  
Q.	More generally, according to Witness HH, the party was informed of the activities of the Interahamwe movement.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is wrong.  Completely wrong.  
Q.	According to Witness G, the executive committee of the MRND was above every other organ.  It had authority over all matters of the MRND, including the Interahamwe, be it in Kigali or in any other préfecture of Rwanda.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That is wrong.  I believe that statement is totally false, and it also results from ignorance.  The steering committee was only an executive committee.  It did not decide anything without the approval of the political bureau.  If the matter was very serious, you needed the approval of the national committee; and if it was at the national level, it was the congress that gave approval.  

The executive bureau was not a -- a group of dictators.  We -- it was not a group of four people -- 
four dictators who commanded everything.  

Witness G hails from a préfecture that I cannot mention.  I would have liked to know whether, in his préfecture, which was practically in the opposition, he could create an Interahamwe movement there.  He did not dare to do that because, if it was possible to create an Interahamwe movement there, he would have been the one to create it.  But he did not dare to do that.  Therefore, what he is saying is a figment of his imagination.  That was not possible.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness UB testified that, after the creation of the Interahamwe, their numbers increased continuously and that, moreover, they moved from one préfecture to another in the company of MRND members and, in particular, in the company of MRND officials.  What are your comments on that? 
A.	I think his testimony is ambiguous.  If we were in a -- if -- if young people were in a rally inside the country, that would be normal.  But that they moved about with members of the MRND in the préfectures, for what purpose if there was no political event?  So that statement is vague.  It's the result of his imagination.  

You just don't move about without cause.  First of all, it is expensive.  And, in general, it is the members of the party who had the means -- who paid for our trips.  And when the secretariat general had the means, they could hire vehicles to take people to rallies.  But that has nothing to do with what UB said.  It is a fabrication.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness UB, Witness G, Witness HH, and Claeys, the Interahamwes, apart from their role to sensitise the population to the ideals of the MRND, were responsible for ensuring the protection of members of the party.  

Were you aware of that role played by the Interahamwe?  And did you, at any point in time, ask that the Interahamwe protect important people, or did you personally enjoy protection by the Interahamwe? 
A.	Never.  No, never.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness T, the Interahamwe movement became a militia of the party just like the youth wings of the other political parties.  What do you say to that? 
A.	This is a misuse of language.  Even in opposition parties -- even in the other political parties, I am not aware of any youth movement that was a militia.  The definition of a militia is well known.  Anyone could go to the Internet and look for the meaning of the term militia.  You would find a definition of the term militia on the Internet.  

These young people, even in opposition parties, were not armed save for those of the RPF.  For the others -- be it the movements of the MDR, the PL, the Social Democratic Party's youth movements -- they did not have a militia.  This is a misuse of language which the media and some other people tried to engage in to denigrate the MRND in the main, and, from 1993, the opposition parties.  

But I'm not aware of a youth movement in any political party that was a militia.  A militia is something else.  A militia is something organised with commandos who are assigned missions of violence or specific actions.  And these youth movements did not carry -- even when they carried out some excesses, it was not under the instructions of the party.  So we should not exaggerate, or perhaps, we should not -- we -- we should not exaggerate the conflict that existed among the political parties and claim that even political parties had militias.  That is completely false.  

From time to time, they -- they fought one another, but it didn't mean that there was militia.  It was just a matter of intolerance.  But if you follow clearly my speeches, I always prohibited that.  And in the speech I gave in Nyamirambo, I repeated that; namely, that I was very pleased to note that fighting among the youth movements of the political parties had come to an end, and I expressed the wish that that fighting should not resume.  There is a speech in which I said that.  I am going to locate the speech if we have time.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I, nevertheless, have some concern regarding what you have said with respect to protection, protection by the Interahamwe, because I -- I have in mind a Defence witness who came before this Chamber and testified that, at some point in time, you invited him to your office and asked him to take the necessary steps for the purpose of protecting important persons.  

Georges Rutaganda said before this Court that you made -- you requested that of him.  Can you clarify that point. 
A.	That is an -- another matter.  After the murder of Gatabazi, Bucyana, and many others, members of the Interahamwe national committee became very afraid.  They feared that they would be eliminated, so they came to me.  I believe the first time it was Robert -- the president of the Interahamwe who met me, and they asked me how they could protect themselves; that members of the committee were afraid.  

I told him that my role as chairman of the party was not to protect people; that I did not have the resources to protect people.  But I told him that -- that the minister of defence knew him; that he should go and meet the minister of defence and present his problem to him.  

I do not know whether he had consulted others, but the reality is that Rutaganda returned and spoke to me about this problem.  And I told him that that matter was beginning to tire -- wear me out; that I was going to try to organise a meeting between them and the minister of defence and also the 
minister of the interior, who are in charge -- or who were in charge of security.  

When I presented the problem to the two ministers, the minister of defence said, "These people are joking.  I have helped them.  I have given them what they need to defend themselves."  And the meeting ended there and then.  

I never saw the resources or equipment that the minister talked about.  I am not aware of the quantity of the material, but that is the reality.  I helped them to protect themselves, but it was not for the purpose of protecting all militants or members of the MRND.  How could they do that?  As I said the other day, you are not talking about hundreds of members of the party.  You are talking of thousands and millions of people.  So this is a misunderstanding -- or, perhaps, a poor assessment of the events and the facts.  

It was not members of the party -- or important -- or dignitaries of the MRND.  It was members of the provisional committee -- the -- of the Interahamwe.  They had just lost two of their members in the sectors -- or secteurs -- close to Kiga -- Kigali, one in Shyorongi and another one in Kigali town.  

So they became afraid.  They thought they were being targeted by the RPF infiltrators.  It was in that context that I made arrangements for them to meet with the minister of defence.  But as you realise now, this was something that remained -- that was confined -- that remained between them and the minister of defence -- that is, the material organisation of that defence.  

The minister of the interior was not even aware of what had happened.  On that note, we separated, and the matter ended there.  
Q.	At that time, Mr. Ngirumpatse, didn't you have UNAMIR to protect you and also to protect members of the MRND party? 
A.	Mr. President, UNAMIR did not protect members of the MRND.  When the late Joseph Nzirorera was here, he said that he wrote -- and I believe the letter exists.  He wrote to General Dallaire asking for protection because he, Nzirorera, lived close to the parliament where the RPF battalion was based.  

He never received any answer from UNAMIR.  We were never protected by UNAMIR.  UNAMIR protected only -- and I repeat -- only ministers and opposition party leaders.  It never protected MRND officials.  Never.  That is something which is known and which is very serious.  Very serious.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I'm going to go over this exercise again, which I consider fastidious, this denial of various testimonies one after the other, but I think that is the price to be paid for your defence.  Matters should be perfectly clear and the Chamber should be thoroughly informed or enlightened.  

Now, going back to a statement by AWD, the Interahamwe allegedly started defending MRND interests when the Arusha negotiations were ongoing and when it was noticed that the MRND was losing its strength.  At that time, they started attacking the Tutsis because they said that the Tutsis were the enemies of the country.  What do you say to that? 
A.	First of all, I do not see how the Interahamwe could interfere in the negotiations that were taking place in Arusha and at a level which was not accessible to them.  Furthermore, I do not see how -- how if the MRND lost its strength, what advantage they would gain by attacking the Tutsis.  I would think it would be the -- the contrary.  This would have increased the marginalisation of the party.  This would have been an ill-conceived idea.  So AWD should follow what we were saying at the helm of the party, instead of inventing what the Interahamwe supposedly did.  

I have not heard of Tutsis who died because we, of the MRND, were losing strength.  I'm not aware of any such Tutsis.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, UB -- Witness UB, AWD, testified that the Interahamwe were feared, greatly feared, because of their criminal acts and that they protected the interests of the MRND; that they were the propagandists of the party who helped to enlist other members.  Do you have any comments on that? 
A.	Yes, of course I have comments -- or I have something to say on that.  That is wrong because the role of the Interahamwe was not to go and canvass or look for members or militants of the party.  But in their mind, their goal was to usher in a more democratic spirit inside the party and to sensitise the young people to the ideals of the party.  But I do not see in what manner this implied violence.  I do not see that.  So what that witness is saying is wrong.  It's not true.  
Q.	According to Witnesses UB and AWB (sic), you were the one in charge of the Interahamwe.  And you were so in charge in agreement with the national executive bureau of the MRND.  Furthermore, instructions to the Interahamwe came from the office of the secretary general.  What do you say to that? 
A.	Did you say Witness UB? 
Q.	Yes.  UB and AWB (sic).  
A.	I am all the more comfortable that both these witnesses were not members of the Interahamwe.  And I never paid any attention to what they were saying; namely, that instructions came from the office of the secretary general; that the Interahamwe were under the authority of the executive bureau.  These are fabrications.  I think they should say something more meaningful.  

I would like to recall once more that these witnesses were in the custody of the judicial authorities in Kigali for their acts.  UB, AWB (sic) -- in fact, UB was sentenced to death.  His sentence was commuted to a life sentence.  He's still in prison.  And he is the one who has become an international witness, who was talked about in the Gacaca newspaper.  What he says should be taken with a pinch of salt.  The executive bureau had other things to do rather than take care of such problems or matters.  
Q.	But Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness T, Witness G, say more or less the same thing.  For example, Witness T testified that you were always the head of the committee, the head of the Interahamwe movement, and that you were such a head as a -- a principal authority of the party, and that in that capacity, you were the one who gave directives on what had to be done.  You were the one who determined the dates of rallies and so on.  According to that witness, you were the person who was present everywhere who gave instructions and directives to the Inter -- to the Interahamwe.  
A.	Rallies, yes.  That is normal.  And even in that case, that witness should make a distinction between the role of the chairman of the party and the role of the national secretary of the party.  It is not the chairman of party who organises rallies.  It is the secretary general, in general or usually after consultation of course with the steering committee.  The secretary general would not do that alone.  

To say that he received instructions, no.  It happened that sometimes, when I learnt that the secretary general intended to do something -- to tell them that this is not in the interests of the party or that when the Interahamwe wanted to do something, I would tell them, "This is not in the interests of the party."  But if they went ahead, they could be penalised by the party.  

But to say that I gave instructions as to what they wrote, what they thought, what they were going to do is totally false.  They had a president; they had a committee; they had advisers.  It was up to them to do all that work which he attributes to me.  

Furthermore, what I have just said concerning Witness UB and AW -- V -- E also applies to the 
two other witnesses; namely, T and the other witness.  T was being prosecuted.  He also had a terrible disease.  G received too much money and total immunity to be credible.  

Here is someone who was a member of the provisional committee of the Interahamwe, who remained in Rwanda up to the end, who moved about in the country as he pleased, and who now claims that I was the one who gave instructions.  

Nevertheless, it happened that I was absent for a long time from the country, at least after the 6th of April.  So that witness did not meet the members of the steering committee, those of them who were still in the country.  Who gave them -- who gave them instructions at the time referred to?  This is what I can say on this matter.  
Q.	For Witness G, you met the national committee of the Interahamwe about 15 times whilst you were coordinator of the MRND party in Kigali and later on secretary of the party and, subsequently, chairman of the party.  
A.	That is possible, but I did not summon them to a meeting.  I am telling you -- I told you about when I met them for matters of security.  Now, if they came to put a problem to me as chairman of the party, it would be like any other member of the party would have done.  That is possible.  

Although, I think that 15 times would be rather an exaggeration.  Definitely an exaggerated number of times I met them.  But I never said that I never met members of the provisional -- 
national provisional committee of the Interahamwe.  No.  I did not say that.  

Sometimes I met them separately.  Robert Kajuga -- we lived in the same neighbourhood with him.  So we spoke to one another often.  That is not surprising.  

Witness T was working at the commercial bank.  I was a customer of that bank.  So he should not exaggerate.  I cannot say that I never received anyone, but that doesn't mean that he should wash his hands from -- of their responsibilities in an attempt to say that I was the one who played the role of the chairman, president or vice-president.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman -- thank you, Mr. President.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Sorry.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness T, during one of the meetings, you made a statement to the effect that the president of the republic had heard about a youth movement that supported the objectives of the MRND and that the president intended to receive a certain delegation for the purpose of talking with that delegation.  

The witness adds that, in the month of December, without specifying the year, the president received the delegation which was led by Mr. Désiré Murenzi, the founder of the Interahamwe, and that he made a commitment to support that youth movement which supported his party.  

Does that bring to mind any comment you would like to make? 
(Pages 1 to 18 by Jean Baigent)




























1030H 
THE WITNESS:
No.  I think the meeting with the president of the republic, which I mentioned, I did not attend that meeting, I did not play the role of intermediary.  It was an arrangement that was outside my scope.  I did not attend the meeting, and I did not play the role of intermediary.  And the president of the republic, who was also chairman of the party, did not talk to me about that meeting, either before the meeting or after.  But I heard about the meeting.  I heard that the delegation went to meet the president of the republic.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Did you, therefore, before, during, or after the meeting, make a statement during a meeting which allegedly took place with the provisional -- national provisional committee of the Interahamwe?  
A.	It was possible, since I was aware of that meeting -- or, rather, it was impossible.  It was impossible since I learnt of the meeting long after the meeting had taken place.  So it was impossible for me to make any statement prior to the meeting -- or, to make any prior statement regarding the meeting. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness T, you asked members of the national committee to envisage extending the movement to other préfectures, and that -- that is how it happened that around the end of January/early February -- I do not know which year -- three people, on your instructions, went to Gisenyi préfecture for the purpose of creating a youth movement of Interahamwe za MRND in Gisenyi préfecture.  What do you say to that allegation?  
A.	Off the cuffs, I already said that they went there to create that organs.  But that recommendation was not my recommendation.  It was amongst the recommendations of 28th of April -- 28th of April 1992, which recommendations were made during a congress, and during that congress I was elected national secretary.  

That resolution congratulates those who created that youth movement.  It was not the party, it was not me, it was the young people themselves, and the congress expressed the wish that that movement, that is the MRND, be extended to all the préfectures.  And when the young people came to ask what the status of their affiliation was, I showed them the congress resolution.  I told them that, first of all, they had to comply with the resolution of the congress regarding that matter.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I can see what the time is, but perhaps I would like to refer Mr. Ngirumpatse to this document, at least for the purposes of the records.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I suppose that, Mr. Ngirumpatse, you want to talk about the congress resolution tendered into evidence as D. NZ6.  I read paragraph 4 thereof:  "Members of the national congress congratulated those who created the Interahamwe movement and asked that its branches be opened in all préfectures, and even in communes.  Furthermore, members of the congress requested that the Interahamwe organisation be affiliated, if possible, to the MRND party."  

Is that what you were referring to?  
A.	Yes, indeed.  They wanted to rush -- they wanted to be affiliated, or integrated, before this resolution was implemented.  And I could not do that.  That's it.  
Q.	Was that resolution implemented, in concrete terms, between 1992 and 1994?  
A.	Never.  In Gisenyi, as I have already told the Court, the set-up -- or, they just installed one person and that was all.  The -- there was no further progress.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, perhaps it is now time for us to take the mid-morning break.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We take the mid-morning recess now.  
(Court recessed from 1033H to 1104H) 
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President.  I thank you, Your Honours.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, witness -- Witnesses G and T testified before this Court that a letter that was written by the provisional committee was always under the cover of the MRND, and in particular the letter of protest written against the acts of intimidation and terrorism -- or, terrorisation of the Parti libéral, dated 26 May 1992.  This is Prosecution Exhibit P. 10.  "Most of that letter was written by Matthieu Ngirumpatse, just like most other letters were written by him."  What do you say to that?  
A.	This is very false.  There is something -- just one thing that is very true in that allegation.  I had told them that although that man did not have the -- should not undermine the interests of the state -- that they did not have to undermine the interests of the state.  I told them that, and that they should be careful in what they write, that if things turned sour they were going to bear the consequences brought to bear on them, either by the government or the state itself.  I always gave that advice; I always told them that they should be careful regarding what they wrote.  

As regards acts of wickedness or acts of violence that were perpetrated on -- or, visited on them by other parties, I believe that I did not write the letter.  But I told them that they -- their language should remain polite and courteous in order to foster dialogue.  I gave them advice in that regard.  But that does not amount to writing a letter.  And I believe it was only in connection with that letter, and I did so because they came to consult me to find out whether it did not undermine the interests of the party.  That is all.  But, as members of the party, I believe it was also their duty not to write anything.  But that was the only letter.  

Otherwise, witness -- Witnesses G and T are people who have been to university and who have good writing skills.  My help in writing the letter, therefore, was not necessary.  I've already stated that.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness AWE mentioned a series of meetings which you allegedly held with conseillers and other MRND officials at the end of 1992.  And that is why I'm mentioning this specifically.  The witness puts this meeting at different periods, he says, at the end of 1992.  The first meeting allegedly took place in the Rubangura building at the end of 1992, and there were about 50 participants at that meeting.  You were supposed to have been -- you were present in the meeting, and you were one of the conveners of the meeting.  You were sitting in the front row.  

And during the said meeting you stated that the Inkotanyis were enemies and that it was necessary for -- to exercise caution, to be alert, and to watch what the Tutsis were saying.  Apparently you also said that the MRND was recruiting young people to train them, and that communal conseillers had to provide premises which they would place at the disposal of the Interahamwe.  

Do you remember such a meeting, and whether you participated in it, and whether you said what is attributed to you?  
A.	Mr. President, this is a prototype of an impossible meeting.  AWE is the same witness who said that he occupied ************************************************************************************.  I would like, once more, to remind the Chamber that this position or post does not exist.  So this witness just fabricated stories.  

Secondly, I had no power to convene communal conseillers to a meeting.  In such a case I would have had to obtain the authorisation of three bourgmestres of the town, the authorisation of Kigali town -- of the préfet of Kigali town, without forgetting the approval of the party itself.  

All the conseillers were not necessarily of the MRND party, and I did not have the right to convene a meeting of administrative authorities.  I said that we were often criticised for being too legalistic, but I respected that principle.  Everyone was free to join a party of their choice, and my attitude remained unchanged, my attitude regarding civil servants, authorities at SONARWA.  Witnesses have told this Court that I did not compel anyone to become a member of the MRND.  In my family, there were people who were in opposition parties, there were women whose husbands were in opposition parties, and vice versa.  

That meeting of conseillers never took place.  From an administrative standpoint, it was impossible to convene or hold such a meeting.  
Q.	How about a second meeting, mentioned by AWE, during which MRND officials at communal level, secteur level, and cellule level were elected?  AWU (sic) himself was elected deputy secretary at the communal level.  Do you remember such a meeting, and whether you participated in it?  
A.	No.  If it is at the end of 1992, I was national secretary at that time and I had nothing to do with elections in Kigali-ville préfecture.  Secondly, that post which the AWE says he was elected to, that is assistant secretary, does not exist in the party constitution at communal level.  That post does not exist.  So, that witness has just made up stories.  That post does not exist.  I do not know who gave him that idea, but I maintain that that post does not exist.  So it is a pure fabrication.  
Q.	And a third meeting mentioned by AWE:  A meeting during which you discussed the idea of providing premises to the Interahamwe to enable them to hold their meetings therein, and also you talked about giving them resources to enable them to attend meetings.  According to that witness it was said, in your presence, that the Interahamwe had just completed their training, that grenades and arms had been given to them, which arms and grenades had -- they had to use if the MRND was attacked or if the town was attacked by the Inkotanyis.  

Do you have any comments on that meaning -- meeting?  Do you have any comments on your participation, the organisation of the meeting, and the words that have been attributed to you?  
A.	No.  Those are utterances that cannot be made by an official.  I believe this witness has just made up stories in an attempt to save himself, because he's also in the hands of justice in Kigali.  But what he says does not at all reflect reality.  Those are words that I cannot utter in public.  I cannot say in public -- I could not have said this in public that people had received weapons.  If I had said that -- first of all, the opposition media or press would have written that immediately.  Secondly, foreign embassies would have convened me -- or, would have come to see me, foreign ambassadors would have come to see me to make their remarks.  

If there is a point on which I agreed entirely with foreign embassies was my courtesy and moderate language vis-à-vis opposition parties and vis-à-vis the RPF, moreover.  Because, on Friday, we talked about the "friends" with which we were going to form the government.  

People dwelt much on this term, "enemy".  But I do not think that in MRND or during rallies, we used that term, "enemy".  We had members of our party who had relatives or friends on the other side of the divide.  So we also had to take them into consideration.  Our party was a national party, not a sectarian party.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	AWE, once again, mentions a meeting which took place between March and August 1993 in the Kabuga building, and the meeting was chaired by you.  In the said meeting, it was said that the Inkotanyis were getting closer to town, and that it was necessary to monitor their movements, particularly the movements of those who were going to the houses of Tutsis.  This was -- AWE says that it was from that moment on that they started monitoring the movements of Tutsis more closely.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have already underscored the fact that I was not in charge of the security of the state of Rwanda.  I was a party leader; that is all.  

Furthermore, from the month of March, before the 3rd of July 1993, I was only national secretary.  I was not chairman of the party.  And security, state security, is taken care of by people appointed to do that.  Because those who are attributing these words to me are words that could have been spoken by the area commander in Kigali, the head of the soldiers in Kigali town, the préfet of Kigali town, but not a party leader who was just a party leader like other party leaders.  

So this is totally wrong.  What the witness is saying is false; I did not utter those words that this witness attributes to me.  Once again, I repeat:  These are the types of words that I could not have uttered in public.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, between January 1993 and early 1994, or at any other time, did you attend MRND meetings at préfectoral level, during which meetings you introduced local Interahamwe chiefs to the various préfectoral secteurs, regional secteurs, or organs of the MRND?  
A.	No.  In Kigali, and in any other préfecture for that matter, there was a chairman of the MRND.  I did not have to duplicate -- carry out the same functions.  And no one else could have been chairing the meetings of young people, or youth activities.  So this, once more, is totally wrong, a pure fabrication.  
Q.	During that period, did you provide your support to local Interahamwe chiefs for the purpose of swelling the ranks of the Interahamwe, and to exercise control over them through the hierarchical supervisory authority of the MRND party?  
A.	This testimony is utterly confused, at least in the mind of the witness, because to exercise control through the MRND channel implies that the Interahamwe provisional committee is under the control of AWE, if he claims that he was carrying out some administrative functions.  That does not at all reflect the reality.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, around the end of 1993 or early 1994, or at any other time, did you attend or chair meetings of the provisional national committee of the Interahamwe, during which meeting you set up or gave instructions to be set up, or you heard that lists of persons to be killed were set up or prepared, and during which you also prepared a campaign for the killing of Tutsis and moderate Hutus?  
A.	These are propagandist allegations.  That list, the list of Tutsis to be killed, the list of moderate Hutus and what have you to be killed, is a fabrication.  Turatsinze talked about that list to Clarice (sic), but he claimed that the list was not complete.  And that is why he did not give the list.  

There is another witness who claimed that those lists were sent to the national secretariat.  But, for the information of the Chamber, I would like to point out that from the 6th -- the night of the 6th of April, no one set his foot in their office.  All our records or archives were picked up by the RPF, without any exception.  Even personal records which were in our offices, even records that were in my law practice, everything was picked up by the RPF.  If that list indeed had existed, I believe that the first thing that the RPF would have done would have been to hand it over to the Prosecutor.  

Furthermore, I would like to underscore, as a sociological reality, that in a country like Rwanda or Burundi, it was not necessary -- or, it is not necessary to prepare a list of Tutsis to be killed.  Everyone in that country knows who is who.  The problem of lists was to provide a basis to the theory of planning.  But, from a sociological point of view, it makes no sense in Rwanda.  It makes no sense at all.  Because if you think that on the various hills people went to draw up lists, did they have the time, first of all -- first of all, do they know to write?  Did they know how to read and write?  So this allegation is for the purposes of the theory of planning advanced by the Prosecution.  But those lists never existed.  

Besides, and here is another argument:  No one could give such instructions.  Because giving the ethnic mix -- or, how the ethnic groups have mixed up, you do not know how far you can go.  No one who was responsible in Rwanda could give such instructions, because the next person could be your brother, your cousin.  You do not know how far that exercise could take you.  Therefore, I think it is necessary that people be careful in their allegations.  And if one knows -- well, it is necessary to understand the society, to -- to know the society in order to understand.  
Q.	Perhaps to bring you back to my question, and only to my question:  Did you participate or attend a meeting during which you drew up a list, or gave instructions for lists to be drawn up?  
A.	No.  No.  To give a more clearer and precise -- or, concise answer, my response to that is no.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, at the end of November 1992, on the 15th of November 1992, did you hear, as Witness AWD alleges, that President Habyarimana declared -- or, stated that the Interahamwe were going to go down to the ground well armed -- going to come out well armed -- well armed?  
A.	15th of November, that is in Ruhengeri, if my memory serves me right?  I'm not going to bother the Chamber with explanations.  That speech exists, and I think it's much simpler to compare the witness's testimony and the president's speech.  That is all.  The president never uttered those words.  
Q.	According to Witness ZF, he attended two MRND meetings during which you asked the Interahamwe to support the army in Gisenyi.  And, in particular, the gendarmerie.  That witness claims that Lieutenant Bizumuremyi, B-I-Z-U-M-U-R-E-M-Y-E (sic), was the coordinator of the Interahamwes and the Impuzamugambi from the Gisenyi préfecture, as well as the Rwandan army in Gisenyi.  What do you know about that? 
A.	That is wrong.  I am not at all aware of the facts that are alleged.  That is completely wrong.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness UB alleges that well before the death of the president, Interahamwes killed Tutsis openly, with the knowledge and in the presence of MRND officials, but -- and that the MRND officials did not intervene.  What do you say to that allegation?  
A.	The witness is telling lies.  First of all, I do not remember Tutsis that were killed during that period.  Furthermore, I do not know -- as I've already indicated, the ministry of justice fell under the opposition.  I do not think that that ministry would have remained without acting.  I do not believe that the prime minister was also in a position -- the prime minister would have folded his arms without reacting to those crimes that were committed in Rwanda itself.  So that testimony is false.  

Besides, there is a tendency to attribute to the MRND party state powers.  If people kill others there is gendarmerie, the forces of law and order, judicial and legal authorities.  In such a context, what would be the role of a party in a state that is organised as Rwanda is organised at the time referred to?  A party would not have any powers in such a context.  At the very most, they would have come to look for me and take me to court for me to explain.  But I totally deny the existence of those facts, the veracity of those facts.  
Q.	But, according to Witness UB, if the crimes that he attributes to the Interahamwe were never punished, it was because of the mastery of the territorial administration and the ministry of the interior by the MRND -- the control of the territorial administration and the ministry of the interior by the MRND.  What are your comments on that?  
A.	That is wrong.  All the bourgmestres or the conseillers did not come from the MRND; neither did all the préfets.  So that, once more, is a fabrication.  He says that we controlled everything.  There was a préfecture where we had one bourgmestre after 17, for example, Gitarama.  In Kibuye we were not in the majority.  Butare also.  Same with Gikongoro.  Therefore this is a way of making baseless accusations.  Those accusations are not true.  We did not have control over territorial administration.  

And I would like to repeat once more that it was not the ministry of territorial administration that deals with matters of law and order and justice.  It is the gendarmerie; it is the ministry of justice; it is the office the prosecutor.  And since the office of the prosecutor was headed by Mr. François Nsanzuwera -- this is a known -- this is a name known here in the court; I do not need to spell it -- I do not think the prosecutor in Kigali would have tolerated all that.  To say that, if you have a bourgmestre -- if you don't have a préfet, you don't master anything. 
Q.	Another witness, Claeys, testified that there was a link between the Interahamwe and the gendarmerie according to him, arising from statements made by Turatsinze, according to which the gendarmerie and the FAR were involved in the modus operandi of the Interahamwe.  What do you say to that testimony by Mr. Claeys? 
A.	Mr. Claeys was told so many things.  And I can say it today, that the Rwandan people believed, rightly or not, that the gendarmerie was against the MRND.  So it may not just be a matter of the entire gendarmerie corps, or of some individuals.  Now, to claim that there was complicity between the gendarmerie and the Interahamwe would be absolutely and utterly false.  

Now, for a gendarme or a soldier to commit themselves to some political party, they need to make sure that they have clearance and support from their bosses.  And that was not the case.  However, although gendarmes and soldiers are forbidden from engaging in politics, that does not deny them the right to be interested in politics.  So I do not think that the foot-and-rank gendarme, or soldier, would engage in politics without being mindful of what their bosses may think.  

So I do not believe that the entire gendarmerie or soldiers were after the MRND or in support of the MRND.  What Claeys was told was probably because he was not a Rwandan and he was new to the environment, and he was told all manner of tales.  However, he had the opportunity to cross-check his information.  He should have cross-checked his information but he did not do so.  And all he did was to rely on Turatsinze.  You see, if he had called me, I would have explained these things to him.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness UB testified that Interahamwe allegedly attended a rally in October 1993 at Nyamirambo, and that they allegedly attacked Tutsis, and that they took it out on passersby as they went along.  And he testified that if one were to analyse what was done to the Tutsis on that day, then one would come to the conclusion that Tutsis had no value in the country at that time.  His conclusion is that, whereas a gendarmerie squad was in the neighbourhood, no one intervened, no one did anything to stop them from committing those crimes, nor to punish them.  

Would you know whether these things actually happened, and whether those accusations narrated by UB, under oath, in fact tally with reality?  
A.	That is incorrect.  That is wrong.  First of all, the rally of 23 October '93 was not convened by the MRND; it was convened by the MDR.  I did not attend that rally, and I am not in a position to know what happened before, during, and after the said rally. 

Secondly, I do not understand how the Interahamwe would have been involved.  You see, the man who had just delivered a speech, which is in evidence before this Court, and who talked about Hutu Power, namely Froduald Karamira, was not of the MRND, he was of the MDR.  How, then, can this witness imagine that MRND supporters could have done what he is accusing the Interahamwe za MRND of?  

Third point:  I did not hear, honestly, mention of any fighting in Nyamirambo after that rally.  No mention of fighting.  Neither by the media, nor by opposition parties, nor by foreign missions which often hastened to bring such incidents to my attention, or to the attention of other MRND ministers, and even to the attention of the president of the republic.  None of them mentioned any such claimed acts of violence.  And all they talked about was Hutu Power, and nothing else.  That is why these accusations are false.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness UB further testified that in 1993 he allegedly heard, over Radio Rwanda, a broadcast of a meeting held at the Kibungo préfectoral office, which you chaired.  He testified that, upon returning from that rally, Interahamwe engaged in acts of violence, destroying houses between Kibungo and Kayonza, as well as in Gikoro, in Kanombe, and that no decision was taken against those who engaged in those acts of violence, that no one protested against what they had done.  
A.	Did you say 1993, please?  Did you mention a specific date?  Well, in any event, that is not necessary.  I can still answer the question.  I know that one day while returning from an MRND rally in Kibungo -- I do not recall having attended the rally.  MRND militants -- I would not say it was the Interahamwe.  MRND members were intercepted by the members of the Parti libéral in Kayonza, which is a Parti libéral bastion -- Kayonza:  K-A-Y-O-N-Z-A -- and they started fighting.  And so talking about destruction would be false, because all what happened is that there was an interception and the other members fled.  This is what I remember, although I was not present.  I didn't attend that rally.  

Now, the second component of my answer is the following:  Witness UB was an office bearer and held a position, and he knew very well that if any fighting of that nature broke out, it would be the armed forces that would intervene.  How, then, would he have expected the MRND to take any measures in relation to that type of activity?  What would it have done?  The MRND was a political party like any other political party.  Any forces of law and order would come either from the gendarmerie, from the army, or from the communal police who were in charge of peace and order, as well as the office of the prosecutor.  

I mean, in short, that these are fabricated, false accusations, designed simply to reaffirm -- or, in support of the allegation that the MRND were under the control of the party.  Now, if people are intercepted or attacked along the road, what can the party do, as a party?  You see, in Kayonza, there is a commune.  This means that there was a communal police force in place, and those are the people who had power and authority to intervene, not the party.  You see, what I am saying, therefore, is that it is MRND members who were attacked and not the Interahamwe.  And this happened quite often when people were returning from a number of rallies at the time.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, still according to UB, when the préfectoral committee noticed that such actions, after having taken place in Murambi and Kibungo, were now occurring in Kigali, and after those acts that had been noticed in those areas, the decision was taken to broadcast an announcement, but the préfectoral committee chair was convened and threatened, and upon his return, told the members of the MRND that the executive bureau of the MRND had dissuaded him from proceeding in that manner, and that he had been instructed that the préfectoral committee should not be involved in matters that are beyond its jurisdiction, particularly matters relating to the Interahamwe.  What do you say to that?  
A.	Witness UB apparently was not within the party.  With all those accusations that he is levelling, he should have resigned from the party.  I don't know how one could have harboured so many questions and still remained within the party.  You see, I did not have to give any instructions or issue any instructions.  The party was autonomous.  The préfectoral committee was autonomous.  It did not have to consult anybody to convene meetings or to make announcements.  And, in a nutshell, it was autonomous.  

Now, if I were to consider the character of Jean Habyarimana, chairman of the MRND in Kigali, he was someone who would not take orders, as such.  And so if they had decided to broadcast an announcement, they would have proceeded to do so.  That is why all of this is false.  
Q.	GOB, on his part, testified that:  "From 1992, when the Interahamwe were present in various areas of the country, they began to attack passersby and loot from people who did not oppose the party.  And inhabitants began to complain about this.  We also had difficulty understanding the conduct of this youth wing, and we raised the matter with the chief, President Habyarimana, or the boss, and the executive secretary who, at the time, must have been Édouard Karemera, and at which time Matthieu Ngirumpatse was the chairman of the MRND party at the préfectoral level.  So we raised these issues with the leadership of the party.  And I do recall that Matthieu Ngirumpatse said:  'You need not complain about the Interahamwe.  What you need to do is to link up with those people and work with them.'  

"Now, the president of the party went further to say -- to say that this was the conduct to be adopted.  And that led me to conclude that the Interahamwe was following instructions from their bosses, particularly the chairman and the executive secretary." 

What is your reaction to that testimony?  
A.	That is entirely false.  You see, some people have taken advantage of the forum offered them by the Tribunal to give some more worth to themselves, and this, I believe, is also replete with the lies that they told.  That man was a member of the parliament, and you may want to know that throughout his tenure he never took the floor.  Now he claims there were issues with the leadership of the party, with Karemera, with myself, the president of the republic, and what have you.  That testimony is entirely false.  I do not have any recollection of any discussion on that kind of topic in the leadership of the party.  

Let me repeat that if what this witness has testified to were true, he would have resigned from the party as an honourable thing to do.  And now he comes here to claim that he was in the right and it was the other members of the party who were in wrong.  That testimony is false.  
Q.	Now, still Witness GOB, he went on to testify that the Interahamwe were the youth wing of the MRND, that the Interahamwe could not initiate their own actions, meaning, therefore, that they only acted upon instruction from the party leadership.  The Interahamwe were not able to initiate any demonstrations if they had not been ordered by the leadership of the party, particularly the chairman, the general secretary, or the political bureau of the MRND.  Do you agree with those accusations by GOB?  
A.	No, I do not.  It was not the party that authorised demonstrations.  Demonstrations were authorised by préfets.  Those who planned any demonstrations had to apply for an authorisation from the préfet.  And those who claim that the responsibility was with the party are people who are stuck in the single-party mentality.  

You see, at some point in time, the party and the administration were one and the same thing.  But there came a time when the party and various préfectures were separate and were not in the hands of the same parties.  Therefore, whenever any party chose to organise a rally or demonstration, they would apply for authorisation from the préfectoral office, and not from the party headquarters.  Even the national secretary of the party, if he needed to organise a rally or a meeting, he would apply to the préfet and wait for the said authorisation.  Anything organised outside of those parameters would be disbursed by the gendarmerie.  And that was the truth.  
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, during some of the most painful times in the history of Rwanda, leading up to the paradoxes -- or, climax in spring of 1994, reference was made about -- was made to what has been referred to as the Bugesera killings.  Some witnesses have come here and testified in support of the theory that the Bugesera killings were a joint action between the Interahamwe and soldiers in civilian attire.  Witness AWD testified along those lines, saying that Interahamwe and mili -- and soldiers in civilian gear went to Bugesera and killed many civilians.  

Question:  Are you aware of the Bugesera killings, and are you in a position to tell the Court what your remarks and comments are in relation to the circumstances leading up to those killings and to WVD's (sic) testimony?  
A.	It is a lie.  The truth of the matter is as follows:  At the time I was minister of justice.  I authorised -- or, should I say, I ordered that all persons involved be arrested, and I think that the number at some point was about 500.  And when things calmed down, about 200 people were still held in detention.  When I left the ministry of justice in April 1992, those people were still in prison.  No one identified among those persons any Interahamwe or any soldier.  Their identities were taken down, and it was the préfet, François Nsanzuwera, whom I mentioned, already, who led the investigation into this matter.  

Secondly, the causes of the unrest in the Bugesera were internal to the Bugesera.  They were not external.  First, there was a lot of tension in the area because many young people were crossing the border from Burundi through Tanzania to undertake training in Uganda, and to be subsequently sent to the battle front.  

With the leave of the Trial Chamber, let me talk about the case of someone whom I knew personally, and I'm narrating to the Court a personal experience.  I went to the Bugesera.  At the time I was a minister.  And then I met an old primary school classmate in Rudondo (sic).  He was Tutsi.  I stopped to greet him.  He was very happy, we warmly embraced each other, and then he told me:  "You see, we are afraid, we are frightened here.  Those of us who are a little older, we are afraid because the children have taken off to join the RPF.  And when they return it will be sadness across the land."  That was what a Tutsi friend from Bugesera told me in confidence.  

Now, what exacerbated issues was the Parti libéral rally, which was organised to show signs of arrogance and to insult Bourgmestre Rwambuka.  This displeased members of the population.  I may not be able to bother the Trial Chamber with the details of this situation, but let it be noted that, while I was minister of justice, I wrote to the minister of the interior, my colleague, to draw his attention to the potentially explosive situation that was brewing in the Bugesera.  

Now, when the unrest broke out, the prime minister convened a cabinet meeting attended by the president of the republic and various ambassadors accredited to Kigali.  At that meeting we defined or determined the various measures that needed to be taken in that connection.  

Now, what this witness has narrated, I believe the Trial Chamber would understand, is cut off from reality.  In the cabinet meeting with the president, the prime minister, and foreign dignitaries, no one else was present.  And what is clear is that that meeting came up with measures and with actions to be taken to put an end to those events.  I conducted investigations and gave orders for all those involved to be arrested.  I did not see that there were any Interahamwe or soldiers involved.  I know that there were members and supporters of all parties, there were Tutsis, of course, but not many of them.  And clearly these actions arose from provocation.  

So when these people were arrested, the matter was solved.  By the time I left the ministry, there were more than 200 people in detention in relation to the Bugesera killings.  And the minister who took over was of the opposition, and a member of the party that had organised those inflammatory events in Bugesera.  And it is only with much surprise that I subsequently learnt that those people were finally released.  The MRND was not involved in this; the Interahamwe were not involved in this.  

And I believe that although my explanations have been lengthy, they were necessary and they do clarify the point.  I thank you, Mr. President.

1200H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Yet, Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness AWD testified that the laying of mines in Bugesera was in fact ordered or masterminded by the MRND and the Interahamwe for the purpose of showing people that it was a matter of joining other parties, that it was a more reasonable choice to remain within the MRND, that the idea was to frighten the inhabitants of Bugesera so as to make them hate opposition political parties.  What is your reaction to that theory advanced by Witness AWD? 
A.	It is strenuous.  There isn't much meat to that evidence.  This is hair-splitting because the attacks were committed everywhere in the country, even in Kigali town, in Kigali market, at the car park, bus station in Kigali, everywhere, even in Kigali bank itself there was something.  

Furthermore, this witness's theory -- well, maybe the witness doesn't read a lot.  He has not had the opportunity of reading.  The RPF at present does not deny that it was at the origin of all these attacks.  Perhaps the witness should be confronted with the admissions or confessions of some RPF members. 

We had no interest in destroying the country's infrastructure and in killing our own members.  This will be silly.  This evidence bears no weight.  It's completely silly. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, it would appear that regarding this point there is some convergence of views with the testimony expressed or given by GOB.  GOB testified that the Interahamwe played a role in the Bugesera killings alongside the inhabitants of Bugesera, members of the MRND, who in the majority were Hutus, and that this followed the conduct of the RPF and its accomplices that laid mines.  The witness testified that those whose family members were killed during the explosion of mines were going to avenge themselves against the inhabitants of Bugesera.  What do you think of this allegation made by GOB? 
A.	It is false.  I gave the origin of this painful problem.  I talked about the steps taken by the government to stem these unrests or disturbances.  But when the witness talks about MRND members, we see that this is somebody who prepared this testimony for a specific purpose. 

Did he know that the majority of communal conseillers from Kanzenze commune were Tutsis and members of the MRND, in addition?  I saw them.  I went to Bugesera to hold a meeting with the local population in the company of Préfet Bagambiki.  I recommended to the people there to live in harmony as before, not to stoke the war -- rather, bring the war taking place at the border in their own homes.  This meeting took place -- or went on smoothly.  We made recommendations and sent the recommendation to the president of the republic and the prime minister.  The meeting was very smooth. 

The presence of Interahamwe or the involvement of the Interahamwe and MRND members in this problem, well, I do not know about the Interahamwe, but I do not believe so.  But to say that there was an MRND militant or member, well, you will not ask a political party why members of its party are committing crimes. 

When a young American shoots a Democratic member of Congress, the head of the 
Republican Party -- where he was when one of its members went to shoot at a Democratic member of Congress -- perhaps this is not a most appropriate example, but this is what Prosecution witnesses are doing. 

They say, "Well, these people were members of your party.  You should, therefore, be aware of all crimes that they committed or intended to commit and to prevent them from committing them."  Well, if that be the case, the power of the state, the role of intelligence and security services, what would be their role?  These powers did not lie with the MRND.  

I told you that the ministry left with us were burdened, we had to wage the war, and the ministry of the interior at the time when half of the population was fleeing from war -- this is the answer I can give you in regard to that question. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I still have a few questions on these witness testimonies or statements and I would have come to an end of the list.  Were there liaison officers, MRND liaison officers?  Were there 
	liaison officers within MRND? 
A.	Liaising with who?  The national secretary or the chairman of the party were the people who dealt with people of the outside world.  I do not see any other liaison officer.  For what purpose?  The chairman of the parties in various communes could contact the préfet and the president of the party in the préfecture could contact directly the national secretary of the party.  So I do not see any other need for a liaison officer. 
Q.	Witness AWD testified that he learnt from an MRND liaison officer that around 1992, Interahamwe went to Shyorongi, S-H-Y-O-N-R-O-N-G-I (sic), and that there they looted property, drove away people and killed others.  And that these acts of aggression against the Tutsi were perpetrated for the purpose of supporting the regime.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I do not understand his conclusion.  Which regime?  This was a coalition government.  The prime minister came from the opposition.  So what regime?  

It is true that there were unrests in Shyorongi commune, but I carried out -- I took personal steps, although I had no capacity to do that because I was no longer a member of government.  I believe I was national secretary of my party.  But, nevertheless, I contacted a female member of parliament in an attempt to resolve the issue.  I even gave a speech inviting the inhabitants of that locality to come together and try to find a solution to their disagreement. 

I think this stemmed from the fact that there was a member of the MRND party, a young member who had been beheaded by enemies, and at the time the RPF was suspected, but we did not suspect all Tutsis together.  That member of parliament was a member of Parti libéral.  The other person was a member of the MDR.  They were not bothered, they were not worried, they were not harassed, except by HH, yes.  HH did many things, did a lot of harm, and I think it was at that time that he was arrested. 

In fact, an arrest warrant was issued against -- the arrest warrant issued against him is in the case file, I believe.  But, otherwise, the rest of what he says is pure fabrication. 
Q.	AWD testified that you summoned him to a meeting in your house, in your residence in the month of January 1994.  Did you summon AWD to a meeting in your residence in the month of January 1994? 
A.	No.  No.  As I explained, at the time referred to I was a lawyer.  I did not spend my time home.  I was in court.  Or sometimes I would be in meeting with the RPF for the setting up of transition institutions.  But during daytime I was not home.  And sometimes I would not go home at midday.  It sometimes happened that I would take my lunch in town and not return home.  And this is because of the distance and the activities.  So his testimony is completely false. 
Q.	Did you receive AWD elsewhere other than your residence, your office, your law practice? 
A.	No.  That person did not fall under my authority.  He fell under the authority of the president or chairman of the party in Kigali préfecture.  If he had had a problem, if AWD had had a problem, it was up to the chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture to make that problem known to the national secretariat in the event he could not resolve it.  Apart from that, what the witness is saying is false.  

Again, these are fabricated testimonies intended to form a basis for the case. 
Q.	And AWE -- did you ever summon AWE to your house?  Did he ever come to your house? 
A.	Never.  Never.  You should bear this in mind:  That I was not carrying out politics in my house, in my residence, except once when I invited the United States' ambassador who was leaving Rwanda, Mr. Flatten, and other ambassadors, ambassadors of Belgium, Zaire, Tanzania and so on.  

I had also the honour that the president of the republic accepted to attend that farewell dinner given in honour of the US ambassador.  That is the only time I could talk of a meeting in my house of a 
political nature.  But it was more a social meeting rather than a political meeting.  We did not discuss politics during that dinner.  We just joked.  We just talked about everything and nothing.  We talked about literature, music, culture.  Yes, that's all. 
Q.	Perhaps you may wish to mention the name of that ambassador again.  
A.	Flat -- F-L-A-T-E-E-N (sic).  Flatten, F-L-A-T-E-E-N -- or double T-E-N, rather. 
Q.	In what date? 
A.	Around 19 -- the second half of 1990 when he left Rwanda, yes.  But I was already chairman of the MRND, therefore, it was after July. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, when AWE purports to have denounced to you criminal acts perpetrated by the Interahamwe and when he claims that you told him that that did not concern him and that you ordered him not to impede the activities of the Interahamwe, what do you say to that? 
A.	It's wrong.  It's false testimony.  As I said, I was not directly accessible or available to him.  On the contrary, the chairman of the MRND in Kigali-ville préfecture was available, accessible, and these matters concerned him.  Not me as chairman of the party.  

As chairman of the party, I was not in charge of Kigali, nor -- neither of the town, that is, Kigali town, nor Kigali préfecture.  I was concerned by national problems, problems at the national level.  I think this witness is exaggerating, is not serious. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, did you in any manner whatsoever incite, aid and abet young people of the MRND party to prepare or to commit crimes? 
A.	No.  I have nothing to add to that answer. 
Q.	Did you in any manner whatsoever aid or contribute to protecting them so as to spare them the punishment they would have incurred if they had committed such crimes? 
A.	No.  Not at all.  I did not have the power to do that. 
Q.	When young militants of the MRND party or young people of Interahamwe za MRND committed any criminal offences, did you disapprove of such acts? 
A.	Yes.  Of course.  I even gave an interview on the radio about that.  I blamed those who were causing harm, but I do not remember the date of the interview.  That was a very long time ago.  But I gave an interview to that effect. 

I should also point out that that does not mean that when they were in difficulties, that is, Interahamwe, they were necessarily wrong, and that is why depending on the circumstances we had a contract with a law practice to defend our members, our militants in the event of difficulty.  Therefore, when you commit lawyers to defend or represent members of your party, it's not to protect them but for them to know the role of justice in the life of a nation. 
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Ngirumpatse.  One of the allegations that the Prosecutor makes against you is that you organised, prepared, aided in organising, aided in preparing what amounted to making of the Interahamwe a militia.  The first aspect of this allegation deals with military training given to the young people of the MRND, young people of Interahamwe za MRND, and a lot was said during the proceedings, during the Prosecution case and also during the cross-examination of some 
Defence witnesses.  A lot was said about this military training given to the young people of the MRND party.  What do you know about that training? 
A.	Starting with my letter of 14-15 February, an attempt was made to construct -- to fabricate everything.  And the propaganda was so carefully carried out that I myself -- at some point in time I believed in it.  Before I had the facts, before I had my indictment, before having all the information around that issue, I thought that may have been possible.  

But let us begin with the beginning because at the beginning -- in fact, it was -- the propaganda was so carefully carried out that I almost thought it was true.  I thought maybe that may be true.  But what is exactly the situation?  

Let us go back to the 9th of January 1994.  Mr. Gasana, G-A-S-A-N-A, a member of the MDR party; minister of foreign affairs, MDR Twagiramungu wing, which was generally known to be pro-RPF -- so Mr. Gasana gave -- made a press communiqué in which he accused the MRND of having trained the Interahamwe for the purpose of killing members of opposition political parties.  In that interview the term "Tutsi" is not used.  He didn't talk about the Tutsis.  He talked about members of the opposition. 

On the 10th Turatsinze recounted his tale to Dallaire with the famous phrase "Our people can kill 
a thousand Tutsis in 20 minutes."  Well, everybody doubted this because they thought it was impossible.  But when I carried out serious research because the allegation was against me, first, I went to look for the origin of that story.  Major Havugiyaremye, H-A-V-U-G-I-Y-A-R-E-M-Y-E, he was a gendarmerie major and he was based in Rwamagana.  He is the one who alerted Kigali saying that he had heard -- he did not see -- that he had heard that there were Interahamwe who passed by on their way to Gabiro to undergo military training.  That is the origin of that story. 

And since this was a sensitive issue, the chief of staff, General Ndindiliyimana -- that is a name known here in this Tribunal -- the chief of staff sent him a cable requesting him to submit a complete and substantiated report.  The major did not confirm his -- what he had said before.  He said that it was despised or disdained, that the people he had seen were guards of the Akagera National Park who had gone there for retraining because the RPF was poaching animals in the national park of Akagera and that the park was empty.  That matter was discussed in a cabinet meeting, and the government was led by Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.  That government concluded that such training did not take place.  That is a document produced by Ndindiliyimana, which he wrote in Brussels in 1999.  He was not yet arrested.  He wrote that document to challenge the first book in which he was talking of training. 

Third conclusion or third observation -- third conclusion I arrived at is that Turatsinze, when talking to Claeys, said that some of those Interahamwe were trained by the Israelites in Nyungwe and the Gishwati forest.  Nyungwe is spelt as follows:  N-U-N-G-W-E (sic).  Gishwati, G-I-S-H-W-A-T-E (sic).  In fact, Claeys believed that story.  We are now in the year 1993.  

If up until 1991, 1992 there was this agreement at the State Department in Washington regarding the United States' policy concerning Rwanda, the people who supported the regime had disappeared from the State Department because this was the year of the theory of New African leaders.  In Uganda, Museveni; Kagame in Rwanda; Ethiopia and Eritrea.  These were the four major leaders that the American administration wanted to promote as models, models for Africa.  

I do not know whether the American administration was right.  But many people doubt -- many people have doubts on the wisdom in such a choice.  I do not see the American administration or government supporting the RPF and the Israelites training the Interahamwe who were fighting the RPF. 

If I could give an example which obtains today.  It is as if someone would tell me that Americans and NATO are fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and that Israel is training the Taliban in Pakistan to come and fight against the Americans.  This is exactly the same type of example.  This is silly.  This is impossible.  This is nonsense.  That is one of the reasons why I dropped those ideas, those beliefs that had been thrown upon me by intensive propaganda. 

Furthermore, we brought our own witnesses, soldiers who worked in those military camps.  Those witnesses completely denied the existence of such training. 

And lastly, Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to note that the Prosecution did not call any witness who participated in those trainings.  The Prosecution brought witnesses who heard about the training, like myself, but witnesses who were never present at the training and who did not have any idea about what happened.  And that is why at present I conclude that all these allegations were fabricated, were framed and do not reflect the reality.  

That is the answer I have to that question, Mr. President, Your Honours.  In fact, the question is surprising.  This question by the Prosecution is surprising. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, I have listened to your answers, but allow me to ask one more question, a very simple question.  Did you, you Matthieu Ngirumpatse, organise training, military training for young persons or youth of your party? 
A.	No.  What I acknowledge is that on 14th February '93, I wrote to the president of the republic, like any other political party.  And like our embassy in Kampala, I wrote to the president, but I did not get any reply to that letter.  My answer to your simple question is no. 
Q.	But the Prosecutor -- according to the Prosecutor, Augustin Bizimana, Théoneste Bagosora and other officers of the Rwandan armed forces had taken steps to ensure that the youth of the 
	Interahamwe za MRND would receive training.  Were you aware of any such steps being taken at the time? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you have confirmation of any such measures today? 
A.	No. 
Q.	According to the Prosecutor, military training was purportedly given in Kigali military camp, 
	Byumba military camp, Gisenyi and Ruhengeri military camps, Gabiro, Mukamira, Bigogwe camps and in neighbouring forests, in the Gishwati forest, in the Akagera forest, in Mutara préfecture.  Now, did you organise military training as described above? 
A.	No.  First of all, it was outside the scope of my duties as chairman of the party.  I had no access to military camps.  I had no access to military business or military affairs. 

Furthermore, the soldiers who worked at those camps and those locations were called before this Court.  Now, those who provided that list were never present at any of those trainings.  And I insist on this point:  None of the Prosecution witnesses testified to have been present at any of these trainings. 

Let me take a specific case.  The Bigogwe camp, which was a large military camp for paracommando soldiers, which provided training for commando soldiers, this camp was run by Belgian officers.  I have read through some of the testimonies by these Belgian officers who categorically deny any such training. 

Mindful of the position of the Belgian soldiers regarding President Habyarimana at the time, there really was no reason why those Belgians would accept civilians for training in those camps at the time.  So those who were in training were soldiers requiring certification as commandos who were provided training in that camp at that time.  

So that is the answer I can provide.  And I thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, according to Witness T, it is in 1993 that Interahamwe were given military training from the second half of that year, namely, July, August, September, up until the end of 1993.  What are your comments to that? 
A.	That is a witness, a Prosecution witness who is narrating things which he did not see.  He was not there.  

As I have already told the Trial Chamber, there was great propaganda going on at that time.  And I almost fell victim to it myself, almost believing that people must have been mistaken.  But, indeed, it is true that this did not happen. 
Q.	According to Witness T still, this issue was discussed at a cabinet meeting in 1992, and the cabinet rejected this proposal that was made by ministers from the MRND party, and that it is because the idea was dismissed by the cabinet that the MRND then took upon itself to proceed.  And according to the witness, it is because of that rejection by the cabinet that the party undertook to provide training for the Interahamwe for purposes of protection of its members, and that the said training evolved thereafter with Matthieu Ngirumpatse participating in all meetings and chairing all the meetings.  

I think that I am speeding up too much now. 

However, can you give us your comments to this question.  
A.	All I would like to do is simply draw the Court's attention to one point.  I drew the president's attention to the fact that if there were any training to be done, it should be done secretly or privately.  How then would I go out to make public statements on a matter recommended confidentially?  I am at least a coherent person.  

Now, we know that in 1991-1992 the RPF had engaged in guerilla warfare which destabilised the people of Rwanda.  It is in that context that the idea was mooted for a self-defence initiative whereby tools for self-defence will be provided to ward off any nightly attacks by the RPF.  It is clear that weapons were distributed in Ruhengeri, Byumba and Gisenyi, in some of these communes.  Those weapons, those arms were used at night and would be returned to the communal office in the morning.  So people did not go about with those weapons or those arms upon themselves. 

Now, when the witness claims that the government rejected the idea, he is simply fabricating something that never existed.  

I have already testified that those weapons were withdrawn because the RPF and pro-RPF 
opposition parties and some foreign embassies had raised so much dust about the issue that the government decided to abandon that strategy and seek other ways of proceeding with self-defence.  That is the truth.  This is what happened.  So these allegations are false.  And what I have said simply points to the fact that this witness is not at all credible. 
Q.	Now, let us turn to Witness HH who testified that in his capacity, which I will not mention in order not to disclose his identity, persons from Kigali-ville and neighbouring communes had been invited by Turatsinze to the MRND office where he told us that there was a problem, and that the Inkotanyi had penetrated or infiltrated the country.  He told us to identify or designate young persons for 
	military training.  

I recall he went on to say that Matthieu Ngirumpatse was present at that meeting which held at the meeting hall at the Kabuga building where the headquarters of the party was located.  Did you ever make any such statement at that location or at any other location in the presence of Witness HH? 
A.	That is false, the simple reason being that in the second half of 1993, we were no longer in the Kabuga building.  So what he is telling is a fabrication, entirely false. 
Q.	AWD asserts that the youth or the Interahamwe went to Mutara in 1993 for military training, but prior to that official exercise we knew that those persons were already receiving military training.  What do you say to that? 
A.	That testimony is also as false as the previous.  I have already demonstrated to the Court that the distribution of weapons and training that was provided was for some persons -- preferentially given to reservists at the time -- was a measure approved by government to counter RPF attacks. 

But these witnesses who do not master the depths of issues, who do not understand the issues at stake, who are simply concerned about saving their skin, all they do is fabricate evidence and narrate it to the Court. 
Q.	Witness UB testified that up until 1993 the Interahamwe had been receiving training.  He goes on to say that, "Even in my area, those Interahamwe who were there received training, not only in Kigali but across the entire country given that the Interahamwe were present throughout Rwanda.  And, furthermore, in Kigali people left in busses to go to military camps, and at that time we thought that they were young people selected for enrolment in the army.  But after the training, those youths returned to their respective areas."  

What is your reaction to this testimony by UB? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  Allow me to add that UB held an office in Kigali town.  If he thought that these things were suspicious, he should have raised them with the préfet or the prosecutor's office in Kigali town.  So I really do not understand how he fabricated such a story.  To my mind, it is false.  

And as I have already said, the propaganda at the time was so intensive that I almost bought into it myself.  And if I had not conducted research myself properly, I would not have been able to understand the source of all this type of propaganda and information. 
Q.	Now turning to Witness AWE.  The said witness asserts that during those meetings which we have just mentioned, meetings which held at the Kabuga building between May and July -- May and August, rather, 1993, the late Joseph Nzirorera allegedly declared that the Interahamwe had completed their training, had received equipment that they were able to use at any time whenever the MRND came under attack, and that they could use the equipment when the Inkotanyi, the Inyenzi, that is, the 
	RPF soldiers, attacked the city.  The said training, according to AWE, was provided or given in Gabiro.  What do you say to that statement? 
A.	Could you be specific as to the month in which the meeting allegedly took place?  I don't know whether the witness talked about the month. 
Q.	The meeting is said to have taken place between May and August 1993.  
A.	Where?  
Q.	In Félicien Kabuga's building.  
A.	Mr. President, Your Honours, I have already somehow tackled this allegation.  I do not see what Joseph Nzirorera, before the 4th of July 1993, would be doing in this area.  The witness is talking about March, and I believe that he is trying to craft his testimony along the lines provided by investigators, that Nzirorera was not in the office in March or thereabouts. 

Joseph Nzirorera was not a member of the bureau before the 4th of July 1993.  He, therefore, could not have chaired a meeting or held a meeting during that period.  

That notwithstanding, let me say that the testimony -- the accusation in itself is still a fabrication which does not reflect reality.  No one ever made any such statement in public. 

Let me reassure the Trial Chamber that mindful of the number of persons alleged to have been present at the meeting, it would have been impossible to dissimulate all this information.  And I believe that the local as well as the international press would have published all of these things.  They wouldn't have had to wait until I appear before this Trial Chamber for any accusations to be levelled against me.  I would have been accused well ahead of that time. 

You see, if there are 50 or 60 people in a meeting, there is no way you can guarantee that secrecy would be held.  Now, for all these meetings alleged to have been secret with 50 to 60 people meeting in public or what have you, all of these meetings, to my mind, are pure fabrications, and they could never have taken place. 
Q.	Are you saying that you would have made these statements in private if you had been sure that they would remain confidential? 
A.	No, no, not at all.  Not at all.  No. 
Q.	Now, Mr. Ngirumpatse, Witness UB testified that at the secteur level it was the Interahamwe officials who selected youth for training in the various military camps who would then forward such lists to the executive bureau and then to the chairman of the Interahamwe at the national level and his secretary, and that the MRND executive bureau had a unit for the Interahamwe headed by Turatsinze who was the coordinator of Interahamwe activities at the national level.  Such lists would then be forwarded to the general secretary of the party. 

Now, without delving into matters relating to Turatsinze, which we may deal with tomorrow, can you give us your remarks, your comments relating to this set up, to the lists, and how they were forwarded to the various structures of the party.  
A.	I am not aware of the activities at secteur level.  I am not aware of any such thing.  I never received any list.  From July 1993, yes, I was the chairman of the party.  I had an office at the Kimihurura building, and I received mail at that office.  I never was aware of any such list.  I am not aware of any selection exercises having been conducted at secteur level. 

As you have recommended, maybe we will talk about Turatsinze later on.  I thank you, Mr. President. 
Q.	Mr. Ngirumpatse, AWD, according to that witness, from the time Ndadaye died, a plan was in place for Interahamwe to be trained and that plan was implemented.  Some Interahamwe were trained in Gabiro, others in Bigogwe and in several other locations in Kigali.  Seven hundred Interahamwe had been selected in Kigali town and sent for training, according to AWD, training that lasted one month, and they returned from the training towards the end of December.  Your remarks.  
A.	I am not aware of those training exercises, and I think that I have already answered the question relating to Gabiro and what the position of the cabinet was in relation to that issue.  I have nothing further to add to my previous answer. 
Q.	AWD also talks about training in early 1993, and at that time at the Kimihurura military camp, the Presidential Guard.  What do you say to that?  
A.	I heard that from his mouth, from his own mouth.  I have never heard anyone else talk about training in the Presidential Guard camp in Kigali.  That camp was, for all intents and purposes, inaccessible.  You know, people don't just have access to military camps like that.  So it is not simply because maybe somebody was in the neighbourhood that they would know what was happening within the camp.  

But my answer is that I am not aware of these allegations. 
Q.	What about military training alleged to have taken place, alleged by Witness HH, to have taken place in the Kabuga building? 
A.	Well, Mr. President, Your Honours, the Kabuga building is in the heart of the city.  Maybe if we are lucky the Trial Chamber will be able to see the situation of that building first-hand.  

You see, it was not possible for military training to be provided in a building in the heart of the city.  For one thing, arms produced a lot of noise; two, military training is not provided in a building.  It usually takes place in an open field.  And so I do not see how it would have been possible for military training to be provided in a building in the heart of the city.  

The people, the press, the opposition, everybody would have blamed us if we had done any such thing.  So I don't know whether that question even deserves an answer. 
Q.	Yet HH is formal about his testimony when he indicates that a stray bullet actually broke some windows.  
A.	In my capacity as an official of the MRND, I never received any bill from Kabuga for his windows to be repaired.  I never saw any such thing.  And that usually is the first thing a tenant -- rather, a landlord would do, to protest against such activities and submit a bill.  I never received any bill and I never heard any protests. 
Q.	HH also claims that there was training in Bigogwe and Butotori.  He says that he did not go to those locations but that those who had been there told him of the said military training at those locations.  And he also said that he saw some 200 to 300 people in Kigali in busses going for training.  What do you say to that? 
A.	I am not aware of that.  I was not aware that HH had people reporting to him from various locations in the country.  In what capacity would he have done so?  So this is a pure fabrication. 

But let us not forget that this witness had been promised freedom, but that to the contrary he received a life sentence in solitary confinement after his testimony before this Tribunal, whereas, he had been promised freedom or a more lenient sentence. 
MR. WEYL:
Well, Mr. President, maybe we should stop here, with your leave, and resume tomorrow morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's 1 o'clock now.  It's time to ask you how you are proceeding, how much more time do you anticipate you require to complete your examination-in-chief. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, you know, we have to address a number of issues in the indictment, and I believe that we are within the time frames indicated earlier.  And if I may, I have gone lightly above halfway through my examination-in-chief.  

Well, the Trial Chamber may also have noticed that in the approach to our examination-in-chief, there are a number of issues that are, more or less, akin to a cross-examination, because we want to afford Mr. Ngirumpatse an opportunity to explain things that were alleged against him by various witnesses and to deal with a number of challenges.  So we are within the indicated time frames.  And maybe Mr. Hometowu can indicate to us whether we are around our 15-hour mark in our examination-in-chief. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, the entire examination-in-chief so far lasted 14 hours, 5 minutes.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 

We can take our adjournment now until tomorrow morning.
(Court adjourned at 1302H)
