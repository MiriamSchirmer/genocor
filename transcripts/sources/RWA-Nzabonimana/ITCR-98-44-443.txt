assistant trial attorney; Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Marie Ka, case manager; 
Efrem Mutashya, language assistant, and we have our intern with us, her name is Marion.

MR. NG'ARUA: 
Her first name is Jamet.  Thank you, Madam.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:

MR. NG'ARUA:

MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Good morning, Madam President.  Good morning, Your Honours.  The Defence bench this morning is composed of:  Philippe Larochelle; Nathalie Leblanc; myself; our investigator, Célestin Kagango, and our intern, Élise Legall.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  We note that the Accused has a new look.  We hope that he is more comfortable.  

Yes, Witness, the Trial Chamber would like to remind you about the declaration that you made to tell the truth, and to remind you that you'll continue to testify bearing that declaration in mind this morning.  And we want to say good morning once again to you.  

THE WITNESS: 
Good morning, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Prosecution Counsel.  We are in open session, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes.  I think the questions that I may go into may require a closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  

Registry, kindly arrange for a closed session.  

Members of the public, we request you to leave as this is a protected witness and the evidence might give his identity away.  We regret that.

(Pages 1 to 2 by Rebecca McCoy)






















MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President.  We are now in open session, Madam President.  However, the Prosecutor has something to say before the witness gets in.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes, Counsel for the Prosecution. 
MR. NG`ARUA:  
Thank you, Madam President.  Madam President, we had some documents to tender into 
	exhibit -- into -- as exhibits, and we had -- you had decided that we shall do that immediately after T24.  
	My Lords, the first document that we wish to tender into evidence is No. 6 on your -- on the folder.  And the motivation for it was served on the Defence on the 27th of April 2010.  This is a confession and guilty plea of T24, dated 20th August, 2008, and precisely, page 8 and 9 of that confession.  May it be marked as a Prosecution exhibit.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
No objection. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, in which language is it?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, it is in Kinyarwanda and it was read into the record, but just for completeness we would like the Court to have it while we make efforts to ask the registrar to have it translated into English and French. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The guilty pleas -- the confession guilty plea of Witness T24 of 20th August 2008, in Kinyarwanda with it's motivation, is entered as a Prosecution exhibit?  
MR. MWAMASAGULA:
Prosecution Exhibit P.  34.
MADAM PRESIDENT:
P. 34. 
MR. MWAMASAGULA: 
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness.  It will be P. 33A, the Kinyarwanda one.  When a translation of it is made in French will be P. 34B and the English will be P.34C.  
(Exhibit No. P. 34A, P. 34B and P. 34C admitted, under seal) 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  The next exhibit we would like to tender, My Lord, is number 7 on the list. Sorry, My Lords, the next document that we would like to have tendered into -- as an exhibit, is 
	number 7 on the tab.  This is a Defence document, taken from the Mugunga secteur of Gacaca trial, the case of T24.  And these were the complaints by (By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover). These documents show the findings of the 
	Gacaca trial.  My Lords, there's a motivation for the production of this document, dated 27th April 2010. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Maybe, Learned Counsel, we should go into a short closed session.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry.

MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Defence counsel.
WITNESS T31,
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  You should have before you a document.  You probably have it -- it is known as a personal identity sheet.  On that sheet you have your particulars, which will be placed under seal by the Chamber and that means that nobody can have access to that sheet, but you need to check through the sheet and show that the information contained therein is accurate.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Yes, Madam President, Your Honours, before my learned colleague continues, we don't have the PIS of this witness.  If we could have that also.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, switch off your microphone.  Did you get a copy from the Defence?  
Learned Counsel for the Defence, we take it that the witness can read the PIS for himself; is that the case? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I think so.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	Witness, do you have the form before you?  That sheet, do you have it on the table in front of you? 
A.	I have it before me, Madam President.  
Q.	Do you understand that the document contains your name, your parents' name, your place of birth, where you lived in 1994, your occupation at the time, your present occupation, and where you now live? 
A.	Yes, I've seen all of that.  
Q.	Is that information correct? 
A.	It is correct.  
Q.	So, I have to ask you to sign the document.  If you have a pen -- if you don't have, one will be given to you.  
A.	Where do I have to append my signature?  On what part of the sheet? 
Q.	At the bottom.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
Says counsel.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Prosecution, any objection? 
MS. MAPOSA: 
No objection, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Defence Counsel, we are pre-empting your request.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Well, my request will be very original.  I would like this document admitted into evidence, under seal, of course.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Registry, what number will this exhibit be? 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
It will be Defence Exhibit number 12, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The personal identification sheet of this witness is entered as Defence Exhibit 12, under seal, as it contains the personal particulars of this witness, a protected witness. 
(Exhibit No. D. 12 admitted, under seal)
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Noted, Madam President.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Well then, I would like to request for a closed session since I am going to address issues that could reveal the witness's identity.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, for the reasons given by Learned Counsel for the Defence we will go into closed session. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 42 to 60] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 40 to 41 by Eleanor Bastian) 











MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
We are now in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, please be very careful with what you say.  Do you know of any military training that may have taken place on the 8th of April, around the home of Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	No, I wasn't a witness to any such exercises of military training. 
Q.	On the 8th of April 1994, did you hear people who were shooting using firearms in your secteur of **************** 
A.	Could you please repeat the date? 
Q.	8th April 1994.  
A.	We didn't hear any shooting on that day.  It was rather on the 10th or the 13th -- 13th of April, when we heard gunshots at the time when the attackers who were attacking refugees were being shot at.  This was at the border between Mahembe and Mugunga secteurs, and that was on the 13th, one-three.  
Q.	Witness, let's now talk about the 9th of April 1994.  Did you attend any meeting in Mbuye with Nzabonimana? 
A.	No, I did not attend any such meeting and I did not hear about the meeting.  If I had attended such a meeting, other members of the population would have seen me at that meeting.  In reality, I did not attend any such meeting on that day and I heard no one talk about a meeting held on the 
	9th of April. 
Q.	Without telling us where you were tried, can you tell the Trial Chamber whether in your country, you were tried and sentenced for having distributed weapons to the population and for having organised training for these members of the population in the handling of firearms and 
	traditional weapons? 
A.	I appeared before two courts.  Before the first court, I was acquitted and before the second court, I was sentenced to *********************.  That was in ********.  When I was repatriated from the Congo, it was the 24th of November, and on the ***************************, I was immediately arrested and detained.  In ******** I was released without any case file having been prepared against me. 
Q.	These are details which could identify you.  So I would ask you questions about your 
	judicial records in a short while.  My question was:  Without giving us any details, were you ever tried and sentenced for having participated in any meetings to distribute weapons to the population, meetings organised by Callixte Nzabonimana, yes or no? 
A.	No, I did not hold any such meetings.  I did not organise meetings with the purpose of distributing weapons to members of the population and members of the population could, indeed, testify to this fact. 
Q.	Were you accused of this? 
A.	No, this fact was never mentioned during the cases that were brought against me.  I was accused for other events. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Would the Trial Chamber like us to take a break now? 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is time for the afternoon break.  	

Witness, you are still testifying.  So do not discuss your evidence during the short break that we are going to take.  Do not leave your seat until the curtains have been drawn.  And these proceedings are adjourned to 35 minutes to five -- 35 past five -- past four, sorry. 
(Court recessed at 1605H)
(Pages 61 to 62 by Haruna Farage)
























(Court resumed at 1637H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The proceedings are resumed.  We are still in open session, Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, can you please tell us when the killings began in your secteur?  And if you need to mention names of people in order to answer my question, I will ask the Chamber to grant a closed session.  
A.	Thank you.  I think that we should go into a closed session because I will be forced to mention names.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
All right.  

Registry, could you kindly arrange for the Trial Chamber to go into a closed session, for the reasons stated by the witness.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
And, Registry, we have no CaseView at the moment.  We need it badly.  The English Judges -- the English-speaking Judges, we don't have the CaseView.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
We are trying to sort it out, Madam President.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 64 to 73] was extracted and filed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
