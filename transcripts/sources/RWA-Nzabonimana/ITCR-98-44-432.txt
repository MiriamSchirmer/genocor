MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  The proceedings are resumed.  

Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I can hear you well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good morning.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Before we resume the testimony of the witness, can we have the appearances of the parties for the record, starting with the Prosecution. 
MR. MAPOSA:
Madam President, Your Honours, the Prosecution appearance is as yesterday.  Thank you, Madam President, and good morning to you, Your Honours. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel. 

Defence Counsel?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Good morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Defence bench remains the same.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Witness, the Trial Chamber reminds you of the oath you took at the beginning of your testimony.  Keep it in mind as you continue to testify.  And, please, break your narration and speak slowly so as to facilitate interpretation and recording of your evidence.  

We are in open session, Learned Counsel for the Defence.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well, Madam President.  I would request that we continue like yesterday in closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  Is it absolutely necessary that we stay in closed session?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Yes, Madam President, I think we're continuing the examination of yesterday with the same constraints.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We'll see.  
Registry, let's go into closed session, please.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.

MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
We are in closed session, Madam President - sorry.  We are in open session, Madam President.  I'm sorry.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Registry.  

Yes, Madam Prosecutor. 
MS. MAPOSA: 
Madam President, I can see the witness is raising his hand. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness.  We are in open session.  Be careful what you say.  
THE WITNESS:
I had personally asked that my whole testimony be heard in closed session, because if we move to an open session, the public will be able to easily recognise me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, the Trial Chamber is very mindful of the fact that you are a protected witness, and that the public should not get hold of any information whatsoever leading to your identity.  That is the reason why since you started your testimony, we have been in closed session.  

Now, we rely on counsel, who are officers of this Chamber to advise us as and when they consider that the questions they are going to put to a witness will not identify them.   So have no fear; if any question is put to you, which we consider might identify you, we will intervene and go into 
closed session before you can answer.  So feel comfortable.  There is no problem.  

Have you understood, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood.  And I believe that I -- if I ever were to believe that my answer to a question may reveal my identity, I will inform you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, indeed, you can, on your part, inform the Chamber, if you think the answer you want to give will identify you. 

Yes, Prosecution.  
MS. MAPOSA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	Witness, you agree with me, don't you, that the issue of children is a recent invention because it's nowhere in your statement? 
A.	This issue doesn't appear in my testimony -- in my statement, but I believe I did mention it yesterday.  I stated that we had left some children at the home of -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I don't know whether I should mention this, Madam President.  A name has been mentioned by the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, you can withhold the name until we go into a closed session later.

Witness, don't mention names of places that may identify you, as we are in open session.

Yes, Madam Prosecutor.  
BY MS. MAPOSA:
Q.	And, Witness, you only brought in this issue of children in order to justify your otherwise unbelievable itinerary; isn't that so? 
A.	What I have told you is the truth.  And those children left before we did, and when we followed them, we wanted to go and take them back.  I am telling you that you cannot limit yourself to a statement, because if one has to say everything in a statement, that would make up thousand of pages. 
Q.	And, Witness, did you see what the relatives of Mr. Nzabonimana were carrying in the pickup Hilux which they brought with them to Nyabikenke commune? 
A.	You are speaking about the pickup which was carrying his younger brother?  I mean, the younger brother who came together with his wife.  
Q.	Yes, Witness, that pickup.  
A.	I was unable to see the items they were carrying on that pickup.  I didn't see the pickup arrive, but I wasn't curious enough to go and see what was being carried on the pickup. 
Q.	You don't know, Witness, because you were not at that location.  If you were there, you could have seen the furniture that the relatives of Mr. Nzabonimana were carrying in that pickup, isn't that so? 
A.	I was present.  And as for the items being transported, maybe they had their bags that they were carrying.  But since I was in hiding, I had no reason to come out and go out and check on what that pickup was carrying, especially because that pickup was carrying members of her family.  So it would have been impolite on my part to go and peep -- to go and see what they were -- what it was transporting.  So you can understand that I was unable to do that.  Otherwise, maybe it could have well been transporting baggage or mattresses, but I didn't go as far as going to check on what items the pickup was carrying or transporting. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
MS. MAPOSA: 
I'm sorry to interrupt the witness, Madam President, but it appears he is delving into some issues that may identify him.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel.  

Registry, could we -- could you arrange for us to go into closed session.  

Members of the public, we regret you have to leave at this moment because this is a protected witness and the information he is due to give might identify him.

  MR. MWAMASANGULA:
      We are in open session, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Good afternoon, Madam Witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
Good day, everyone.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Registry, can you administer the oath to the witness. 
(Declaration made by Witness T59 in Kinyarwanda) 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness T59, can you hear the Trial Chamber? 
THE WITNESS: 
I can hear you very well.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Witness, we want to give you a briefing on how the proceedings will be conducted during your testimony.  And the first thing we want you to get to know is how to switch on and off your microphone.  Thank you, Witness.  When you are not speaking, kindly switch it off, as if you leave it open and another one is opened, it will interfere with translation of your testimony and its recording.  

The proceedings in this Tribunal are conducted as follows, Witness:  The Defence team on 
your left -- seated on your left hand will lead questions -- will ask you questions to lead your evidence.  When they have finished asking you questions, the Prosecution will, in turn, put questions to you.  And the Prosecution is seated on your left -- on your right, in front of the translation booth.  When the Prosecution has finished asking you questions, the Judges may ask you questions as well.  But that does not prevent them asking you questions at any time during your testimony if they feel that they require a clarification from you.  

Make your narrative short and brief, and to the point.  Answer questions directly.  And if you have not understood a question ask for it to be repeated.  

If a question is not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  And unless it has said so, you are required to answer all the questions that are put to you.  

You are also required to be courteous to everybody in this courtroom.  Likewise, everybody in this courtroom is obliged to be courteous to you.  

Currently, we are in open session.  If any of the counsel that are conducting these proceedings, through putting questions to you, consider that the questions that they are going to put to you will identify you, they will alert the Trial Chamber, which will quickly go into closed session, so that you don't give away information that may identify you.  

And you, on your part, if you feel that the answer you are about to give might give away your identity, don't hesitate to alert the Chamber regarding this matter, because it's very important.  

With these brief directions in mind, we hope that your testimony will quickly come to an end, if you keep them in mind.  

Have you understood, Witness? 
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I have understood, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel. 
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
Thank you, Madam President.  I would start by requiring somebody to read out the personal identification sheet of the witness to her.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Has it been placed in front of the witness?  
MR. LAROCHELLE: 
I'm not sure. 
MR. MWAMASANGULA: 
Yes, Madam President, it is in front of the witness. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, could a Kinyarwanda interpreter --
BY MR. LA ROCHELLE:
Q.	Madam Witness, are you able to read French? 
A.	No.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, could a Kinyarwanda interpreter kindly come down to assist the witness? 

Just a moment, Witness.  Is there a correction?  And if it is made now, wouldn't it identify you because we are in open session, Witness? 

THE WITNESS: 
Yes, I think something needs to be corrected in respect of my place of birth.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Registry, can we go into closed session, please? 

Witness, hold on.  

Can we go into closed session, please?
