MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  The Chamber greets you all with best wishes for 2011. 

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please. 
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, and Judge Vagn Joensen, is now sitting in open session today, Monday, the 10th of January 2011, for the resumption of the trial in the matter of the 
Prosecutor versus Karemera et al., Case No. ICTR-98-44-T. 

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

Could we have the appearances. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Good morning and happy new year to the Court and to the Defence and the registry.  The Prosecution is represented by myself, Don Webster, along with Maria Wilson, Takeh Sendze and Aidan Leonard, among others who are not present in the court today.  But the representation continues as it has been in the past.  Good morning to all. 
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours.  Happy new year to you, and I wish you good health throughout this year of 2011, as well as peace and happiness and especially serenity.  

I would also like to extend my wishes to the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as to the registry, and obviously to all members of the various Defence teams.  

Today, Mr. President, I am with Mr. Édouard Karemera, whom I am representing; 
Mr. Bernard Munyanziza, our investigator; Ms. Majda Dautovic, who has just joined the Karemera team.  And in the absence of Counsel Sow and Ms. Fatou Ndour, thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, my respects and the best wishes from my team at the beginning of this new year and all the wishes as you know relate to the full conduct of the proceedings and all the interests we can derive from -- or the interests that can be derived by the accused, Mr. Ngirumpatse, as well as the emergence of the truth. 

Mr. President, as I said, I am representing Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I am assisted by Marina Yetongnon, our legal assistant; Jean-Paul Simbizi and Jean Chrysostome Ntirugiribambe, who are our investigators.  The Chamber is aware that lead counsel, Chantal Hounkpatin, is unwell for a period which we are unable to say at this time.  So the Chamber would appreciate that this is a destabilising factor in our team, and, therefore, I wish that in the circumstances the Chamber will understand the mishaps that may occur in its work owing to ill health of lead counsel, and I also take this opportunity to wish her a speedy recovery. 

And as the proceedings reopen, I would also want to wish a happy new year to all the staff of the Tribunal and obviously to the Office of the Prosecutor, notwithstanding the interest, which is sometimes divergent, and obviously once more to the Defence team of Édouard Karemera because we are involved in this common purpose to ensure the manifestation of the truth. 

Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On behalf of the Chamber and the registry, I just express appreciation for the good wishes that have been extended by all counsel.  We do look forward to a happy and successful tour of duty for everybody during the coming year. 

Mr. Webster, we have to -- really, it's Ms. Diagne.  We have to welcome a new member of your team.  You indicated that there is a new member of your team, and we would just like to express a welcome to him and to wish that he has a successful tour of duty -- to her.  Sorry. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honours, it may not be necessary at this point, but let me offer the following comment in response to Maître Weyl:  I did receive a letter from Madam Hounkpatin that was addressed to the Judges indicating that she wanted to start -- or did not want to start the direct examination of Mathieu Ngirumpatse until the 20th of January.  The Prosecution has no objection to that, but we would assume that all other witnesses will have completed their evidence by the 20th of January.  So just for the clarity of the Chamber or the record, we have no problem with Madam Hounkpatin's suggestion.  But our understanding is that all other witnesses will have completed their testimony by then. 

And then on a housekeeping matter, this Chamber issued a decision on the 16th of December 2010 in regard to the admissibility of a speech by Joshua Ruzibiza, and it admitted that speech.  I would like to get a number for it and hand up the text that should be admitted now.  

I have shown what I plan to -- or what I suggest to be admitted to the Defence team and there didn't seem to be an objection.  My suggestion is that it be given 558A and B.  A would be annexure 3 from the submission made by the Prosecution on the 13th of December 2010, which would be the affidavit of Jochen Peters, a copy of his identification card and a copy of the speech where he has initialled the lower right-hand corner, and 558B would be the same text of the speech but printed on an 
eight-and-a-half by eleven sheet of paper which is easier to read.  So there is no difference in the substance of the text.  It's just a question of legibility.  I don't think there should any problem.  I have both here, and I would hand them up to Mr. Issa with the Court's permission. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Issa, could you assist.  

We have no problems with the method proposed, and we would make the appropriate orders. 
MR. WEBSTER:
So that would be 558A and B, and I've labelled them on the back for the ease of the registry. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
With regard to the date of the commencement of Mr. Ngirumpatse's testimony, we don't make any orders as yet.  We have taken note of the correspondence, and we will address it in due course. 
MR. WEBSTER:
If Mr. Issa could collect this from me, please.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Mr. Weyl, are you ready to start your witness this morning?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am ready as much as I can.  I am available to the Chamber and ready to start the examination-in-chief of the witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does this witness have a protective status at this stage?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the witness was protected but has waived her protection.  But as usual, I would request that you get the witness to confirm that she is waiving those protective measures from her own mouth. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Madam Witness. 
THE WITNESS:
Good morning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The Chamber had previously made an order for your protection.  One element of this would be that your identity would be concealed from the public as a witness.  It has been drawn to our attention that you wish to waive those protections that we have made on your behalf, and we would be just grateful if you could let us know what the position is. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes.  I wish to testify in full view. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you testified in any other cases before this one?  
THE WITNESS:
No. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we make the order waiving the protection order that we made on your behalf. 
MR. MJUI:
Your Honour, before we continue I would like to correct the exhibit number mentioned by the Prosecutor.  The document mentioned as P. 558, we have already assigned as P. 557.  But the correction is, it will be A and B.  So it will not be P. 558.  It will be P. 557.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
(Exhibit No. P. 557A and P. 557B admitted)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Witness, before you begin to testify, you have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will now assist you to do that. 
MR. MJUI:
Thank you, Your Honour.
(Declaration made by Delphine Ngirumpatse in French) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  You will now give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel, first of all, by Counsel Weyl representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse.
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.
DELPHINE NGIRUMPATSE, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, good morning.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	Witness, first of all, I would like to direct your attention to some rules of operation in this Chamber.  The first is that you are a French speaker and I am also a French speaker, but my questions and your answers have to be interpreted into English, and that means that the interpreters should perform their work as best as possible.  Hence you are advised to observe a pause before you answer my questions and that in your answer you speak slowly -- or quite slowly.  I would have to remind you if you speak too fast. 

The second advice is that for some names to be properly recorded, they have to be spelt out.  And when you mention some unusual names for the first time, I would like you to spell them out for the transcripts. 

At this stage, I would like you to tell the Court your first name and your surname.  
A.	My name is Delphine Ngirumpatse.  Ngirumpatse is spelt N-G-I-R-U-M-P-A-T-S-E.
Q.	What is your date of birth? 
A.	26th of September 1976 (sic). 
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, before you you have a document titled "Personal Identification Sheet of 
	Witness BXZ (sic)".  I would like you to read it over attentively and to ensure that there are no mistakes therein.  If there are any mistakes, I would like you to correct them.  And upon completing that exercise, I would like you to date the document, that is, 10th of January 2011, and then append your signature at the bottom of that document.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Issa, could you please retrieve the document after showing the document to the Chamber and to the parties. 

I would apply for its admission into evidence as Exhibit D. NG191. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.
(Exhibit No. D. NG191 admitted) 
MR. WEYL:
I am obliged, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, we are aware that you were born in September 1975 in Kigali.  How old were you, therefore, when Rwanda was attacked by the RPF in 1990? 
A.	I was 18. 
Q.	I am referring to 1990.  
A.	I was 15. 
Q.	How old were you in April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane was attacked? 
A.	I was 18. 
Q.	How did your teenage years go? 
A.	My teenage years were pretty difficult because Rwanda was in a state of war.  So that period was pretty complicated. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court -- or can you give the Court a concise profile of your education.  
A.	Would you like me to start off from primary school?  
Q.	The basics of what you deem relevant for the Chamber's attention in terms of your education and your level of education.  Where did you attend school? 
A.	I started secondary school in Kenya in Nairobi, and from the third year I continued in Kigali at the Belgian school, and I completed my last year of secondary school in the Belgian school of Bukavu where I graduated. 
Q.	You have mentioned to the Court that you attended the Belgian school in Kigali as part of your educational background.  Could you be more specific as to that period.  
A.	During that period we tried to forget the state in which Kigali and Rwanda were.  So we tried to lead normal adolescent lives by engaging in various activities that would take our attention away from that situation. 
Q.	So when did you start your education at the Belgian school, in which year, and when did you stop attending the Belgian school? 
A.	I started school at the Belgian school of Kigali in 1990, and my studies were interrupted in 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane was attacked.  Then I went to the Bukavu Belgian school in June 1994. 
Q.	Could you mention to the Court the names of some of your school -- or classmates at the Belgian school, particularly those who were your closest friends.  
A.	We had our neighbours, the Mbonyumutwa family, the children being Maryse, Patrice and Gustave.  M-B-O-N-Y-U-M-U-T-W-A for Mbonyumutwa.  

There was also Corneille Nyungura.  N-Y-U-N-G-U-R-A for Nyungura.  Kiko or otherwise known as Frédéric Mugwaneza.  Mugwaneza.  M-U-N-G-W-A-N-E-Z-A (sic) for Mugwaneza.  Among other friends. 
Q.	During that period did you and those -- your friends discuss the prevailing political situation in Rwanda, or did you discuss the events that occurred during that historical period from 1990 to 1994? 
A.	No, not at all.  As I mentioned previously, we tried to shift our minds away from the tensions at the time, and we talked about video clips, films and youth love, so to speak. 
Q.	What is your relationship with Mathieu Ngirumpatse, Madam Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I am proud to be his daughter. 
Q.	During that period, from 1990 to 1994, was your father -- were your father's political activities discussed in school?  Was the fact that you were Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter of any consequence in respect of questions being put to you or any points being raised with you in relation to your father's political activities? 
A.	No, not at all, because I did not meddle with my father's political life, and I never met anyone who wanted to discuss such issues with me. 
Q.	While you were at the Belgian school, did you have any conversations -- or did you ever become aware that your father was an extremist or that he held ethnic-based or regionalist views? 
A.	No, because we did not discuss politics neither at school nor with my friends.  But given that I know my father, I know that he is not an extremist and he is not a regionalist. 
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, in that context, were issues of ethnicity of any significance in your relationships? 
A.	Frankly speaking, I only became aware of issues of ethnicity in 1990; the point being that we never took those matters into consideration within our family. 
Q.	Was the ethnicity of your friends of any significance to your mind? 
A.	No.  Not at all because I did not know which ethnic groups they belonged to. 
Q.	Did you know for yourself which ethnic group you belonged to? 
A.	I only became aware of it when I was granted an identity card at age 16 because the identity cards bore reference to one's ethnicity. 
Q.	And what was your ethnicity? 
A.	My identity card had the entry Hutu under ethnicity. 
Q.	In your daily relationships were you identified as belonging to another ethnic group? 
A.	When my father returned to work in Rwanda, having served as ambassador in Germany, I do recall that some children told us that we were Tutsi because we had slim hands.  And so when we got home and asked our father who or what was a Tutsi, he did not provide an answer. 
Q.	I thank you, Witness.  Now, I would like you to tell the Court as precisely as you can what your understanding of the principles that guided your education were.  
A.	Respect for life, respect for one's neighbour, the truth, loyalty, integrity. 
Q.	Those values were important for the Ngirumpatse family; is that not so? 
A.	These are values that we inculcated and that we observed to be practiced in the daily lives of our parents. 
Q.	You are aware that your father was a very active man in several areas:  Cultural, professional, political and otherwise.  Did his activities impact negatively on your family life? 
A.	Well, my father never came home with those activities, except for the music that he composed on the piano at home.  The other activities he was engaged in did not come home with him. 
Q.	Did it ever happen that your father would engage in political activities at home? 
A.	No.  Our house was a family cocoon reserved for family activities. 
Q.	Did any politicians frequently visit you at home? 
A.	No.  Like I have already stated, the activities at home were essentially family activities or activities with other relationships.  So no politician came to our house. 
Q.	Witness, it has been your testimony that you did not discuss politics with your friends at the 
	Belgian school.  Did you engage in political activities elsewhere? 
A.	No.  As I stated earlier, I tried to shift my mind away from the prevailing situation in Rwanda.  And with my friends we discussed video clips and other issues. 
Q.	Did you ever have any discussions of a political nature with your father? 
A.	No.  Never.  When he came home we discussed other issues such as culture or my studies or music or movies. 
Q.	Did you ever hear your father make any statements that were anti-Tutsi? 
A.	No.  I never heard my father say anything anti-anybody, including anti-Tutsi. 
Q.	So did you ever hear him call for the extermination of the Tutsi? 
A.	No.  As I mentioned earlier, my father held human life in great esteem, and I never heard him call for the extermination of Tutsis. 
Q.	Did Mathieu Ngirumpatse, as far as you may have noticed, make any choices in terms of his relationships on grounds of ethnicity?  In other words, did he have friends or relationships only with persons of Hutu ethnicity? 
A.	That is a difficult question for me because I was not personally aware of people's ethnicities in Kigali.  It is only subsequently that I found out that his father -- or, rather, his driver was a Tutsi.  So my answer would be that he did not choose his friends or relationships on the grounds of ethnicity. 
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, did your father at any time whatsoever incite or urge you to join the MRND? 
A.	No.  Never.  And as I have already told you, my father and I never discussed politics, and he never urged me to embrace his ideas or his opinions or even his activities. 
Q.	Did he incite or urge you to engage in proselytism in favour of the MRND before your friends or other persons you may know -- may have known? 
A.	No.  He never urged me to engage in proselytism because we never, as I said, discussed any politics. 
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, in which secteur of Kigali did you live? 
A.	The neighbourhood in wish we lived was called Kicukiro.  K-I-C-Y-C-I-K-R-O (sic). 
Q.	And in which secteur of Kigali is that? 
A.	In which neighbourhood was the Belgian school located?  The Belgian school was located downtown close to Radio Rwanda. 
Q.	How did you travel to school from your home, and how did you return home from school? 
A.	Papa's driver took me to school and then dropped him at the office every morning.  And he would come to fetch me at noon, and then we would go home and return to school in the afternoon at 2 p.m. and then go back at the end of the day together. 
Q.	Do you remember who that driver was, that driver who had the privilege to drive you to and from school? 
A.	Yes.  His name was Gérard. 
Q.	Can you tell the Court and maybe describe, as far as you can recall, what this driver looked like and how old he was and maybe mention his ethnicity as well, if you can.  
A.	As I told you, it is only subsequently that I found out that Gérard was Tutsi.  I did not know previously that he was Tutsi.  I was also not aware of his age, but he must have been 50 or so, or thereabouts, and he was bald. 
Q.	Thank you.  Ms. Ngirumpatse, do you remember whether, your father being such an official, your home was provided security?  Did you have guards at your Kicukiro residence? 
A.	I know -- or, rather, what I remember is that at some point when I returned from school we had some guards, and I believe they were gendarmes.  And my mother explained to me that while we were in school a group of youth had attacked my father, and so the gendarmerie had, I guess, decided to provide him with personal guards, but those guards were not assigned for a long time. 
Q.	Do you know why the guards were taken away or not left on that assignment? 
A.	Well, not quite.  I do not know.  But I believe it was because we lived behind a gendarmerie position, and so if we needed assistance we could have received such assistance from the gendarmerie who were nearby. 
Q.	From 1990 to 1994, during that period, did security problems take on greater significance in your life? 
A.	Yes, to the extent that as an adolescent I lost some of my freedom.  My father insisted that we travel to school with his driver and that we refrain from playing around the gate.  And he also stopped me from going on a school trip for security reasons. 
Q.	Were you, however, able to move about, more or less, freely to visit your friends in the neighbourhood?  And could your friends visit you at home as well? 
A.	Yes.  That is what helped us to maintain some sanity, because we were able to visit each other.  My friends would come to my house, just as I was able to go to their homes.
Q.	I thank you, Ms. Ngirumpatse.  Now, I would like to direct your attention, in essence, to the 
	6th of April 1994, to that day and to subsequent days.  Do you recall what your roster or your timetable was like on the 6th of April? 
A.	No, not quite, because prior to the explosion of the presidential plane, the day would have been an ordinary day.  We were on holidays, and I believe that I worked at my mother's restaurant, and then I went back home. 
Q.	Did you subsequently attempt to revisit your activities of that day?  And were you able to somehow reconstruct the manner in which that day unfolded for you after the fact? 
A.	Yes.  I have tried to reconstruct the unfolding of that day.  You see, before the plane exploded, it was really an ordinary day.  And as I have said, I went to work at my mother's restaurant.  It is when we were home and the plane exploded that everything took on an entirely new twist. 
Q.	What was the prevailing atmosphere in general terms in Kigali during that month of April 1994? 
A.	It is quite difficult -- or somewhat difficult to explain, but I do recall that there was tension in the air given that some politicians had been murdered a few weeks or months before, and one would say that it was not a calm atmosphere at that time. 
Q.	As far as you can recall, can you tell us how things took on a different turn and how the 6th of April was affected and how your future was transformed.  
A.	When I returned from my mother's restaurant, I was with Léonidas, one of my cousins, and we were standing outside within our compound when we heard the explosion of the plane.  We immediately returned into the house or entered the house.  And I think that -- although this happened a long time ago, I believe that we heard some gunshots thereafter.  But my memory is not very clear. 
Q.	As far as you can recall, what time was it?  About what time was it? 
A.	Nineteen hours, 20 hours or thereabouts.  I know that a curfew was in place, and we had to close the restaurant a little bit early, around 7 p.m.  So by the time we got home, it must have been 7:30 or 8 p.m. or thereabouts. 
Q.	And once again, as far as you can recall, what happened immediately thereafter, that is, following the explosion which you heard? 
A.	Are you asking about what happened in our home or -- 
Q.	Yes.  At home what did you talk about?  What did you discuss?  What was the reaction of those present in your home? 
A.	Well, my father -- the telephone rang, and I know that my father was worried.  He kept pacing up and down in the house.  And it was shortly later on that he explained to us that the explosion was probably that of the presidential plane. 
Q.	And what happened thereafter at home? 
A.	Well, thereafter, given that one of my aunts was at our home with her son, we were asked to go to our rooms as the firing increased and as the shelling and grenade explosions increased.  So we were asked to go to our rooms. 
Q.	Do you recall whether on that night your father left the house? 
A.	To the best of my recollection, he did not leave the house. 
Q.	You were in your bedroom and you were, therefore, not with your father, so what makes you think -- what makes you say that he did not go out -- or what makes you feel that he did not go out on that night? 
A.	We would have heard a car drive out and dogs.  We also had dogs at home.  The dogs would have reacted if somebody had gone out. 
Q.	Do you know whether your father left the house subsequently, that is, the next day in the morning on the 7th of April? 
A.	I know that some gendarmes came to look for him in the morning. 
Q.	Do you have an idea or can you remember the time, in approximate terms, when they came to look for him? 
A.	No, I cannot really say at what time they came.  All I know is that they had come in the morning. 
Q.	Did your father return home later in the day or any time whatsoever? 
A.	Yes.  He came back home because in the evening he was there.  He was home. 
Q.	To the best of your recollection, what happened in the Ngirumpatse home on the day or in the course of the 7th of April 1994? 
A.	I know that at some point in time there were -- there was a crowd of people who were outside the fence and they finally got into the house because they were seeking for refuge, and it is on that same day that Kiko came to the house after his family had been massacred. 
Q.	Do you have a distinct recollection of those who were present?  Or do you remember some of the persons who came to seek refuge there? 
A.	I do not have a distinct recollection of all the persons who were there because there were numerous persons, but I know that the Nguryunmutwa (sic) family was there, as well as Mr. Karemera and his family. 
Q.	You also mentioned Kiko.  Were there other members of Kiko's family? 
A.	No, because his brother and his sister were in Belgium, and, unfortunately, the rest of his family members had been killed. 
Q.	You have mentioned Kiko or -- and Frédéric Mugwaneza.  Since that fateful day, have you met him once again, or have you had the opportunity to discuss those events with him? 
A.	We meet once in a while in Montreal because he also lives in Montreal.  We never discussed those events because they are really painful to him and to myself. 
Q.	Have you ever spoken to him on a one-to-one basis?  Has he ever confided in you? 
A.	When we get to talk, if at all, we talk about our lives, our current lives, and never about the events that unfolded in Rwanda.  Hence he has never confided in me. 
Q.	Has he at any time voiced hatred or revenge against Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	No.  He has never discussed my father with me. 
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, how long did you stay in Kicukiro in the -- those circumstances alongside the persons who had come to seek refuge in the Ngirumpatse home? 
A.	Personally, I do not quite recall the day we left, but I would say perhaps -- I was told that it was on the 10th of April.  But as far as I can remember, perhaps two or three nights, but I cannot say -- I do not know precisely. 
Q.	You do not precisely recall the date.  Do you recall the circumstances of your departure? 
A.	Yes.  I know that there was a soldier who came home or a gendarme, I think, and he asked my mother -- or he told my mother that we had to leave immediately and that, if we had not boarded the car in the next five minutes, he would leave us behind.  So we all left in a haste. 
Q.	When you say, "We all left in a haste," whom are you referring to when you say "we"?  Are you referring to the Ngirumpatse family?  Could you be more specific.  
A.	Yes.  There was the Ngirumpatse family and also some of the families that had taken refuge in our house. 
Q.	You left in a vehicle.  Can you mention the vehicle you used to leave Kicukiro.  
A.	It was mommy's vehicle.  It was a Pajero. 
Q.	Did the Ngirumpatse family have other vehicles?  Are you positive that it was the four-wheel drive Pajero car you boarded to leave Kicukiro? 
A.	Yes, I am certain because we were quite a number in the car. 
Q.	When you left Kicukiro, did -- was, rather, your father in the car when you left Kicukiro? 
MR. WEBSTER:
Sorry.  Before we continue, I believe Mr. Weyl asked the question, "Did the Ngirumpatse family have other vehicles?"  And I didn't hear a response from the witness to that portion of his question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, perhaps you can answer:  Did the Ngirumpatse family own other vehicles besides the Pajero? 
A.	Yes.  There were two Mercedes cars. 
Q.	What was the colour of those Mercedes?  
A.	One was black, and another one was champagne in colour. 
Q.	When you left Kicukiro, where were the black and champagne-coloured Mercedes cars, to the best of your knowledge? 
A.	They were in the garage. 
Q.	What garage? 
A.	The garage of the house at Kicukiro. 
Q.	So you left Kicukiro with a four-wheel drive Pajero and leaving behind the black Mercedes and the champagne-coloured Mercedes?  
A.	That is absolutely correct. 
Q.	Now, let me come back to my question interrupted by the Prosecutor.  When you left Kicukiro, was your father with you? 
A.	No.  In the Pajero, when I cast my mind at those who were in the car, my father was not there.  There was Frank, a family friend; my cousin Léonidas; my mother; and Monique, my aunt; and her son called Kevin (sic). 
Q.	Where did you go to from Kicukiro? 
A.	We went to the Hôtel des Diplomates and later on to my mother's restaurant. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court the name of your mother's restaurant.  
A.	It was called the Eden Garden. 
Q.	Do you know or do you recall how long you stayed at the Eden Garden and the circumstances under which you left that place? 
A.	Once again, I cannot give you a specific date, but I believe we spent one or two nights there.  But all the same, not more than two nights.  And my parents came to fetch us in the Pajero for us to leave Kigali for Gitarama. 
Q.	When you say "we", who were those present at Eden Garden when your parents came to fetch you? 
A.	There were those of us who were in the Pajero when we left the house, namely, Frank, Monique and her son Earvin, and Léonidas.  And at some point in time when we were at Eden, Monique's two other children arrived, Jupiter and Cynthia.  So those were the persons present, those of us who were in the Pajero initially, including Jupiter and Cynthia, as well as mom and dad. 

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreter would like to make a correction for the record.  Monique's son is Earvin and not Kevin. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, the interpreter wishes to just make a correction, which has taken place, I think. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, Mr. President.  It was Earvin and not Kevin, the son of Monique.  Earvin. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President, for that clarification. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So you left Eden Garden in the Pajero.  Do you confirm that your father was present in the Pajero? 
A.	Yes, because he came to fetch us in the Pajero with mom. 
Q.	Where did you go to from Eden Garden? 
A.	From Eden Garden we went to Gitarama, but we stopped over at the Hôtel des Diplomates.  I think we had to join the government convoy, but I think that convoy had left.  So we left subsequently. 
Q.	Do you, therefore, confirm that you left Kigali for Gitarama in the company of your father in your mother's Pajero?  Are you sure about that? 
A.	Yes, I am. 
Q.	Were you stopped on the way at any time -- at any point in time? 
A.	There were roadblocks on the way, and I think we were stopped at least once. 
Q.	Do you recall the roadblocks, whether they were located near Kigali or near Gitarama? 
A.	I do not quite recall the roadblocks, but we had covered quite some distance, and I believe it was much closer to Gitarama. 
Q.	Did your father leave the vehicle at any point in time? 
A.	No.  Nobody left the vehicle. 
Q.	Do you recall the circumstances under which you crossed that roadblock and which you say you recall? 
A.	I was trying not to look outside or to see what was happening.  But what I know is that my father spoke or negotiated with those who were manning the roadblocks to allow us go through. 
Q.	Do you recall whether at any point in time your father congratulated those who were manning the roadblock? 
A.	The only time he spoke to somebody at the roadblock was to negotiate with that person to enable us go through the roadblock. 
Q.	Did you hear him give orders? 
A.	No.  Rather, he was trying to get us go through the roadblock.  It was not a matter of giving orders. 
Q.	During your journey from Kigali to Gitarama, did you see corpses on the road or at roadblocks? 
A.	I did see some at the beginning, but once I saw -- I saw those bodies I tried to protect myself by shielding myself in the vehicle. 
Q.	Didn't you have a macabre desire to see what was outside? 
A.	No.  The sights I had seen were rather traumatic and I did not intend to see any more. 
Q.	Do you recall how long you stayed in Gitarama? 
A.	Once again, I cannot give you a specific date, but I left Gitarama to continue my studies in Bukavu, and I think I spent about one month or one and a half months in Bukavu.  So perhaps I might have left in mid-April -- mid-May, but I cannot say for sure. 
Q.	When you left Gitarama, was your father in Gitarama? 
A.	No, because when we got to Gitarama, he left a few days later. 
Q.	Do you recall the circumstances under which you left Gitarama?  What mode of transport did you use when you left Gitarama for Bukavu? 
A.	Yes.  There was a gentleman called Mbangura who was going to meet his family at Bukavu or Cyangugu and I left with him. 
Q.	Could you, first of all, spell the name and tell the Court to the best of your recollection who was Mr. Mbangura.  
A.	Mbangura is spelt M-B-A-N-G-U-R-A.  Mbangura.  And I recall that he was a minister, but I do not quite recall in what ministry. 
Q.	I take it that being Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter, driving in a minister's car, your journey to Bukavu was hitch free.  Could you tell the Court more about that.  
A.	No.  The journey was not hitch free because I was threatened with death thrice in the course of that journey. 
Q.	Could you tell the Court the circumstances under which you were threatened and how did you survive those threats.  
A.	There were also roadblocks between the Gitarama and Cyangugu road, and at the first roadblock we were asked to produce our identity cards.  And when they looked into the car, they deemed that my identity card was inaccurate and they wanted to detain me, but Mr. Mbangura negotiated for me to stay in the car. 
Q.	Being Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter, was it any -- did it afford any protection at that roadblock? 
A.	No.  It wasn't any form of protection because during the next -- or at the next two roadblocks, they -- one of the gentlemen insisted that I get out of the car and Mr. Mbangura gave him money.  And then there was another one who pointed out his gun on my head. 
Q.	Would you like us to observe a pause? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Those manning those roadblocks, were they soldiers or civilians, as far as you can remember? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, perhaps at this stage we can take our adjournment five minutes earlier to enable the witness to, you know, sort of get back her spirits. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, the Prosecution has no opposition to that.  We are aware of -- I am not quite sure, but there is a will-say statement for this witness, and if she is going to testify along the lines that I expect, maybe this portion of her testimony should be given in closed session.  I am not sure.  Mr. Weyl knows better than I do.  But what I expect to be forthcoming may be better taken in closed session. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated)...protective measures have been waived. 
MR. WEBSTER:
I understand.  It's not to protect her identity.  It's the substance of what she may be going into.  Mr. Weyl can deal with this issue if it's appropriate.  Maybe I am going down the wrong path. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe you would like to spare the witness the pain.  There are already -- she already has to cope with a lot of painful things, and I do not intend to get into a closed session.  And I believe that we will stay within the limits of what can be heard in a public hearing.  And I would say that I am almost done with my examination-in-chief.  After the adjournment I would be dealing with more general issues. 

Of course, I submit to the wisdom of the Court in respect of the timing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, Mr. Weyl, we have to rely on your advice to a large extent in this area -- on this issue.  We don't know exactly what questions you are going to put to the witness, but we can take the 
	mid-morning recess now.
(Court recessed at 1029H)
(Pages 1 to 15 by Joe Reynosa) 













(Court resumed at 1102H) 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, you may continue. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, are you feeling better?
A.	Yes.  Thanks. 
Q.	We were dealing with a question relating to the difficulties you encountered between Gitarama and Bukavu.  Did your ID card bear your father's name? 
A.	Yes.  Indeed.
Q.	And at each checkpoint did you have to produce your identity card? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	The fact that your identity card showed that you were Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter, did that shield you from the threats? 
A.	No.  They were not interested in knowing who I was or who my father was.  They believed, going by my fine features, that...(no interpretation)
Q.	(No interpretation)
A.	(No interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the interpreter lost the last bit of the witness's last but one answer.  Could she please repeat that bit.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, apparently, there was a problem with the interpretation. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Could the witness --

Witness, could the -- the prop -- the interpreters did not get your last answer.  Could you repeat it, please. 
THE WITNESS:
I said, yes, that's correct. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, actually, it's the question -- 
MR. WEYL: 
And the question was...(no interpretation) 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, it was the last but one answer, that is, the answer prior to this answer the witness has given.  The last bit was lost in translation, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Weyl, maybe the easiest way to resolve it is to just put the question again to the witness so we can move forward. 
MR. WEYL: 
Very well, Mr. President.  That is what I was about to do. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, or Ms. Ngirumpatse, I'm going to put back the question to you.  You were threatened at the roadblocks, notwithstanding the fact that you were Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter? 
A.	Yes.  Absolutely. 
Q.	And despite the fact that your identity card supported the fact that you were Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Thank you, Ms. Ngirumpatse.  Perhaps -- I am drifting to the end of my examination-in-chief.  

So in 19 -- April 1994 being the daughter of Mathieu Ngirumpatse did not offer a safe passage?  
A.	It was not a safe passage.  It was not a passport or a visa.  It didn't help much when you had to deal with people at the roadblocks who were determined to commit evil. 
Q.	Being Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter today -- is it being helpful in any way today? 
A.	I must admit that it doesn't make life any easier for me today.  For instance, when I put in my application for refugee status in Canada, first, I had to prove that I was his daughter.  And after giving such evidence, I had to explain myself on account of the fact that he is in detention here and is standing trial.  So it's not easy at all. 
Q.	Do you hide the fact that you are Mathieu Ngirumpatse's daughter? 
A.	No.  Absolutely not.  I have no reason to hide that fact.  I know he is a man of integrity and he did not commit the crimes for which he is charged.  So I have nothing to hide. 
Q.	In your daily encounters with fellow Rwandans, what do you hear about your father's character or personality? 
A.	The few Rwandans I get to meet tell me that he is a man of integrity and that I should be proud to be his daughter. 
Q.	At this juncture, to close my examination-in-chief, could I ask you -- or perhaps one last question before I conclude.  

Did you -- or you mentioned a while ago among your classmates in the Belgian school -- you mentioned Corneille.  Can you say who Corneille is.  And what relationship do you have or have you had with Corneille?  
A.	Corneille was a friend, a classmate in the Belgian school and a neighbour, and we were close friends.  And during our flight from Rwanda, we met him in Goma.  

And when my mother saw me, she tried absolutely -- or as much as she could to help him flee and to help him meet his parents in Germany.  And we met subsequently in Canada, as he lives in Canada. 
Q.	Did you have an opportunity to discuss with Corneille about the situation prevailing in Rwanda in 1994? 
A.	No.  As with Kiko, we never discussed what happened in Rwanda apart from videos or films we watched or music we listened. 
Q.	To your knowledge, did it so happen that Corneille, in private or in public, has made any remarks about Mathieu Ngirumpatse and his family? 
A.	Yes.  I watched a programme on Canadian television where he stated that my father and mother had helped him flee Rwanda.  In the same programme he further stated that he did not believe my father was a genocidaire. 
Q.	Ms. Ngirumpatse, I have come to the end of my examination-in-chief, and I would like you to tell the Court the reasons why you have come to testify for your -- in your father's trial.  Is it by compulsion?  Is it a duty, or is it because of your family ties?  Can you tell the Chamber why you chose to testify.  
A.	The people of Rwanda lived an unspeakable tragedy.  And I believe the millions of persons who lost their lives, as well as those of us who have survived and who have to rebuild our country to the best of our ability, should -- are looking forward to the day truth will prevail in this Tribunal.  

So I have come to testify here to help the world discover the truth and also to enlighten the Court, if it is not to their knowledge, that my father is not an extremist, that he is a man of integrity, that he believes in human life, and that he has respect for life and that all the charges levelled against him run counter to his beliefs.  And I further believe that the people of Rwanda deserve to know that the persons who stand accused in this trial are not those who committed the crimes.  I believe in the impartiality of this Tribunal. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for the witness.  

And I would like to thank the witness for her contribution to the manifestation of the truth. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Weyl. 

Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions to put to this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
(Microphone not activated)  

	It was just to say no, Mr. President.  I'm obliged. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you.

Madam, you are now going to have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and you'll now have to respond to questions put on behalf of the Prosecution. 
MS. WILSON:
Good morning, Mr. President, Your Honours, colleagues, to all. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	My name is Maria Wilson, and I'm one of the Prosecutors in this case.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, I do have some documents which I have to distribute to Your Honours.  I have, in fact, already distributed them to my colleagues.  

Mr. President, I was simply waiting for the documents to be distributed.  

If I may commence, Mr. President. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Good morning, Madam Witness.  
A.	Good morning. 
Q.	I have some questions to ask you in relation to the evidence that you've given this morning.  

You said that you were one of Ngirumpatse's daughters.  Are -- are you the youngest daughter in that family?  
A.	I am -- oh.  

	Yes.  I am his youngest daughter. 
Q.	And in 1994 did your other siblings also live at home with your father and your mother? 
A.	In 1994 I was the only family member, that is, among the children, who was still at home. 
Q.	And you said you attended the Belgian school in Kigali.  Is that a school that you have to pay fees to attend -- in order to attend there? 
A.	Yes.  One has to pay school fees. 
Q.	So I take it that your father supported you in paying your school fees and generally whilst you continued to live at his house.  
A.	Yes.  He and my mother paid those fees. 
Q.	And subsequently, you went to school in Bukavu.  Yes?  Was that also a school -- a fee-paying school? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Now, you mentioned Jupiter Kayonga.  And that would have been the -- the son of Victor and Monique.  That was your evidence, wasn't it? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	During -- how often did you see Jupiter, if at all, at your home? 
A.	I did not get to count the number of times he came to the house, but he came often to the house. 
Q.	And when he came to -- to the house, did his sister Cynthia also -- also company him to your home? 
A.	Jupiter's entire family, namely, his father, mother, brother, and sister, came to the house. 
Q.	And were there any particular activities that took place, or did they just come to visit the family? 
A.	They were visits among families. 
Q.	So is your answer that there were no particular activities that took place at your home when they visited?  They just came to see you and your family.  
A.	What do you mean by activity specifically?  
Q.	Well, that's what I want you to assist us with.  If -- when they came -- that you're just -- they just came across, what did you do?  Did they just play games?  What did they do when they came to your house? 
A.	Among the children we would play -- we would play the piano; we would play with the dogs while the adults would chat among themselves.  It was like a family visit. 
Q.	And Léonidas, did you see any of him before December of 1990 at your home or at all? 
A.	He also came to visit us. 
Q.	And how often did Léonidas come to visit you before December of 1990? 
A.	Once again, I did not count, but he came as often as he could. 
Q.	But not as often as Jupiter.  Do you agree? 
A.	I am unable to answer that question. 
Q.	Let's move on.  

It seems as if you had very little interest in the politics of Rwanda when you lived there.  Is that a correct statement?  
A.	Yes.  That's correct. 
Q.	But did you at least appreciate the position which your father held in 1994? 
A.	What do you mean specifically?  Do you mean whether I knew what he did or was doing?  
Q.	Do you -- did -- do you know what position your father held in -- was he a member of a political party?  Are you aware of that? 
A.	Yes.  He was chairman of the MRND. 
Q.	And do you agree that as president of the MRND he was in a position of authority? 
A.	I cannot say that he was a figure of authority because of his position.  What I can say is that from the very onset, from as far as I knew him, he had always been in a position of authority. 
Q.	From the time you knew him, he was always in a position of authority by virtue of the positions he held, and one of them was as president of the MRND.  
A.	What I was saying is that he was not in a -- he was not a figure of authority simply or exclusively because he was chairman of the MRND. 
Q.	So explain to me what you mean.  Why did you consider your father a figure of authority? 
A.	I say so because I notice that whenever people had discussions with him they showed a lot of respect and others even referred to him as your excellency although he was no longer serving as an ambassador. 
Q.	So you would agree with me that he had a great capacity to influence others.  
A.	What I would say, rather, is that many people admired him. 
Q.	And respected him?  
A.	Yes.  They also respected him. 
Q.	When he spoke, people listened to what he had to say.  
A.	Yes, among other things. 
Q.	I know you indicated that you were never involved in politics, but did you ever attend any political meetings? 
A.	Personally, no.  I never attended any such meeting.  But I went with him on one or two occasions but not as a participant. 
Q.	I -- I -- not ask you as a participant but just as a mere attendee.  So you -- your answer is that you have, in fact, attended a couple of political meetings.  Is that what you're saying? 
A.	No.  I accompanied him once to a meeting or rally. 
Q.	And do you recall when that was and where the meeting was held? 
A.	I do not exactly recall the date.  But I think the rally took place at the Nyamirambo stadium. 
Q.	And did you ever hear your father give any speeches, and that is, of course, political speeches? 
A.	He delivered a speech at that rally. 
Q.	So that was the only political speech which your father made that you heard? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I will still ask you this:  Did you -- were you aware that your father made a political speech when he was in Nairobi? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So when in your evidence you stated that your -- your father has never made any statements that incite hatred or ethnic -- ethnic differences, that is not based on the fact that you ever heard him make speeches other than the one that you -- you heard.  
A.	No.  It is based on the fact that I know that he has no ethnic-based hatred. 
Q.	Now -- and let's go to the 6th of April 1994.  From your evidence I wasn't clear.  When you first heard about the president's plane being attacked or shot, you -- were you in -- at Eden Garden or at your home? 
A.	I was at home. 
Q.	The reason why I'm asking you that, it's because you said as a result you all had to close Eden Garden early and you left.  So you said you were at home.  Yes? 
A.	No.  I did not say that we had to close earlier.  I said simply that we had to close the restaurant at around 7 p.m.  We did not close the restaurant because of the accident but, rather, because it was time to close it. 
Q.	Okay.  Thank you.  

And who was at home with you -- which -- when you heard of the news of the president's death?  
A.	Papa was there.  Léonidas, my cousin, was there.  Monique and her son Earvin were also there.  And there was Frank and mama. 
Q.	And you say Frank is a friend of the family's; am I correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were there any other -- so were there any other members of your family there, any other siblings present on the 6th when you heard the news? 
A.	No.  As I previously testified, my brothers and sisters were not in Rwanda in 1994. 
Q.	And you said that Monique, your mother's sister, was also present.  When did Monique come to your home?  Or did she always live with your family? 
A.	No.  She did not always live with our family.  I believe that she came in two or three days before the 6th of April. 
Q.	And is it -- you said that your father received calls.  Did he receive many calls on that evening of the 6th of April? 
A.	Yes.  The telephone rang several times that night. 
Q.	And do you know someone by the name of Bagosora? 
A.	No, not in person.  But I know him by name. 
Q.	Do you know if your father received a call from Bagosora that night? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did your father keep you abreast of the persons who -- who were -- received calls from on that evening? 
A.	No.  He did not discuss his phone calls with me. 
Q.	You said in your evidence in chief that you went to bed.  Around what -- you went to your rooms.  Around what time did you go to your rooms that evening? 
A.	I do not recall the specific time.  But it must have been between 11 p.m. and midnight. 
Q.	And what -- around what time did you fall asleep that night?  Can you -- do you have an idea of what time? 
A.	No.  No idea. 
Q.	Now, you said that your father did not leave home that -- that evening.  If you were asleep, you cannot say for certain that he did not leave your home on that evening, can you? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Do you know someone by the name of Brigitte Niyonsaba? 
A.	I know that Karemera's wife is called Brigitte, but I don't know whether her surname is Niyonsaba. 
Q.	I can tell you that Mr. Karemera's wife is called Brigitte Niyonsaba.  

Now, did you -- when did you first meet Brigitte Niyonsaba?  
A.	Well, I don't recall exactly.  I don't know. 
Q.	But you knew her for a long period of time? 
A.	No.  
Q.	And was she a friend of your father's?
A.	I can say yes because from time to time she would come home with her husband. 
Q.	And how often would they come to your home, Mr. and Mrs. Karemera? 
A.	They did not come often, maybe two or three times for dinner. 
Q.	But sometimes your father or your father and mother would go to their homes? 
A.	I am not in a position to answer you, because my parents did not necessarily tell me where they were going. 
Q.	But there was no reason for your parents to keep that away from you, whether they went to visit a friend or not.  Do you agree? 
A.	No. 
Q.	And your mother was also friendly with Brigitte, Mrs. Karemera? 
A.	The only times I saw them together was when Mr. and Mrs. Karemera came home. 
Q.	Have you been to Mr. and Mrs. Karemera's home? 
A.	No.  Never. 
Q.	Are you aware that Mr. Karemera was also a member of the MRND? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you know what position he held?  
A.	I think he was the secretary. 
Q.	Now, do you recall your mother receiving a call from Brigitte on the evening of the 6th of April? 
A.	The telephone rang several times that evening, and I don't know who called.  So my answer would be no. 
Q.	So your mother didn't tell you all the persons she received calls from, did she? 
A.	No.  She did not discuss her telephone conversations with me. 
Q.	Brigitte Niyonsaba gave a statement to the judicial police in Brussels -- 
MS. WILSON:
And here I'm referring to exhibit 1.
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	-- on the 29th of September 1998.  And at page 1 in paragraphs 5, 6, 7, this is what she had to say in relation to whether or not your father left the house.  
MS. WILSON:
So I'm looking at paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 of page 1. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	"Soon after the news of the president's death was announced, my husband received several 
	telephone calls, and people I did not recognise came to fetch him.  He came home around 3 a.m. 

"When he left, I became concerned and telephoned the wife of Mathieu Ngirumpatse, who was the MRND chairman.  His wife confirmed that they...left together." 

This is what Brigitte, Mrs. Karemera, had to say in a statement she gave on the 29th of September 1998.  Is there any reason for Mrs. Karemera to -- to lie in relation to the telephone call she made to your mother?  
A.	She has no reason to lie.  But I am also not in a position to confirm that she effectively placed that phone call and had that conversation. 
Q.	Mrs. Karemera also testified at this trial on the 6th of April 2009.  
MS. WILSON:
And I have, in fact, sent electronic copies of this to the Court and my colleagues.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	She stated that her husband left home -- she gave a -- a different version.  She said her husband left home and never returned and -- so that was her evidence in -- in that regard, that they left home and never returned.  

And later on she went on to create the impression that she was not sure whether or not they were, in fact, together.  But she confirmed that she spoke -- spoke to your mother in this trial.  What do you have to say in relation to that?  
A.	I believe that if you are seeking to find out whether my father went out of the house on the night of the 6th of April -- is that the question?  Is that what you're seeking to establish?  
Q.	I'm seeking to find out from you.  I know I can ask many other people.  I'm seeking to find out from you about that situation.  
A.	I really cannot answer that question.  But I am sure that my father can provide the answer. 
Q.	But you agree that you have no reason to deny what Mrs. Karemera has said? 
A.	I can neither deny nor confirm it.  
Q.	But you accept that you might be mistaken when you said your father did not leave home that night? 
A.	As far as I can recall, he did not leave the house that night. 
Q.	Let us go to the 7th of April 1994.  You gave us -- you informed us that some people came to your home and you -- you referred to Mr. and Mrs. Karemera and Gustave -- Gustave's family.  Apart from them and the persons who were present in your house on the 6th, were there any other persons at your home on the 7th? 
A.	Apart from the Karemera and Mbonyumutwa families, Kiko arrived as well and several other people whom I did not know but who lived in our neighbourhood. 
Q.	And you referred to Rico and you also referred to Frédéric.  Are they one and the same?  Are they the same persons?  Is Rico the nickname of Frédéric? 
A.	The name is Kiko, K-I-K-O.  And indeed that is Frédéric's nickname, Kiko, K-I-K-O. 
Q.	Yes.  And so you gave all the names of the people you can remember who were at your house --
	yes? -- on the 7th.  
A.	I have given you the names of the people whom I know.  There were several other persons whom I did not know. 
Q.	And when you referred to a crowd of people who were calling at the gate and they eventually got into your house, who -- who was this crowd who was at the gate at the time, which of your guests? 
A.	Just people who lived in the neighbourhood who were afraid or frightened and who were seeking refuge.  And since we lived quite close to the gendarmerie, they came to our home. 
Q.	But apart from living close to the gendarmerie, you yourself admitted that your house was guarded at some period in time; correct? 
A.	The house was guarded before the 6th of April. 
Q.	For what period of time was your house guarded, according to you? 
A.	I do not know the specific period.  But I believe, once the danger of the attacks was behind us, they withdrew the guards -- the guards.  But I am not able to tell you how long the house was guarded. 
Q.	But was it up until the month of April? 
A.	No.  They were taken away before then. 
Q.	Do you know someone by the name of Félix Nyamutera? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Just to jog your memory, he lived a mere 200 metres away from your home.  Can you now recall who he is? 
A.	No.  I don't know him. 
Q.	He gave a statement to the OTP on the 22nd of September 1998 -- 
MS. WILSON:
That's exhibit number 4.
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	-- and he stated at page 3 that your father's house was guarded by gendarmes day and night.  What do you have to say in relation to that? 
A.	As far as I can recall, after the attack the guard was kept in place for a while and then withdrawn. 
Q.	So you say as far as you were -- you can recall.  So you might, in fact, be mistaken? 
A.	No.  That is the recollection I have of the situation. 
Q.	Did your father leave the house on the 7th of April? 
A.	Yes.  In the morning gendarmes came to fetch him. 
Q.	Do you know where he was going to? 
A.	No.  I was simply told that he had to leave. 
Q.	Did you later enquire from him where he went? 
A.	No.  It was on that very day that Kiko arrived and we focused our attention on Kiko.  So I did not ask him anything. 
Q.	How did your father become aware that he had to -- to leave -- that he was being picked up at a particular time on that day? 
A.	I am not in a position to answer that question.  I do not know. 
Q.	Did your father return home on that day, on the 7th? 
A.	Yes.  He was there in the evening when we took care of Kiko. 
Q.	And do you know someone by the name of Georges Twagiramuhaza (sic)?  I will spell that.  T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-H-A-Z-A (sic).  Did you know someone by that name? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did your mother not have a brother called Georges Twagiramuhaza? 
A.	I know that his name was Uncle Georges.  I only called him Uncle Georges.  I didn't know his surname. 
Q.	And you knew that he was married? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, did you -- what time did Frédéric arrive at your home, at the family home? 
A.	It must have been in the afternoon, I think. 
Q.	And did he come alone to that -- to your home? 
A.	Are you asking whether he came with someone else from his home?  
Q.	I'm asking you if he came to your -- to your home alone, by himself.  
A.	Gustave went to fetch him. 
Q.	And do you know the circumstances under which you -- your -- you became aware of where Frédéric was prior to coming to your home? 
A.	Yes.  There was a discussion at home.  Somebody had called.  I think it was Mr. Mugenzi who had called to explain what had happened to Frédéric's family and that he was in hiding at his place and wondered whether somebody could come fetch him. 
Q.	And at the time you found that out, apart from Frédéric, were you aware that his grandfather was still in the house with him and alive? 
A.	No.  From the discussions it emerged that only Frédéric was still alive. 
Q.	Was Gustave the first person who attempted to go fetch Frédéric? 
A.	No.  My mother went first, and from what she told me, Frédéric was frightened and did not want to come out.  So my mother returned to the house. 
Q.	There is testimony in this trial from Gustave that -- that at -- the first attempt was -- was made by the gendarmes, the guards, to fetch Frédéric.  Do you recall that? 
A.	No.  I, rather, think that mother was in the company of gendarmes from the gendarmerie. 
Q.	Do you have a proper recollection of the events that occurred surrounding the calls received in relation to the death of Frédéric's father -- family? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question. 
Q.	Do you have a proper recollection of the events surrounding your family going to fetch Frédéric? 
A.	Yes, I do recall. 
Q.	The evidence in this Tribunal from one of the Defence witnesses, Gustave, was that the first -- first attempt was by the gendarmes.  Two gendarmes went to the home of Frédéric, supposedly to look for him.  That was after the first call from Justin Mugenzi.  

Then there was a second call, and then Rose, your mother, went with the gendarmes.  And she could not find him.  

And then on the third occasion, it was then that Gustave went with the gendarmes.  That's how Gustave, a Defence witness, a witness for your father -- that's how he related the incident.  And there were two calls from Justin Mugenzi.  Do you recall that?  If you're unable to, please tell me.  
A.	The discussion I recall is the one that prompted my mother to go to Frédéric's with two gendarmes.  And subsequently, Gustave also went there.  The first discussion I heard is the one -- my mother went to fetch him together with gendarmes. 
Q.	And were you present during the conversation -- the total conversation that took place in relation to Frédéric? 
A.	I was not present throughout the conversation. 
Q.	So -- 
A.	I was present during the conversation before my mother left and before Gustave left or went there. 
Q.	So you're not disputing what Gustave has said to the Court about the two gendarmes going there first.  You're not in a position to dispute that.  Do you agree? 
A.	I cannot dispute nor confirm that. 
Q.	In any event, the wife of your Uncle Georges gave a statement to the OTP.  
MS. WILSON:
That's exhibit 2, page 4 in the English version.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And before I go -- before I go to -- to that statement, did Frédéric indicate who was responsible for the death of his father? 
A.	No, not really.  Because he was in a state of shock, and he mainly said, "Oh, they've killed my parents; they've killed my family," but he did not mention those who were responsible. 
Q.	In a statement given by the wife of your Uncle Georges -- 
MS. WILSON:
And that's exhibit 2 at page 4 in the English version.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	-- she states that she suspects that your father was behind Victor's murder.  And the reason for her -- her suspicion was because of the sudden departure of Monique from Victor's house.  What do you have to say in response to that? 
A.	I know that Monique came to the house because she had family problems, and it was not in any way connected -- or my father was not in any way involved with that. 
Q.	Are you -- you said you're not in -- interested in politics, but are you aware that your father was not pleased with Victor's political affiliations? 
A.	No.  As I have mentioned previously, my father and myself never talked politics.  So it was not to my knowledge. 
Q.	Are you -- you were 18 at the time.  Are you -- were you at least aware of what different parties existed in Rwanda at that time? 
A.	I knew them by their names. 
Q.	And were you aware that Victor's father what -- was in a different party from your father -- that Victor belonged to a different party to the party your father belonged to? 
A.	I did not know the political leanings of Victor. 
Q.	Okay.  Now, how long did Frédéric remain at your home?  Did you remain at your home throughout the same period all the other visitors remained? 
A.	As I have stated previously, I cannot give you an exact date.  But Frédéric left on the same day we left the house. 
Q.	And you said after leaving the house you -- you all went to Hôtel des Diplomates.  On the way to the hotel, did you see any dead bodies? 
A.	No.  I saw -- I saw a few dead bodies, and subsequently, I did not direct my sight at them. 
Q.	And how many of you got into the vehicle that took you to the Hôtel des Diplomates? 
A.	Eight. 
Q.	Eight people were able to fit in that vehicle.  And who were these eight people? 
A.	There was Frank, mom -- oh, no.  Are you referring to when we left Kicukiro?  
Q.	When you left to go home.  
A.	No.  There were six persons.  And they were Frank, mom, Earvin, Léonidas, Monique, and myself. 
Q.	And eventually, you went to Hôtel des Diplomates, and you can't recall how long you stayed at Hôtel des Diplomates? 
A.	No.  We spent maybe one night there. 
Q.	And you -- after -- who stayed at Eden Garden? 
A.	Frank, Léonidas, Monique, Earvin, and myself. 
Q.	And when did you stay there?  Was it after Hôtel des Diplomates? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And for how long? 
A.	About two or three nights. 
Q.	And was it safe to stay at Eden Garden at the time you stayed?  What were the conditions like at that time? 
A.	We were in the basement where we had food.  And we used the couches and the chairs as beds.  And we were as safe as we could have been at the time. 
Q.	And there was a lot of gunshots and shellings going on in the surrounding area at the time? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So it was not exactly the best place for you all to be.  Do you agree? 
A.	There were gunshots all over.  We were safer because we were in the basement.  But then gunshots were heard all over the place. 
Q.	And Jupiter was in a cabinet or cupboard some -- at some point in time whilst he was at Eden Garden? 
A.	Yes.  He hid there because he got frightened when he heard the gunshots. 
Q.	And so why didn't you stay at the Hôtel des Diplomates for all the period? 
A.	I think it was a matter of space and safety because Hôtel des Diplomates was not safer than Eden Garden, because at least at Eden Garden nobody knew that -- that we were there. 
Q.	But your father didn't stay at Eden Garden, neither did your mother.  Do you agree? 
A.	No.  They stayed at the hotel. 
Q.	And there was security at the hotel? 
A.	The government was there.  I think there was a semblance of security.  But it did not make things any safer. 
Q.	But it would have at least been safer than Eden Gardens.  Do you agree? 
A.	No.  We were all in the basement at Eden Garden, and so we were much safer. 
Q.	And you left -- is it -- is it correct that you left from Eden Garden to go to Gitarama but made a stop at Hôtel des Diplomates? 
A.	Yes.  That's correct.
(Pages 16 to 29 by Tanya West)










1215H 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	And from six persons who you said were passing just -- in that Pajero, the numbers increased, according to you, to how many? 
A.	Jupiter and Cynthia came to Eden whilst we were there.  And when we left Eden for Gitarama, 
	my father was also in the car.  So there were three more persons.  
Q.	And you are saying that nine persons were able to fit into that car? 
A.	Yes, because there were persons sitting in the back seat, in the trunk.  
Q.	And you said you left -- you can't remember, when was the date -- you said that someone told you that it was on the 10th that you left.  Who was this someone who told you it was the 10th, because you said you couldn't remember yourself? 
A.	It is later on when I was leaving with my mother, and when we were discussing the events, she's the one who told me that it was the 10th. 
Q.	When did your mother discuss the events with you?  Prior to this trial? 
A.	No.  That is while we were living in Mali or in France, and that was a long time ago.  
Q.	And did she also assist you in recalling other aspects of the events?  
A.	No. 
Q.	But you discussed the events with your mother and with others before coming here to give evidence.  
A.	No.  I have stated that I discussed the events with my mother when we used to live in Mali and France.  
Q.	And did you also discuss with her the type of vehicle that took you from Eden garden to Gitarama? 
A.	No, because I know her vehicle very well and I used to drive it myself, so she didn't need to remind me about it.  
Q.	When you got to Gitarama, where did you and your family stay? 
A.	It was in a school at Murambi spelt M-U-R-A-M-B-I, Murambi.  
Q.	And who exactly stayed at the school?  Which members of your family, the whole family stayed there? 
A.	While I was there, the family was also there, apart from the fact that I know that my father left and shortly after I also left for Bukavu. 
Q.	And whilst you were in Gitarama, how were you getting around the area?  What form of transport? 
A.	I did not leave the school, so there was no means of transport. 
Q.	Going back briefly to Frédéric, your father did not -- was not one of these persons who went to fetch Frédéric, was he?
A.	No.  
Q.	And, in Gitarama, you said you saw some more roadblocks.  
A.	Yes, on the way when we left Eden for Gitarama.  
Q.	And you can't remember exactly where was the roadblock you spoke about where you said your father had to negotiate with the persons at the roadblock, you can't recall? 
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	And you said your father negotiated with the man at the roadblock, did he not?  Did he have to leave with the car to negotiate? 
A.	No, he spoke to them from the window.  He was sitting on the front seat, so he spoke to them from that seat.  
Q.	And were you in a position to hear what he was saying? 
A.	He was asking them to let us pass. 
Q.	Yes.  And the man at the roadblock allowed you also once he spoke to them? 
A.	Yes, at the end of day they let us pass. 
Q.	And these men at the roadblock, were they civilians or were they soldiers? 
A.	I think they were soldiers. 
Q.	Why are you not sure? 
A.	Because that happened a very long time ago and my memory is fading or has faded and I cannot tell exactly how they were attired.  
Q.	So you cannot remember how they were attired.  So why do you say that they were soldiers? 
A.	I said I thought, but I did not know precisely who they were. 
Q.	So based on what did you guess that they were soldiers if you are not sure of what they were wearing? 
A.	Because there were soldiers at the roadblocks and that is why I said that I believed or thought they were soldiers.  
Q.	So you saw some people dressed in military gear or you can't recall what they were wearing at all? 
A.	Are you referring to that specific roadblock?  
Q.	Yes, I am.  
A.	It is a little vague in my mind.  I see military gear.  I see persons dressed as civilians, but I can't say specifically.  It's just all vague in my mind.  
Q.	And would you say that they were Interahamwe, the men who were at this roadblock? 
A.	That I can't say.  
Q.	And while you knew who the Interahamwe were, didn't you? 
A.	I know that the Interahamwe is the youth wing of the MRND, but I cannot see somebody and identify them as an Interahamwe. 
Q.	Did you ever meet any members of the youth wing of the MRND? 
A.	Meeting as such, no.  I have seen -- I don't remember his name.  I have -- I have seen Robert in 
	my mother's restaurant.  No -- but -- but that is because I knew him.  He was Kiko's uncle, but it is not by his sight that I knew or I would say he was an Interahamwe.  
Q.	That is Robert Kajuga, yes?  And apart -- no members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, you said that you were threatened at a particular roadblock, yes? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And despite the fact that you showed your ID card you were not spared.  You were still threatened, that is the evidence you have given.  
A.	Yes.  They threatened me despite the fact that they had seen my ID card.  
Q.	And that's because they believed your ID card was false?  That is the evidence you gave.  
A.	No.  It is rather because they were not interested in knowing what appeared on my identity card.  
Q.	Did they look at your ID card?  If they were not interested in what was there, did they look at it at all? 
A.	Yes.  They looked at it, but they didn't care all the same.  
Q.	And you, yourself, you have testified that people often take you for a Tutsi, correct? 
A.	Yes, that was in primary school.  
Q.	And these people who looked at you -- who threatened you, were they members of the Interahamwe? 
A.	That was in primary school and that was before the advent of multiparty politics in Rwanda.  They did not threaten me.  They simply said that I had fine hands and, therefore, I was definitely Tutsi.  
Q.	Sorry.  I don't think you understood my question.  Sometime during the events you said it was mid-May, I believe, you were threatened at a roadblock, yes?  So I am asking you a question in that context.  So despite as you said you appeared to look like a Tutsi and that was the reason why they threatened you, do you agree?
A.	Yes.  But I cannot identify them as Interahamwe because I cannot recognise an Interahamwe by sight. 
Q.	And do you agree that thousands and thousands of Tutsis were subject to crime just because they were Tutsis during these events? 
A.	Let me tell you that I admit that 1 million persons lost their lives during the events, some of them because of their ethnicity, including the Tutsi.  
Q.	And what I am saying is that because they were Tutsi, they were targeted.  
A.	Let me say -- I cannot say why those persons were killed because I wasn't there, but what I know is that that was one of the reasons they used -- they wanted to get rid of me.  
Q.	So you were victim of crime.  Which crime was committed against you?  
A.	I was threatened with death. 
Q.	Were you sexually assaulted as well? 
A.	During the checkpoints or at the checkpoints at the roadblocks? 
Q.	You said that you were threatened, so I want to know if you were a victim of sexual assault.  
A.	No.  
Q.	But you agree that during these events there were many women -- Tutsi women who were victims 
	of sexual assault.  
A.	I do not know for sure.  I do not know any woman who was a victim of sexual assault.  I know there were lots of victims, but talking about sexual violence, I can't say. 
Q.	So you never in your statement to your Defence attorneys indicate that you were a victim of 
	sexual violence.  
A.	My statement to the Defence did not relate to roadblocks.  

MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe these questions do not arise from examination-in-chief.  And that -- regardless of the issue at hand, the Prosecutor is going beyond the scope of the examination.  To me these are questions which are vague and irrelevant.  
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, I want to wrap up soon because I am seeing the time.  But the rule, in fact, does 
impact us to go beyond the scope of the questions which are asked in examination-in-chief.  And 
my learned friend, in the information he gave us about this witness, had, in fact, indicated that she was going to testify in relation to that issue. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
(Microphone not activated) 
MS. WILSON:
I just have one more question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I will permit the question.  The question is permitted and the witness can answer it and then we'll take our luncheon adjournment.  
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Madam Witness, would you please answer the question.  In your will-say, it's stated that you were a victim of sexual violence; is that, in fact, the case? 
A.	Yes, I was a victim of sexual assault, but in Goma, and that act was committed by a Zairean soldier.
Q.	Thank you.
MS. WILSON:
And, Mr. President, I just wanted to -- as I said, I had one more question.  

Mr. Issa, if you could assist me in just giving the witness the exhibit, number 6. 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Madam Witness, what is written there is in three different languages.  Do you mind just reading it in Kinyarwanda.

And what do you understand that expression to mean? 
A.	It is an insect that hums or makes noise at night and which does not really make sense.  And any child who disobeys his parents is only listening to that insect that has nothing interesting to say.  
Q.	And that is a literal meaning, but, in any effect, it means a child who disobeys her parents is at his or 
	her own peril or risk.  Do you agree that as the child and daughter, the last daughter, you would not want any harm to come to your father? 
A.	I do not understand the question or the substance of the question.  
Q.	It is a simple one.  Ngirumpatse is your father.  You wouldn't like to see him convicted, would you? 
A.	I do not wish to see him convicted for crimes he did not commit.  
Q.	You would not -- and I am saying that as a child you have an obligation to your father and your parents and it is out of that obligation that you have come here to give evidence in support of your father.  
A.	I did not come here as a matter of duty or as an obligation.  I am here to reveal the truth to the world and to tell people the kind of man he is.  
Q.	But you agree that it's very difficult for you to say or impossible for you to say anything negative about your father.  
A.	It is difficult because I know that it is not the truth. 
Q.	So as far as you are concerned your father can do no harm.  
A.	My father is not the kind of man who would plot against other people just because they belong to another ethnic group or to another political party.
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, Your Honours, these are my questions for this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Weyl, if you do not intend to cross-examine (sic) the witness, should we excuse her now or do we take the luncheon adjournment?  Are there any questions in redirect?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe that my questions in redirect would be very concise and very short, two points.  If we -- you would allow me, we could do it now so that we can let off the witness and this in connection with the motion I have filed.  So, with the leave of the Bench, I would rather do that exercise now.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may conduct your redirect. 
MR. WEYL:
I am obliged, Mr. President.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	There are two points, Ms. Ngirumpatse, which I would like to revisit.  Victor -- when Victor used to come to the house, was he well received?  
A.	Victor was always well received because he was part of the family.  He was my aunt's husband and the father of my cousin.  So he was there as one of the family members.  
Q.	When Victor came to the house, did he have good relations with your father? 
A.	Yes.  He had good relationships with him as with everybody.  
Q.	And were these good relations reciprocal?  Did your father also have good relations with Victor?  
A.	Yes.  What I actually wanted to say is that they respected themselves mutually and loved one another.  So they had good relations.  
Q.	Did there come a time when those good relations were strained, to your knowledge? 
A.	No, because I have always seen them.  All the time I saw them together, they were always in a 
	good disposition and were joking or cracking jokes. 
Q.	My second point for clarification relates to your painful journey from Gitarama.  You were in 
	Daniel Mbangura's car; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	You testified before the Chamber that Daniel Mbangura was a man who was known.  
A.	I said he was a minister.  I believe that was the position he held.  He was a member of the government. 
Q.	Do you know whether regarding the threats made against you, whether Daniel Mbangura mentioned that you were Ngirumpatse's daughter?  
A.	I believe he explained to them who I was and who my father was, but they were not interested.  
Q.	Thank you, Ms. Ngirumpatse.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have no further questions.  Obviously, I would like to apply to the Chamber, this is not the customary application.  Mainly, I am requesting the Chamber to allow Delphine to meet her father.  

And, obviously, I would like to thank you, to thank Delphine Ngirumpatse for her contribution to the manifestation of the truth.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Thank you very much for coming to testify, as we thank all witnesses who do this to assist the 
Trial Chamber in its work.  You are now excused and you are free to go.  The registrar will make arrangements to proceed with the request for you to meet with your father.  We take -- 

Yes, Mr. Weyl, you made a hint.  We resume as usual after lunch.
MR. WEYL:
That is our expectation.  We have a witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So 2:15 we resume.  We will resume at 2:15.  
(Court recessed from 1250H to 1423H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Good afternoon, Mr. Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Before you begin to give your testimony, you'll have to take an oath to tell the truth, and the registrar will assist you to do that.  
(Declaration made by Malien Habyarimana in French)
MR. MJUI:
Thank you.  You may sit down.  
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, you will give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by counsel, and you will respond, first of all, to Mr. Weyl representing Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I think there is a minor difficulty, or perhaps it's not a difficulty.  However, to 
my knowledge, the witness has also given up his status as a protected witness.  Perhaps we forgot to ask you to remind him of that and to ask him to state that in his own words.  I speak and I stand to be corrected by the witness who, to my knowledge, had given up his status as a protected witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Witness, the Chamber had made an order for your protection for security reasons, one element of which was that your identity as a witness would be concealed from the public.  Counsel has informed us that you have decided that that protection is not necessary.  Could you kindly explain the position to us, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Indeed, of my own volition, I have surrendered my status as a 
protected witness.  I do not have any special explanation to give.  However, I thought that I have nothing to hide.  I do not have any desire to hide because, indeed, I have nothing to hide and that is why I sought to surrender the status of a protected witness.  I thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you testified in any other cases besides this one? 
THE WITNESS:
No, Mr. President.  I repeat.  No, Mr. President, I have not testified in any other trial here before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  In those circumstances we -- 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We revoke the order for protection made in favour of this witness.  
MR. WEYL:
I thank you, Mr. President. 
MALIEN HABYARIMANA, 
first having been duly sworn,
testified as follows: 
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, I would like to remind you -- or, rather, I would like to draw your attention to how we operate in this Court.  You and I speak French.  My questions have to be translated into English.  Your answers also have to be translated into English.  It is, therefore, necessary for you to pause before answering my questions.  This will enable the interpreters to do their work.  And you should also reply in a reasonable -- or, at a reasonable pace to enable them to translate as accurately as possible.  

Furthermore, I would request that you kindly spell unusual proper nouns or proper nouns that you would use for the first time.  

I would now ask you to tell the Court what your name and the first name are.  
A.	My name is Habyarimana and my first name is Malien. 
Q.	Can you please spell your name. 
A.	H-A-B-Y-A-R-I-M-A-N-A.  
Q.	I thank you.  Can you tell the Court your date of birth.  
A.	I was born on the 25th of September 1951.  
Q.	I thank you.  You have before you, I believe, a document entitled "Witness's identification sheet HAM".  I would ask you to check it carefully to correct any errors you may find therein.  If it contains no errors or after the corrections, I would ask you to mention the date of 10th January 2011, at the left bottom -- or bottom left-hand corner, and you also sign the document at that part of the document.  
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  I have, indeed, read the document which was given to me by the registry.  There is some information I would like to correct, the address -- my address in 1994.  In fact, where I lived was known as Kicukiro, Remera.  It was Remera I, but it was generally referred to as Kicukiro, Remera.  So I can correct that information.  I will put Remera I.  
Q.	Do that, Counsel -- sorry.  Do that, Witness, and please date and sign the document, please. 
MR. WEYL:
And with the assistance of Mr. Issa, I would like this information -- rather, personal information sheet to be shown to the other party.  And, Mr. President, I would request you to admit this as D. NG182 -- 192, sorry.  D. NG192. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
(Exhibit No. D. NG192 admitted) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Habyarimana, can you briefly tell the Court your educational background, your level of education. 
A.	Thank you very much, Counsel.  In brief, my educational background is as follows:  

I completed secondary school in 1971.  That was in Cyangugu -- Cyangugu préfecture in a school known as Nyamasheke.  From 1971 to 1974 I went to the National University of Rwanda.  I was in the faculty of maths, physics and engineering.  From '79 to 1982 I did the civil engineering public works in Lyon in France.  I should add that in addition to that training in 1990, I also did specialisation in transport economics.  Counsel, in brief, that is my academic background.  

Before I complete you may have noticed that there is a void between 1979 to 1982.  I am sorry, there is no void.  Rather, I would come back to that period when I will be talking about the -- what I did, my occupation.  Thank you.  
Q.	Thank you.  Following up from where you left up, let me remind you that it is necessary to spell out 
	the proper nouns.  You mentioned Nyamasheke.  Would you please kindly spell out that name into 
	your microphone.  Thank you.  
A.	Y-A-M-A-S-H-E-K-E (sic). 
Q.	Thank you.  So I was going to continue by saying that I would like you to specify to the Court what 
	your professional background is, particularly in respect to the period we are interested in, that is, up until 1994.  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  
	
	And, very briefly, after graduating from the first cycle of the National University of Rwanda in 1971, I went to serve -- or, to work at the ministry of transport and communications.  I was immediately appointed head of service of studies in the ministry of transport and communications, an office which I held up until 1979 before returning to studies in France.  

Allow me, however, to state that the position of head of service for studies had been created by the minister and was answerable to the cabinet of the minister and was in charge of studies and planning within the entire ministry, including legislative matters pertaining to the ministry in collaboration with other services of the ministry.  

In 1982, when I returned from my studies in France, I was appointed to the service of studies, but in a different capacity, that of director.  So I became director of studies and planning in the ministry in 1982.  This service was attached to the minister's cabinet and conducted or carried out studies for the entire ministry in collaboration, of course, with the other services of the ministry.  I held that position of 
director of studies until mid 1992, that is, in the second semester of 1992.  So from 1982 to the 
second semester of 1992, I was director of studies and evaluation and planning in the ministry as the service was then referred to.  

In the second quarter -- or, in the second semester, rather, of 1992, I was appointed general director for coordination -- for technical coordination of all the services of the ministry of transport and communications.  Allow me to specify since we have mentioned general director of technical coordination for the ministry, this was at the time of multiparty politics and the ministers had political cabinets which were involved in political matters, while the general director was in charge of all the technical services of the ministry.  

Counsel, maybe you would allow me to add that, in addition to coordinating the technical services of the ministry, a huge ministry as it was, allow me to say that there were also supervisory bodies which were under my supervision, and if necessary, I may shed more light on how these services were organised under the supervisory authority of our ministry and how it was that I had oversight in relation to their activities.  
Q.	Thank you for that background.  And now I would like you to tell this Court whether within the context of your duties and your technical work at the time, ministry of transport -- I would like you to tell the Court whether in that capacity you dealt with matters relating to civil aviation, air traffic organisation, airport services across Rwanda, and please focus on the year 1993, and if we were to be more specific, the second half of 1993.  

The question, then, is:  Did you have any role to play in matters pertaining to airport and aeronautics in your functions? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  As general director for technical coordination in the ministry, I had a role to play in relation to civil aviation.  First of all, I was the coordinator of the directorate of civil aviation, be it at the technical or regulatory levels.  

Secondly, I coordinated the service in charge of airports in Rwanda.  To explain the matter briefly, what happened was that government had set up an organisation with financial autonomy, but without administrative autonomy to manage the airports of Rwanda.  And so that organisation was under the administrative purview of the ministry of transport and communications, and I provided that responsibility or that oversight on behalf of the minister.

Now, as for my duties and civil aviation, let me say that I had control authority over civil aviation in order to ensure that the services were properly provided.  You also know that civil aviation is a very delicate area and I, therefore, had to, on behalf of the minister, monitor the issuance of landing and overflying permissions or authorisations.  So any such issuances came directly from the minister pursuant to the Civil Aviation Convention of December 1944, signed in Chicago.  So, in very broad strokes, those were my attributions in relation to the way the service was set up.  And to be more specific, I had some oversight in the issuance of authorisations to overfly or to land on Rwandan territory.  
Q.	Mr. Habyarimana, mindful of your duties and your responsibilities at the time, can you tell this Court whether you had full and complete knowledge of the airline companies that flew over Rwandan airspace and landed in Kigali and parked at the Kigali airport and took off from Kigali? 
A.	In very succinct terms, I think we need to clarify that we had, on the one hand, what could be referred to as regular or normal airlines or companies, such as Air France, Sabina, Ethiopian Airlines, 
	Air Tanzania, Air Burundi, Aeroflot of the URSS -- USSR, rather, in English, and those are the major airlines which I can remember.  And, in very broad strokes, those are the ones that quickly come to mind.  

So, Counsel, those were the major airlines that came to Rwanda, but there were other airlines that would come to Rwanda in what one could refer to as an irregular manner.  And in order for such crafts to land, it was necessary to obtain an authorisation from the ministry of transport and communication.  
Q.	Mindful of your duties and your responsibilities, were you fully and completely aware of any authorisations that may have been issued during that period, that is, the second semester of 1993? 

Witness, please switch on your microphone.
A.	What I was saying is that the question is rather complex.  You see, those crafts which one referred to as irregular companies were airlines that would fly into the country following an agreement or an authorisation.  So, quite briefly, I can say that we had some planes flying in from Egypt and others from France, because, once again, we need to distinguish and understand that France does not only have 
	Air France, because other airlines came from France and even from Belgium.  So, clearly, many airplanes, apart from the so-called regular companies, also landed in Kigali.

1445H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Habyarimana, were you aware of one landing or several landings of a -- or, some crafts in
	Kigali from Romania? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  I can state emphatically that no plane from Romania landed in Kigali during the period you have referred to.  I can say this and I can insist on it, Counsel, because I was in a position to know, given that the authorisations were granted by the ministry of transport and communication.  

In order to be more specific in my answer, let me say that for an airline to land in Kigali, that is, at the Kanombe International Airport, it was necessary for a number of conditions to be met, including those outlined in the authorisation.  Therefore, based on the said authorisations, it was possible to know which plane had landed and which one had not landed.  

And with your leave, I may be able to tell you those elements or information that were required from an airline in order to authorise landing for such aircraft, and the conditions were very strict and stiffed.  With your leave, I can go on to enumerate those conditions.  

	Now, for an airline to land in Kigali, it had to provide the name of the airline, say, Air France or Romanian, as you just referred to.  It was also supposed to specify the type of craft or aircraft.  It was supposed to -- well, when I talk about type of aircraft, it is either Boeing 737, 747 or Airbus, and what have you.  It also had to provide the registration number of the craft, because each country has its own registration.  The company was supposed to state the origin or provenance of the craft and also state the cargo or load and specify the date and time of arrival -- expected date and time of arrival in Kigali. The airlines are supposed to provide the expected date and time of departure of the craft from the 
	Kigali airport.  Those are the main conditions.  I may have omitted a few, but the conditions were very stringent.  And so, it is mindful of these criteria that any company which wanted to come had to fill out those forms and meet those requirements. 
Q.	A short while ago, I asked you, Witness, whether you were aware of any flight from Romania, which may have been authorised to land.  Your answer is no.  Now, did you have any knowledge of a cargo plane of Romanian origin flying to Kanombe at that time and which, allegedly, was parked at that airport? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel, for the question.  And once again, my answer is no.  I am not aware of that.  But let me shed light on this matter for the benefit of the Court, and say that whenever a plane has landed at an airport, this information can be cross-checked, because the reports, the annual reports and other documentation would show proof of such landing or take off with specific information as to the tare, weight and the merchandise that may have been transported by such a craft.  

Now, in the area of civil aviation, for a plane to land in Kigali, it must have overflown other countries.  And in that specific case, it must, at least, have overflown Uganda, Tanzania, DRC or Burundi.  And so it would be possible to find that in those countries there would be specific authorisations for such a craft as well.  So my position is that, if the archives have not been destroyed, it is possible to trace any such craft that may or may not have landed at Kigali airport. 
Q.	Do you believe that tracing or tracking a craft that landed in Kigali, having necessarily overflown Burundi, Tanzania or Uganda, would you think that such material enabling such tracking would have been destroyed in all those areas where such evidence or tracing materials could have been destroyed? 
A.	Well, I do not think so.  I know that I have mentioned the archives may have been destroyed, but that is only in relation to the case of Rwanda, where we experienced these most unfortunate events that we are talking about.  But I believe that in the other countries, it is possible for the archives to be consulted, but, once again, I cannot express any opinion in relation to any of those other countries.  
Q.	Would you know whether any such archives relating to the movement of aircrafts are also held at international level or within the international body? 
A.	Yes, that data is available, given that each country is obliged to make a statement or a declaration to the international civil aviation organisation on an annual basis, on traffic at its airport.  And this information provides the number and types of crafts that had landed at the airport, the number of passengers and the freight that was processed at that airport.  And it is on the basis of such data that the international civil aviation organisation can provide assessments and projections on civil aviation within the country.  So that is why I believe that within that organisation, it would be possible to find that data. 
Q.	Mr. Habyarimana, on the basis of the various -- or, this information, can you tell the Court whether it is possible for an aircraft coming from Romania, or belonging to Romanian airline or registered in Romania, landed -- was parked in Kigali without you being aware?  
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  It is true that I was not always -- or, was not often at the airport.  However, an aircraft, whatever it may be, or whoever it may belong to, be it Romanian or the aircraft of another country, which landed in Kigali and which unloaded I do not know what, I must have been aware of that.  

In any case, if there was any abnormality, I would necessary be aware.  But if an aircraft came under normal circumstances and unloaded whatever it had on board, if there was nothing abnormal -- well, rather, if there was anything abnormal, I would be aware, and that is my area of training. 
Q.	To your knowledge, was there any anomaly of that nature during the last half of 1993?  
A.	First of all, my department at the airport did not inform me of anything of that nature, that's the Rwandan airport authority did not inform me about that.  The director of aeronautics did not give me any such information.  

I would like to add that during the multiparty era, people, indeed, were very vigilant, were very alert.  They had their eyes open.  I, therefore, I did not see in the print media any information indicating an abnormally -- an anomaly in the Kigali International Airport.  I never heard it over the radio either, neither did I see that on television.  So I was not aware of anything unusual at the airport.  I thank you. 
Q.	Was the volume of traffic at Kigali airport significant at that time?  Can you give the Court an idea of the volume of traffic at Kigali airport? 
A.	I thank you, Counsel.  In fact, the movement of aircrafts at Kigali airport was not so significant.  I have given you the list of airlines.  They may have been six or seven.  Sometimes two airlines would reach the airport practically at the same time.  So if I were to make an estimate, I could say that when flights were at peak hours, rather, we could have about three aircrafts landing at the same time, especially as the parking area was not so big as to accommodate so many aircrafts at the same time.  
Q.	If I am asking you these questions, Witness, it is because a Prosecution witness stated that aircrafts belonging to a Romanian airline regularly parked in Kigali airport during an unspecified period at the end of 1993, and that those aircrafts were used for arms trafficking, which were made to pass for spare parts.  The witness also testified to the presence on the tarmac of Kigali airport of an aircraft and dozens of crates measuring about 2 metres by 2 metres.  Does such a situation seem to you to be possible?  Does it seem to you to be plausible?  Is it possible that voluminous cargo was brought in by aircrafts which were not given authorisation to land at Kigali airport during that special period, that is, the period of -- rather, at the end of 1993? 
A.	Thank you, Counsel.  My answer is that that would not be possible.  I could repeat the conditions I mentioned to you.  When we allowed an aircraft to land, the aircraft had to give us details of its cargo.  When the aircraft arrived at the airport, it was taken care of by many staff members.  There was the gendarmerie involved; there was an inspector of the airport's authority who went to the aircraft to inspect it; there were the customs officers, who were, in fact, responsible for checking the cargo.  Once the customs officers had checked the cargo, the goods were unloaded by Air Rwanda.  And once the goods were unloaded by Air Rwanda, they were taken to the general warehouse in Rwanda.  So you would understand clearly that there were many people involved who had an eye on that aircraft.  I have mentioned them. 

I would like to add that all the people involved -- well, were so involved during the multiparty era.  People were now members of various political parties.  There was intelligence.  So if there was anything unusual, it should have been brought to light, either by the press.  In any case, we would have heard about it, all the more so, as the airport was managed by the MRND party.  As you yourself would understand, if there was any such unusual event, the other parties, the opposition parties would have mentioned or given great publicity to that and that would cause a great deal of damage.  So I am telling you that such a thing did not happen. 
A.	In order to transport spare parts under the most natural or normal conditions, would it have been common or usual to use an airline which did not have authorisation, and this, in the context of the various controls or checks that were carried out at the airport? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Switch his microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
In fact, an aircraft without authorisation would not be allowed to land.  I am telling you that an aircraft without an authorisation would not be allowed to land.  We verified -- we checked all conditions before given authorisation, and an aircraft without authorisation would not land at Kigali International Airport. 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Do you remember whether the Kigali airport was the subject of any special supervision or surveillance by the security services during that period of 1993?  Were there the gendarmerie services, the military services that carried out the surveillance of the airport, as far as you know? 
A.	At Kigali airport -- moreover, this applies to every airport -- the international civil aviation organisation is strict.  What is known as air security is something very important.  We had the gendarmerie which was present at the airport.  It was very difficult for someone who did not wear or carry a badge to have access to the airport.  I, myself, was general manager, but for me to enter the airport, I had to wear a badge.  Even the minister himself, could not just come like that and say I am a minister, no, he had to wear his badge.  Therefore, in order to enter the airport, you had to go through strict control.  You had to have the authorisation by the official of the airports authority which issued badges to various people.  

I would also like to add that even if someone had such a badge, there are -- or, there were areas to which you would not have access, because having access to such areas meant that you had to get close to the airport -- rather, to the aircraft.  And this was only possible by a few -- for a few people, the gendarmes, the airport officials, the staff of Air Rwanda, who did handling of cargo or the customs officials.  These were the only people who could get close enough to the aircraft.  Other people were strictly forbidden to get close to the airport -- to the aircraft. 
Q.	Perhaps clarify your thinking.  Was it possible for a private vehicle to have access to a plane or aircraft in order to collect cargo or goods directly from the foot of the plane as they were unloaded?  
A.	There, again, my answer is no.  That was not possible.  First of all, a private vehicle was not allowed to enter the airport, even an official vehicle was not allowed to enter the airport.  I will give you an example, even in my own case, I left my vehicle outside.  Furthermore, it was impossible, as I told you, for someone without authorisation to get close to the aircraft.  Do you imagine what would happen if the international civil aviation organisation learnt that we allowed people to come on to the tarmac and get close to the aircraft?  This would be very harmful for Rwanda.  And there were many eyes.  People were seeing what was happening.  Therefore, it was not possible.  That could not be allowed and that did not happen.  
Q.	I thank you, Mr. Habyarimana, for all those clarifications, which have shed all the necessary light.  I thank you for all the contributions that you have made for the manifestation of the truth.  I thank you, 
	Mr. Habyarimana.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I have no further questions for this witness. 
THE WITNESS:
I also thank you, Counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Ms. Diagne, do you have any questions for this witness?  
MS. DIAGNE-MBAYE: 
No, Mr. President.  I thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you will now have to be cross-examined by the Prosecutor, and you will now have to respond to questions put by the Prosecutor.  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Mr. President.
MS. WILSON: 
Mr. President, I do have some documents to distribute, if Mr. Issa could please assist.  

Thank you, Mr. President, Your Honours.  I have distributed some documents, they are all reports.  And I was only able to find them in English.  So to facilitate, I would only read the relevant portion that I am going to be referring to. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. WILSON:
Q.	Mr. Witness, good afternoon.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel. 
Q.	My name is Maria Wilson, and I am one of the Prosecutors in this matter.  I simply have a few questions for you, Mr. Habyarimana.  
A.	Very well, Counsel. 
Q.	In 1993, 1994, where was your office located? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone, please.
THE WITNESS:
1993 to 1994, during that period, my office was at the ministry of transport and communication.  It was located in the building of the post office.  My office was on the first floor, first storey, the minister's office was on the second floor, and I remember that on the third floor, there was the office of the department of communication.  The building had three storeys.  So, my office was located in that building, the building of the postal authority or post office of Kigali. 
BY MS. WILSON:  
Q.	And which part of Kigali is that? 
A.	It was in the capital city.  In fact, the post office building is located opposite the president's office.  It was opposite the presidency of the republic.  There was only a road that separated us from the president's office.  So, right opposite us was the presidency of the republic and office of the Kigali-Rural préfecture. 
Q.	Thank you.  And as director general of the ministry of transport, who did you report to? 
A.	As director general, I was answerable to the minister of transport and communication.  That was the only person I was answerable to. 
Q.	And who was the minister of transport and communication at that time? 
A.	It was Mr. André Ntagerura.  Mr. André Ntagerura, I can spell Ntagerura, N-T-A-G-E-R-U-R-A; Ntagerura, André. 
Q.	And you agree that he was an MRND minister? 
A.	Yes, yes, he was an MRND minister.  But I would like to point out that, in fact, being an MRND minister did not mean that the ministry was an MRND ministry. 
Q.	Thank you, for that explanation.  I was simply asking you if he was an MRND member.  And were you also an MRND member? 
A.	Yes, I was a member of the MRND. 
Q.	From its inception, during the early era of single party politics, since then you were MRND and you continued up to the multiparty phase; is that true? 
A.	I was a member of the MRND from its inception, therefore, when it was a single party in the country, and also at the birth of multiparty politics in 1991.  I decided to remain a member of MRND.  Other people left MRND and went to other parties, but I decided to remain a member of the MRND.  And I was not the only one to do -- to take such a decision.  I would like to point that out.  At the ministry of transport and communication, there were other MRND members, but they were not the only people in the ministry.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And as an MRND member and also someone who reported to the minister, you would obviously have to follow whatever instructions he gave you? 
A.	Yes, that was only normal, because I was director in charge of coordination at the ministry.  The minister would give instructions.  He was the minister.  I do not see how it could have been otherwise.  
Q.	Do you agree that in your evidence you painted a picture perfect system at the airport of Kigali? 
A.	I presented the situation as I knew it, as things happened.  Otherwise, the description of ideal or perfect is not what I intended.  I just presented the situation as it was at the airport.  I remember that if there had been anything abnormal, I would have been aware of it.  And I clearly indicated that, to my knowledge, there was no unusual or abnormal event. 
Q.	Yes, that's to your knowledge.  But do you agree that most of your evidence deals with aircraft that landed regularly at the Kigali airport? 
A.	I talked of aircrafts that landed regularly at Kigali.  I believe I nevertheless mentioned irregular flights, therefore, of aircraft that were freighted.  If I did not mention them, perhaps that would be an omission, but I believe I mentioned aircrafts that were freighted. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, we are on the same page.  I just simply asked you, if most of your evidence was about aircrafts that landed regularly at the Kigali airport, because you went on about the conditions or the requirements for aircrafts that landed regularly, as most of your evidence, it's not all, most, do you agree? 
A.	Well, I answered the questions that were put to me.  I said there were scheduled flights.  I talked also about scheduled flights, but there were also flights that were not scheduled, for example, for chartered aircrafts.  If I wasn't clear enough, please ask me further questions so that I may answer them.
Q.	Mr. Witness, you are absolutely clear.  And you said those that had landed regularly, you had to provide or the minister had to provide authorisation for them to land; that's correct, is it not?  
A.	No, that is not what I said.  If that is how you understood it, perhaps then I was not clearly understood.  And you now give me the opportunity to clarify what I said.  In civil aviation, there was what was referred to as airline agreements signed between states.  During the negotiation of those airline agreements, each state would designate an airline that would make use of the agreement.  In technical terms, that was referred to as designated airline company.  It is that designated airline company which carried out regular flights, which carry out flights on the basis of a schedule, and all you had to do was to present that schedule to the ministry of transport and communication.  You would understand that you would not allow an aircraft to just come in anyhow and at any time.  That will be chaos or disorder.  So it would be that designated company.  

I would also like to point out that in every country, you had a designated company.  One country may have ten designated -- or, rather, ten airlines.  It was for the country to choose the airline to be designated.  The other airlines that are designated in the accord or agreement, whenever they wanted to transport passengers or cargo to Kigali, they would ask for authorisation.  So, as I said, they had to meet the conditions which I stated in my evidence.  I believe perhaps I am clear now as to what I meant.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  And you went on to say, but if there was an anomaly, then you would have received reports either from the Rwandan airline authorities or the aeronautics reports or you might have seen it on the press, correct? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	Are you in a position today to say whether there were anomalies in 1993?  
A.	To my knowledge, and I mean, to my knowledge, there were no anomalies which were mentioned, to my knowledge, I repeat.  
Q.	Did you understand my question?  Are you in a position to say that there were no anomalies in 1993?  
A.	I cannot answer your question with no, because as you know, we are human beings.  We try to be perfect, but asking me to say that there was -- absolutely there was no anomaly, well, I cannot say there was no anomaly.  But it is highly probable that there was no anomaly.  But I cannot say no, because as you know, there is always room for improvement. 
Q.	It did not picture perfect.  Did you go back to your notes or reports about the year 1993, or is this just memory, based on memory that you are making these statements?  
A.	I am relying on my memory, because I did not take notes.  I did not make notes.  So I'm relying on my memory.  I did not make any notes.  I'm relying on my memory, I repeat. 
Q.	Thank you. 
MS. WILSON:
Mr. President, I'm looking at the time and I see it's 3:31 and the next stage would be showing exhibits to this witness.  So maybe it could be a convenient time for the Court to take the adjournment.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, our trial normally ends at 3:30, and that is just about the time now.  So we adjourn until tomorrow morning.  

I should remind you that while you are our witness, during this or any adjournment, you are not to discuss the case or your testimony with anybody.  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood you, Counsel, and I would comply with that order. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This has a little more weight than coming from the counsel -- the Judges, but we accept your understanding of the requirements.  We adjourn now until tomorrow morning. 
(Court adjourned at 1530H)
