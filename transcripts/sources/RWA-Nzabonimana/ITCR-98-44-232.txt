MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please open the proceedings?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal of Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 8th of February 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Before you start, Mr. Hooper, I must just let you know that the reason for the late start this morning was that we had to tempt fate by exposing ourselves to the official photographer for the Tribunal, and that took a little more time than we had anticipated. 
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed.  I won't ask who Ms. March might be.  But can I just indicate, so that we can better see the road ahead, that this is Witness 9/31, recalled to conclude this morning his evidence, his cross-examination.  

The next witness will be 4/16, who is the witness who is called in order to produce certain documents that we have, but which he, as yet, has not seen.  And so after this witness has finished, either directly or through WVSS, we'd like him to have -- to be given those documents and for us to have indicated to us whether those are the documents he was -- he mentioned.  They're the documents we've obtained, if that's possible.  

In respect of Witness 5/10, he's an abandoned witness.  We're not calling him.  We hope, in those circumstances, to conclude the case today, subject to the subpoena matter, which is, from what I've heard, probably an academic issue but one which at this stage we necessarily need to formally retain an interest in, for obvious reasons.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Witness, welcome back to the Tribunal.  As you had been informed when you were here on the last occasion -- well, your cross-examination has to be completed.  Ms. Fall will now continue her cross-examination of you.  I remind you that you are on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you began your testimony.  

Yes, Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS 9/31 (continued)
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness.  Good morning, Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Witness, the last time we were talking about the Gacaca proceedings, and today, before dealing with the events of the 12th of April, I should like to put some questions to you regarding when you went to Kibobo.  You said you went to Kibobo on the 12th of April 1994.  

Can you hear me, Witness?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The Rwandan booth -- Rwandese booth -- Kinyarwanda booth says there might be a technical problem.  They don't seem to be communicating with the witness.  It would appear the witness can't hear.  
THE WITNESS:
I can hear.  I can hear the Kinyarwanda interpreters.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	I shall put the question afresh.  You said under examination-in-chief that you went to Kibobo on the 12th of April 1994.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you tell me at what time you went to Kibobo? 
A.	I think it was between 2 and 3 p.m.  I left that place at 2 p.m. and arrived in Kibobo at about 3 p.m. 
Q.	You also said that when you went to Kibobo, you met several people.  Do you remember that? 
A.	Yes, I think I tried to name the people that I found there.  
Q.	Yes, quite, Witness.  You were asked to write on a piece of paper, and it is in the transcript.  We did want the names of the people that you met there.  
A.	Yes, I gave those names. 
Q.	Now, unless I'm mistaken, if I refer to that list, it would seem that you only put No. 1 on the list, the name of the person who is No. 1.  
A.	Yes, that is correct, I put No. 1 because it was her that I met there.  
Q.	Yet you had said you met several people there, and we asked you to give us all their names, and you only put down one, wrote down -- you only wrote down No. 1.  
A.	I stated that I met No. 1, and the other number who was related to No. 1. 
Q.	Well, out of a concern for objectivity and fairness, why didn't you write the names of No. 1 and No. 2, who was the relative of No. 1?  
A.	I wrote those two names down on the list because it was the two people that I found in the family with whom I was seeking refuge.  I was seeking refuge in the same family as those two people whose names were on the list.  
Q.	Yet again, Witness, you have acknowledged here that you only wrote down the name of No. 1, which is the name on the list.  You did not write down the name of No. 2.  Why were you concentrated so, focused so, on No. 1? 
A.	I think I have explained that.  I made it clear that I did also encounter there No. 2. 
Q.	But you do acknowledge that when you were asked to write down the names, you did not mention No. 2, but only No. 1?  
A.	I thought I was asked -- I was first told not to mention the name of that person.  They asked me if I had encountered No. 1 there.  It was in response to the question put to me that I wrote down the name of No. 1 on the list of -- on the piece of paper.  I did not list any other names.  I did not list the people I was not put questions about. 
Q.	I won't insist.  The Trial Chamber will assess your answer in respect of the question put to you.  Now, at Kibobo, you acknowledge having met No. 1, encountered No. 1, and you say that No. 1 had been there for some time.  On what basis do you assert that? 
A.	I thought that she had arrived there several hours before me, because when you arrive somewhere and you find someone who has been there for some hours or some days, from their behaviour, how they receive you, all that can indicate that someone has spent several hours or days at that place. 
Q.	Would that be a mere supposition on your part or do you have something concrete that -- to indicate that she had been there several hours or several days, as you seem to suggest?  
A.	I have just explained to you that when you arrive somewhere and you are fleeing, the person that you find there, when that person asks you, "What's happening?  Why are you fleeing the place where you were?"  When you're afraid and you see that the person is not afraid and doesn't seem to be informed as to what is happening, when they question you so as to know what is the situation, "Why are you afraid?  Why have you fled from where you were," you conclude that person was not at the place where you were and that they had arrived at this place well before you. 
Q.	Did you concretely discuss with her how long she'd been there, when she had arrived at that place? 
A.	Yes.  It was obvious she wasn't aware of the situation that -- of what the situation had been a few hours earlier.  When a person puts questions to you so as to know what is happening, all the details of what is happening, and when you are fleeing, you don't have the time to take all your clothes; you're not properly dressed, whereas the person you find on the spot is well dressed, you could see that she didn't come by way of fleeing as we had.  
Q.	Witness, you have just repeated what you said before, and you did not answer the very precise question I put to you, which would help us to gain time.  Did you or did you not discuss with her how long she had been at Kibobo?  
A.	No, we did not discuss that, but we did discuss the reasons why I had fled.  And I gave her all the details as to the events that had occurred and why I had fled from where I had been. 
Q.	Witness, I shall now come to the events of 12th April.  In respect of those events, you spoke of massacre -- a massacre at the Protestant church.  You spoke of that at length, but I shall not dwell on that because we are not interested in that so much because we do not accuse the Accused of those events.  I merely wish to ask you if you know how many people were killed at that church.  
A.	Mention was made of 60 victims or so, on the basis of the information I was given by our local authorities. 
Q.	So, personally, you did not witness that attack and you don't know exactly how many people.  All you know is what you have been told? 
A.	Well, with regard to that information, I have told you that we participate in Gacaca sessions, and in the course of Gacaca sessions, all the events that occurred in our area are narrated.  I told you that detailed explanations were given regarding the massacres that took place back home.  I did not participate in that attack, of course, but I obtained information at the Gacaca sessions, and we were told that from 50 to 60 people perished in that attack. 
Q.	Witness, in respect of those attacks, you have said that the perpetrators were, in particular, assailants who had come from Rubungo.  Can you tell us under what circumstances those assailants arrived? 
A.	I have explained that those assailants found us ************ in Kurupangu.  I don't know how they organised themselves to come to ********, but the fact is that we saw them coming ************** at Kurupangu trading centre.  
Q.	And how did they come?  By what mode did they come to ************? 
A.	They came in vehicles.  The vehicles arrived, and we immediately fled. 
Q.	At what time did the vehicles arrive? 
A.	Those vehicles arrived somewhere about 1 or 2 p.m.  I do not remember the exact time, but it is somewhere there between 1 and 2 p.m. 
Q.	And how many vehicles did you see? 
A.	Three vehicles. 
Q.	You personally saw three vehicles? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You did not see four vehicles? 
A.	I saw three vehicles. 
Q.	Can you tell us who were in those vehicles, who were the occupants of the vehicles? 
A.	I could not identify the vehicles' occupants because Rubungo is very far from Gikomero.  If you live in Gikomero, you can't know the people who live in Rubungo.  But I can say that I did know one Nduwayesu, a young man by the name of Nduwayesu.  I knew Nduwayesu because she (sic) had a close relative in Gikomero and he would go -- when he came to visit those people. 
Q.	Witness, you have a great gift in eluding the questions I put to you.  I will repeat the question, and I hope to get a precise answer.  I asked you who was in those vehicles.  
A.	I have explained to you that I did not know the occupants of those vehicles.  I told you that I could only recognise Nduwayesu.  I could only identify Nduwayesu. 
Q.	Can you, therefore, specify whether there were civilians or other people in those vehicles? 
A.	I have explained to you that most of the assailants were civilians, that there was one man wearing a military cap and who had a military camouflage jacket, but he wore normal trousers, civilian trousers. 
Q.	So, from what you have said, your response, would it be correct to say that there were civilians and there were no soldiers?  
A.	I don't know whether that person who was wearing a camouflage jacket and a military cap, I don't know if that person was a soldier or a civilian.  I, therefore, cannot confirm that there were any soldiers aboard those vehicles. 
Q.	Witness, now regarding the attacks, since you've said that there was an attack at the Kurupangu trading centre, could you tell us the time at which the attack took place? 
A.	I tried to tell you that the group of assailants came in at about 1 to 2 o'clock.  I cannot tell you the precise hour, but I gave you 1 to 2 p.m. 
Q.	So, you're not in a position to tell us the precise time at which the attack at the Kurupangu centre took place; is that correct? 
A.	I gave you a time span; I said, "1 to 2 o'clock".  I cannot remember the precise time at which the attack took place. 
Q.	Do you know whether -- Witness, do you know whether people were killed during that attack at the Kurupangu trading centre? 
A.	At the Kurupangu centre ***********, there were no victims.  
Q.	So you are saying that nobody was killed at the Kurupangu centre.  
A.	I told you that there were two centres, the one *****************; that is the Kurupangu centre.  There, there was no victim.  I explained to you that when ****************************************** there was another centre.  There is another centre called Kurupangu centre; in other words there are two Kurupangu centres.  I am saying that, so far as the one around the one ******** was concerned, there was no victim.  Nobody died that day during the attack.  
Q.	Now, as for the second Kurupangu centre, then, this is the first time we are hearing that there are two centres with the same name.  You said that the distance between the two was not very far, it was practically three metres.  Aren't we talking about the same centre then? 
A.	No, it is not a distance of three metres between the two.  The distance between the two would be between 300 and 400 metres. 
Q.	That could be verified in the transcripts.  Now, Witness, would you be surprised if you were to hear that we were told here that people were killed at the trading centre of Kurupangu?  Would you be surprised? 
A.	Do you mean on that day, the day of the attack?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreters didn't hear the Defence's (sic) response.  
THE WITNESS:
To my knowledge, there was nobody that was killed or died at the Kurupangu centre ***************.  Now, if there are other people that have evidence to the contrary, they may submit them to you.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Well, I believe that has been asserted here.  I do not think I want to contradict myself at this time.  
A.	Well, if there is any other person that has evidence to the effect of your assertions, that person should make such evidence.  So far as I'm concerned, I know nothing of it. 
Q.	Witness, were there any blocks or roadblocks set up in your cellule? 
A.	In ***************** cellule in which I lived, there were no roadblocks. 
Q.	Witness, when those vehicles that had assailants on board arrived, there were several people aboard those vehicles.  Did those people ask to set up roadblocks?  
A.	I didn't hear anything like that.  I did explain to you that we tried to run away, and we had to come back home in the night.  I don't know whether the assailants gave out orders for roadblocks to be set up.  All that I know is that at the **************** where I live, there was no roadblock. 
Q.	Would you be surprised to hear that people have testified here concerning this same case, that indeed roadblocks were set up?  And they went into greater detail.  I can give you references in the transcripts.  Some of them testified that all the persons that lived at the trading centre participated in the setting up of the roadblocks, as well as other members of the -- people from the -- members of the commune.  Would you contradict that testimony?  
A.	I explained to this august Chamber as follows:  If there is anybody that has evidence that is contrary to what I am saying here concerning that part of the Kurupangu trading centre ******************, they may submit such evidence.  In the centre that is below, there is a -- sort of a crossroads.  It was a crossroads between four cellules.  So that if anybody has evidence to that effect, they may submit such evidence to you. 
Q.	I'm convinced, Witness, that this Chamber will, on the basis of what has been said here, will be able to appreciate the facts.  Now, Witness, do you know one Patessi, P-A-T-E-S-S-I, Patessi?  Do you know that person? 
A.	No. 
Q.	If I were to tell you that this is a young girl of between 16 to 17 years old who was killed during those events, together with two of her brothers? 
A.	Well, that question has nothing to do with the question that you precedingly put to me.  You asked me whether there were any victims on the day of the attack.  I told you that, on that day, there were no victims.  The three persons you are talking about, I do not know them.  People came to state at the Gacaca sessions that those three persons came from Rutunga and that they were running away from the attacks of the Inkotanyi, but they were not killed on the day of the attack. 
Q.	Were they killed, yes or no? 
A.	They were killed. 
Q.	Well, since you were in those sessions, did you gain any knowledge as to the location at which they were killed? 
A.	Well, those persons that were killed at the Kurupangu centre, their killers are now in detention, madam. 
Q.	You did not answer my question.  Were you told or did you learn about the location at which they were killed? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could you then tell us? 
A.	Those persons were killed at the Kurupangu centre. 
Q.	Wasn't it suggested that they were killed very near, or not far, **************? 
A.	No.  That was not what was said. 
Q.	At the beginning you appeared to know nothing about those persons, but now you seem to be a little bit more knowledgeable.  Now, what did you learn about the location at which they were killed? 
A.	I told you, and I want to repeat it, the Kurupangu centre is an intersection of several cellules.  Those persons were killed at the intersection of -- the intersection of Twina and Runyinya.  That location is also called Kurupangu.  So they were killed at the crossroads there. 
MS. FALL:
Your Honour, I believe I am through with this witness.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  

Mr. Hooper, re-examination?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, just one or two questions.  
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Just dealing with this last issue that the Prosecution have raised with you in relation to the three people who were killed, do you know when it's suggested -- what date it was that it was suggested that they were killed?  And do you know, or are you in a position to name their killers, from what you've heard?  
A.	If I am to go by the information I garnered during Gacaca sessions, I wouldn't remember the date at which they were killed.  But I do know the names of the people that killed them because their names were published or divulged, revealed during the Gacaca sessions.  
Q.	Now, on the 12th, when the three vehicles you saw arrived, you may recall you told us on a previous occasion, when you gave evidence, your reaction to that, and how -- that there were Tutsis in your house and how they recognised the people as being Interahamwe, and having recognised them, you went in to warn -- or having been told that, you went in and warned, with the others, the other people in the house.  And that you left out of the back of the house and you fled.  Do you remember telling us that? 
A.	Yes, I do remember making that statement. 
Q.	And having fled and run away, and having gone down to Kibobo, where you met No. 1 and the person related to her, and you told us how you stayed there for some two hours with them, or near them for two hours, what did you do that night, the night of the 12th?  Did you go home that night or not?  
A.	In the night of the 12th I didn't try to go back home because I thought that there was trouble all around.  I therefore went to my parents in the ******** cellule. 
Q.	So when did you next get home? 
A.	The next day, on the 13th, in the evening. 
Q.	Now, after the 13th, did you stay home every day and every night, or not? 
A.	During the following days we spent the day at home, but not every day.  It happened that we had to go to church, to pray, and on other occasions we tried to stay away from the road, because you know that we live very near the road.  So we spent some time at the house, and sometimes we would try to run away. 
Q.	And when did you finally leave, if you did leave at all, when did you finally leave ***********?
A.	I couldn't understand your question, sir.  Are you talking about the flight which we were forced to make, or our evacuation, or are you talking about our trying to stay away from the road?  I do not understand your question clearly, sir. 
Q.	We know you ran away after seeing the three vehicles arrive on the 12th and you came back the next day.  Did there come a time when you left your home for any period of time?  Did there come a time when you were in any way forced out of that area, or did you remain living at home? 
A.	We fled when the Inkotanyi took over our area.  We were, therefore, evacuated by the Inkotanyi to Rubungo.  It was the Inkotanyi who evacuated us.  
Q.	Now, can we just come back to the name of the centre?  We've seen from photographs*****************, and you know that the Judges here have visited that place.  So we know that area.  We know the line of houses there.  We know the metal cattle grid there in the middle.  We can get a picture in our minds of where that is, and we understand that that's called ***************.  

Then you mention there's another place that's always -- that's also called that.  Where is that in relation to your house?  Let me put it like that -- not your house -- where is that in relation ******************** where we know ************* and have spoken of?  Where is it in relation to that?  
A.	I don't know whether you went down to 300 metres to that location where you have big eucalyptus trees now.  Now, at that location there is another centre that is a sort of a crossroads between these cellules that I mentioned. 
Q.	Let me put it like this.  Let's put ourselves -- let's stand in the middle of the centre where the metal cattle grid is, all right, the cattle fence in the middle of the centre there.  Now, to go to the place you are now talking of, do we walk towards, for example, the secteur building or do we walk towards the home of No. 1, or what? 
A.	Well, you move towards the secteur building, indeed. 
Q.	All right.  So let's walk towards the secteur building.  Now, I've walked to the secteur building.  Am I there yet or do I have to go somewhere else?  
A.	You go by the secteur building.  It is below the secteur building. 
Q.	When you say "below", is it on the road that would take you to Kayanga or not? 
A.	Yes, that is the road that leads to Kayanga. 
Q.	And we know that that road, in fact, on that site splits into two:  one side taking it to the centre and the other side going straight on, where it meets the road that goes to the Protestant school.  So there's a division of the road there; that's right, isn't it? 
A.	When you take the road to Kayanga from the centre, the Kurupangu centre, you move towards Kayanga.  Now, at about 300 metres there is another road that leads to Lake Muhazi.  There is another road that goes to the Kayanga centre.  Now, at that junction there is another centre.  
Q.	And what's the name of that other centre? 
A.	It is also called Kurupangu. 
Q.	So if I want to meet you and I say, "I'll meet you at Kurupangu," how do I know to meet you there rather than the other place?  
A.	Well, in that case, I will ask you for details as to where we should meet.  You can tell me, for example, "Let's meet at the Kurupangu centre, at the marketplace, the marketplace, Kurupangu centre."  It's up to you to tell me whether you want to meet me at the marketplace or at the other centre,**************************. 
Q.	If I refer to "Kurupangu marketplace", is that the area ***************? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So there's Kurupangu, and there's Kurupangu specifically the marketplace; is that the position or not? 
A.	The two centres are called Kurupangu since -- ever since I was born, those centres were so called.  And, later on, the name was given to the other location, so the two centres are all Kurupangu.  There is a Kurupangu that is rather uphill and the Kurupangu below. 
Q.	Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, I've no other questions, Mr. President.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Mr. Witness, thank you for giving testimony at the Tribunal.  It's now completed, and you are free to go now.  Thank you very much.  
MR. HOOPER:
Again, I don't know whether this witness wishes to see Dr. Rwamakuba, but if he does, may he have the permission of this Court to do so?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, permission granted. 
MR. HOOPER:
There are some exhibits relating to this witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I don't know whether you would allow me to report a concern that I have.  I would like to intimate something to you, to say something to you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
You are permitted; you may say what you wish to say.  
THE WITNESS:
Regarding this trial, I should like to beg this Chamber, if it is possible, that the Judges at the Bench visit the area and come to our Kurupangu centre so that they will know the truth, because if they come, they will meet the people in that area.  This is a request that I am putting to you.  I would apologise if it is of any inconvenience to Your Honours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  I've decided to answer his question.  

Thank you, Mr. Witness.  Trials of this nature have regulated procedures and the way the Judges behave has to conform with the recognised procedures which are laid down for the conduct of trials of this nature.  It so happens that the decision to do a site visit was, in fact, taken, and the Chamber did visit the area.  So, we do have a visual impression of the locality.  

Now, however, the procedure that governs our behaviour does not permit that we make personal enquiries and speak to people in the neighbourhood.  That is not permitted in the way in which our cases are managed.  But we have had a chance to see the locality, and it will enable us to assess the testimony given to some extent.  Thank you very much for your enquiry.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER:
There are three exhibits.  One has been exhibited as D. 204, which is a photocopy of three photographs which were identified by the witness, including the third photograph which showed his residence; that is, his previous residence.  There were then two pieces of paper that have gone -- I don't know where they've gone to, but one contained two names on it, and I hand that up first.  And the second which was referred to by my friend, Ms. Fall, this morning had just one name on it, and I pass that up as typed out, and if the Prosecution and you, Mr. President, can agree that that is -- that was the position, then these would be the exhibits to give sense to the testimony.  But the handwritten note has gone adrift.  So if those are in a satisfactory state, Ms. Fall.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  
MR. HOOPER:
And if we can have the registry exhibit number, D-number.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, there's a problem with the photographs.  Where are they?  
MR. HOOPER:
I've seen -- we've seen those.  They're in the file, and I think, as I say, they're D. 204.  

Mr. Issa, is that right?  Yes.  Thanks.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The registrar informs me the photographs have already been admitted, and the next number is D. 206.  
MR. HOOPER:
Can the first piece of paper with two names on it be D. 206, and the typed replica, as it were, of the second document which was signed by the -- not signed, it was written by the witness who wrote one name on it, that name appears on D. 207?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted, under seal.  Those papers are under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 206 admitted, under seal)
(Exhibit No. D. 207 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all the matters relating to this witness.  I see the time. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We take the mid-morning break now.  
(Court recessed at 1039H) 
(Pages 1 to 11 by Karen Holm)








(Court resumed at 1127H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now we can resume our sitting.  

Mr. Witness, I welcome you back to the Tribunal where you will complete your testimony this morning.  Can you hear me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, Mr. President, I can hear you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  Now Mr. Hooper will examine you.  I remind you that you're on the same oath to tell the truth that you took when you commenced giving your evidence.  

Yes, Mr. Hooper.
WITNESS 4/16
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued) 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning.  Good morning, Counsel.  
Q.	Well, it's a little time since we last saw you here in this Chamber, and you've come back, you may recall, because we were given time to see if we could get documents that you had referred to and that were in the ********* prison, where, of course, you're a detained prisoner *********.  And our investigator has been to Rwanda and has, in fact, had contact with persons that you'd indicated.  And as a consequence of that, there are two documents, both of which are in your hands, I think, I hope.  Have you brought them into court with you this morning?  
A.	Thank you.  Those documents -- the letter that I sent to the prosecutor, calling for justice to be done to me, yes, I have these documents here with me.  
Q.	Right.  And there's two letters.  One is dated the 29th of May 2003, and the other is dated the 3rd of July 2003, and --

Now they've been written in Kinyarwanda --  
A.	Yes, you're right, I have those letters here with me.  
Q.	They've been written, of course, in Kinyarwanda.  Is it right, both of those letters are signed by you?  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  Both letters bear my signature.  
Q.	And if we turn to the letter of the 29th of May 2003 --
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  If the booths don't have these, I'm afraid, we can get them to you.  Excuse me, one moment.  

Well, let's see how we go.  If we're going to -- if we're going -- or either -- or if the Prosecution decide to, as it were, dwell in detail on the documents, we'll have to get photocopies made for you and the Kinyarwanda booth, as they're written in Kinyarwanda, and for the rest of the booths.  I'm sorry I don't have them.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	But let's just deal, then, very, very generally.  The first letter is dated the 29th of May 2003, and that's addressed to -- who is it addressed to?  
A.	This letter was addressed to the prosecutor in Kigali.  I was seeking from him to acquit me since those people that were responsible for the murders in question had pleaded guilty, and that at the Gacaca sessions, the accusations were levelled at them.  Those people that carried out the murders pleaded guilty.  That was the purpose of my letter to the prosecutor.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I have a copy of the original of one letter.  And can I ask that this be passed up, please, to the Kinyarwanda booth?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	This is the Kinyarwanda document photocopy of the letter which you, the witness, are holding in your hand in the witness box.  These are not long letters, and in the circumstances, I'd ask you to -- I'm going to ask you to read the letter, and we'll have translation of it in that way.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the fact that we're in open session going to compromise anybody?  
MR. HOOPER:
Can I just give some thought to that?  I haven't thought about it.  

I don't consider that there's a particular difficulty other than -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
There'll be one -- 
MR. HOOPER:
One name. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- directive that -- precisely, the name.
MR. HOOPER:
Yep.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, Mr. Witness, I'm going to ask you to read the letter, starting with "Dear Mr. Prosecutor," as it were, and then I've got a translation here that you start off by identifying yourself.  You say, me, Mr. XY, and then you say, I'm the son of so and so, and I come from such and such a place.  I ask that you, in fact, cut out that first witness altogether because it identifies you, you see.  And I think from then on you can read it out to us.  And, of course, you don't announce your name at the end as the person who signed the letter.  So have you followed me there?  I think there's a point -- leave out the first sentence of your letter, and then it starts in the translation I've got, "I write this letter to you, requesting you to let justice be done in my case," or words to that effect, the second sentence of your letter. 
MR. HOOPER:
And it may assist -- though, we're going to probably hear a slightly different translation inevitably -- I've got some English translations of the letter of the 29th, and if these could be passed to the Judges for their assistance.  The Prosecution have one.  I don't have a French, I'm afraid.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And we can just follow loosely what you write of in this letter in May of 2003.  So could you start, then, Mr. Witness, from the second sentence of your letter, "I write this letter to you"?  Could you just read it out and read it slowly because someone's going to translate the words as you speak them.  So don't go quickly.  Go slowly.  Thank you.  You may start, please.  
A.	Thank you very much.  "29th May '03."    
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, the witness had started from the top of the letter.  This is why we had to remind him that he should start with the second paragraph.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	No.  Second sentence, please.  Second sentence of the first paragraph.  It starts -- the sentence reads, "I write this letter to you, requesting you to let justice be done."  Okay, have you got that bit?  If you have --
A.	(No interpretation)
Q.	-- you can read from there.  
A.	(No interpretation)
MR. HOOPER:
I'm wondering if it might be quicker for the booth to do it.  Would that be possible, or is it not clear enough to read the photocopy?  It's clear enough.  Thank you very much.  Well, can I beg your assistance, Mr. Booth, if you can read it, please, from there.  That will assist, and we can hear it -- and you can follow it, Mr. Witness, on your -- on your original.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
If you -- 
MR. MORLEY:
(Microphones overlapping)... that procedure, if I may, Your Honour.  I'm a little puzzled as to why the witness is having difficulty reading what, I anticipate, is supposed to be in his own handwriting.  I would ask that my learned friend establishes why the witness is having difficulty reading what it is my learned friend seeks before we start having it read by somebody else.  

MR. HOOPER:
All right.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me ask you this.  The letter that you have, is that a letter written by you or by somebody else on your behalf?  
A.	Thank you.  Now, this letter was written in the presence of several persons that sat in the Gacaca, as well as the deputy of the prison manager.  This letter was, therefore, written by the members of the Gacaca, but they wrote it in my presence, so that it is not me who wrote the letter.  The letter was written in public, so to speak.  There is no secret about it.  There's nothing secret about it.  Even the prison director is informed.  He has taken cognisance of this letter.  As far as reading this letter is concerned, it is not my handwriting, but I can -- I can read what is in the letter.  
Q.	So this is a letter that's written in a -- in a formal way by the Gacaca court at the prison?  Is that right or not?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	Now, can you read it?  I mean, are you -- I mean, some people are better at reading than others.  
A.	It would be better for somebody else to read it instead of me.  But if I am given time, I can read it slowly, but it may take a little bit more time.  But I can read it.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I'm going to invite the booth to read it from the second sentence of the first paragraph, please, to get it done as quickly as possible -- or we can just put in the translations.  
MR. MORLEY:
Will Your Honour just allow me a moment with regard to the translations?  It may be that there won't be a difficulty.  Just allow me a moment.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, if it turns out that you do want it read and translated, it can't be both at the same time from the Kinyarwanda booth is -- what I mean is, someone will have to come down into the well of the court to read it in Kinyarwanda.  Sorry.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that information. 
MR. MORLEY:
I thought a technical difficulty might arise.  Your Honour, I'm informed by the helpful Kinyarwandan assistant behind me that, insofar as the English translations are concerned, they're pretty much right, and my learned friend can put those forward as being a translation of the document in Kinyarwandan.  
MR. HOOPER:
Okay.  Thank you for that.  And have those copies been circulated or not?  Have the Chamber now received -- yes, thank you very much.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
We've only received one.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  Well, let me deal with that one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The 29th of May.  
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Let me read that then.  I'll read it.  It reads, me, names the witness, and his parentage, and his home.  "I write this letter to you, requesting you to let justice be done in my case as I was detained, accused of playing a role in the murder of" -- and he then names Nzamutuma, Magdalene; Kambanda, Evariste; Nkurunziza; a Mukakimenyi; Nyiranjaringa; and Kanuma.  

And can I just pass copies of the letter to the stenographers, please, and can the names I've just read appear as spelt there.  

And the letter continues.  "All of these people were living in Kibenga" -- that's K-I-B-E-N-G-A -- " cellule, Rutunga secteur."  R-U-T-U-N-G-A.  "I inform you that I played no role in the death of these people, because those who killed them are known, and they accept that, and the Gacaca of the prison has shown that.  Those who testify that and those who did that, none of them accuses me."  

And then there's some more names referred to in the letter.  I don't know if it's necessary for me to read those out.  Well, Muta- --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, slowly.  Sorry.  
MR. HOOPER:
-- Mutarataza -- I won't give the first -- the first name.  Mutatara- -- sorry.  Start again.  

"Mutarataza admitted that he killed Nzamutuma.  Nzaramba and Mudaheranwa" -- that's M-U-D-A-H-E-R-A-N-W-A -- "and Hategekimana" -- that's H-A-T-E-G-E-K-I-M-A-N-A -- "Alias Niyonsaba" -- N-I-Y-O-N-S-A-B-A -- "admitted to have killed Kambanda and Kanuma.  Nzaramba" -- N-Z-A-R-A-M-B-A -- "admitted that he killed Nkurunziza," N-K-U-R-U-N-Z-I-Z-A.  "All of these persons are held at *********** prison."

"Mr. The Prosecutor, these persons killed and those who killed them were inhabitants of Kibenga cellule, and I'm an inhabitant of" -- and you name a different cellule -- "and I have never been or seen where those persons were murdered.  I pray you, Mr. Prosecutor, to release me and to let me join my family because you stand for justice and you fight against injustice and for the respect of law.  And it is clear that I played no role in the allegations put to me.  I thank you in advance for how you are to receive my request and the attention you are going to give it in its execution."  And that letter's signed by -- by you.  

The next document you have there, I believe, is a letter, again, written -- well, let's just discover this.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Are you -- is this written in the same way, this letter dated the 3rd of July 2003?  What's the source of this letter?  Was this a letter written by you or on your behalf?  Was it a letter written as part of a Gacaca letter-writing or what?  
A.	Yes.  It was thus that all these letters were written, that is, within the framework of the Gacaca in the presence of the deputy director of the prisons and the Gacaca members in the prison, and in the presence of other persons too.  This second letter was written just like the first.  
Q.	In fact, I think I need to go back to that first letter just for one moment, the letter of the 29th of May 2003, because in our translations, it's just indicated at the end that you have signed it.  But has anybody else signed that letter?  And if so, who has signed it?  What kind of -- 
A.	I signed it personally.  
Q.	Has anybody else signed that letter?  
A.	The prison director also signed the letter, as well as the author, of course, of the letter; that is myself and the director of the prison.  
Q.	Just before we leave that letter, then, I wonder if you could pass it to me, please.  Can I have that letter of the 29th of May in its original before we come to the next letter?  Once I've seen it, I can just have it passed about quickly so that we can see that letter in its original format.  And I say its "original format" -- this letter was sent, was it, and if it was sent, how do we have that document?  Did it come back to you, or did you make a copy?  What's the position in respect of this document?  
A.	Thank you.  Actually, the prosecutor visits the detainees at the prison once every three months.  Now, when I wrote this letter, he was visiting, or he had visited the prison and urged us to write letters in proportion (sic) as the Gacaca sessions were held.  I had to advise the letter written on the 29th of May, by writing the 3rd July letter to add additional information.  Then the prosecutor asked us to write down further evidence to testify or to say that if there are people who withdrew the accusations, they should say so, so that you become blameless.  This is why I wrote this second letter, but the other people who said they are not accusing me would -- did sign the letter.  
Q.	Right.  
A.	And the 3rd July letter is rather like the 29th May letter, apart from the additions.  
Q.	All right.  I'll come to that.  The question I was asking is, if you sent this letter, how do we happen to have -- how is it I'm holding it in my hand today?  Or is this a copy that's written?  
A.	Actually, you have four originals established.  You sent -- we sent all these letters to the director who sent a copy to whom it may concern.  Since I wrote four original letters, four letters in original form, he sent two of the original letters to whom it may concern and gave me the two other original letters.  
Q.	So in the absence of photocopying facilities and the like, there's four originals; the same letter is written, four originals, two of which you've explained are posted off and two are returned to you?  
A.	(Microphones overlapping) 
Q.	Can I just pass, then, one of these documents for the Chamber to see -- and come to your letter of the 3rd of July.  All right.  I'm going to just read, then, from the translation of the letter of the 3rd of July.  
MR. HOOPER:
Before I do so, can I pass copies of it to the stenographers and to the Judges?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Could we ask a copy for the interpreters, please?  
MR. HOOPER:
I've only got one spare, but can it go to you, please?  I've got one spare.  We haven't photocopied sufficient.  So this can go -- probably best if it goes to the middle booth.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And while that's going to the interpreter, Mr. Witness, you were saying, as I understand it, that this letter, the way it's been written, for example, and -- came about in the same way as the previous letter; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  This second letter was written on the 3rd of July within the same framework as the first, apart from the few additions.  And in proportion (sic), as the Gacaca sessions were held, we garnered further information.  Before, you know, people were afraid of confessing and pleading guilty, but as the Gacaca went on, I took cognisance of further articles that I could use to defend myself, and I used them to write the second letter, so that it was thus that I decided to write the second letter.  If not, it is quite similar to the first one.  
Q.	In fact, just looking and comparing the two letters, they are, I think, word for word, the same in their English translation.  So it's a later letter but is distinguished, perhaps, by the end of the letter.  Apart from you signing it -- and again don't give us your name -- who else has signed this letter?  
A.	As a matter of fact, the prosecutor told us that if there were people that wanted to testify that you were not guilty, they should also sign the letter.  The person concerned should also write down the number of his case file so that it facilitates the prosecutor's task.  This is why Mumbarambum (as interpreted), Mudaheranwa, Mutaharaza (as interpreted) signed as evidence or as testimony to the fact that they were not accusing us.  
Q.	All right.  So at the bottom of the letter, is it right that you have, first of all, the signature of Mutarataza, Boniface; next, the signature of Nzaramba, Ephrem; and thirdly, the signature of Mudaheranwa; is that correct?  Do those signatures appear on the letter?  
A.	Yes to everything, with the corresponding case numbers, and that makes the prosecutor's job easier so as to know who to release or who not to release or which case file to delve into before considering releasing anyone.  That is the procedure in prison, and that is the procedure I followed.  
Q.	And we can see in respect of each of those three men, in the text of your letter, and of the letter of May that we've had read, the wording being the same, who they've admitted -- or you claim in your letter -- they admitted to killing, and they've signed your letter, in fact, to confirm what you have said; is that right?  
A.	Quite.  They exculpated me.  They pleaded guilty to having killed the people in question.  And for the moment, I'm awaiting the prosecutor's answer, and I'm not the only one by the way.  We're quite a few to be awaiting such a response from the prosecutor.  
Q.	Now, could you pass up to me, please, that letter so that I can look at it and then pass it around, again, the Chamber.  Yes, thank you.  In fact, there's two -- the two kept copies of the four documents that are brought into existence at the same time, and these are the two that are provided for you.  Is that right?  
A.	Yes, quite.  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions for this witness, thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Is there any cross-examination?  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Mr. Witness, you have to answer questions put to you by the Prosecutor now.  You understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I understand.  I'm ready to answer the Prosecutor's questions. 
WITNESS 4/16
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued) 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	Thank you for bringing these documents.  Were these documents that you had in your possession at the prison?  
A.	Yes, I had these documents at the prison because this is the evidence I shall be using in the context of my trial to prove that I am innocent before the Gacaca court.  
Q.	You did not bring these documents earlier.  How were they obtained just now?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm sorry.  Look, as a result of cross-examination, this witness told us all a week or so ago that he had a document that his cousin can get.  His cousin was in Remera prison, and we had an investigator go to Kigali to go to the prison, to speak to the cousin, to get the documents to bring back to us.  So they were produced in that way.  And the first time this witness saw the documents again was this morning when he had them handed to him to confirm that those are the documents that he referred to in his cross-examination.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You did not write either of these two documents; that's right, is it?  
A.	That is quite correct.  The two letters were drafted in the course of the Gacaca proceedings, in the presence of the prison warden, director of the prison, and the Gacaca bench, the judges of the Gacaca bench.  The letter was drafted on the instructions of the prosecutor so that the innocent people be known and the guilty parties as well be identified.  And all that is as a result of the prosecutor's instructions, and we complied with his instructions.  
Q.	The prosecutor asked for this letter; is that right?  
A.	Quite.  The prosecutor sends the deputy prosecutors to the prisons to -- for that purpose, on that mission.  That is how things are in the prison.  
Q.	Are you satisfied that the prosecutor has, indeed, received your letter of May 2003 and your letter of July 2003?  
A.	Yes, I was satisfied, but I am awaiting a response.  I am presently awaiting an answer.  
Q.	It would be right, would it not, that your answer is self-evident?  The contents of these letters have not been accepted by the prosecutor.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Could you please repeat the question," asks the booth.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It's right, is it not, that the response of the prosecutor is self-evident?  The contents of these letters have not been accepted; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Well, thank you, but when you send a letter to the prosecutor, before your copy comes back to you, the prosecutor must, first of all, accept your grievance.  When the prosecutor is not satisfied he does not send you a copy of your letter.  So the fact that I received the copy of my letter shows that the prosecutor accepted it, and in that case, you just wait.  You just wait for the full answer of the prosecutor.  The stamp on the letter shows that the prosecutor, that the prison director, agree with the procedure, with the drafting of the letter.  That is what -- how things stand.  
Q.	You have applied to be released, and two-and-a-half years later, you remain in prison.  It is self-evident that the contents of the letter have not been agreed with.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	The prosecutor freed prisoners in 2003.  In 2005, he released another group of detainees.  So the prosecutor doesn't release at once all those detained.  He does it gradually.  So I'm waiting to be released in my turn because there are detainees awaiting release, and since I did have acknowledgement of receipt of the letter by the prosecutor, I'm awaiting his answer or to be released.  The prosecutor received my letter, and I'm awaiting to be released -- expecting to be released.  
Q.	I suggest that these letters, written in almost identical terms, are what might be called a punt.  It's an attempt by you to get your friends to exonerate you so that you might be released at a time when you thought there would be general releases.  And it didn't work.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	The Rwandan government wants to know how things happened at cellule -- cellule, secteur, and commune level.  Our commune, which has now become a district, a district -- at least the people who killed people in our commune are known.  They confessed, and they were released.  Others are still in prison, awaiting release.  I am those -- among those who are awaiting release, and I am innocent.  Therefore, I await release.  
Q.	In the letter of May, there's no signature from the three people you say exonerate you.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	The letter I wrote on the 29th of May, at the time of the prosecutor's visit to the prison, subsequent to that, after his visit, he said it would be better, if someone wants to exculpate a detainee, that that person sign the letter of the detainee in question; and that the number of the case file of the person that countersigns also be indicated in the document, which is why the letter of the 7th of July - of the 3rd of July, sorry, is different from that of the 29th of May.  That's how things stand.  
Q.	So the answer to the question was, in fact, yes.  

And if you look at the July document, the only difference, in terms of the information on the July document, is the signatures.  In the May document, the names and the case files are mentioned.  So the only difference in respect of the July document are the signatures.  Now, can you agree with that as a yes?  
A.	I agree with you, but I have an explanation to give you.  When the prosecutor comes to a prison, he organises a meeting with all the detainees and clarifies matters with regard to previous instructions.  When he came after I had sent the letter of 29th of May, he ordered that anyone having sent a letter but which is not countersigned by those who exculpate him, well, that person must write another letter so that those who exculpate that person countersign it, so that the guilty parties be known, which is why I drafted the second letter, in accordance with the instructions given by the prosecutor.  And that is why on the first letter you don't see those people's signatures.  And when you know that you are innocent, you must do everything you can to mobilise the evidence of your innocence.  
Q.	So, again, the answer was yes.  

And if we look at the three names of those you say discharge you, is it right that they have all been released?  
A.	That is true.  Those people confessed, they begged forgiveness, and they were released.  Because the law is that once you have confessed and begged forgiveness from the Rwandan people, you are released.  So these three people did do so, and they were released.  
Q.	And were they released shortly after the letter of July of 2003?  
A.	Well, let us take the example of Hategekimana, Niyonsaba, he was released in 2003.  As for Mutarataza, Boniface, Mutaheranwa, and Nzaramba, they were released in 2005.  
Q.	Dealing, then, with the two who were released in 2005, knowing, as we now know, that people within the Gacaca write letters on your behalf, which you then sign, can you help us with why those two people, so very anxious to help you, have not written letters, which they then signed, to say that you're an innocent man?  
A.	The reason why those people discharged me is because I am a resident of ************ cellule, and the others reside in Kibenga cellule, where the people were killed.  So in the Gacaca sessions I was present because I reside in that cellule.  Those people told the whole truth, and since I was accused, I felt I was concerned, and I deduced that it was they who were responsible for those murders.  So I went to the authorities in the Gacaca court, and I told them that Mutarataza -- Mutarataza and Mutaheranwa pleaded guilty to those deaths and had exculpated me in public.  And so I was asked to write a letter to the prosecutor to be -- in order to be released.  And at the Gacaca session, when they realised that I was innocent and guilty of no murders, the letter was written.  And those are the circumstances under which it was written and sent to the prosecutor.  And today I am still detained, but I am innocent.  
Q.	Another long answer, but can you please answer the question.  You've had two years for these people who were prepared to sign your letter in July of 2003, to have organised the writing of a letter on their part, which would say you're an innocent man.  Why hasn't that happened?  Why isn't there anything in writing from these people who you say exonerate you?  
A.	We hold meetings in prison.  Those meetings are chaired by the director of the prison and the prosecutor, and they tell us that everyone must testify as to his experience.  The person concerned is the first one to speak of his own experiences during the genocide, and it must be done in writing.  If a person is found innocent, they are released.  On that occasion I was present and these people that confessed were there, and I asked them to countersign my letter, and thus they exculpated me.  
Q.	Well, again, that doesn't answer the question, but I'll move on.  The Gacaca officials, who apparently are prepared to write letters on your behalf, why isn't there a letter from the Gacaca officials, saying that these three people exonerated you?  "Mr. Prosecutor, please consider this man's case"?  Why isn't there an official letter from them?  
A.	When the prosecutor comes to meet the prisoners, he listens to their grievances, and he tells them -- he tells you, "I will send as many deputy prosecutors as necessary," and that is why he sent the deputy prosecutors who held meetings in the prison.  After those meetings, the deputy prosecutor responsible for your home area gives you his response in conjunction with the prison director and the prosecutor.  They are the three people who sign your letter and tell you you're innocent.  If they think you're not innocent, they don't sign.  

And as far as I'm concerned, I received this response from those three people, and I'm awaiting release.  And in such a case, when you have the response of those three people, come what may, at some point in time, you will be released.  
Q.	Who is Olere Mukantabana?  
A.	The name "Mukantabana" does not appear in either of these documents.  I don't know that person.  And you know it's more than ten years that I have been detained.  I don't know that person very well.  Perhaps you should refresh my memory.  
Q.	If we look at the document, it seems to have been signed by P-O -- and I'm looking at the English translation -- Mukantabana, Olere.  It may be that there's a spelling mistake, perfectly possible, given that it's a handwriting translation, but somebody has signed this document, and I'd like to know who it was.  Perhaps if you might have the original back, 29th of May, please.  
MR. MORLEY:
Yep, thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	If you look at the document of the 29th of May, top right-hand corner, six lines down, there is a signature.  Who is that, please?  
A.	Thank you.  Under normal circumstances, the prison organisation is such that there is an overall director, deputy director, and a director in charge of production.  And that lady is the deputy to the director responsible for administration.  When the director is absent, it is this person that signs in his stead.  So I have now remembered that lady.  She is in ******** prison.  I know her.  
Q.	It follows, then, that on this document, 29th of May, and on the document of the 3rd of July, there is no signature from any member of the Gacaca committee.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	The members of the Gacaca committees meet in the presence of a substitute of the prosecutor.  It is this substitute that makes the final decision because he is the one that takes the document, and he is the one that hands over replies to persons concerned.  So when you obtain -- when you get your reply, you are happy because you receive a letter -- reply from the prosecutor and the director of the prison.  So the members of the Gacaca committees do not sign any documents.  It is only those other persons that sign the documents, that is, the prison director and the person concerned.  
Q.	No one from the Gacaca committee has vouched safe the truth of this letter; that's right, isn't it?  
A.	Every Gacaca committee member has his or her attributions in the prison.  Now, as far as these documents are concerned, it is the writer of the letter that makes a decision to write the letter with, of course, the consent or the collaboration of the prison director.  So the members of the Gacaca committees have their own attributions.  He has -- or they have documents that they send to the director of the prison.  A member of the committee, therefore, cannot, therefore, countersign the documents.  He has his own documents that he signs.  
Q.	Again, the answer might have been yes.  

The position is, is it not, that this letter -- or the two letters were written by someone within the Gacaca committee?  You told us that earlier.  Can we have that person's name, please?  It's obviously the same handwriting.  
A.	Usually, each secteur has Gacaca presidents.  So if the commune is composed of ten secteurs, you have ten presidents of cellule committees.  Now, after a Gacaca session, these chairmen, or presidents, meet with the delegate of the prosecutor, and they write these letters, the letters of -- or the list of the people who have been exculpated.  I do remember the person that dealt with our own secteur, but they also have their secretaries.  The chairman of the Gacaca committee has a secretary who writes his letters, who drafts his letters.  And even when the prosecutor's substitute is there, those letters are written in his presence.  I do not know precisely the person who wrote this letter.  They sit somewhere in an office and write these letters.  You complain to them, and then they make drafts so that the secretaries (unintelligible). 
Q.	You told us earlier this letter was written in your presence.  Now you're telling us that it was written in an office, not in your presence, and you don't know who wrote it.  Which is true?  
A.	The truth is, when the replacement of the prosecutor is there, you queue up.  He jots down your complaints and writes the letter, and people who exculpate you also come to countersign the letter and a certain number of other documents.  Now, those documents are taken to the prosecutor's office and then directed to the prosecutor's office, and at that time, there was one Noel, who was working as secretary, but he is deceased now.  It was he that represented our secteur and our commune, as a matter of fact.  Well, so far as the secretaries that he had working with him were concerned, there were many.  You go to them.  They jot down your complaints.  
Q.	You told us earlier that the letter was written by a member of the Gacaca committee.  You now seem to be saying it was written by a secretary, acting on behalf of the prosecutor's office.  Which is true?  
A.	The truth is, the head of the secteur, or the chairman of the Gacaca at cellule or secteur level, have their secretaries.  And this has been a very long time.  I cannot tell you the name of the person who wrote this letter, this particular -- or these two particular letters.  You queue up.  You stand before them, and they write these letters.  I cannot remember the names of all the secretaries that wrote such letters for our commune.  Gacaca chairmen, that is, at the level of secteur or commune, had several secretaries.  I cannot point out or tell you the name of any given secretary that wrote the letters.  
Q.	Why is there no letter from the president of the Gacaca saying that what you say is true, namely, all these three people have exonerated you?  Why hasn't there been something from the Gacaca committee?  
A.	Thank you.  When I appeared before this Tribunal, I wasn't told that I should bring the letter of the president of the Gacaca.  If you want me to produce actual documents, it's not a difficult task.  I could request the chairman to give me the letter -- or the president.  I didn't know that I would be asked about this letter here.  
Q.	So there's another document we don't have.  What is this document that you're now referring to?  Tell us about it.  
A.	Usually when the Gacaca sittings are held, as I am an accused, I have to look for evidence concerning the events that took place in my area.  I should, therefore, collate evidence on the events that took place in my cellule or in my secteur, which means that as an accused, I should monitor everything that is said during the Gacaca sessions.  I do have those documents, therefore, since I should be prepared to appear before the Gacaca.  I have all these documents for -- just in case these documents are required of me.  But when I was coming here, I didn't know that you would need such documents.  
Q.	Do you have a letter from the president of the Gacaca, saying that you are an innocent man?  
A.	Usually the president of the Gacaca would have a register.  He has a register in which all the events in the cellule and the secteur are recorded.  The gathering of information is done at the level of the cellule -- at the level of the commune and the secteur, throughout the -- to cover the entire genocide period.  So the president does have all such information in the register.  And as an accused, it is in my interest to monitor carefully everything that is said in the Gacaca sessions.  The president of the Gacaca committee at the prison does have such a register, but he, of course, keeps it in the office of the prison director.  
Q.	So the answer to the question was, in fact, no.  

Can you help me with this?  You've described queuing.  Is it right, then, that there's a long queue of people competing to list grievances and that this letter that you've written is by no means exceptional?  It's pretty standard.  Everybody complains to the prosecutor that they should be released.  
A.	When the Gacaca sittings are held and that -- it is said that in such and such a secteur, such and such a crime was committed, all the accused get together and begin, of course, accusing one another or blaming one another.  And apart from these mutual accusations, we know who's innocent and who is otherwise accused.  It is during these mutual-accusation sessions that some people decide to write letters to demand justice.  They write letters to the prosecutor through the prison director.  
Q.	The two letters which you've produced are self-serving statements.  They are unsupported by any independent documentation to show what you say in those two letters is true.  And I suggest to you that the two letters, unsupported as they are, unsupported by any independent signature, unsupported by any letter in support from the Gacaca committee, unsupported by any letter in support from any of the three people you say exonerate you -- unhappily, a matter for the Tribunal -- are valueless as evidence.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Any re-examination?  
MR. HOOPER:
Just a moment, yes. 



WITNESS 4/16
RE-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	For the last almost an hour, Mr. Witness, you've been questioned about these documents.  When you gave evidence and were cross-examined by Mr. Morley a week or so ago, you said that you'd written to the prosecutor and you'd provided the prosecutor with an exoneration, and you were asked to produce documents in relation to that.  Now, looking at these letters that we have, just very briefly, in the first paragraph, you set out there -- or it is set out by those who make representations on your behalf what you are accused of.  That's the first thing we can see, who it's said you've killed.  Then you state that you did -- played no role in their deaths.  Then you name those who have admitted it and give their names.  And then you state that you were not present when those persons were murdered.  And by the July letter, you have the signatures of each of the men who you say have -- bear out and agree with what you say.  That's the representation that's made.  And it's said that there's no independent signature there, but, in fact, there's the signature of each of those who have confessed to the murders; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is correct, absolutely.  
Q.	Okay.  That's all I need.  
A.	The people that confessed and pleaded guilty -- 
Q.	(Microphones overlapping)... you've given me your answer.  

And is that signed by the director of the prison?  Does the director of the prison, or his agent, add his authority to your representations?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm sorry.  
THE WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. MORLEY:
(Microphones overlapping)... I object to that question in the manner in which it was put.  It's very leading, and it suggests a state of mind on the part of the prison authority which this witness is not in a position to give any evidence on.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Is this letter signed by the director of the prison or by someone on his authority?  
A.	That lady called Olere Mukantabana signs in the absence of the director.  It was, therefore, her that was there, and she's still there. 
Q.	She's not a prisoner.  She -- 
A.	She works at the prison.  
Q.	Yes.  She works at the prison; right?  
A.	Yes.  She works as deputy director of the prison.  
Q.	In fact, is she a Tutsi lady or not?  
A.	I don't know.  I didn't seek to know what her ethnicity was.  At any rate, she works in the prison.  
Q.	Now, you were asked why, despite the fact that this is all you are charged with, you're still in the prison.  A number of those who've admitted to the murders were released in August of last year; is that right?  
A.	Yes, that is quite correct.  
Q.	I'm going to put a date to you because I've looked at my diary here.  Is it right, I met you on the 28th of July at *********** prison?  
A.	Could you kindly repeat the question, Counsel.  
Q.	Is it correct that I met you, in relation to this case, on the 28th of July at ********* prison?  
A.	I do not remember the precise dates.  I wasn't prepared to answer questions concerning the date of our first meeting.  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all my questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Now, Mr. Witness, thank you for giving testimony before the Tribunal.  Your testimony is now completed, and you are free to go.  So you are now excused.  
THE WITNESS:
Most obliged, Mr. President.
(Witness excused)
MR. HOOPER:
Given the nature of these documents and their significance for this witness, may I ask that the original copies, if I can put it like that, not be exhibited, unless that is thought necessary, and that the photocopies, together with the English translation, in respect of both letters, be exhibited as Defence Exhibit -- two separate numbers -- 209 and 10, I think it is?  
MR. MORLEY:
May I address Your Honour briefly?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it possible for the registry to make a photocopy and attach it to the English translations?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, certainly.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Fry, would that be possible?  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't know if the witness has gone -- have they been retained, or has the witness gone off with them?  And can someone ensure WVS don't remove him until we've seen him shortly after the adjournment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  And can I seek permission also for his access to Rwamakuba if he wishes to see him, thank you, before I forget.  Thanks.  
MR. MORLEY:
Very briefly, Your Honour, in respect of the documents, there is an objection invited in respect of their being exhibited.  I'm informed that when a Prosecution witness, GIN, gave evidence, there was a similarly self-serving document offered by the Prosecution, and there was objection taken to its being admitted in evidence, and that was a successful objection.  Insofar as the documents which have been offered by my learned friend are concerned, Your Honours will be aware that they are self-serving documents and -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, just a minute.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we are thinking is this, particularly in view of the time, that the argument with regard to the admissibility of this document and the argument with regard to the admissibility of the document that Ms. Fall had raised which we had deferred, we want to propose that the arguments be submitted to us in writing by Friday.  
MR. HOOPER:
There's quite a lot here on that and other matters, and we're wondering if we can do it by oral argument tomorrow.  We thought we'd have time this morning, but we've run -- it's now 1:00.  The Court sat patiently.  We're not going to clear up today.  I'm afraid we're going to have to sit tomorrow or Friday, in my submission, because there's other matters also to deal with and exhibit numbers and to conclude the position with witnesses.  

In respect of two witnesses of whom there are subpoenas, we're told that they're sitting in Mucyo's office this morning, he being the procureur général.  We're still pessimistic as to what result that will have.  Mr. O'Shea urges me to suggest that we sit Friday just to clarify -- just to tidy up these matters finally, but that may be an inconvenience.  I'm in your hands, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
How much time do you anticipate this will take in all?  
MR. HOOPER:
We've got about a 15-minute argument from Mr. O'Shea in respect of the Gacaca document.  We've got some tidying up on the exhibits.  We've got the final position in respect of subpoena witnesses, but I've already indicated I'm content if you are, Mr. President, to close the case, subject to re-opening it if any of those witnesses can be here functionally by -- to conclude their evidence by the 10th of April -- sorry -- 10th of February, Friday, in other words.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, why do you think that Mr. O'Shea's voice would improve the arguments on the Gacaca papers?  
MR. HOOPER:
Because it will take him away from other duties, as he will, as I know, dedicate himself over many hours to write and hone his written argument, and I will not then have access to his capabilities while he'll be doing that.  He'll go and hide himself away from me somewhere so that I can't interfere with him, and I won't have him to deal with some matters that need, perhaps, to be addressed between now and over the next couple of days.  It's not quite as radical as that, but -- and he's in your hands, as ever.  He's quite willing to produce a written motion, but if there's written motions, there's then days of response to them and counter-response.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The motion has been made already, and the -- the issues have been very clearly identified.  It's just the argument that we need to hear.  
MR. HOOPER:
Would it be possible for us to take those arguments today?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We must vacate the court at 1:30.  That's a point.  
MR. HOOPER:
He says he can do it by 10 or 12 minutes past.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there's something else that we need to do because we have to schedule the closing arguments and the filing of the closing brief.  I don't know if -- to what extent that consideration has been given to that already, and that is what I thought would have been important for us to dedicate a few minutes to, to establishing.  Now, both parties have, at the beginning of the trial session, indicated that they would require approximately six weeks after the arguments -- after the evidence had been concluded, for the closing arguments.  But I want to put a date to you, the 22nd of March, which would mean that the documents would have to be filed the weekend before that, that's on the 17th of March.  Would that be something that the parties can comply with?  
MR. HOOPER:
No, I think that, without (sic) the respect, would be far too quick a period of time.  Originally, I understood that it was going to be eight weeks for the Prosecution argument.  That's the figure we had -- six weeks.  We were thinking we were going to get Prosecution arguments, followed by a period of time for our response to them, at which time we'd have done much of our preparation.  I thought that a period of eight weeks was necessary for us to do that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Eight weeks from today?  
MR. HOOPER:
Eight weeks.  I thought, altogether, I had a figure of ten weeks in my mind.  Where I got that, I'm unclear.  Six plus four.  It had been perhaps mooted in a meeting we had before Christmas.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Not to impose or, I hope, intrude, we were looking at a date for final closing arguments and the final Defence closing argument, having been pre-dated by, we hoped, four weeks for the Prosecution argument.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, just on that issue, our appreciation of the jurisprudence, which has been supported by Appeal Chamber decisions, is that the closing arguments of both sides, both parties, are presented at the same time.  Now, each party would have an opportunity for rebuttal during the oral arguments which follow the presentation of the closing arguments.  But we are not aware that there's a practice, or an approved practice, for a delay such as you propose.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  It's not a -- if that's the practice, then obviously we can conform with it, but we did understand originally, before Christmas, in meetings, we were talking there of a Prosecution date, followed by a matter of weeks and then the Defence.  And we thought that that was not bad practice because the onus is, after all, on the Prosecution, and it would give us a time to respond to matters we hadn't otherwise addressed in our, by then, formed argument, but that it would overcome the necessity of rebuttal.  

And in terms of oral argument, I never saw that more than a presentation, really, of the written document, and I certainly didn't intend -- or in my mind's eye, discussing it amongst us -- have ever intend to take more than an hour or so of court time.  There seems little point in oral argument if it's in a written format, and that's the view that we've adopted.  

But in terms of a date, we'd be looking at the end of April, and the reason for that is that we consider, given the nature of these cases and given the amount of transcripts and the rest, and discussion that then needs to take place, dealing with the best part of 60 witnesses, and then around and consolidating and comparing, of course, those witnesses, to present the Chamber with as finely argued -- and by that, I don't mean lengthily argued, but finely argued position as we're in a position to present.  And both of us, both myself and Mr. O'Shea, consider that to be a reasonable minimum of time for us to present that argument.  

I'm not returning to London until the 26th of this month, and all the work that I do will be done there.  Mr. O'Shea will be in various parts of the world, but that's something that we've accommodated ourselves to in the past, and we'll do it over that period, but it is an added factor for us, and we'll, no doubt, negotiate between us a meeting drawing towards the close of our written arguments to hammer out anything else that we feel we need to.  But we certainly won't be able to do it in the period that was initially suggested this morning, and it's certainly is strongly against our expectations hitherto.  

So we'd ask for a date -- I think Easter's late -- about Easter.  The Court -- I don't know what the Court -- its own position is -- the Chamber's own position is then, and, of course, we'll conform, as I hope we've indicated so far, with the necessary orders and views of the Chamber, but we strongly exhort the Chamber to allow us this necessary time to present the case.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Madam Prosecutor?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  It is correct that at a meeting we did request a certain number of days to draw up our final arguments.  I think we did agree on six weeks.  It is true that it would seem that six weeks might be a bit tight in respect of the work to be done, but if we could perhaps being given two weeks more, it would be reasonable for us.  So instead of six weeks, eight weeks.  

The second point on which I will wish to speak -- and I thank the Trial Chamber for having been vigilant in respect of the Rules of Procedure of this Tribunal -- both the final arguments must be deposited, filed, at the same time.  So I should merely like to know what that date would be for both final arguments to be filed, and that is up to -- in the light of your other obligations, and we shall do our utmost to comply with your decision.  But perfectly honestly, we had, at the outset, spoken of six weeks, but we would merely like to request two further weeks which would be enough for us.  

I don't know if I can turn now to the problem of the submissions in respect of the -- and exhibits to be tendered.  I can tell you that in any case, we will not speak at any length.  We have two or three sentences that must be expressed.  We won't be long.  We will be extremely brief.  We don't need to have written submissions.  We can give you our oral arguments, and that would be not more than three sentences.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  

Okay.  What we think is possible is that we allocate Friday, the 21st of April, as the date for the oral argument -- oral closing argument and the written briefs to be filed a week before that.  That would be the 13th of April.  That's a compromise, ten weeks, Mr. Hooper, because it means that the oral argument will take place ten weeks after, and the written document filed a week before that.  
MR. HOOPER:
I mean, effectively, I'm not back in London, as I say, for two weeks, until the 26th.  And I won't -- there's a -- I mean, I've got things to do here in terms of disengaging and the rest of it here, documents obviously to empty and the rest of it.  So I won't be back there until -- until then.  I don't know when Easter is this year.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good Friday is the 14th of April.  So what we are really thinking was that you file the document -- that we have the closing argument the week -- the Friday after Easter Monday.  
MR. HOOPER:
O'Shea's in Sierra Leone, coming back on the 11th of April.  If the Chamber wants a better -- a decent argument, you're going to have to give us more time.  We'd ask for a period two weeks after Easter, the end of April, for closing -- for closing argument, for us to present our case.  In discussions we've had together, we feel that that's the kind of time that we need.  And there's, perhaps, a -- I don't know -- I think there's a bit more to it than perhaps the Chamber -- the Chamber perhaps may appreciate.  There's a bit more to it in terms of actual hands-on work and going through transcripts and the like, and the comparisons, dealing with the necessary exhibits.  

Mr. O'Shea tells me it will be more concise if you give us a longer time, but I'm not so sure that the Chamber would necessarily accept that as a given, but it should be, yes.  It should be a more focused document.  And as far as the Accused is concerned, I know that he would be -- he would be keenly supportive of our judgement, as his counsel.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Fall?  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I should like to raise a concern here, problem perhaps.  It is the practice in this Tribunal that the written submission be filed before the oral submissions, because it is on the basis of the written argument that, at the time of the oral submissions, the Trial Chamber can base its -- the questions, the aspects it wished to have developed, is on the basis of the written, final arguments.  So this can be checked, but the written, final arguments are filed first, and subsequently one hears the oral submissions.  And arguments are developed, fine-tuned, at the time of the oral submissions.  This is which (sic) I wanted to recall here as being standard procedure before this Tribunal.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a matter of interest, do either of you have any request as to the duration of the oral arguments?  Now, Mr. Hooper had suggested one hour.  If we were to make a scheduling order, do we identify the duration of the closing -- the oral argument, and if so, what would be an appropriate time to allocate?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, our assessment had been on the basis, I must say, of having had sight of the Prosecution closing argument and having taken those arguments up in our closing Defence argument.  But if, in fact, that isn't the procedure and it's not what's going to be followed, then it's difficult to predict what matters may be raised in a document which we'll get, at most, five days before, that may need to be attended to by way of, I suppose, essentially further argument, rebuttal.  And -- but in terms of the actual presentation of the -- the bones, as it were, of the Defence case, I'd have thought no more than two hours would be necessary from -- from our perspective.  So, essentially, I suppose what I'm saying is that it's not a question, as I see it, of the several days that some cases occupy.  I don't know how the Chamber itself is placed in terms of time and the like.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, once upon a time in a former life, there was a co-counsel who we always sent to apply for adjournments because he was able to occupy the entire time available with his application.  We have to adjourn now because we have to vacate the courtroom at 1:30.  So we must resume tomorrow morning.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.  I hope you're not looking at me when you tell that (unintelligible).  But, yes, well, in any event, perhaps some useful discussions can take place between now and tomorrow.  Are we going to adjourn to the normal time tomorrow or -- or what?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  Because I must tell you, we had made other arrangements for the use of the time tomorrow.  
MR. HOOPER:
Right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And there's some activities relevant to our work in the case which we'd like to undertake.  So we prefer to start early.  We could start at 9:00 if that's better -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah, sure.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
-- but we'd like to conclude early enough to have some time to undertake a few other tasks.   
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.  Mr. O'Shea says, what shall we do with the argument?  Can he raise it tomorrow?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
We've got three sentences, apparently, from Ms. Fall -- 
MR. PRESIDENT, 
Yes, we will continue -- 
MR. HOOPER:
-- and 12 minutes here.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We'll continue tomorrow morning. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And as I said, if there is after-court discussion, it might facilitate the -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
 -- agreement as to schedule --  
MR. HOOPER:
(Microphones overlapping)... perhaps we can meet with Ms. Denis as soon as you've risen.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  We take the adjournment now.
