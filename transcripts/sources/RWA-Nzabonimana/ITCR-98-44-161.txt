EXHIBIT

Exhibit No. D. 151	6



























P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karen Hökborg, and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Wednesday, 7 September 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.

Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, before I ask the Prosecutor.  In relation to the admissibility of the Defence exhibit on which we reserved yesterday, we have decided to mark the document for identification and reserve our decision on admissibility indefinitely.  But we would like to have it marked for identification and in the possession of the registry.  
MR. HOOPER: 
I am afraid I was entrusted with all the copies and they are at my house.  Mr. O'Shea, I see, has sprung to his feet; he may have one.  He has.  In fact, he has all the copies.  So as many as need be -- can I put -- I am putting four in.  They are all identically the same and -- to be marked.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, do you have any further information on the main reason for our presence here today?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, yesterday, after the hearing, I pulled out all the stops to see -- to get in touch with Mr. Iain Morley, and I was able to join him finally while he was attending a meeting.  And he told me that he was going to try to bring his meeting with AWV (sic) forward, that is, to 2 p.m. and that he will provide me with information, additional information before 3 p.m.  

That is what I believe they have done, because at 3 o'clock on the dot the chief of Prosecutor (sic) phoned me and told me that, unfortunately, they weren't able to meet Witness AWZ, but that I could tell the Chamber that tomorrow at about 5 p.m. we would have a definitive answer as to whether she will be appearing at the trial or not.  So this is the information I got from the chief of Prosecutor -- of Prosecutions.  

And I also received two messages on my phone here from Iain Morley, who was also confirming to me these statements made by Mr. Rapp.  So they are doing everything to be able to see the witness and give me her answer.  

So tomorrow morning I will be calling Mr. Rapp, since tomorrow we will need a final answer on the problem.  And he told me that tomorrow we will have the definitive decision of AWZ.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, you said at 5 p.m. tomorrow?  
MS. FALL:
Yes, at about 5 p.m., Mr. President.  That's what Mr. Stephen Rapp told me, 5 p.m. Belgium time, which means that will be 6 p.m. Arusha time because there is a one-hour difference between the two time zones.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any information about the witness who -- I am sorry.  Is there any information about the witness who resides in Rwanda?
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President.  I was in touch with a colleague in Kigali, and I have to forward some documents to him from the Office of the Prosecutor so that we -- he can take the necessary steps to contact the witness.  

I think that tomorrow I will also be in a position to give you any additional information.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I suggest then that we sit both tomorrow and on Friday, because you don't expect us to sit after five -- after 6 p.m. tomorrow evening.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I will do everything possible.  As for the -- our sitting, you will be the person to decide when we should. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We cannot be unmindful of the objective interest of justice.  This Accused has been in detention now here since 1996, and I am -- you know, when you advocate that these are important witnesses, and at this stage you are still trying to make contact with them, it -- there's just something that's a little bit strange about it and not quite satisfactory.  I don't know what to do.
(Pages 1 to 2 by Judith Baverstock)





1628H 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am really sorry to come back to this issue.  As you said, these are witnesses that we included on our list and that have been there for a long time, and we really would like to have them.  Up to the last minute, we didn't have any problem, and it is just when we intended to bring them here that they said that they no longer wanted to come and testify.  We have pulled all the stops in order to bring them here, and the reason wherefore we are confirming to you that these are key witnesses to us is that, at a certain point, we were about to request that you give us assistance to make them come here.  But after some brainstorming, we felt that the most appropriate solution wouldn't be restraint but that we should try to convince them to come.  And that is what we're trying to do now.  

I believe, Mr. President, that to ensure equity or balance in justice, the Prosecutor really needs those two witnesses, and that is why we are insisting on this.  Otherwise, rest assured that we would have told you already that we had concluded the Prosecution case after RJ.  But if we can't call in those two witnesses, we will consider that the Prosecutor hasn't finished presenting its evidence.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
I suspect I'm saying something that was probably apparent to the Chamber, that when a moment ago Ms. Fall said that up to the last minute there was no problem, that is not right.  In fact, the Prosecution informed us and the Chamber of the problem at the first minute, not the last minute.  We were told seven or eight weeks ago that there was a problem with the witnesses.  

When we reach a stage well into the day when we sit, half past four now on this Wednesday, a week after this trial was expected to conclude -- and I think it's fair to say that this Chamber will accept that we, the Defence, have a reasonable expectation, as indeed does the Chamber, and that there is an obligation and a responsibility here on the Prosecution that does not seem to be properly addressed and doesn't, as we meet this afternoon, appear to have been properly addressed.  

Today is Wednesday afternoon.  I understood that Mr. Rapp left on Friday and Mr. Morley with him, whenever.  He's been several days in this place with a witness who is, we understand, on a telephone, a witness with an email address, and a witness with a settled address.  This hasn't been a question of hunting her down.  And for our part, I'm sure the Chamber will have every sympathy when we say enough is enough.  

Those are our observations.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have taken into account what has been urged upon us, and after a brief deliberation, we think that, in the interest of justice, we will adjourn this hearing until Friday morning -- Friday, at a time to be announced.  But we also ask that Ms. -- that the chief Prosecutor -- the Prosecutor attend to give a report on this matter.  

I should specify the Prosecutor, Mr. Jallow, Mr. Jallow.  

Perhaps we could take the adjournment now, until Friday.  
MR. HOOPER:
There's one matter, in fact, can I raise at this stage, and that is the passport.  You may recall that the Defence, at the Prosecution request, obtained this passport from the UNDF, from the governor, who very kindly provided it to the registry.  And we've been waiting for the past two weeks, with several invitations to the Prosecution, to come and inspect it.  That offer's never been taken up.  We now return it to the custody of the registry.  

I'm amazed at the indifference that the Crown -- or, the Prosecution have shown, I should say, in respect of this document.  

And, in fact, may I ask that that document be exhibited?  The original, if that could be put in now and exhibited, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there any objection?  

Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
As a matter of practicality, if that is a passport which might require to be used -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Once it's exhibited, you can't get access to it again.  So it might be more convenient if you applied to have a copy -- photocopy exhibited.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, we have a scan, but the passport itself is out of date.  I can't see how it can ever be used.  It's a 1994 passport issued by the Rwandan government in 1993, I should say, and extended until 1999.  So it's a defunct document. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes.  Madam Prosecutor, any objection? 
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, to the extent that I believe that I've had to raise this before the Chamber.  We have on several occasions asked Counsel Hooper to let us inspect the documents that he had.  So far, we haven't had any formal answer.  Our case manager, Mrs. Cummings-John, before going on holidays on the 15th of July, personally contacted Counsel Hooper on the matter.  So far, there has been no answer from Mr. Hooper.  

Now, in respect of the passport, I believe that Counsel Hooper has said before this Chamber that he had André Rwamakuba's passport.  I don't quite recall exactly how he asked us.  Probably I am mistaken, but I don't see how he asked us to come and inspect the passport, unless I've forgotten.  I believe we have the right to inspect that passport, and I think we will do this since he's inviting us kindly to do so.  I believe that for now, since we need that document, we will request -- or, rather, we will raise an objection to the application that he has just made. 
MR. HOOPER:
Right.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I should remind you that the Court, our Court, our Chamber, made an order for the passport to be delivered by the commandant of the UNDF prisons, who had it for the purpose of allowing you to inspect it.  And that was done as an effort, at the Defence request, to facilitate enabling your inspection of the document.  So that was an order which we made.  And we will supervise the photocopy of the passport at the time.  Now -- now, if the -- if the issue is access, having it admitted as an exhibit provides you a level of access to it which guarantees your -- its availability to you whenever you take the required procedures.  It means that the Defence will be completely not involved in the timing or method of your inspection of the document.  So if that's the only issue, then I don't think that's really an objection to the admission because you would have better access if it's in the custody of the Court.  
MR. HOOPER:
I know this Chamber doesn't like a bicker, but I'm in rather a bickery mood at the moment.  I just want to correct the record about what's just been said.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. -- Mr. Hooper, I don't think it's necessary. 
MR. HOOPER:
All right, I'll -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Like I said, the Court was involved in this matter. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I don't have -- I don't have a cat to kick at the moment, so I won't say any more. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Yes, we admit the passport.  

What's the exhibit number?
MR. MJUI:
The next exhibit, Your Honour, will be D. 151. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can that be under seal, Your Honour --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. HOOPER:
-- to prevent any misuse? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 151 admitted, under seal) 
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.

Can I also say that two months ago the Defence provided the Prosecution with details of alibi from mid-September 1993 to mid-March -- or, the end of March, I should say, 27th of March, of 1994.  In that alibi notice was statements and details and CVs relating to three Belgian professors, 
Professor Mercenier, Professor -- Dr. Monet, I should say, and Professor Van Balen.  

Professor Mercenier is now retired, a significant figure in the international world of medicine, now retired, living in Italy; Professor Van Balen, senior professor and consultant in -- in -- in the University of Anvers, or the Institute, as it is otherwise known, of King Leopold and Tropical Medicine; and Dr. Monet, a lifelong doctor and consultant in Africa, presently employed by the World Health Organization in Burkina Faso.  All of those men give extensive details of their knowledge of André Rwamakuba himself and verifying his presence from mid-September '93 to the end of March '94 in various places where the Defence have said he was, i.e., principally at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Amsterdam -- in, I'm sorry, Antwerp, during which time there was no return trip to Rwanda.  

As far as I know, there hasn't been the slightest approach to any of those parties.  The whole exercise has -- appears to have been a relative waste of time in that respect.  And we'd like an early indication from the Prosecution as to whether they challenge any part of this alibi from mid-September '93 to mid-March of '94 because on any view, we're not so distant in time from the Defence case.  Time and energy will be taken up.  And what we ask is, is it really necessary to bring these three eminent men here, at United Nations expense, in order to restate that which is clearly stated and evidenced by their statements and the documents that they produce?  We'd ask the Prosecution to address this issue seriously and to provide the Defence and, indeed, the Chamber with as early a response as possible.  Otherwise, time and energy and great expense is going to be taken up.  

Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That's not a matter upon which I can make an order at this stage. 
MR. HOOPER:
No, we -- we flag it up.  

Another matter is that I received a motion this afternoon.  I know the Court -- the Chamber expects no response from me at present.  But I do wish to say something, perhaps later this week.  I've read the statements of the various witnesses, and I'll say now, as counsel appointed by the United Nations to serve this Tribunal and as a member of my bar, the bar of England and Wales, that each and every allegation is wholly untrue.  

I'm concerned, though, to know, how, in fact, I can go about serving, as it were, my own interests when I notice that it's WVS who lodge the motion and it's this Prosecutor who eagerly supports it.  And I would request an -- an early -- or, a status hearing this week -- perhaps Friday we can raise it again -- in order for us to be able to, if we wish, having discussed it -- because I literally received it only an hour ago -- 

And I notice Ms. Fall laughing.  I personally don't find this a laughing matter, madam.  

And so perhaps we can defer it until Friday.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We won't make a ruling on that at this moment.  But we will consider what you have said.  

I think we can now take the adjournment until Friday at a time to be announced. 
(Court adjourned at 1645H)
