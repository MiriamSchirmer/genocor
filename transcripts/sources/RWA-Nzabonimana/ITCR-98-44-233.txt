P R O C E E D I N G S 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, Mr. Registrar.  Could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 9th of February 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
The appearances are the same.  I think as we commence this final stage of our trial, the only matters, I think, that are left to be addressed are the issue of our scheduling and the arguments -- the legal arguments on the admissibility issues which we had deferred for argument this morning.  In a conference held with the parties just before we commenced hearing this morning, we worked out a schedule which will be formalised in a scheduling order.  But basically the parties have agreed to exchange closing arguments on the 15th of April and to have the written closing -- the oral closing arguments scheduled for Friday, 21st April.  

On the 15th of April, the exchange of closing arguments will be copied to the trial coordinator so the Judges will have access to that material at the same time, in preparation for the closing arguments on the 21st of April.  

Now, Mr. -- I'm not quite certain who starts with the legal arguments.  
MR. HOOPER:
Just before we come to those, can I just do some final housekeeping --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MR. HOOPER:
-- in terms of -- because there's been, I'm afraid, a rather regretful lapse to some extent on our part in terms of keeping abreast witness by witness with relevant documents, and we just want to ensure -- we've had the usual cooperation this morning from Mr. Fry and Mr. Issa, and we are in a position, I think, to bring, as it were, the exhibit list to a conclusion.  

I think yesterday we dealt with exhibits relating to 9/31, the last full Gikomero witness, who produced photographs and the two pieces of substituted paper, if I can put it like that, and those have been admitted.  

In respect of 4/16, prison documents, we seek to exhibit them as D. 208 and 9 and the registry have photocopied the original Kinyarwanda, and they also have the translation that was made in respect of both documents.  

In respect of 5/7, we'd wish to enter as an exhibit an extract from the Gacaca newspaper, Inkiko Gacaca, for January 2005, which was read out, you may recall, and it's in relation to the extract that was read out, and only that, that the relevant extract from that paper has been submitted which is on page 2, the third column, and running over the page to the next page, there's two or three further lines, relating to a reference there to Rwamakuba, where a witness called ************************, is asked if he (sic) was there, and she says she hadn't heard of him.  And in relation to that document, that would be D. 210, slightly out of sequence, but we'd ask that that be admitted.  

In respect of 9/29, she referred to the photograph of the priest and the photograph of André Rwamakuba.  The photograph of the priest has previously been exhibited at D. 150 and the reference to the Rwamakuba photograph is a photograph that's been previously exhibited as D. 177, but it's felt that it's appropriate to re-exhibit them as part of 9/29's testimony, really, just to facilitate those who come to the transcript and can better refer to it in sequence on the exhibit list.  And those two documents have, therefore, been resubmitted today, and they will be D. 211 and D. 212.  

In respect of Witness 7/14, move to exhibit the judgement of GIN, Witness GIN, of September 2002, her conviction for murder.  Now, the original Kinyarwanda and French version of that certainly has been in our hands as part of exhibited documents in the past -- not exhibited documents -- documents that have been served by one side or the other.  But I'm afraid, despite our best efforts, we are unable to lay our hands on that, and so what is being, in fact, exhibited, is the GIN judgement in English translation, but that is sufficient for our purposes.  

We also move to exhibit the final judgement of the case concerning Witness 7/14, a copy of which has been provided to the registry.  It's in Kinyarwanda and not translated, but it's submitted for our purposes in that form.  It's sufficient, and it is the final judgement and acquittal of Witness 7/14 by the court in Rwanda on the 12th of May 2005 -- 12th of May 2005.  

Aside from the fact of acquittal being -- we've had evidence of it, but there's further proof of that.  The date is also perhaps of some significance, given the letter that was introduced by the Prosecution which pre-dates that.  So the judgement is made three months -- or two months after that letter was sent to whichever court it was sent.  So that's the point there.  

And those would be D. 213 and D. 214.  

The only other matter is a fact which is admitted by agreement, which I don't think has been read into the transcript as yet, and I do so now.  And I will present a copy of the document and exhibit that, but I read it in.  It is that "Dr. André Rwamakuba was admitted to the UNDF on the 23rd of October 1998, and has been detained there ever since.  And two, the preliminary medical examination took place on the 29th of October 1998.  His height was 170 centimetres, and his weight was 62 kilograms."  And that document, headed "The Following Facts Are Admitted," would be D. 215.  Perhaps I can pass that up.  And I think those are all the matters -- 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I wanted to ask if that document has ever been disclosed to us before today.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, this is what you, Ms. Fall, agreed to by your e-mail to me of about ten days ago.  It's an extract from the Vindo (sic) letter.  The Prosecution wouldn't admit the rest of it.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I am really upset by some practices here.  The letter to which I responded was Mr. Guindo's letter.  He didn't want to appear before the Trial Chamber.  He told us why.  And the letter was about Rwamakuba wearing glasses, if I remember correctly, using spectacles.  We did, several times, respond to Counsel Hooper's request by saying, of course, we would not object to that document being admitted as a Defence exhibit, but we do not at all agree that these are agreed facts at all.  So the document he's referring -- that I said clearly in my e-mail to him, the document (sic) referring to does not bear these -- this information.  It's merely that he'd been prescribed glasses and that he hadn't worn them since then.  That was the only thing on which I had responded to Counsel Hooper's request.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm sorry.  I thought this was all agreed.  I was told by Mr. Morley that the facts about the glasses would not be agreed which is why it's been extracted and doesn't form part of the document, but if what I'm hearing is right, I can submit the entire document.  And can I, therefore, withdraw the last one, and I'll read the letter in its entirety.  And, thank you, Ms. Fall.  

And the letter, therefore, reads as follows:  "Detainee André Rwamakuba" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Not too quick.  Sorry, sorry.  
MR. HOOPER:
-- "Detainee André Rwamakuba was admitted at the UNDF on the 23rd of October 1998, and had been detained since that date.  The preliminary medical examination took place on the 29th of October 1998" -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Slowly, slowly.  Sorry.  
MR. HOOPER:
 -- "on Detainee Rwamakuba's consent.  His height was 170 centimetres, and his weight was 62 kilograms.  

"Two, when detainee Rwamakuba was admitted to the UNDF, he had no spectacles in his possession.  

"Three, he was seen by an optometrist and prescribed spectacles on the 9th of June 1999.  However, the record available does not show when he was provided with spectacles.  

"Four, in general, Detainee André Rwamakuba has not worn spectacles since it was -- the time it was prescribed to him."

And it's signed by Saidou Guindo, UNDF commanding officer, and dated the 16th of November 2005.  And can I, therefore, admit or have admitted that as D. 215, please.  Thank you.  And I'll withdraw the shorter -- the other document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I take it there is no objection to these?  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all the housekeeping matters. 
MS. FALL:
No, Mr. President, no objections.  Sorry, I hadn't put on the microphone.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Admitted. 
(Exhibit No. D. 208 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. 209 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. 210 admitted)

(Exhibit No. D. 214 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibit No. D. 215 admitted)
BY MR. PRESIDENT:  
Is that sufficient?  

Mr. Hooper, are there any documents in this group which need to be put under seal?  
MR. HOOPER:
Indeed, there are.  In fact, it's probably easier to -- the D. 210 does not need to be under seal.  The (By order of the Court, this name has been extracted and filed under seal) document -- sorry.  Can I have that redacted immediately?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that's redacted immediately.  
MR. HOOPER:
The 4/16 document, two prison letters should be under seal, and the translation.  

The extract from the Gacaca paper does not need to be under seal.  

The two judgements produced in respect of 7/14 should both be under seal.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we make the order for the relevant documents to be placed under seal.  
MR. HOOPER:
Those are all those matters, and the only other matter I'd mention is that there was an application earlier which -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper -- I suppose this is also for Ms. Fall as well -- question, why should we put under seal a judgement when a judgement is a public document?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, I'm quite happy that they are, in fact, not under seal, but I suppose the argument is that both those protected -- protected witnesses, the judgements relating to them, are so closely allied to them, that it would be, I think, to an ordinary reader of transcripts, clear from the judgements, what names, as it were, are relevant to the witness.  Because the judgements also have a history of the events in those cases and all the relationships.  And so it would fill in the gaps, as it were, the pseudonym gaps, and -- and there we are.  But I see -- I'm entirely in the Chamber's hands, and if it's felt that it's not appropriate for a judgement to be under seal, I don't stand in the way of that at all.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Our position was not as strong as that.  We were genuinely asking.  In fact, we were thinking that -- much along the same lines as you've mentioned, but we thought we should just ask counsel on both sides.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I believe that for once I'll go along with the Defence.  I'll go along with the Defence for once, and, indeed, if the judgement is public in Rwanda, in the Tribunal, on the contrary, it covers protected witnesses, and I believe it would be better that the judgement be put under seal.  I leave it to your wisdom, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  Well, we'll leave them under seal.  

You know, we have a very pro-active support team in the courtroom, and the interpreters have drawn to our attention that the closing brief cannot be translated within one week.  Now, is the issue of translation going to be an issue in the closing brief of this case?  Will the closing briefs be provided in English, or is there going to be a need for translation?  
MR. HOOPER:
How long does translation take?  What's the minimum period within which both of these briefs can be translated into the sister language?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We don't know what's the minimum period, but we were told that we'd have to make an allowance of one month.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, the Prosecution is presumed bilingual, and we'd ask for an order that their closing argument be in English.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just as a preliminary issue, we -- we want, first of all, to enquire whether the closing briefs will contain confidential information.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  I mean -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question that we are -- the purpose of the question is whether or not it is worth enquiring whether, if the time standards we have in mind cannot be met in-house, whether it is worth considering the possibility of contracting out the translation.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yeah.  Well, there's bound to be a wealth of private and in closed (sic) information in our closing briefs.  And I doubt if we'd even -- we would even consider using pseudonyms over much within the brief in order to make it easier so -- for the reader, really, but -- well, as well as the writer.  But even with that, I don't see why that should necessarily be a handicap to an appropriate contract being brought into existence.  I mean, if it's out-house, it would be work done under obligation, and that could be reflected in the contract.  

It's a bit of a fly in the ointment, this translation matter, because not only is there the act of translation, but there's also the need for the other side to be able to fairly deal with the subject.  And though one of us is bilingual here, one of us isn't, and that's me.  And though I can read much of the French text that we get, it gets more difficult if one's dealing with a technical document, which closing arguments can be, at least in part.  It would be unfair, I think, to expect me to be able to be at ease, on behalf of the Accused, with a French document.  I think the Chamber recognises that.  But I don't want to stand in the way of the schedule because I know there are good reasons why it's being adopted.  But at the present, I can't quite see the best way around this.  

In terms of consideration of arguments, it's not a difficulty because there would be time -- well, there should be some time for translation, for your brother Judge, whose English is rather akin to my French.  But with us, between the parties, I'd have thought an English document on both sides is what's necessary.  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
Counsel Hooper, am I the Judge to whom you are referring when you are saying that my English would be like your French?  
MR. HOOPER:
No.  No, not at all.  
JUDGE HÖKBORG:
It was a rhetorical question.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right, yes.  No.  But there's that aspect of translation as well.  I'm not losing sight or diminishing the francophone content of the Tribunal or our need to serve it, but it's just the mechanics of how to go about this in the time scale, poses the problems, of course.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, let me please give you my point of view concerning the confidential documents and Mr. Hooper's reaction to the fact that he would not use pseudonyms, if I understood him correctly.  I believe that may run counter to our practices here in the Tribunal as far as it is the pseudonyms that are used both in briefs and in the judgements.  Using names, therefore, could generate some problems in certain briefs -- in briefs in general.  

Now, the other problem so far as translations are concerned, I would throw the ball back to Mr. Hooper.  If he thinks that we are bilingual, probably I could say the same thing as far as the Defence is concerned, and that will not be contradicted.  There we have somebody who is totally French.  

Now, apart from that, I believe that at our meeting yesterday in our team, we thought that it would be better for us, when we serve our brief, that it be done both in English and French.  Now, the problem for us is in terms of time limits, but we could really say that we will do our best -- we cannot do the impossible -- to ensure that the translations are done and submitted in French and English, that is, within the time frame.  

Now, the second issue we would like to raise is that, of course, if we are to work in two languages, we will take it that the Prosecution receives English documents that then are translated, and there's no obligation for the Prosecutor to submit his brief in one of the languages of the Tribunal (as interpreted).  This is in response to Mr. Hooper, that I would like to add, once again, that as we see it, we would submit briefs in the two languages within the time frame, if possible, of course.  We will have to take into account the composition of the Chamber in which we have English-speaking and French-speaking officials.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  

Mr. Hooper, we were also told that the translation unit, in-house, would be assisted with provisional translations.  So, for example, if your -- would you be in a position to submit a provisionally translated document with your brief?  
MR. HOOPER:
When you say "provisionally," what -- provisionally in French?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah.  
MR. HOOPER:
I don't think we are.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you going to be submitting your brief in English?  
MR. HOOPER:
I mean, Mr. O'Shea's spoken French is pretty good --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What about your legal assistant?  
MR. HOOPER:
-- but his written -- his written French is not that good.  

And in terms of the legal assistant, the difficulty there is the English side of it.  So we don't have anyone on this team who could -- who could adequately, that I can see, translate a document, nor -- the document, nor do we feel we'd have time to do it.  And the difficulty is, we can't subcontract it out.  Well, we can't basically because there's no funding from the registrar -- registry for that, and we can't find anyone that fulfills the requirements of the UN.  It has to be someone who's a self-correcting translator.  There's a particular criteria, and they don't seem to exist outside the UN.  It seems to be a particular tag or qualification that only seems to exist within the UN.  So that's from a previous attempt to get translations done a few years ago.  So we'd be looking to the registry, whether they were keeping it in-house or not, to translate a document -- or our document.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. HOOPER:
And I'm just thinking whether we can sort of feed the document in, in stages, but it doesn't work like that, this kind of document.  It's not an episodic document.  It gets finished, and then that's -- we're not in a position to, as it were, feed in pages as we go along.  I don't think that's the answer, thinking, as it were, on my feet on that.  So... 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

I think we've spent enough time with this issue.  We will -- I think the Chamber will take this up directly with the chief of translations and see what is the best solution.  If it turns out that the problem cannot be solved, we will get back to you and make any adjustments that may be necessary, but I think that we can take it from here with the translation department and see if we could find a satisfactory solution.  Okay?  

Okay.  Now, you have promised to us -- you had promised to compress your legal arguments on the two matters that are left open for legal argument on the admissibility.  Who goes first?  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honour, my suggestion would be that Ms. Fall has attempted to admit a document, and we've objected to it.  So it would make sense that we go first on the basis that we elaborate our objection, and then the Prosecution follows.  That would be my suggestion in relation to that matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, that sounds reasonable, Mr. O'Shea.  You can go on.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Your Honours, the Prosecution has sought to admit a document in relation to a Gacaca process which took place in Mamba, a document which is dated the 25th of January 2006, and it seeks to admit the entire document.  We object to the admission of the entire document on three grounds.  

First of all, we say that to admit this document would be antithetical to the integrity of the proceedings under Rule 75.  

Secondly, we say that the means by which this evidence was obtained casts substantial doubt on its reliability, again under Rule 75.  

And thirdly, we say that the nature of the document would, if admitted as it is, without further evidence being called, tantamount to a violation of Article 24(E) and Rule 90 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.  

So coming to the first issue, we say that it would be antithetical to the integrity of the proceedings to admit this document because of the history of the way it has been dealt with by the Prosecution.  We say the Prosecution conduct in dealing with this document and the consequent prejudice to the Defence militates against its admission.  There have, in our submission, been two, at a minimum, negligent misrepresentations on the part of the Prosecution, which both the Court and the Defence have relied upon to their detriment.  

The first was in relation to when the issue of the existence of this document was first raised during the testimony of a witness when the witness stated that at the Mamba Gacaca, she had heard the name of André Rwamakuba mentioned one time.  And the Prosecution undertook to exercise their good offices to attempt to obtain whatever document this was which contained the name "André Rwamakuba" from the Mamba Gacaca.  This was apparently done.  A document came into existence.  The Defence did not take any steps to try and get the document independently, by virtue of the undertaking of the Prosecution.  But the Prosecution, instead of disclosing to the Defence on obtaining it, decided to keep its existence secret.  

The second negligent misrepresentation was this, that when Mr. Hooper insisted that he was entitled to see the entirety of the document, Mr. Morley, acting for the Prosecution, made the following statement:  "The other material within that document is no more than observations on other people who have not been relevant to this Tribunal thus far."  Now, the Prosecution in all fairness, should have said, "However, Your Honours, I should point out that it relates to three witnesses on the Defence witness list.  And, further, that we, the Prosecution, inadvertently however, but we do have knowledge of the fact that at least one of these witnesses is the subject of a decision of a subpoena."  

In our submission, the admission of that additional information makes that statement of Mr. Morley a misrepresentation to the Court and to the Defence.  The statement refers to a lack of relevance.  Clearly those names had relevance to these proceedings, by virtue of being on the Defence witness list and by virtue of what was said about them in those pages.  But also the use of the words "thus far" in that statement of Mr. Morley tends to suggest a fairly well articulated position on the part of the Prosecution, that they were, in fact, aware of the fact that this evidence was about to become relevant.  And in those circumstances, that, in our submission, is unfair conduct on the part of the Prosecution.  

The follow-up from that was that the Court decided not to make a ruling in the face of a request by Mr. Hooper to make a ruling because in Mr. Hooper's view, and I quote, "I have another witness to come.  In order to deal with this document fairly and squarely, I submit that the Defence are entitled to see it in its entirety."  Even then the Prosecution did not correct their statement.  Mr. Hooper did not insist when the Court said it would not make a ruling but decided to go along with what the Chamber was saying when the Chamber said it would not place -- it may or may not place a certain amount of weight on the document in such circumstances, and that it was surprised that the Prosecution would not disclose the other pages.  

Then the witness gives -- the second witness gives testimony.  Mr. Hooper does not have the opportunity to make reference to those other pages to that other witness.  That other witness was in a position to comment on the contents of those other missing pages and, therefore, to shed light -- assuming that the Chamber were to find the witness's testimony credible -- shed light on the general reliability of that document.  

Then the Prosecution decides, when that witness's testimony is finished and when the Defence has been deprived of the opportunity to do that, the Prosecution then decides to attempt to admit the entire document.  In our submission, that whole exercise, apparently calculated on its face, but possibly innocent, but whether innocent or calculated, gives an appearance of great unfairness and prejudice on the Defence.  So we say that it should not be admitted because it would be antithetical to the integrity of the proceedings to do so under Rule 75.  

The second matter is this:  Your Honours will have noticed on the face of the document that there were four signatures, and one of those signatures was a previous protected Prosecution witness, known to this court as RO.  This was one of the signatures of authority on the Gacaca document.  Now, that Witness RO, has, first of all, given testimony in the previous trial in this case against this Accused; secondly, has given written testimony against lead counsel on the Defence team, testimony which this Chamber discounted and said was without foundation; and thirdly, this Witness RO is a witness who some of our Defence witnesses have been claiming, whether this is right or not, been claiming that this person is central to a plot or a clique to provide false evidence.

1100H 
MR. O'SHEA:
Now, in those circumstances, it would, in our submission, be antithetical to the integrity of the proceedings to be given a document which is given the stamp of authority by a person in that position.  And we also say, on the second ground, that that casts substantial doubt on the reliability of the document because this person clearly played a central role in how this evidence was initially obtained.  

Thirdly, we say this:  that in that document, that document essentially contains a page of allegations against the Accused and a page of allegations against each of six Defence witnesses who are subject to subpoenas, who, interestingly, according to my observation, do not appear to be targets in the witness statements of Prosecution witnesses before, or in the PVs that have been the subject of discussion in this case.  According to my recollection, these -- these individuals have not featured, as other individuals who are not in the document have featured extensively.  

Now, in these circumstances, here we have these allegations.  We do not know from whom these allegations come.  There is no indication as to which witnesses in the Gacaca have made these claims.  And that, put together with a Prosecution -- a prior Prosecution witness's stamp of approval on the front of the document, where does that leave us in terms of Article 24(E) of the Statute, which says that we are entitled to examine witnesses under the same conditions as the Prosecution?  And where does it leave us under Rule 90, where, in principle, evidence should be heard orally?  These are blind allegations thrown at us, against the Accused and Defence witnesses, which we are unable to test.  And those are the circumstances, Your Honours, under which we say the Court should not exercise its discretion, and it is a discretion under Rule 89 to admit these documents, Rule 89, in conjunction with Rule 75, in conjunction with Rule 90, in conjunction with Article 24(C) and the application of general principles of law.  

Those are all my submissions.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I hope that I will be able to keep my promise.  I said that I would be pronouncing three sentences -- uttering three sentences.  I will try to stick to that, but of course everything depends on the length of the sentences.  

Mr. President, first of all, I should like to clarify the chronological order of events.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, in order to assist you, we can define a sentence as lasting as long as your breath.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I can assure you that I have quite a capacity -- lung capacity.  

So, I was saying that I should like to re-establish the chronological order of events and the reality, even, of the events.  Counsel O'Shea spoke of a document that the Defence had asked us to assist in obtaining.  Well, it wasn't at all -- and I don't think Counsel Hooper will contradict me, but it wasn't anything -- it wasn't at all a document coming from the Gacaca jurisdiction.  He'd asked us if we could give him the list, the published list, the people who had been accused, and we complied on the 27th of January, 2006, and that can be confirmed by colleagues in Kigali.  And, to date, we have not received a response.  

Another point regarding our refusal to submit the document to the Chamber, we don't think that these are relevant under Rule 67 or 68, that are quite clear as to the Prosecutor's obligations.  We merely said -- and Counsel Morley only pronounced a single sentence that Mr. O'Shea quoted.  He said that, indeed, in the document, there were other items concerning other witnesses, and it wasn't the time to disclose that and it would be disclosed subsequently, when necessary.  And not intending to use it at the time, he felt it was unnecessary for him to disclose them.  

And there is another thing I should like to clarify.  If it is true that we felt it necessary to disclose the totality of the document, on the spur of the moment, really, when it would -- we thought we'd do it when it would be necessary, but because the Trial Chamber said they wanted to see the rest of the document, which is why, the very next day, after the Bench's request, we decided to disclose the document.  

Mr. President, very rapidly, coming to those documents, their source, I think that here the source, the provenance, has been discussed, has been widely explained.  We explained the circumstances under which we received the document through our colleagues and the judicial authorities.  We requested that Gacaca proceedings document, which is what was done.  It was sent to us quite late in relation to the deadlines under which we were working, and when we received it, in respect of those items which concerned us at the time, we were -- the witness was appearing -- that part we disclosed to the Defence.  But when you look at the document, you see that the provenance is the Gacaca jurisdiction, with their stamp, and there's no doubt as to that because the Defence witnesses questioned, in turn, did confirm that the Mamba court was, indeed, the one responsible for the events that occurred in Butare.  

Those Defence witnesses that testified never questioned the names appearing in the document as being the people constituting the Mamba Gacaca committee.  RO has been referred to here as a witness that was neither reliable, nor credible, and part of an alleged clique -- I'm using the term without at all being convinced thereof.  Yet, again, there the Defence witnesses did acknowledge that they were part of that Gacaca committee and could be considered, under the organic law, as being the people termed "persons of integrity".  I should add that she no longer is a Prosecution witness and has not been one for quite some time now.  

As to the source of the document, provenance of the document, I should not dwell on this at length.  I've already told you the essentials, who supplied the document and whence; there are authentic signatures.  No one has questioned the authenticity.  And the point that concerns us, which is important under Rule 89, is that you are the only ones able, Mr. President, to admit an exhibit, and you -- and it is solely the Bench, and I'm convinced that -- to determine its authenticity, and of that I am convinced.  

Mr. President, I should not like to speak at excessive length on -- nor dwell on these arguments that have been amply elucidated before the Chamber.  We merely request that it be admitted, at your request, since you did say you wanted to see the document, and if it is true that this document contains, in the main, three Defence witnesses -- mentioned three Defence witnesses that have been accused of having committed reprehensible acts at Butare university hospital, but those witnesses having not yet appeared before the Trial Chamber, we did not feel at the time that it was necessary to use the document.  And perhaps we were quite right, because those three witnesses have been withdrawn from the list of Defence witnesses.  Some were the objects of subpoenas, but others were quite simply withdrawn, they having refused to come to testify before the Trial Chamber, and we can -- we are free to imagine what could be the reasons for the refusal.  

Mr. President, I shall not speak any further on this document.  You are in a position to assess its authenticity and also are in a position, I think, to say whether, as we request yet again, it can be admitted as a Prosecution exhibit, since you had asked also to take cognizance thereof.  

Now, Mr. President, I don't know if I can speak on the second document.  
MR. O'SHEA:
Well, before you do, with respect, I think I need to make a couple of short comments.  Again, there's been a degree of misrepresentation here, which is so self-evident that I'm not going to go into it, but I would like to point out two things, however.  

First of all, this is not an issue of the disclosure rules.  This is an issue of the way the Prosecution has conducted itself in attempting to introduce this evidence.  A document is either disclosed or it is not disclosed.  It is admitted or it is not admitted.  And the Prosecution cannot have their cake and eat it.  They cannot introduce a document and decide to only use part of the document, hide the rest of the document, in order to prevent the Defence from making use of it, and then subsequently introduce the whole document.  That is what I am complaining about:  It is the conduct of the Prosecution.  

And it is incorrect to say that the three names or, indeed, any of the names on that Gacaca document of witnesses have been withdrawn from the Defence witness list.  Even now the Defence has not closed its case, and if we do close our case, we will do so with leave to call the subpoena witnesses if necessary.  But that is not where the prejudice lies.  The prejudice lies in the nature of the document itself.  The Prosecution has put forward a document, the entire document, in a manner to assert its reliability.  Now, it is clear that Mr. Hooper would have been in a position to examine the contents of what was said against the three previously-unused names to the witness in the witness box, and the witness's knowledge of events at the hospital and of those three other people may have cast doubt upon the reliability of that document.  

We were deprived of that opportunity because the Prosecution not only decided to have their cake and eat it, but to do so in a manner which was, at the very least, negligent.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. O'Shea.  

Ms. Fall, can you come to the second issue now?  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think that, in relation to what has just been said, I have explained at length the response to Counsel O'Shea's arguments.  I don't think he's brought anything new.  The problem here in respect of what I've just heard would be to ask whether the Defence wants the Trial Chamber to have the capacity or power to withdraw our documents.  

The admissibility of the first part of the document concerning the Gacaca jurisdiction, to my knowledge, the Defence formulated no objections to its admission.  By logical deduction, therefore, one could say that she could -- the Defence could not, therefore, refuse the supplemental part, the -- so I don't understand today why such intolerance, why if one part is admitted, it can't be admitted in toto.  

I don't wish to repeat the legal arguments I developed there.  I should merely like to say that we are ready because, under Rule 89, the Trial Chamber has every power necessary to verify the authenticity of the document.  We are convinced that it is authentic in any case, but should the Bench require any further proof, we are ready to provide it.  But I think that we have already clearly explained how the document was produced and what was the source, the provenance.
 
Now, Mr. President, I don't know whether I can go on to the second point. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we would like you to do that now.  
MS. FALL:
The second point is the letter shown to us by one of the Prosecution witnesses, and here we are in the same situation as the Defence, who here requested that a document be produced that had been -- that had been requested by one of the Defence witnesses who said he had a letter that would exculpate him.  We are in exactly the same situation.  

I think that when our Prosecution witness came here, GIN, she had always denied the allegations against her, that on appeal she had provided exculpatory material by the perpetrators of that murder.  And when we questioned Witness 7/14 in cross-examination, we did mention that letter that had been disclosed to the Defence.  Mr. President, I think we could do so, and that's what we did.  

There seemed to be an objection, a Defence objection, which we did not quite comprehend, actually, and we should like to enter the document.  The objection was, I think, because the witness had said, "Yes, it is not a normal document," but, unfortunately, when we came to study the document, the whole procedure that the witness had defined in -- under questioning, had been respected.  The letter had been sent to the president of the Supreme Court. 
MR. O'SHEA:
I'm not being rude.  It just -- it appears to me that we might be at cross-purposes.  Is Madam Fall under the impression that we are objecting to the admission of the letters which we obtained?  I'm not sure which document the Prosecution is talking about, in fact.  I'm getting a bit lost with this.  It may be that we're in agreement.  You see, my understanding was that the Prosecution had an objection to the two letters.  I thought that was the other legal argument.  We appear to be dealing with something else, unless I'm mistaken.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I don't know if everybody was following what I said at the outset.  It would appear not, at least on the Defence Bench, because I said that I was referring to the second document concerning the letter that I had used in my cross-examination of 7/14, and I think that Defence has forgotten its objection. 
MR. HOOPER:
There's no objection to that.  We've raised serious questions as to its authenticity and provenance, but as a document, it's been admitted, as far as I know.  It just happens to be sent to the wrong person, which is puzzling, but there we are. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
If that's the position, then we could move on, if there is no objection.  
Mr. Fry, what's the position?  Do you have the document?  
MS. FALL:
Which does show that there was an objection, because we couldn't get it admitted as evidence.  There was an objection to this at the time when I questioned -- was cross-examining 7/14, but -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, we have moved past that now.  

Mr. Fry, could you just get the document and see if you can get it in now.  What would be the number, exhibit number, for that document?  
MS. FALL:
I think it might be P. 94, unless I am mistaken.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, admitted as P. 94. 
(Exhibit No. P. 94 admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Now, I think that we will not be able to rule immediately on the legal arguments that have been addressed, but we reserve that and address it in due course.  

Are there any other outstanding matters?  
MR. HOOPER:
The only outstanding matter, I think, was that we sought a ruling in respect of the Prosecution disclosing their file on the Accused André Rwamakuba, relevant, that is, or up until the time -- or relevant to the time when Mr. Goldstone wrote his letter to the Namibian authorities, saying that they had no reason to request the Namibian authorities to further detain André Rwamakuba, which led to his release from custody, he having been detained by the Rwandan -- by the Namibian authorities in conformity with their obligations under international law to United Nations, and they having, in fact, instructed the Prosecutor that they held Rwamakuba.  That file has been the subject of the history, as we know.  We have never had access to it, and we've asked, in fact, that the Prosecution disclose it, if not to us, to you, the Judges.  

That's the only outstanding matter, except for one --  
MS. FALL:
Yes, Mr. President, very quickly, in respect of this file, it's not the first time the request has been made before you.  We have developed those arguments previously.  And as to that, in quotation marks, "file", we have said that we do not have such a file.  That's all I can say now.  This has already been discussed here.  

Secondly, I should nonetheless like to know -- at least, the Office of the Prosecutor would like to know if the Defence case is closed or not, because I thought I heard that the Defence case is not closed.  So, is that just a supposition on the part of the Defence, or is it really closed or not?  Because I think we did stipulate the dates by which we have to present our closing arguments, and I should be very surprised if we should have further hearings before the date fixed for the closing arguments.  So I should like to know if at this stage the Defence case is closed or not.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, the answer to that is, it's not closed as yet.  We are moving towards closure in a minute or two, I think, but from our position as a Chamber, we needed to know if there were any outstanding matters which we needed to rule on before the case is closed.  

Now, the issue with regard to the file, as you have said, we do have some recollection that we have considered it before, but we just thought that we'd say at this stage that we will look into it again so as not to delay our proceedings this morning, and make our final ruling on that in due course.  But were there any other matters which are outstanding on which you think that we need to rule before the case is closed?  You have nothing?   

Yes, Mr. Hooper?  You had mentioned that there was nothing, except for one matter.  
MR. HOOPER:
That was it.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
That was it. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So we are -- as far as our obligations are concerned, we have ruled on everything that is before us, up to now. 
MR. HOOPER:
There's an outstanding ruling on XV's statement. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
XV's statement.  
MR. HOOPER:
That, at one time, had been expressed to be something that was going to be ruled on, and then at another time it was going to be something that we dealt with in the course of the judgement, as a matter of weight, which is, in fact, our perception of it in any event. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think that latter recollection is correct.  
MR. HOOPER:
But it hasn't been admitted as yet. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have reserved on that.  
MR. HOOPER:
All right.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We recall that we have that obligation, but it was not necessary to deal with it until we came to the judgement. 
MR. HOOPER:
In that case, that's it, as far as we know. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Ms. Fall, that is also your position, that the Tribunal -- we have discharged our obligations in terms of rulings on matters which have been raised, as far as the Prosecutor is concerned?  
MS. FALL:
Absolutely, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  

Now, Mr. Hooper, we had agreed, I thought, that you would close your case today, subject to the liberty to call the subpoena witnesses if WVSS produced them before Friday.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, exactly.  And -- yes, well, we are aware we all have our entrances and our exits, and ours is probably a little overdue, but, yes, I formally close the case, the Defence case, of André Rwamakuba, subject to that proviso, which is effectively a closure today, but we maintain until 1:30 tomorrow, at the appropriate time, the facility, should the Rwandan government fulfil its obligations, either by way of a transfer order in respect of the detained witness or in respect of subpoenas which have been directed to the government of Rwanda by this Chamber.  And if the Rwandan government meets its international responsibilities, as it's duty bound to do, in sufficient time for us to call any one of those witnesses and to conclude their evidence by tomorrow, then that's the one proviso on our closing the case.  But our case is effectively closed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
I hope it's not inappropriate, particularly as I know time has gone on this morning.  We are very aware that this is a trial that started in May of last year, so we've been together quite a long time, through storm and earthquake, and we'd like, on behalf of ourselves, the bar on the Defence case, and on behalf of André Rwamakuba, whose absence has, of course, always been the case but whose presence, I'm sure, has nevertheless been quite strongly felt in other ways from time to time, to thank you, the Judges, for your patience and understanding and assistance, and unfailing courtesy.  

We would like to thank also those on the opposition Benches and those who have assisted all of us; the stenographers and court management, Mr. Issa and Mr. Fry, notably, Mr. Hometowu, of course; Miss Denis, who's -- never have I had such sustained pleasure having my arm bent as I have had from Miss Denis over the many months.  

I would like to thank the interpreters here, whose dulcet tones have lent an added weight to our own weak voices; to technical support, if they're listening -- and I think they are -- for their assistance; and to the security staff who have looked after us in that respect.  

Thank you very much.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, once again, you would be glad, since, so far as gratitude is concerned, I really do associate myself with Mr. Hooper.  In a word or two, I should like to associate myself with all expressions of gratitude he has made to this Chamber, and gratitude for his patience and courtesy, and gratitude to all the parties in this case.  He has expressed gratitude in a magisterial fashion, 
and I should like to associate myself with him.  

I am being reminded of one thing.  I am being asked whether I should present him with an Oscar.  Right now, I shall; I have.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
On behalf of the Bench, I, too, would like to commend everyone for the way in which this trial has been conducted.  I think that I should commend counsel and express our appreciation for the high quality of the advocacy which has earmarked this case.  It has had both fierce hostility, a lot of law and technicalities to adjudicate on, but at the end of the day, the quality of professionalism and comradeship has always been evident, and it has made our task much easier and we have been able to perform it without any embarrassment.  

So, we would like to thank counsel on both sides for their services to their cases, to the Court, and to the administration of justice.  So, thank you very much.  
The court staff, all aspects of it, the case management teams, the court stenographers, the interpreters, the security, the technical support, I think, have been tremendous throughout the proceedings.  They have been very efficient, very effective.  From time to time we have made what might have been regarded as excessive demands.  They have always been met in a cooperative, amicable and courteous manner, and we have also had the benefit of their pro-active advice which has assisted us in the efficient management of the trial.  So we would like to express our sincere thanks and appreciation to the court management support systems here.  

Well, we are also extremely happy that we have been able to close the case within the scheduled time for doing so, and we trust that we'll be able to continue in that timely manner and have our judgement delivered in a time which would accord with the fair-trial objectives of a fair trial within a reasonable time.  So, we thank you all very much for everything, and we now formally close the hearings in this matter.
