MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg, and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 2nd of February 2006, for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, Case No. ICTR-98-44C-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

The appearances are the same.  

Mr. Registrar, are we connected to our video link?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, we are, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, we'd agreed that this session would be in closed circuit for the protection of the witness; is that correct, Mr. Hooper?  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
For the benefit of the waiting public, I must inform you that the Court sometimes makes orders for the protection of witnesses, and in this particular case, we've ordered that the -- the testimony of this witness be given in closed session.  So we have to excuse the public from sitting this morning.  We'll go into closed session now. 
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 2 to 79] was extracted and sealed under separate cover as the session was heard in camera)
