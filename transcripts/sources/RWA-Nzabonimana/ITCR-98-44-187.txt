P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

Mr. Fry, would you open the proceedings. 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Friday the 21st of October 2005 for the continuation of trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Karemera, et al, Case Number ICTR 98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  

Appearances, do I note that the appearances are the same?  Yes, the appearances are the same.

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Just for the ease of pronunciation, I will simply refer to you as Witness GFJ, if you don't mind.  

As you were informed, we have embarked upon the testimony of another witness; that testimony is not yet completed.  We resume that testimony at 10 o'clock this morning.  So we just have an one-hour window for the continuation of your cross-examination.  If it is not completed this morning, it will           be -- before 10 o'clock; it will be continued on Monday of next week.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President.  But before that, I have something to tell the Chamber. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, you may state it. 
THE WITNESS:
I'm not sure whether to speak in French or in English; either way this is a very important issue that has caused me a great deal of grief.  Should I speak in French or English so that it is as clear as can be? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, there are official translators, so if you speak it will be translated so that we can understand it.  You may proceed. 
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  When I see you in front of me, Mr. President, I consider you as a father.  You represent international criminal justice, which is reasonable.  In fact, I should have written a letter to you; but as it turns out I wrote the letter to President Erik Møse.

Early on I lodged my complaint with the registry, and believed that you were informed of that.  I believed that the registry informed the concerned persons, but those people did not want to speak with me.  When I arrived here for the first time I didn't even know that that section was part of the Tribunal, given the way they were behaving with me.  I thought that they were some kind of police body working with the United Nations.  But later on, I realised that it was, indeed, a section of this very Tribunal.  With regard to that, I wrote a letter; perhaps I shouldn't have sent it to President Møse or to the Registrar, Adam Dieng; I should have written it to you, Mr. President.  But I believe that something happened and someone asked the section to meet with me and they refused.  I have come across a great deal -- a great number of problems, Mr. President.  And I was going to address those with you at the end of my testimony, but now I have to lay them out on the table.

For example, I have a passport.  I was supposed to use that so that I could send some things home.  I'm not able to go to the bank without a passport.  Right now, I am in a hotel and there is paperwork that must be done, but in order to fill all of that out completely, I need that document.  Now, with regard to moving about town, I have had a lot of problems.  I need to identify myself when asked to do so.  In place of that document I was given this document, but I'm not sure that this is sufficient or can help me in any way.  There is only an address on this document for anyone who wants to reach the Tribunal.  

I spoke with someone about these problems; that person came to see me at the hotel, but I was intimidated because I had written a letter.  I was then asked to show the original copy of my resignation letter from the MRND.  Given all of that, I was wondering what was going on.  Perhaps only the President of the chamber was supposed to ask me questions about these matters, or, perhaps, just the registrar.  This all made me think that that section is poorly managed.  It is unacceptable the way they behave, the section headed by Kalumo.  I have had a great many problems, and perhaps I can go more into depth regarding them after my testimony because, after all, I have come here to give testimony.

The registrar -- the registry came to tell me that I had to show my letter to everyone.  I am not hiding anything; but what I do fear is that at a later stage I will be accused of having lodged a complaint against the parties and, in fact, that is not the case.  I simply want to go on with my testimony.  This is even explained in my letter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, there are one or two comments I could make on what you have said.  The parties in these proceedings had made an application for us to order that your communication with the President be disclosed.  In our opinion, it was not necessary for us to make such an order.  And we had indicated that that letter would not be disclosed without your permission because it was a private communication from you to the President.   

The registrar inquired of you this morning, on our instructions, whether you were willing to disclose it under those circumstances; so, that was the purpose why that inquiry was made.  There is nothing secret or intimidating about it.  If you do not wish to have the letter shown to the parties in the case, it will not be shown.  You have the right to say no.  That is what we wanted to ensure.

Now, secondly, with regard to the request for the original letters that you had; there was a request from parties of the Tribunal to have copies of certain of the documents you had expressed an interest in being inspected.  And we directed the registry to enquire from you whether you were willing to permit copies to be made of those documents in order to be disclosed to the parties.  Again, you had the right to say yes, or you had the right to say no.  You said no, no pressure or any compulsive efforts are going to be brought to bear on you; but it was really in response to what had seemed to be an offer on your part to make the information available to the parties in these proceedings.

Now, with regard to the passport issue which you have raised; we have had some preliminary information, but we are willing to make further enquiries into the matter.  And, in fact, as a result of what you have said just now, we will just -- we will do exactly that.  We will make further inquiry and we will come to some determination on this matter.  And we will do it as quickly as we can.  

In the circumstances, what we would like you to do is to continue your testimony.  It is now quarter past nine, there are approximately 45 minutes of it.  And before you leave, I presume the registrar will get some information from you about contacting you.  And we will ensure that we will use our best efforts to deal with this matter as quickly and as fairly as possible; but that is the most that we can do at this stage.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
It is very clear, Mr. President.  I don't want people to think that my behaviour is unacceptable.  I didn't come here to be mistreated.  If someone comes here voluntarily to assist justice, that person should not be mistreated.  I'm a human being.  I asked people to receive me and they refused.  You have even issued an order for them to contact me.  Even my visa had expired, I believe, on the 10th or the 14th.  Only recently have they tried to resolve these issues.  And I was told that on Monday my visa would be extended.  One person seemed to be -- Essombe, he seemed to be cooperative, but Kalumo said that we are simply waiting for the Chamber's decision.   But now I see that there is no decision by the Chamber, and yet I have to be able to live correctly and be safe at the hotel, and send money to my family.  You have understood me very well, Mr. President, but my situation remains difficult because of all of these problems.  

Without regard to all of those documents, I did not talk about the Defence or the Prosecution because these matters did not concern them.  I didn't talk about the Prosecution or about the Defence.  That is why I believe that the content of the document did not concern the parties.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness.  I think we should give you a few minutes just to prepare yourself to continue your testimony, but I think that the -- you will have to accept our assurance that we will investigate this matter in the best way that we can and get back to you as soon as we can on it.  And we would like for you    to -- we would like to move the proceedings forward. So what we will do -- are you ready to continue your testimony now?  
THE WITNESS:
If I had to continue my testimony it would be as if I was disobeying the President of the Tribunal, to whom I addressed the letter.  If we take a break for a few minutes, perhaps you can contact the President of the Tribunal, because I was promised an answer.  All of a sudden, I don't know what is happening because you are saying that the Chamber will deal with these matters, but I was awaiting a response from the President of the Tribunal.  The situation has changed.  Unless you have confirmed that the President has delegated that authority to this Chamber, otherwise I think I have to await the decision made by the president of the Tribunal, Mr. Møse. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, what I can tell you is that we have some information on these matters.  I'm not certain that I am at liberty to say or disclose to you all of the information that we have; but I can assure you that continuing your testimony will not be in disobedience to any direction or order that the President has given, I can assure you of that.  So, you would not be doing anything improper or inconsistent with the complaint you have made by continuing your testimony.  

If you want to have one or two moments to compose yourself, we could rise briefly for that purpose.  But as the Trial Chamber that is seized of this matter, we will make the enquiry on your complaint.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Perhaps, based on the information you have given me some enquiries must be made.  I am the person concerned here.  Perhaps, I can meet with you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not --  
THE WITNESS:
I didn't mean to meet the president in person. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
This is not the forum in which enquiries can be conducted.  And you will be informed of the method that will be utilized to deal with this issue.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Are you ready now or do you want a minute?  

Mr. Witness, are you ready to start now or would you like us to rise for a few minutes before starting?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President -- (microphone not activated)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Witness's microphone, please. 
THE WITNESS:
With all due respect to this Chamber, Mr. President, I do not wish to waste the Chamber's time, we should move on.  As I said during my testimony, I will talk about all of the complaints that I have.  I have faced all of those problems but, nevertheless, I will not say that I am going to suspend my testimony or waste the Tribunal's time.  I knew that I was going to come back to resume my testimony after resolving all of those problems, but unfortunately that wasn't the case, because the problems are persistent and it is not a healthy situation.  And so I don't want to waste the Chamber's time; just know that those problems still exists and they must be dealt with, especially the problem regarding my passport.  I have to send money home, and I have to be sure that I'm safe in the hotel where I am at; otherwise, we can proceed Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we have understood what your complaint is, I think, and as I have told you, we will be looking into it.  If you are ready to proceed now, I think we have half an hour.  

Mr. Robinson, can you use that time effectively? 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because I think we should stop at about five to 10:00?   
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, I can utilize the time right now.  But I do, Mr. President, want to make an application; it would be very brief.  And my application is that the Trial Chamber makes an order that the passport of this witness be returned to him.  And I make this statement not only out of concern for this witness, but the Defence is going to be bringing many witnesses here, who we hope, like Mr. Mbonyunkiza, will not insist on witness protection and will be able to come here and testify under their true names, which we want to encourage.  And I see no justification whatsoever for the witness victim section to take someone's passport and essentially hold them hostage here in Arusha.  They have no authority to do that.  So I think this is a situation that applies not only to this witness, but it is a precedent that we need to make sure that it doesn't happen again.  So, I am making a formal application that the Trial Chamber orders the witness victims section to return the passport to Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  And that is my application. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, we are not going to take that application at this stage.  You heard me indicate that the Chamber itself proprio motu intended to make enquiries.  I think your application is premature. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Well, thank you, Mr. President, I understand you are going to make the enquiries, but I think as a legal issue that there has to be a ruling that it is not permissible for a section of this Tribunal to take someone's passport --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you make an application, then we don't make enquires, and then the burden of proof is on you.  You can't prove this issue.  It is far more appropriate for the Chamber to investigate it itself, without it being a contentious or party initiated issue.  I don't see how you can address the matter, if you do it as a party initiated issue. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
Because --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Because the only method, in our view, of addressing the matter in a satisfactorily manner is for us to deal with it.  And we think that that is the likely -- the most effective way of getting a fair result. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
I appreciate that, Mr. President, but I would like to be assured that what happens -- what happened to this witness does not happen again, so there needs to be some kind of judicial decision so that there is -- this is a matter of record, not simply something -- I would appreciate that you can work this out for this witness.  But I don't think it is proper for any kind of precedent to be established that a passport of a person who is not protected can be confiscated.  So, I would like you to make a ruling on the matter in addition to the enquiries that you are making. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, after the enquiries we will decide what should be done.  We do not have appropriate factual basis to make any legal commentary at this stage in time.  And once we have that, then we will deal -- do what we think is required.  
THE WITNESS:
With your leave, Mr. President, I would like to add something.  I just heard that you will undertake an enquiry into the matter and, perhaps, by Monday at the latest this issue can be resolved.  I really need my passport by Monday at the latest.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
That is my position, Mr. President.  I'm sorry, but if I don't have my passport by Monday I can't come before this Chamber on Tuesday, honestly.  Mr. President, even a government cannot confiscate someone's passport. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Witness, do not make threats of this nature.  We are a judicial body.  And I have indicated that we will deal with this matter as quickly and as fairly as we can.  It is not necessary, or acceptable for you to make threats to us.  Do you understand?  
MR. WITNESS:
(No interpretation)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are doing something that is unconditional in the interest of fair play.  And you will have to accept that. 
THE WITNESS:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
WITNESS AHMED NAPOLÉON MBONYUNKIZA
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	(No interpretation), Mr. Mbonyunkiza? 
A.	Good morning, Mr. Robinson. 
Q.	Are you ready to answer my questions? 
A.	Given the circumstances, I can tell you that I am ready; you can see that; perhaps you shouldn't ask me certain questions however, and pardon me if I answer those questions like someone who is in difficulty.  You have just heard about the situation yourself.  It is most unfortunate. 
Q.	Well, I agree.  And I will do the best I can, but I'm going to have to take you back now to where we left off on the 3rd of October.  And so, you recall that you had told us that you attended three meetings in February of 1992 in which at least one of them Mathieu Ngirumpatse said that the Tutsi should be exterminated.  And that after that, you had accepted employment at the ministry of justice in          March 1992, I believe; and that you had worked there for approximately 18 days, and had taken a leave from that position.  Now, am I correct in all of that? 
A.	Yes, you are correct. 
Q.	And then the next event that I want to talk to you about involved the time that you were assaulted in early May 1992.  And you told us that you were assaulted outside of the offices of the MRND, in the building of Vedaste Rubangura, correct? 
A.	Yes, in front of that building on the roadside.  Earlier the interpreter said that it was inside that building, but I would like to correct that; it was in front of the building, on the road. 
Q.	And you told us, I believe, that you were wearing the cap of the MRND at the time that you were assaulted, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	So, even after hearing what Mr. Ngirumpatse allegedly said in February of 1992, you continued to go to the MRND office and continued to wear the MRND uniform or cap, correct? 
A.	That is right.  As I have explained, I was still taking my time to try and observe what was happening so that I could come to a decision. 
Q.	And the events of that day when you were assaulted are they still very clear in your mind? 
A.	Yes, they are, nothing has changed. 
Q.	And that was a very significant event that you still can picture in your mind; is that correct? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The interpreter in the Kinyarwanda booth did not understand the witness's answer, Mr. President.  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to know whether this question which has been put to me deals with the resignation or something else.  I'm, therefore, seeking clarification from Counsel Robinson. 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Yes, I can ask you the question again.  I'm asking you if you -- the day that you were assaulted in front of the MRND office was a significant event for you, such as you can recall it in your mind even today, 13 years later? 
A.	Yes, that is right.  One cannot forget an event that one has experienced; obviously, there are some that one forgets, but others remain engraved in one's memory. 
Q.	I take it there are not too many times in your life that you have been hit over the head, correct? 
A.	It wasn't twice, it was once.  I don't know where you are drawing that statement you have just made. 
Q.	No, actually, what I am trying to have you express is that this was a very unique event, and so you have a good memory of it; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	And so, you -- after you were hit on the head and you were bleeding, you preceded from outside of the building of the Vedaste Rubangura to go to see Mathieu Ngirumpatse, correct? 
A.	No, it is not from the Rubangura building that these attackers found me.  They did not come from inside of the building so the aggression took place on the street; and I went from the street. 
Q.	Right.  That is actually what I meant to ask you, that you went from the street, in front of the building and you were heading to see Mr. Ngirumpatse while you were bleeding, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right. 
Q.	And can you tell us why in that situation of distress you would go to the office of a man who you had heard was in favour of exterminating Tutsi? 
A.	Do you think I was Tutsi at the time, and that Tutsi would be going to parade before Mr. Ngirumpatse; is that your question?  I really don't think that that is an intelligent question.  But if we are not careful, we may be falling into your trap.  But as I said to you, Mr. Robinson, I'm going to answer you in like manner, may God forgive me, because a moment ago I was really ill at ease, if I were to answer you, given the circumstances under which I'm living now, I don't think that would please you.  Anyway, what I'm going to say is this; I was still a member of the MRND, and I was going about with its business.  And I was not going to leave my obligations aside, because that would take some time.  

But what I would like to say to you, Mr. Robinson, is this; at that time, I still had in my mind that our official was Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  He was the one to take decisions when an event such as that one were to happen to a member, like myself, who was occupying two positions, I would say.  So that was my motivation, to go to see him.  However, I had not forgotten that I still need to reflect on the general situation obtaining, so that I could see how things would develop.  So, that was the situation that I was in.

Let me leave it there.  Maybe you will have understood.  
Q.	Okay, so now Mathieu Ngirumpatse's office was no longer in the building of Rubangura in May of 1992, and so you had to walk from the -- in front of the Rubangura building to another place to find               Mr. Ngirumpatse, correct? 
A.	Yes, that is right.  You see when he became national secretary, replacing that man there,           Édouard Karemera, there was like some kind of handing over.  Mathieu needed to be in that building, and that was how it was, Counsel, that was the situation.  I'm trying to tell you the truth as it happened.  I'm trying to tell you about the reality of the time. 
Q.	So, can you tell us, then, where did you walk to find Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	Do you know Kigali town, Counsel?  Are you familiar with the city's map, because I'm going to mention names?  Do you know the area known as Cuba?  I'm going to give you such names, Counsel; I don't know whether you know the place. 
Q.	I don't know the place? 
A.	I'm going to explain it to you.  I'm talking about this place known as Cuba.  It is below that office.  It is even down below the central prison of Kigali.  I don't know whether you know the neighbourhood known as Kabakenyi (phonetic).  I want to explain this to you, Counsel, but unless you have some point of departure you can tell me maybe that you know such and such a neighbourhood, I will be more easily able to tell you my itinerary. 
Q.	Okay, well, Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I think I know some areas of Kigali, but it is important for the               Trial Chamber that we express ourselves, not only to inform me but to inform everybody.  So, tell us this, what was the building that you found Mathieu Ngirumpatse in; what was the name of that building? 
A.	You see, the MRND building was the building belonging to one Félicien Kabuga, I believe that man still owns that property.  It is a building situated in the Nyabagogo area.  You see there is a small stream known as Nyabagogo, and from there, the neighbourhood derived its name.  And the secteur is Muhima.  

Initially, before he became national secretary, Mathieu Ngirumpatse had his offices farther up, opposite the Muhima camp; so, it was in the Vedaste Rubangura building.  It was in that same building that Techno-Serve Company had its offices, such that at the time people would refer to that building as the Techno-Serve offices.  So, it was in that building where I was attacked with an iron bar.  And I left that area and I went towards Muhima.  Maybe when you hear this, you are thinking that it is far away, but the distance is not great.  I didn't go on the road; rather I used the foot paths that go along the hills.  I didn't take the main road to go to that building. 
Q.	So, as I understand your testimony, you were attacked in front of the Rubangura building, and you were bleeding.  And you walked through the foot path, down the hill to the Kabuga building, where the office of Mathieu Ngirumpatse was; and you can picture that in your mind, correct? 
A.	It is not a figment of my imagination, it is what happened.  There are technical terms that you used and which do not reflect the reality.  I'm telling you something that I experienced.  Please understand,       Mr. Robinson, I left that place and I went down further to Mathieu's building.  I was looking for assistance, and he didn't offer that to me.  

You used the term "imagination," rather; you should ask me whether it was the truth, because that is the more appropriate term, because if you are talking about figment of my imagination, maybe one could believe these are things that I am inventing.  You men of the law have your own ways of speaking, but we, the profane, we try to explain to you, the truth. 
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, I think there may have been some difference in translation from what I said or what I intended, because I was asking if you could picture this, if you had a mental picture of the event, not that were you imagining anything.  I'm not accusing you of imagining something.  

So, anyway, let me go on now.  And I ask that you be shown -- 
MR. ROBINSON:
I would ask the registrar, if the Trial Chamber could direct the registrar to show this witness,         Exhibit D. NG3A, that is Ngirumpatse Exhibit, D. NG3A, which is the statement of Mr.  Mbonyunkiza made to the ICTR on the 10th of January of 2001. 
(Pages 1 to 10 by Donna M. Lewis)


0945H 
BY MR. ROBINSON:
Q.	Mr. Mbonyunkiza, if you have that document in front of you now, you previously identified this as the statement that you signed in January of 2001.  And, I want to call your attention to page 6 of this statement, about the middle of the page, when you described the incident where you were attacked.  And for those following in English, this is on page 7, at the bottom last paragraph.  

And, I am going to ask you, Mr. Mbonyunkiza.  Isn't it true that when you described this event in 2001, to the investigators from the ICTR, you told them that you had gone -- after you were attacked; you had gone to the office of Mr. Ngirumpatse at the ministry of justice? 
A.	I would like to ask Counsel to repeat his question so I can understand it properly. 
Q.	Isn't it true that in 2001 when you described this event to the ICTR investigators, you told them that you had gone to Mr. Ngirumpatse's office after your attack -- you were attacked at the ministry of justice, and I am referring to the middle of page 6? 
A.	You did well to put that question to me, Mr. Robinson.  As I told you the last time around, in fact, there was a lady who mentioned this question and she was with you.  I would like to explain to you that those who wrote this statement made mistakes.  I was in prison and I didn't even have time to check it so that I could see the mistakes in it.  I am saying this before the Chamber and before the President.  When I was saying that it was Karemera who was financing the genocide -- please look into the events of the genocide.  There is a place where this is mentioned.  There is somewhere else where it is said that -- and it was Marshal who was financing the RTLM.  Somewhere else also it is said that I resigned from the chairmanship of the MRND in Kigali town, whereas I was a member of the JMRND.  Last time I explained to you the reality of the situation.  I don't know whether you understood me right, the last time.  So, I recall having said that even this sentence, the content of this sentence is not correct.  I was in prison at the time and I could not bring out all the mistakes.  I think your learned sister asked me one of the questions like this, and I told her that I was in prison.  And, if I had had the time to check everything, I would have noticed that mistake.  

	Furthermore, this is one of the mistakes which I was unable to notice.  In fact, there are other mistakes which I corrected when I arrived here, when I met the Prosecutor.  When I met the Prosecutor, I read together with him the statement.  I made certain corrections, and I do realise that this mistake escaped me.  I should have corrected it as well.  That is the answer that I can give you, Mr. Robinson.  Otherwise, I do admit that there are certain things, some facts or some information which is in the statement but which are not -- is not correct.  It is normal that if you leave the town you go to Kacyiru and Kacyiru is very far.  So, if you are bleeding, in that case, you will already be anaemic; you will have no more blood.  You will understand yourself that that is not right.  These are people who are writing things in a manner which is not appropriate. 
Q.	And the office of the ministry of justice was a long way away from the Rubangura building, correct? 
A.	Yes.  Yes, Mr. Robinson. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. President, at this time I would like the witness to be shown another document.  Or perhaps you would like to take a break now. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It's now (inaudible) ... I think that it might be appropriate. 

Mr. Witness, we have to take the break now.  We are going to resume on Monday morning.
(Microphone not activated)
MR. FRY:
That's correct, Your Honour, for the UN day. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
On Monday, our starting time 9:45, at a quarter to 10:00.  Before you leave the premises, however, the registrar will speak with you to get contact information ... (microphone not activated).  So, he will be asking you for contact information for that purpose. 

We would just rise for a few minutes and resume at the time to start the next witness. 
(Court recessed from 0955H to 1030H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning everybody. 
MR. FRY:  
I would like to inform The Hague that we are starting this time.  Are you there?  
MR. JUMA:
We are ready in The Hague. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.

Mr. Weyl, I would like to apologise for the late start this morning.  We spent some time trying to manage an issue which had arisen with regard to Witness GFJ and that accounted for our late start.  So we apologise for that. 
MR. WEYL:
I appreciate that a great deal, Mr. President.  I, of course, am willing to do what I can, but I must say that it would be difficult for me to finish my cross-examination with the time remaining for us this morning.  I should like to begin, Mr. President. 


WITNESS G,
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	My name is Frédéric Weyl.  I am counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse and as co-counsel, because with you there, in The Hague, you have Ms. Chantal Hounkpatin, who is lead counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse.  However, I am going to lead the cross-examination in the interest of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I am a member of the Paris Bar and I am a French speaker. 

I should like to ask you before we begin to be very attentive and wait until you receive my question and observe a pause before you speak, so that those who speak English here can hear the end of my question before they hear the beginning of your answer.  So, I will attempt to observe a pause after your answers and I also would ask the interpreters to remind me if we go after -- and I do not observe those pauses. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, I hope you had an opportunity to rest and I would try to work with you and I know that you were available for Mr. Robinson.  I hope that you are just as available for me and cooperative with me as you were with Mr. Robinson.  Thank you. 

I am counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse, and I should like to ask you a few questions to begin with regard to your acquaintance with Mr. Ngirumpatse.  Witness, can you remind us how long have you known Mr. Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I have known him since 1991. 
Q.	Is it possible for you to be more specific, when exactly did you know him in 1991? 
A.	I would say it was around the time when the Interahamwe were created, therefore, in November 1991. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, under which circumstances you met him for the first time? 
A.	I met him for the first time towards the end of 1991.
Q.	I don't believe that we have a translation problem between us.  I am no longer asking about the date, but I am asking about the circumstances now. 
A.	Very well.  I met him during a weekly Wednesday meeting convened by the organisation I belonged to. 
Q.	Where was the meeting at, Witness? 
A.	It was at the MRND offices in Kigali, near the ministry of planning. 
Q.	Can you be more specific in regards to your description of those offices? 
A.	Yes, those offices were located in a building which belonged to Vedas Rubangura. 
Q.	You had never met Mr. Ngirumpatse prior to that; is that correct?  I am talking about when the organisation was set up in 1991. 
A.	I can tell you that well before that I knew who he was.  I was still young.  I believe that he was a prosecutor in Butare.  I knew him.  He used to take vacation in Kigali when he was an ambassador.  I met him at that time in Musha as he was coming through in Kibungo préfecture, I believe.  I met him on several occasions at his restaurant. 
Q.	We will get to that.  You know Mr. Ngirumpatse.  You knew him before the meeting which took place in the month of November, the meetings you described as weekly Wednesday meetings at the MRND offices; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you also confirm for us, Witness, that Mr. Ngirumpatse was a public figure? 
A.	Yes, he was. 
Q.	That he was well known, well known in Rwanda? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	This is something that would be interesting for me.  Do you know if he ever wrote a grammar book? 
A.	I have no idea. 
Q.	You never during your studies worked with a grammar book that was written by Mr. Ngirumpatse, by chance? 
A.	I don't think so. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness. 

	During your examination-in-chief, you told the Prosecution that you met Mr. Ngirumpatse 15 or so times.  Can you confirm that for me, Witness? 
A.	Yes, I can confirm that. 
Q.	Did you ever go to his home? 
A.	I knew that he lived in Kicukiro, but I would never go to his house. 
Q.	Can you tell us, Witness, how many times you were with him during rallies or public meetings? 
A.	I went to a meeting that he chaired, but I never was able to approach him during public rallies. 
Q.	Can you tell us how many times you met with him during the MRND meetings? 
A.	What do you exactly mean by meetings, MRND meetings?
Q.	Perhaps in your answers you can be more specific when you describe the meetings.  Tell us how many times you met him during the public meetings, or how many times you met him during meetings specifically reserved for MRND bodies.  So how many times did you meet Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse during MRND meetings? 
A.	I could tell you that I met him 15 times maximum. 
Q.	I am talking about MRND specific meetings? 
A.	To be more specific, I am not referring to Interahamwe meetings.  I wouldn't say that I met him in any MRND specific meetings. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let us look at some of the characteristics of Mr. Ngirumpatse together.  You said that he was a public figure well known in Rwanda; you will confirm that, won't you, Witness? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In response to questions put to you by Mr. Robinson, you said that Mr. Ngirumpatse was kind and that he was an intelligent man, and as his counsel for five years, I can confirm that for you.  I want to talk about some more characteristics.  Did you know that he is a musician? 
A.	Yes, I know that. 
Q.	Do you know that he has composed several pieces? 
A.	Yes, I know that. 
Q.	Do you know and can you understand me that he composed some music for weddings of some of his friends?  
A.	That is correct.
Q.	Can you confirm for me or do you know, Witness that he formed, chaired and led a choir? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	Can you confirm that that choir included Rwandans of all ethnic groups without discrimination, both Tutsis and Hutus? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Given that information, can you acknowledge with me that Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse is, indeed, a sensitive man? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Did you know that Mathieu Ngirumpatse chaired and supported a soccer club in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, for many, many years? 
A.	I didn't know that, pardon me. 
Q.	Very well.  I am happy to provide you with some new information.  Let's talk about some more of his characteristics.  Did you know that he was a lawyer? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you know that he provided counsel for all Rwandans?  He defended Rwandans, both Hutus, Twas, Tutsis, in his capacity as a lawyer? 
A.	Yes, I knew that. 
Q.	And he did so without any ethnic discrimination, can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	You, yourself, told me that he was a prosecutor.  You know that and you confirmed that.  Can you tell me if he was well regarded in his job as a prosecutor? 
A.	Well, I was young at the time, but people spoke well of him.  
Q.	Because he exercised his duties without bias.
A.	I believe so.  He was well regarded. 
Q.	Did you also know that he was minister of justice? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you remind us when or would you like me to refresh your memory with regard to that point? 
A.	I believe that he was minister of justice in early 1992 in the Nzeyimana government. 
Q.	That is correct, Witness.  To be more specific, it was from the 31st of December 1991 until the 18th of April 1992.  Do you remember during that period that Rwanda went through a difficult period when there were massacres in Bugesera? 
A.	Yes, that occurred in 1992.
Q.	Do you remember in which month of 1992, Witness?  
A.	I believe it was in February. 
Q.	No, in fact, it was in March 1992, Witness.  Did you know, Witness, that after the massacres in Bugesera more than 400 people were arrested?  

Did you hear me, Witness, or do you want me to repeat my question? 
A.	No, I said there were many arrests at that time. 
Q.	Did you know that the persons arrested were detained in April, at the time when Mr. Ngirumpatse left the ministry of justice? 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I am not sure if the link is still functional. 
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, the connection with The Hague has been interrupted.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will just wait a minute.
MR. WEYL:
Even the technical aspects are against us, Mr. President.  I am coming up against all possible difficulties. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Don't take it personal, Mr. Weyl, we all feel the same. 
(Pages 11 to 16 by Sithembiso Moyo)











1945H  
MR. WEYL:
     Mr. President, I am not sure if the link is still functional.
MR. FRY: 
Your Honour, the connection at The Hague has been interrupted.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
We can jus wait for a few minutes and see what happens. 
MR. WEYL: 
Even the technical aspects are against us, Mr. President.  I am coming up against all possible difficulties. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Don't take it personally, Mr. Weyl, we all feel the same way.  We are back? 
MR. WEYL:   
It appears we have the link back, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, so I promised.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness, let me repeat my question for you.  Can you confirm for me that in the month of April there were many detainees in Rwandan prisons at the time when Mr. Ngirumpatse left the ministry of justice? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	After he left the ministry, they were released. Is that correct? 
A.	I know some people who were released.  Many of those who were detained in Bugesera, but I don't know exactly when, I can't confirm that for you. 
Q.	Do you know that Mr. Ngirumpatse was a prosecutor in Kigali at the time those people were released? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	In fact, can I refresh your memory and tell you that it was François Nsanzuwera, and I spell that for you, N-S-A-N-Z-U-W-E-R-A, he was the prosecutor in Kigali at that time? 
A.	Yes, I think that is correct. 
Q.	Do you know who was minister of justice at the time when those people were released, and hence the person who was successor to Mr. Ngirumpatse at the ministry of justice at that time? 
A.	I don't recall, Counsel. 
Q.	Can I refresh your memory and tell you that it was Stanislaus Bonimpeka. I don't believe we need to spell that name. 
A.	Yes, you are correct.
Q.	Do you know which party Stanislaus Bonimpeka belonged to? 
A.	Yes, I do.  
Q.	Can you tell us which party it was? 
A.	He was member of the PL party.  
Q.	Let us make a conclusion with regard to Mr. Ngirumpatse's departure from the ministry of justice.  Would you agree to or admit with me that Mr. Ngirumpatse is a fair and unbiased man with a sense of equity? 
A.	That is how I knew him as well.
Q.	Can we say that he was a just man? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Did you know that Mr. Ngirumpatse managed a state owned enterprises? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you happen to recall which enterprises he worked for or would you like me to refresh your memory, Witness?  
A.	I know that he managed the Sonarwa, the national insurance company.  He was the director general. 
Q.	Do you know if he had any other functions in any other state enterprises? 
A.	I am not aware of that. 
Q.	Let me try to assist you.  Do you know that he was chief of the board of directors of Sonarwa? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you know why he was appointed as chairman of the board? 
A.	I can tell you that that is what went on in government circles, the high echelons. 
Q.	At the time there was a conflict between a Rwandan chairman and a European chairman and 
	Mr. Ngirumpatse was appointed to mediate.  Does this refresh your memory? 
A.	Honestly no. 
Q.	Given what you know about Mr. Ngirumpatse, would that surprise you or would it seen natural to you that he would be designated? 
A.	It doesn't surprise me. 
Q.	Did you know that he was also the administrator of the Rwandan development Bank? 
A.	You know those administrative functions were based on nominations that weren't made public, those were internal matters, and it is very possible that he was the administrator of the Rwandan development Bank.
Q.	According to you, it's also possible that he was director of the general warehouses of Rwanda? 
A.	That is possible, sometimes when you are director- general of company such as Sonarwa.  Sonarwa had interests in many other companies, in many other businesses where the government also held interests.  So a director or a representative of the director of the company would be appointed administrator.
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  In the framework of those responsibilities, especially at Sonarwa, do you belive that he sought to develop the company and wanted its staff to be as sufficient as possible, all those things he took to heart? 
A.	I would say yes. ********************************************************************************************** *****************************************************They spoke well of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  So, Mathieu was respected by his staff, appreciated by his staff, yes that is correct. 
Q.	He was also respected by his commercial partners; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	He was fair in his business transactions; was he not?  
A.	I do I believe, so, yes. 
Q.	Did you learn that at any time he was discriminated in the exercise of his responsibilities? 
A.	No.  
Q.	At any point in time whatsoever, as far as you know, did anyone express any doubt about the honesty of Mathieu Ngirumpatse? 
A.	I didn't have any opportunity to hear any of that. 
Q.	Amongst his political adversaries or opponents, was there no one who suggested at any point in time that he was a corrupt man?  
A.	I never heard Mathieu being attacked by other political opponents regarding his honesty in terms of management. 
Q.	So I think that at the end of this consideration of Mathieu Ngirumpatse as a man, we could agree that he was someone who had the reputation of probity, integrity and honesty? 
A.	Yes, I can say that. 
Q.	Thank you.  You, yourself, told me that Mathieu had been an ambassador of his country.  Can you confirm that for me? 
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	Can you to be more specific about the embassy posts or positions he occupied, the countries in which he represented his own? 
A.	I think he was the ambassador of Rwanda to Japan, and I believe, he ended up as being an ambassador in Germany, in Bonn.
Q.	Can I refresh your memory by saying that Mathieu was an ambassador for Rwanda, initially in Ethiopia in the Sudan? 
A.	Yes, with the AOU, with the ADB and then later on in Switzerland, Austria, Germany. 
Q.	Does this tally with what your memory tells you? 
A.	Yes, that's true because the Ambassador in Ethiopia covered many countries and as ambassador to Germany, he would also have covered many countries and the same applies to Japan. 
Q.	At any point whatsoever, did anyone say about Mathieu Ngirumpatse that he did not defend the interests of the country in his activities as ambassador? 
A.	I think one would have to-- he would have to be recalled, but in so far as I know, he was the one who resigned. 
Q.	So, there was never any criticism about him in the manner in which he was representing Rwanda in the international arena as far as you know? 
A.	As far as I know, no. 
Q.	I would like to make a proposal to you, putting to you a theory. In the exercise of his responsibilities in public office, in his position as a government minister and in his diplomatic functions, would you agree that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was devoted to the public interests and the interests of the nation? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  In 1992, the MRND congress which took place in April elected him to the post of national secretary.  Can you confirm that for me please? 
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	A while later in July 1993, he was to be elected chairman of the MRND.  Can you confirm that for me, again?  
A.	Yes I can. 
Q.	Do you remember the statutes of the MRND and the objectives of the party, MRND?
A.	Yes, a little. 
Q.	Do you recall that the statutes of the MRND prescribed any kind of discrimination? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you confirm that Mathieu Ngirumpatse never left the MRND to join a Hutu party? 
A.	He remained in the MRND.
Q.	He didn't leave the MRND for a party whose objective was to promote a society based on ethnic division? 
A.	I told you that he remained in the MRND. 
Q.	He never asked that the statutes of the MRND be amended so that they would preach ethnic division? 
A.	No.  
Q.	In April 1992, he was elected national secretary, and as a member of the MRND leadership including personalities who were Tutsi, can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, he became leader of that party during this period of time, characterised by the establishment of the 
multi-party era? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	This was at the time of transition within the negotiations, and then followed by the implementation of the Arusha Accords? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	At a time when the country run, that is in the middle of the war led by the RPF?
A.	Yes.
Q.	In his responsibilities as national secretary and chairman of the MRND, did you get the feeling that he was fanatical? 
A.	I wouldn't say he was fanatical, no. 
Q.	Was he secretarian? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was he a man who was prone to join factions? 
A.	No 
Q.	Not everybody agreed with him, but he stuck to his guns, so as to speech, nonetheless?
A.	That is true
Q.	He was a man who encouraged dialogue? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	He was like a mediator? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Conciliator?
A.	Yes.
Q.	He bought together people? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And it is for this reason that he was appointed to the leadership of the MRND; was he not? 
A.	He had everything on his side to be elected leader of the MRND. 
Q.	He could contribute to the meetings of the activists of the MRND on its objectives and the statutory objectives of the party; couldn't he? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I now want to go to another characteristic of his personality in the more private sphere of his life. Did you know that the members of his own staff could be without any discrimination, be Tutsi and Hutu? 
A.	What I saw -- given what I saw in his company, I would, yes, yes.  
Q.	Did you know that the drivers employed by Mathieu were Tutsi? 
A.	I no longer remember his only driver.  
Q.	But if I were to tell you that, you wouldn't be surprised; would you? 
A.	No, no, not at all. 
Q.	If I were to put it to you that he had Hutu and Tutsi friends that would not surprise you either? 
A.	No.  
Q.	You yourself had Tutsi friends just like him? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So all of this would seem to you quite natural? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that Mathieu was a generous man?  He was a good man? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  Do you know that during this tragic period of the history of your country, he saved the lives of many Rwandans? 
A.	That is possible. 
Q.	Do you know that he saved the lives of Rwandans who were of Tutsi origin? 
A.	You know, I wasn't with him during the period of the war.  I know that he was very busy with the president. 
Q.	Let me refresh your memory especially for one person.  Others will come to testify, others may well remember the details better than you do.  But I would like to remind you now of one person whom he helped escape tragic circumstances.  You, yourself said that No. 1 was Tutsi?  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that. 
Q.	The family of No. 1 was completely decimated? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You stated that No. 1 came to Butare in order to obtain treatment and also for his own security and safety.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I do confirm that. 
Q.	He felt threatened? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Do you remember any rumours circulating concerning No.1 during that period of time in history? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us what those rumours were? 
A.	In Kigali, whilst he was in Kigali during the month of April 1994, at a point in time, there was the group led by No. 6 which had wanted to eliminate him, and he was taken as a person who was saving Tutsis.  He would hide them and try to take them to the Hotel De Mille Collines.
Q.	So, he was considered as someone who was working with the RPF?  
A.	So if he had chosen to remain in Kigali, those people would have killed him because they took him to be someone who was working for PRF. 
Q.	So you can confirm that No 1 was Tutsi and that there were rumours according to which he was defending Tutsis and providing them with assistance? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that was one of the reasons why he was evacuated to Butare? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	When you suggest that Mathieu did everything to help in the evacuation for his health reasons, would you agree with me that this was an act of solidarity, an act which was humanitarian?  
A.	Before I answer you that question, I would like to say that No. 1 was very, very close to 
	Mr. Mathieu Ngirumpatse.  What he did by taking him to a place where he would receive medical treatment was something good. 
Q.	Would you agree with me that Mathieu Ngirumpatse was a man full of humanitarism? 
A.	I would say, yes.
Q.	I now want to recapitulate.  You stated that Mathieu was kind.  He was intelligent.  He was very sensitive; he was generous with solidarity.  He was an upright man.  He was fair.  He had no bias in him.  He was just. He is energumen.  He was honest, and he was devoted to the -- the public interest and the national interest.  He was for dialogue.  He was a moderator and he was conciliatory.  He brought people together and he didn't have any delusions.  He was good.  He was solid, firm, and full of humanitarianism.  Can you understand how it came about that I chose to be his lawyer? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	For you, these qualifiers, are they synonymous? 
MR. MORLEY: 
I found myself at my feet. This is the second time that my learned friend has offered effectively a personal opinion about his defendant, and Your Honour and Your Honour's colleagues will know that that is just not all.  He is perfectly entitled to list from the witness a glowing testimony with any number marvelous attitudes, but to then say that that is why I became his counsel is improper, and I am sure my learned friend Mr. Weyl knows that this is the second time we have heard it this morning. 
MR. WEYL: 
I think if I have been disciplined.  The President would have called me to order as normal and since he has not expressed any opinion thus far, I affirmed an assertion, and I was simply asking the witness and I will ask him if he could understand that situation.  Other than that-- 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I act on the premise that counsel appearing in this Court knows the law and knows the Rules, and I expect the counsel appearing in this court to self monitor.  I don't think I need to comment every time there is in faction, and I think that if a hand is given, it should be enough as to save a word to the wise, it should be enough. 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I would like to ask the witness whether he can tell me if these various qualifiers I have just listed are for him synonymous with hatred, divisionism incitement to discrimination, extermination, cruelty or inhuman and barbarous treatment. 
THE WITNESS:
I can confirm that. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	I don't think the witness understood my question.  He is confirming that the qualities of generosity and so on are not synonymous with divisions.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Thank you.  You stated that you knew Mathieu very well.  I now want to look at what you know of the MRND, and the other parties, before 1991, the MRND was a single party; wasn't it? 
A.	Yes. It wasn't quite the same MRND, the abbreviations were different, the full name was different, but it was a single party.
Q.	A party to which it was necessary to join or was it   something that was automatic as far as you know? 
A.	Membership was automatic.
Q.	Did this change with the introduction of the multi-partysm?
A.	Yes.
Q.	Was it necessary to join the MRND? 
A.	If you so wished, if you did not want to, you could join another party.
Q.	But if you wanted to remain in the MRND, you had to join the MRND? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You indicated that at the time of multipartysm, you decided to remain; you chose to remain in the MRND.  Does it mean that you took up membership of that party then? 
A.	Let me tell you that at the time of multi-partysm, the MRND changed, and there were other membership cards issued.  I never enrolled in the new MRND party. I simply continued as a member.  I never registered anew. 
Q.	So are you saying you're not a member of the MRND? 
A.	I could say so. 
Q.	So you could be an Interahamwe without being a member of the MRND? 
A.	That was the condition for being a member of an organisation, but there was no mentoring. 
Q.	Are you telling me that one could have intense activities within the Interahamwe without being a member of the MRND? 
A.	That is what happened to me because I was a member of that organization without having the membership card of the new MRND party. 
Q.	I will be satisfied with that answer, but when you say that you chose to remain with the MRND without formally renewing your membership; what was your reason for doing that? 
A.	I remained within the MRND because the objective of the MRND, I accepted the objectives of the MRND, unity, peace and development. 
Q.	So you were accepting Article 5 of the statutes which said  in particular that the objective of the party was the promotion of the values of the Rwandan society in order to consolidate unity, peace and national unity, and to banish from the minds of all Rwandans the surviving aspects of feudalism that the party was also for union excluding all forms of discrimination, the intensification of members of the efforts of the movement in order to realise or accomplish the development of the whole Rwanda nation in peace unity, togetherness and democracy in conformity with the manifesto of the party.  Can you confirm that for me? 
A.	Yes, I can. 
Q.	It is on those objectives, and those principles on the basis of those principles and objectives that you chose to remain in the MRND and the MRND was the party which brought about people together during the establishment of the new MRND?
A.	The MRND remained a party which brought together all the ethnic groups and all the regions of the country.  
Q.	The choice that you made was made in full awareness and determination on your part? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So you had compared it with other parties; had you? 
A.	Yes, in the final analysis I made comparisons and I decided that that was the party I needed to remain in.
Q.	Did you attend any rallies of other parties? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	Can you tell us which and at what period of time? 
A.	During the establishment of the other parties, I attended the first rallies of the meeting, the initial rallies which took place at the Nyamirambo stadium. 
Q.	Can you please tell us exactly which parties? 
A.	I attended the rallies of the MRND, PSD, PL, MDR and PSD. 
Q.	I think this is more or less in line with what I had in my own notes because you did state that you attended demonstrations or rallies of the Liberal Party, of the PSD, and meetings of the CDR? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	I am reading this in the transcripts in the Nahimana et al, 20th February 2002, page 120 of the French version, line 12 where it is stated that you attended meetings of the CDR and that you also attended a meeting of the PL.  So we do agree with one another, you and I.    Now, for you to have participated--
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Well, it's 11:30, so when it can be convenient to stop you can-- 
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, you took the words right out of my mouth  because I was having this one last question, and I am going to suggest that -- suggest to you what is normally done by my colleague, Robinson, and to suggest was it the last -- it was the time for the break.  But anyway, this is my last question. 
BY MR. WEYL: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you attend these meetings as an Interahamwe, a member of the Interahamwe? 
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honour, I am on my feet very briefly because this may go back to some of the things we discussed several weeks ago.  Will bring us direct questions about something.
MR. WEYL:  
I didn't quite understand the objection.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley.  I think it's too general.  He said as an Interahamwe.  
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it maybe that the cat is out of the bag anyway, the way how the questions - - and the answers have gone in the past days, but insofar as we try to dip the cat in the bag, that's a fairly tricky question.  That is not something that has already been established on the record and hasn't been said before. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, we think this question is okay.  It is at the organizational level that we will draw the line.   The particular question is permitted, Mr. Weyl.  The question is permitted. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
You know where the line should be drawn.  There is a line. 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, of course, Mr. President.  I am situating it, oh, saying this is between 10, the tens of hundreds and thousands.  So let me put the question again. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	In what capacity did you attend these rallies of the other parties?  Were you attending then as a member of the Interahamwe? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You were not wearing an Interahamwe uniform during these meetings; were you? 
A.	No.  I would have been lynched.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER: 
I am sorry they are speaking at the same time.  
THE WITNESS:
If I were to be wearing Interahamwe uniforms, I would be lynched. 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Let me take your answer and be satisfied with that.  Maybe in order to seize the bait offered by the Presiding Judge, we could come to the break because I have dealt with this particular aspect in my cross-examination.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you very much, Mr. Weyl.  We will now take a short break.

1215H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I am afraid I apologise to you again, and it's exactly the same reason.  It's continuation of the management of the problem that occurred this morning. 
MR. WEYL: 
Believe me, Mr. President, when I say that I apologise for having to always -- we apologise too, but at any rate, I am ready to proceed and I am available to the Chamber.  However, Mr. President, may I be permitted to ask you what time we will be finishing this afternoon?  From my information it was 1:30. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One thirty.  Go ahead, Mr. Weyl.
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Again, it's a matter which we are not going to adjust because certain members of our panel have other commitments which have to be on the resolve.  So we have to stop at 1:30.  
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you.  Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, are you with us? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	I would like us now to look at an issue that we have already examined that of the creation of the Interahamwe group.  According to you, Witness, did the central committee of the MRND have the idea to create a youth wing for the MRND party? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You were not a member of the central committee, were you, nor were you on the board of the MRND? 
A.	No, I was not. 
Q.	According to you, when was the decision taken? 
A.	I couldn't tell you.  As you said, I was not a member of the central committee. 
Q.	Do you know under which circumstances the decision was made? 
A.	I do not. 
Q.	So, in fact, you didn't go to any meetings during which the central committee of the MRND made that decision? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were you aware of a resolution by that central committee which called for a creation of a youth wing? 
A.	No? 
Q.	Are you aware of any written decision from the MRND leadership? 
A.	No. 
Q.	There were no MRND publications mentioning the creation of a youth wing for the MRND? 
A.	I was not aware of that and I didn't read any of those. 
Q.	Were there any press conferences announcing the creation of the youth wing for the MRND? 
A.	Not to my knowledge. 
Q.	Were there any press releases announcing a decision by the MRND to create a youth wing? 
A.	Not to my knowledge. 
Q.	However, Witness, all of the other parties or many of them, at least, had already created their youth wing? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	And they had their own statutes? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, it would have been completely normal for the MRND party to do the same? 
A.	I think so. 
Q.	But there was no publicity from the MRND, from their central committee to that effect, was there? 
A.	Not to my knowledge, no. 
Q.	So, why can't you say that the youth wing of the MRND was created following a decision taken by the MRND, and it's central committee? 
A.	When Desiré Murenzi invited the people to that meeting, he told us that he was sent by the MRND to look into how the MRND could create a youth wing.  I believe that Murenzi at that time was chairman of the youth committee within the MRND. 
Q.	But that could have been Desiré Murenzi's decision, couldn't it?  
A.	If it was Desiré Murenzi's decision, at any rate, he told us it was the MRND, and we had a meeting at the MRND headquarters.  That's what he told us on that day.  He talked about the MRND, not his own initiatives.  He was with other people as well.  He was with people from the MRND central committee. 
Q.	Were any of the accused present at the time Desiré Murenzi said that there should be a youth wing created? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were you at that first meeting? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us who else was there, Witness? 
A.	Should I say the names out aloud?  
Q.	Let me be clear.  We are in open session.  If I am asking you for names, you should probably refer to Exhibit P. 9.  
A.	Well, No. 1, was there; so, were Nos. 2; and 3; 4 and 5, 10 and 11. 
Q.	How many people were there in all, at the meeting? 
A.	I would say 30 or so. 
Q.	Besides the people you mentioned, were there any other officials there that you may recall? 
A.	Yes, there were two other people who came with Desiré Murenzi to that meeting. 
Q.	Can you give us their names, please? 
A.	Yes.  Silas Bizimana and Thomas Kikufi.  Both of them were members of the préfectural committee in Gitarama, I believe.  
Q.	We are far short of the number.  You mentioned 30 or so.  Do you have any other names that you might recall? 
A.	No.  There were members of the recreational team, Kigali.  They were brought by No. 1.  They were 20 or so of them. 
Q.	Are you referring to the football team you mentioned? 
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	Was the name Interahamwe proposed at that first meeting? 
A.	No, no. 
Q.	Can you tell us when that name was put forth, at what other meeting? 
A.	I would say after two or three meetings, they put that name forward. 
Q.	Can you tell us who proposed the name? 
A.	**** had an assembly at that time and they put forth three or four names.  ****all agreed on the name of the organisation.  I don't remember who exactly was the person who proposed the name. 
Q.	Witness, can I ask you not to use ***********************when you answer the questions.  No longer say "****" when you answer the questions? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  I order a redaction. 
MR. WEYL: 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
THE WITNESS:
But you were asking questions about***********************************************.  And how am I going to answer you, otherwise?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Going by the Rules that we have been following all along.  We all have to follow those Rules even if sometimes we might have practical issues with that.  I ask you to abide by those rules just like anyone else. 
A.	You are in charge of this examination.  I am simply following you, Counsel. 
Q.	Let me move on.  During the first meeting were the different positions and responsibilities assigned? 
A.	To my knowledge the positions for Nos. 1 to 5 were assigned on that day in the first meeting -- towards the end of the meeting, in fact.
(Pages 27 to 29 by Judith Kapatamoyo)



1230H 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Do you know who proposed the different persons for the various positions?  
A.	Yes.  It was the group led by Mr. Murenzi.  
Q.	Do you know what prerequisites were required to fill those different positions?  
A.	I don't know.  
Q.	You, for example, don't know who appointed number 1 for the position of number 1?  
A.	Let me talk about number 1.  He brought a team with him which had about 20 members.  He was someone who was always with the young people.  Everybody liked him.  I think for that reason he was appointed to the post of number 1.  

Now, number 5 had various responsibilities.  On the basis of those activities he was a good fit for the post of number 5.  
Q.	Did the participants in the first meeting know about those responsibilities?  
A.	Yes.  For number 5 they did.  
Q.	Did the participants in the first meeting know one another prior to the first meeting?  
A.	You know, people who were in the sports team all came from the same town.  Kigali, in fact, is a small city.  Everyone knew everyone.  
Q.	So number -- numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 knew one another prior to the meeting?  
A.	I can tell you that number 1, number 4, and number 5 knew each other.  Number 2, number 3 -- numbers 2 and 3 were newer.  I don't know if they knew the others.  But numbers 2 and 5 knew each other very well.  Yes, they knew each other.  
Q.	Overall, they were employed, weren't they?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	They weren't former police officers or gendarmes or soldiers, were they?  
A.	Only one of them.  
Q.	Which one?  
A.	Number 2.  
Q.	He was a police officer?  He had been a gendarme?  He had been a soldier?  
A.	He had been, yes.  He had been a gendarme in the past.  
Q.	But he no longer was a gendarme?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	Nor were they sports -- practitioners of sports? 
A.	No.  
Q.	But they were intellectuals?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	They were leaders of companies, senior officials?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	They all had professions and salaries; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	They were capable of thinking?  
A.	Yes, of course.  
Q.	They could also have political ideas, couldn't they? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were they capable of coming up with political initiatives?  
A.	I don't believe so.  
Q.	Could we say the same for numbers 6 through 11?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Were numbers 6 through 11 present at the first meeting?  
A.	Only 10 and 11 were at the first meeting.  
Q.	Did the others come to the second meeting?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	According to you, Witness, what was the personal motivation of the participants in creating the movement?  
A.	I don't know.  I can't speak on behalf of everyone.  I know that some were there to benefit in some way.  Others were there simply to create a youth wing for the party.  
Q.	You think that some of them had personal interests, and that's why they were there, that this could help their own matters, their own business?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Many of them, in your opinion, or just a few?  
A.	To my knowledge, a minority of them.  
Q.	And so most of them had political interests, and that's why they were there?  
A.	I believe so, but I can't confirm that.  
Q.	Do you believe that most of them wanted to support the activities of the MRND?  
A.	I can't speak for the others.  I can say that many of those people had personal interests.  
Q.	So you -- you believe, even as you give me these answers, that the leadership of the MRND proposed or suggested the creation of a youth wing and committed the destiny thereof to people who had only their personal interests to pursue?  
A.	I do not know what the intentions of the people of the MRND were, but when I look at all these people and how they evolved within the organisation, most of them were there for their personal interests.  
Q.	But according to you, that was not the attitude of the participants at that first meeting -- or at least they didn't show any attitude of defending their personal interests at that first meeting; is that correct?  
A.	I can say that out of the 11, three came because of promises that had been made to them.  
Q.	Following the first meeting or at the end of that first meeting, who is it that asked those who were in attendance to talk about the creation of this organisation to their -- to people in their circles and to bring others into the organisation?  
A.	It is Murenzi who called on the participants at the first meeting to try to invite their friends to the next meeting.  
Q.	Was it an invitation, or was it something more specific?  
A.	No.  It was just asking them to invite people and to let them understand that something was being created, namely, the youth wing of a party, and, therefore, ask them to come and attend and listen if they choose to.  
Q.	It would seem, however, that I saw somewhere -- and I may be mistaken, my notes might be incomplete.  It would seem to me that I saw that each of the participants had been summoned to bring a friend to the next meeting.  Do you confirm that?  
A.	One was not obliged to do so.  We were -- one was expected to talk about it to friends, and if the friends chose to come, fair and good.  If not, fair and good.  There was no obligation.  
MR. WEYL:
I'm sorry.  It looks like the English translation is not over.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
It is over now, Counsel.  Thank you.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Is it under those -- or is it in that manner that number 9 was invited to the second meeting?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Was he invited on the grounds that an MRND youth wing was being created?  
A.	Well, he was told that an organisation was being set up and that the said organisation would be the youth wing of the MRND.  He did understand that and attend it.  He came.  
Q.	Did he come because it was his desire to be part of the creation of the MRND youth wing?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Was he told the purpose of the MRND youth wing?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you know the information given to him that would have described what the youth wing of the MRND would be?  
A.	The group which had come with Murenzi had provided the reasons for the setting up of that organisation.  
Q.	So would it be that when someone was being invited to attend for the first time that person was told what those objectives and purposes were?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Could you summarise the various arguments that were put forth to convince someone to become part of the youth wing of the MRND?  
A.	At that time, with the advent of multiparty politics, the youth wing of the MDR party -- of the MDR party was attacking the youths of the MRND party, shaking them up, and telling them to leave or to quit the MRND and join the MDR.  So the MRND members or supporters were threatened on several occasions by members of the other parties.  So out of fear, people began to quit the MRND, to be forcibly joined to other parties, and that is why Murenzi told us that the time had come for our members to be reassured and told that our party was still in place and that our party was still strong.  He told us that many persons of the MRND leadership -- that some members within the leadership of the MRND were taking the MRND victory for granted or as a given, and, therefore, did not do anything further to allay the apprehensions and restore confidence within their membership.  So he said we needed to restore confidence within the membership, and that is what we were told at that first meeting.  
Q.	Do you think that it was more appropriate for intellectuals or academics to be invited to the meetings?  
A.	Well, I believe that that would have been the best way that is, using intellectuals to reach out to other intellectuals and to convince them accordingly.  
Q.	Do you think that intellectuals and -- well, you said that those concerned were mainly intellectuals and that there was one gendarme.  
A.	Well, Counsel, you see, it is not because of one's title that one is an intellectual or not.  
Q.	But do you think that -- do you think that for the security of a movement to be ensured it is necessary to refer to intellectuals, particularly when you want to check attacks from outside the organisation? 
A.	Well, you see, in Kigali those who were involved were state functionaries or civil servants of the state.  They were intellectuals who were well known to this group of 11.  Now, so we started -- they started from there, and subsequently there was recruitment from among the youths.  Now, when the youths found themselves in a position where there were other members of other parties, now, when this group showed up, the youth wing of the MDR, for example, if they noticed that there was such a group that was already in place, they wouldn't continue to harass that group of civil servants who had come to share a drink or so.  So there was some sense of security in the face of the other group.  
Q.	Well, I was talking about the first two meetings, but you seem to be going further ahead than I am.  Now, for the first two meetings, from your understanding, I seem to understand that intellectuals were being invited to have discussions with other intellectuals; is that correct?  
A.	The first group which attended the first meeting was a group of people who had friends.  So that initial group invited their friends to attend their meetings, telling them that they could choose to attend or not, but they would not be forced to.  That is what happened.  
Q.	At those first two meetings, was the political situation in Rwanda discussed?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So there was some discussion, a little bit of discussion about politics?  
A.	Well, the party was a political party.  
Q.	So was there talk about a political programme or project?  
A.	There was talk about politics.  The party was a political party which wanted to create a youth wing.  
Q.	Now, those intellectuals who met in November, they discussed politics, and they talked about the political projects they wanted to embark on; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So, in November 1991, there is a political movement which is being set up; is that correct?  
Could you please answer my question?  
A.	Well, I didn't get the question.  I thought you were still going to put the question.  Could you please repeat your question? 
Q.	In November 1991, could one say that a political movement was being set up?  Can you confirm that?  
A.	Well, an association attached to a political party.  
Q.	An association -- a political association that was guided and driven by young intellectuals?  
A.	Well, run or guided by members of the MRND party.  
Q.	At those two meetings, the national committee and the committee of conseiller was set up and was made up of young intellectuals; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And all of this in line with MRND objectives of unity, peace, and development; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	In the struggle or the fight against all forms of discrimination?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And it is for that reason that Hutus, Tutsi, and Twa were all members of the Interahamwe; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	The purpose of the provisional national committee was to engage in politics; right?  
A.	No.  
Q.	But that seems to be the thrust of the communiqué.  
A.	Politics was a matter for the MRND party.  
Q.	But the communiqué of the provisional national committee states that the purpose was to engage in political debate.  
A.	Let me tell you that the communiqué from the national committee were always approved by the executive committee of the MRND.  
Q.	That is not exactly what I am seeking through my question.  I didn't ask you for the author or the approver of the communiqué.  I simply want to know from you whether the purpose of the communiqué was to seek involvement in public political debate.  
A.	I do not quite know how to answer you, but I would say no.  My answer would be no.  
Q.	Therefore, when the Interahamwe national committee releases a communiqué whereby it stigmatises the prime minister's behaviour or corruption and refers to the past, would that not be political debate?  
A.	Well, any Rwandan citizen who observes what a prime minister or a leader is doing is entitled to criticise, either in writing or by some communiqué. 
(Pages 30 to 34 by Wendy Molnar)

      1300H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So what you're saying is that there will be politics like any ordinary citizen is entitled to be engaged in? 
A.	Well, I don't see that as politics. It probably is a way of showing the population abuses and other ills that are obtaining (sic).  You see, the organisation in itself did not have any legal stages to allow it to engage in any such debate. 
Q.	However, they had a newsletter, a newspaper, didn't they? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And the newspaper was about politics, wasn't it? 
A.	Well, you know, a newspaper seeks to provide information to the population, doesn't it?  Now, if there were any bad things in that newspaper, it would probably have been suspended or cancelled. 
Q.	So, the -- the newspaper did not promote discrimination? 
A.	I don't quite remember the contents or what was written in those newspapers.  Maybe you would like to help me remember. 
Q.	I don't think I need to assist you by refreshing your memory on the existence of that newspaper.  Maybe in a while we will delve into that a little more, because I believe at the Ruhengeri meeting of 15 November 1995, the issue of the newspaper of the Interahamwe was broached.  Does that ring any bell and help you to remember the existence of the newspaper?
A.	I didn't say that I didn't recognise the existence of the newspaper.  The newspaper was there and its purpose was to provide information to the population.  
Q.	As far as you know, was that newspaper ever brought to book before the courts for slander and defamation? 
A.	I have no such recollection clearly. 
Q.	Was that newspaper ever banned? 
A.	I don't think so. 
Q.	Was it said that the Interahamwe newspaper incited people towards hatred wherever? 
A.	No, I didn't hear any such thing. 
Q.	At the April 1992 congress, did Mr. Ngirumpatse, as he took the floor, mention that the MRND had created a wing? 
A.	I believe that this came out in the resolutions of that congress where it had been agreed that the said movement be created at the préfectural levels. 
Q.	My question is the following:   At the 1992 congress, was there a resolution to create the movement?  Well, I could almost understand your answer to be no, but could you be more specific?  Could you answer my question specifically?  
A.	I do not think so. 
Q.	So there was no resolution to create a movement?  Do we agree on that? 
A.	Well, but the congress does acknowledge the existence of a movement, that a movement already exists. 
Q.	Let me remind you of what was done by the congress on the 18th of April in exact terms.  Resolution number 4, Exhibit D. NZ6 is what I'm referring to, K-number 0356679.  The resolution is as follows:   

 "Members of the national congress congratulated those who had created the Interahamwe organisation and requested that branches thereof be set up in all préfectures and even in communes.  Furthermore, they requested that the Interahamwe organisation be affiliated if possible to the MRND."  

Would you agree with me if I were to put it to you that the MRND, in April 1992, thanked those who had initiated the creation of the Interahamwe youth wing?  
A.	And if I were to say to you that the organisation Interahamwe was using the address, the logo and the stamps of the MRND, even before 1994, and letterheads and all that you may, what would you say?  
Q.	I would rather you answer my question, Witness, and that would spare me the trouble of having to answer yours, and maybe tell you that I'm not aware of any document that is as confused as you may want to portray.  What I would like is for you to answer my question and tell me whether, from resolution number 4, one could come to the conclusion that the MRND did thank and congratulate those who had initiated something.
A.	I believe that they officialised -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- in the witness's words --
THE WITNESS:
	-- what was already going on; what they had already started? 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So while all of the other parties or almost all the other political parties had their youth wings in April 1992, the MRND does not decide to create a youth wing, but simply congratulate those who had taken the initiative, at least as far as the resolution goes.  
A.	That congress officialised it.  That is what I can say.  They officialised something that was already in existence. 
Q.	Yet, they call for the affiliation of the Interahamwe as much as possible.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	The MRND does not decide; it calls for.  
A.	Well, I'm not here to analyse those things, but the fact is that people had come to create that organisation.  They came; they worked in MRND offices.  They held their meetings within MRND premises and offices to the point where the MRND subsequently convened a congress and made that announcement.  So that organisation was already existing and already functional in Kigali, even before the congress of April 1994 -- rather, 1992.  
Q.	You even told me that it was a political association attached to the MRND.  
A.	An organisation attached to the MRND party.  
Q.	Which did not have its own statute? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Which never decided to file its statutes?
A.	Which it requested to come up with statutes, but the MRND refused.  The MRND had no desire.
Q.	It requested to be integrated?  
A.	No, it requested to have legal status; to file its statutes as the other youth wings of other parties had done, but the MRND denied the request.  
Q.	According to you, did the leaders of the Interahamwe seek integration? 
A.	What exactly do you mean by "integration"?
Q.	Let me go over the MRND statutes so that this is very clear for you.  Let me remind you of article 61 of the statutes.  
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I'm on my feet.  It occurs to me to inquire whether Mr. Weyl has in mind exhibiting the statutes as he has been referring to them several times. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, we don't have many exhibits to tender for the time being.  This is relatively easy.  This is D. NG (sic) number 2. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think it's already in evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
My apologies. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.  

Let me proceed, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Let me remind you of article 61 of the statutes, Mr. Witness.  Integrated organisations may be formed or be constituted within the movement with a view to achieve a determined goal or programme.  Their statutes are certified by the national committee.  That is the procedure that is set out for integrated organisations, and a part of the MRND.  

There is another procedure spelled out in article 62.  It regards affiliated organisations; independent organisations may affiliate with the movement.  They shall be called affiliated organisations.  All autonomous associations, whose objectives are not contrary to the objectives of the movement, may request affiliation to the movement with a view to collaborate with it.  Title of affiliated organisation to the movement is granted by the national committee.  
At no point, to your knowledge, and in spite of the request made by the congress on the 
18th of April 1992, at no time did the political association of the Interahamwe request or express its desire to become an integrated organisation as a part of the MRND, or did it request a status as an affiliated organisation, because it wanted to be independent and autonomous.  
A.	I told you that the association requested the MRND that it have a statute and legal status.  MRND officials said "no".  They said that if legal status was granted, the organisation would have problems with its members in case things got out of hand, and that they would be directly responsible for that.  And so they preferred the MRND manage everything, so that when something needed to be done, the MRND would be there to represent the organisation. 

Let me tell you something:   As soon as the organisation was created, it began to use the logo, the address, the stamp and seal of the party, and on the seal you could see "MRND", and "MRND party".  The party never objected; never refused use of those documents or seals or logos.  My conclusion, therefore, is that the MRND, the political party, prior to the 6th of April 1992, before April 1992, accepted the association or the organisation as an integral part of the MRND party. 
Q.	The Interahamwe did not have their own seal; is that what you're saying? 
A.	Look at the seal and see whether or not it has the "MRND" or the coat of arms of the MRND.  You need to look at that.  Look at their postal address, which post office box they had.  Wasn't it for the MRND?  Even the name of the association itself, "Interahamwe za MRND", they never removed MRND from the very title of the organisation.  
Q.	I have some more specific questions.  There were Interahamwe leaders.  Do you think that any among them would have accepted the loss of their autonomy or independence or power to the MRND, or accepted to be put under the supervision of the MRND?  
A.	They were under MRND supervision?  Please, none of them.  The movement was created in MRND offices.  It was formed by members of the MRND executive committee.  Mr. Murenzi was from the MRND in Kigali.  The other two were from Gitarama.  They were members of the MRND.  Why did they use MRND premises when the organisation was set up?  Who did the organisation belong to?  
Q.	You never heard any of the Interahamwe leaders claim that they had founded the organisation? 
A.	The Interahamwe were created by the members of the committee of the MRND, and in MRND offices.  
Q.	If I were to tell you that number 1 said he initiated all of it, what would you say?  Would you be surprised?  
A.	Yes, I would be surprised. 
Q.	Those who say they heard number 1 claim that he was responsible for creating the interahamwe, are mistaken, therefore? 
A.	To my knowledge, he was invited just like everyone else when the Interahamwe were created.  This is the first time I've ever heard anything like that. 
Q.	So someone who would say, had he spoke with the head of the Interahamwe, and who would say that the chairman of the militia is stronger than any minister, he says that he personally created the militia --  I'm sorry, I was going too quickly for the interpreters -- who boasts that he created the militia on the basis of his political convictions to support the MRND party, anyone who would say that would be mistaken; is that what you're saying, Witness?  
A.	I say that that is incorrect.  So I would even say more.  He was used, like a designated chairman.  He was used.  
Q.	So, when people say that number 1 boasted of the initiative to support the MRND, either one of two things:   Number 1 never said that, or people are saying things that are not true? 
A.	I have no idea where you get that from.  Keep it for yourself. 
Q.	No, let's share it.  This is D. NZ16A, K0152939.  Lieutenant McNees was reporting about a conversation he had the day before with the chief of the Interahamwe.  This is on the 17th of March 1994.  Kibat commander says that, on the 16th of March 1994, he spoke with number 1, the Interahamwe, who was more powerful than any minister; a man who boasted about personally creating the militia on the basis of his political convictions and to provide support to the MRND party and to the regime.  According to you, was Lieutenant McNees mistaken? 
A.	That's what he said, not me. 
Q.	According to you, number 1 said things that were not true.  
A.	I'm not sure about what you're saying.  You're trying to make me speak of things that I don't want to.  I can't speak about this.  Speak to them. 

For me, he was invited just like everyone else.  He had a team, and in that team there were Tutsis and Hutus.  He brought them with him.  I would say that he was used for the formation of that.  He didn't chair the meeting.  He was appointed just like everyone else. 

I don't know if you have an opportunity to speak with Désiré Murenzi, but you can, or talk to your client.  He was chairman, I believe, in Kigali-ville.  He was the coordinator, and that's where the meetings were being held at the MRND. 

Ask officials of the MRND and ask them if number 1 came to the MRND proposing that this organisation be created. 
Q.	That's exactly what we're thinking about doing, and Mr. McNees, Lieutenant McNees, heard these things from number 1.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have a concern.  I have a few questions left in this line, but I see that it is 1:25.  Should I finish this line, which will take me about seven or eight minutes?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I think it would be preferable to stop now.  How much more time do you have (unintelligible).  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe that I would respect the overall time limits that I set out at first.  I will need an entire day.  I've been going for about two hours and I believe that I'll need some more time, not for just those last few questions, of course. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Would you complete it, say, in three hours more?  Is that what you estimated?  This is just an estimate for the purpose of scheduling. 
MR. WEYL:
I can try in three hours.  I will try to save the Court's time and pare down some of the questions, but I have talked about the constraints we have and personal difficulties that I have, especially for Tuesday.  I raised this issue yesterday, and it still remains a problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sow, now you've heard the other questioning, do you have an estimate of the duration of your cross-examination?  
MR. SOW:
Yes, Mr. President.  I believe that I will need maximum three hours, perhaps less.  Counsel Weyl has already put some of the questions to the witness and I don't need to go back over those. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much. 
MR. SOW:
Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, would you -- would your lead counsel be here on Tuesday?  
MR. WEYL:
I believe so, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Could she carry out the cross-examination?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I don't believe that I can suggest that to her, but perhaps she can answer that herself.  It seems to me to be very difficult to take up a cross-examination in the middle of it.  I have a line of questioning that has my own touches on it, my own reflections.  I was conducting the cross-examination and I don't think that she will be able to take it up in the middle.   In fact, I don't think that it is in Tribunal practice to do so.  I do think it would be extremely difficult, especially since -- all the more since, rather, we don't have a way of getting the transcripts to her of all the hearings we've had up until now -- last week.  I've been taking -- rather; it's difficult to take notes from The Hague because of the transmission difficulties.  I don't think she'll be in a position to take it up.  I would like to continue in my own line of questioning.  
I was told that I may have personalised it a bit too much this morning, in fact, but I would like to continue.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Mrs. President, this is Chantal Hounkpatin from The Hague.  May I say something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Ms. Hounkpatin.
MS. HOUNKPATIN:
Just to add to what my colleague, Mr. Weyl, had said.  It's not that I don't want to do that work or that I'm not capable of doing it, but just for the purposes of coherence and for good administration of justice, it would be preferable for the person who began the cross-examination to not stop in the middle in that way. 

Furthermore, for all of us, if you requested that the cross-examiner change, I would have to start at zero.  It would not be desirable -- just to give you my opinion; it would not be desirable to proceed in that manner. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We permit the witness to be released. 

Mr. Witness, we take the adjournment now.  You are not required to return until Tuesday morning at the usual commencement time. 
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Please -- please do not remove the witnesses yet for a while. 

Mr. Weyl, it's not going to be practical to postpone your cross-examination until Wednesday.  Now, the Court could sit under 15 bis this afternoon, which would give you two and a half hours.  So the alternative that we propose would be a 15 bis sitting this afternoon.  If you could conclude your cross-examination during that period, we will be willing to sit to permit you to continue this afternoon. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, this would be extremely difficult for two reasons:   First, when I estimate the time at three or four hours, it really is paring down as much as I can.  Two hours will not be enough time.  We will still be facing the same issues with regard to the determination of my cross-examination.  

I must say that I did everything possible to begin yesterday, and to hope to finish today with the time that was given to me. 

I fully intended to finish by this evening, but I must say it would be extremely difficult now to do so, because this morning I haven't even used two hours for the reasons, of course, that you mentioned, which are not attributable to me. 

We knew that the witness had difficulties yesterday, and we respected that, but I must absolutely be in Paris on Tuesday.

I think that Mr. Sow will conduct the cross-examination of Mr. Karemera on Tuesday.  He may be able to do so.  I have these constraints, Mr. President.  They are absolutely necessary, and I would request that I be able to resume on Wednesday morning as early as possible so that I can try to finish as quickly as possible during that day.  

I think that the Prosecution will have the same issues in their re-direct.  We both share the burden of these constraints, Mr. President. 

With your leave, Mr. President, I have a second objection.  If we have to begin at 3:30 this afternoon to continue with two hours of cross-examination, I will miss my plane for Paris because the only available flight is this evening's.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Just out of curiosity, may I inquire how Mr. Weyl will travel -- be in Paris on Tuesday and arrive in Arusha on Wednesday, because usually the flights -- it takes a whole day to travel from Europe to Arusha, so are we talking about Wednesday or Thursday?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Unfortunately, Mr. President, The Hague, Mr. Weyl and Mr. Webster have all spoken at the same time and the interpreters did not get any of it. 
MR. WEYL:
I want to reassure the Prosecutor, I intend to be before your Chamber, Mr. President, at ten o'clock in the morning, on Wednesday morning.  I will be going through Nairobi. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, may I offer a thought with regard to scheduling?  Might it meet with the Court's agreement that, for Monday, clearly it's GFJ; Tuesday, Mr. Sow can conduct his cross-examination in the morning, and one anticipates that he will complete his cross-examination by the afternoon, at which time we could return to GFJ. 

In terms of G's testimony, we would lose probably about two hours, and he would then commence again on Wednesday morning with Mr. Weyl. 

What I'm offering, therefore, is, as a thought, to accommodate the difficulties which seem to be apparent, we would lose two hours of G's testimony, but we can fill it with GFJ.  
MS. TALON:
Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, madam registrar.  
MS. TALON:
If the hearing were to resume this afternoon, there would be problems with the victims section here in The Hague, because the day had been planned along the lines of the indications that were given yesterday.  Thank you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Mr. Weyl, although we have a general attitude of facilitation, we still feel that -- that you are actually before us now, and the management that you should have embarked upon was with the other engagement.  This is -- you are in our Court, undertaken a task before us, and we think it is very unsatisfactory that you have made this request.  We -- we -- we don't like it at all. 

Now, Mr. Morley has put forward a proposal.  The problem with Mr. Morley's proposal is that it can only work if you and Mr. Morley are able to work together to ensure that the witness's testimony is concluded on Wednesday.  So you all will have to give undertakings to the Court concerning the time, which will be undertakings will which be strictly enforced.  

As a general rule, we don't like to give -- impose time restrictions on cross-examination.  But in this case, if you make this arrangement, we will have to act on that premise.  So it would mean that you would have to commit yourself to a time by which your cross-examination will be completed -- an enforceable time limit by which time your cross-examination will be completed. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, would you allow me to say something?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, you put me in a very difficult position for several reasons:   First of all, it will require that I take comments that lie more with Mr. Morley.  

Secondly, you are requiring of me commitments that may tend to compromise the interests of Mr. Ngirumpatse.  I am doing my level best to limit my cross-examination as much as possible, and I believe that I have not been wasteful of the Trial Chamber's time. 

I'm also very, very concerned by the fact that my commitments on Monday and Tuesday are commitments that have already been postponed several times over, given the uncertainties around the Defence's timetable in view of the Prosecutor's schedules.  We have a lot of work ahead of us and we try to share it with the lead counsel as best we can, and we try to do our level best to be available to the Trial Chamber.  But, Mr. President, I believe you need to understand that I have already postponed these commitments that I have in Paris for Monday and Tuesday several times over, and if you are telling me again, Mr. President, that I must defend Mr. Ngirumpatse's interests, let me say that even from as far back as January when the issue of the withdrawal of Mr. Ngirumpatse's lead counsel arose, I think that presence before the Trial Chamber at all times has been utmost in my concerns, and it has depended on the choices by the Prosecutor to call so and so a witness.  

And so, Mr. President, when you ask me to be completely available, then I must revisit what I am doing here within the Defence team, because it does not comply with my professional and ethical duties, as well as my professional independence.  Right now, Mr. President, I am rather quite confused.  
(Pages 35 to 44 by Jennifer Spring)





















1354H 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I don't think that that speech was necessary.  You had said that you thought you could complete your cross-examination if you had three hours.  If we start at 10:00 on Wednesday morning, you'd have -- there would be approximately three hours by the time we adjourn at 1:30.  And my comment was that if you're going to do what we do not want to do and allow you to start your cross-examination on Wednesday, then you'll have to observe strictly the estimate that you, yourself, gave.  We were not imposing anything on you extraneously.  But all we are saying is, we have generally had an attitude of latitude up till now.  We have not held anybody to the estimates they've given, but I say in this case we might have to do it if we accommodate what we consider to be a request which we do not appreciate.  

We don't appreciate the fact that counsel who is appearing before us, actually engaged in an activity, should leave to do something else.  We think that's an extraordinary situation.  Now, we are considering making an accommodation, but -- but we are wanting to ensure that if we did that -- I have to come back to Mr. Morley because he also, in fact, is also being put on the spot to some extent by what I have just commented on.  But we did not take your comment about a full day seriously, Mr. Morley, when you first mentioned it.  And we thought about it a bit.  And I would not think that the Prosecutor's interest would be handicapped if you were able to complete within a two-and-a-half hour timetable.  Again, it's just a view from the Bench.  We're seeing it from a different angle, of course.  
MR. MORLEY:
The picture will be far clearer on Monday, but the present estimate, with the amount of material that Mr. Webster and I have discussed, is that a day is realistic.  The reason why the picture will be clearer on Monday is because Mr. Webster and I are going to be finalising, as best we can, what the re-direct would involve on Saturday morning, but at the moment, we think a day is, in fact, realistic.  

Now, Your Honour, I'm sure, has in mind that if it wasn't for the kind of delays that we have in this environment with video links and translations and so on, the re-direct would be reasonably quick.  I would have thought that in my home jurisdiction it wouldn't be longer than about an hour-and-a-half, but in this environment that tends to get multiplied by at least three.  So we think a day is not unrealistic, but we can inform Your Honour better on Monday morning if that assists.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, with your leave?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, please be re-assured -- and I'm going to speak quite solemnly -- please be re-assured that I gave absolute priority to my work before the Trial Chamber as far as possible.  And when I say "as far as possible," it is because on two occasions I have had to postpone this pressing issue that is calling me to Paris, unavoidably, Mr. President, and I'm being very sincere and very faithful.  I have no choice.  I have no choice at this juncture, Mr. President, because I was pushed to this position because of accumulated delays that did not arise from my own doing.  

I would like to pray one further thing from the Trial Chamber.  I know that I am in the hands of the Court, but I have this request to make of the Trial Chamber.  I said I would need two days, and you kept urging me to do my level best, and I have done my level best.  Now the other witness took one hour of my time.  Now I'm losing the afternoon which I had hoped would be available for me, and I have now come to a position where, after making all of these arrangements, I'm being asked to use only three hours.  But I had initially asked for two days.  Now, Mr. President, I would have needed Tuesday and Wednesday under the same conditions to conduct my cross-examination.  Now I'm appealing to the Trial Chamber to please grant me at least the day of Wednesday, so that I can do my level best to reduce my cross-examination in its concluding phases and then maybe wrap up in the morning, and if necessary, take a little bit of the afternoon with the leave of the Trial Chamber.  And I just crave your indulgence to -- to -- to trust me, so that I can be part of getting everything to happen properly, taking into account all the surrounding circumstances.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
What we are thinking of doing now is this, that on Monday we'll hear GFJ, and if his testimony is not concluded, we will resume on Tuesday morning at 8:45.  Hopefully, his cross-examination and re-examination, we'll see if you could -- I would expect that that would be Monday -- Monday and Tuesday morning might be sufficient to conclude that.  We'll resume with this witness on Monday afternoon at 3:30.  Mr. Sow would -- 3:30 our time, Tuesday afternoon, I'm sorry -- Tuesday afternoon after lunch, which may allow Mr. Sow to do his cross-examination on Tuesday afternoon, and then we will continue on Wednesday  and see what we complete (inaudible). 

Yes, Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
I want to most sincerely thank the Trial Chamber for that solution, Mr. President.  
MR. WEBSTER:
Your Honour, if I could make a slight counterproposal that we start on Tuesday morning with Witness G and Mr. Sow's cross-examination because if he ends up going over, we want to get as much testimony from Witness G as possible.  So rather than starting with Witness G at 3:30 and having him not finish by 6:00, it would be preferable to start at 10:00 with Witness G and go as long as it takes for him to complete that cross-examination.  

MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, well, let me ask you this.  In terms of the completion of Witness GFJ, do you have an idea of the extent of your re-examination?  What -- we would not have wanted to lose time if it was necessary to complete it on Tuesday.  So our idea was, would we be able to start 8:45 with GFJ?  Would it be difficult for counsel to manage that?  
MR. WEBSTER:
It would not be difficult for me.  I don't know about Mr. Robinson.  In my last conversation with him, he indicated that he may take more than a day, but we could start with GFJ at 8:45, end with him at 10:00, take Witness G as far as it goes, and then re-commence with Witness GFJ in the afternoon, because my concern is finishing as much as possible of Witness J -- Witness G, because he's the one that really presents the logistical challenge.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, would that be okay with you? 
MR. ROBINSON:
I don't have any problem with that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, I think we can make the adjustment and do that.  We will --

Mr. Registrar is that clear, or do I have to say it, myself?  
MR. FRY:
It's so ordered, Your Honour, (unintelligible).  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Well, that concludes our business today, and we can take adjournment until Monday morning.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm sorry.  I just simply wanted to tell the Trial Chamber, with your leave, that Monday one of our learned colleagues will be holding the brief on behalf of Mr. Ngirumpatse because Madam (sic) Ngirumpatse will be on the plane, and I wouldn't be in Arusha.  So Mr. Ngirumpatse would be alone, assisted by one of our learned colleagues, who have agreed to do so with the authorisation of the Trial Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
And with Mr. Ngirumpatse's consent?  I beg your pardon?  
MR. WEYL:
I do not do anything without his consent, Mr. President, and he can confirm that himself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'll take your word, Mr. Weyl.  Thank you.
(Court adjourned at 1410H)
