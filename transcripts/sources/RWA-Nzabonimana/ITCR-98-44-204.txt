 (Witness entered courtroom) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody.  

Mr. Registrar, would you please commence and open the proceedings.
MR HOMETOWU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Dennis Byron, presiding, Judge Karin Hökborg and Judge Gberdao Gustave Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Tuesday, the 22nd of November 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of the Prosecutor versus Rwamakuba, case no. ICTR-98-44-C-T.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar.  The appearances are the same?

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning.
MR. HOOPER:
Our next witness is the witness sat before you.  On my arrival this morning, he told me that he wasn't feeling well, and that he had a headache.  It was my suggestion to him that if in fact he wasn't feeling well, I would rather he didn't give his evidence today, and with this he concurred.

May I say that this witness has been here, or brought here, for five consecutive days.  He expected yesterday, as I did, that he would be giving his evidence fairly early in the morning session, and he wasn't reached.  There's never been this difficulty, and to save him embarrassment, for my part and looking at him -- for my part, I came to the rapid view that he was unwell, and his evidence is such that I would prefer that if he was going to give it, he give it in the best of health rather than feeling unwell.

I have asked for another witness to be called, who's a relatively short witness, who I understand is en route.  And so I hope, if the Chamber concurs in this witness having his evidence deferred until tomorrow, that that will be, I hope, a suitable use of court time today.

With the possibility that it is the beginning of something rather than the thing itself, I will ask that a second witness be brought with this witness again tomorrow -- that is if the one on his way, if we start him, hasn't been concluded.

MR. PRESIDENT:
Have you determined the nature of his ailment?
MR. HOOPER:
He's just told me that he has a headache and a stomach upset.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You think that he will be recovered without getting medical attention?
MR. HOOPER:
He is in WVS hands, and they provide him with every assistance.  And so I would have thought that it was probably the case that between them they can resolve the matter appropriately.  He hasn't asked me for a doctor this morning or suggested that.  But I'm just concerned that a witness who's going to go into quite a lot of detail about events, and I'm aware of the range of his evidence, gives it at his best.  My feeling is, talking to him this morning, that was not the case, and I've had the opportunity of seeing him over previous mornings.  I hope that assists.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You mentioned the witness you are calling is a short witness.  Why do you think the evidence of the next witness will exhaust the whole day?
MR. HOOPER:
The last witness was here for almost five days, or five mornings, I should say -- or was here for five mornings.  So it is on that unhappy prognosis that I'm basing that view.  But if there's any doubt about that, I can always whistle up another.  They are banking up down there, so at the moment I don't have a witness problem other than a surfeit.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, how much time do you anticipate?  At what time do you anticipate the other witness to be here?
MR. HOOPER:
I understand he's on his way.  The safe house is not very far.  I need just 10 minutes, just for my part, to organise closed session material and the general plot of the evidence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have something to say, Mr. Morley?
MR. MORLEY:
The concern of the Prosecution is simply that the proposed witness is not, as we understand it, the next proposed witness, and as a consequence there is a degree of concern on the part of my learned leader that there is insufficient time for preparation.  One understands the importance of being able to prepare for the cross-examination of witnesses.  

One understands my learned friend's difficulty.  If there's a witness who is ill, one doesn't want to force the witness to give evidence.  The witness, on the face of it, is a short witness and it may be that if Your Honour comes to the view that the other witness is to be called now rather than the present witness, who perhaps is a little ill, it may be that, with a little bit of time after the evidence-in-chief, plus the fact that we have a break at 10:30, we'll be ready to start cross-examination today.  But we are a little uneasy about it; I think that's the best way of putting it -- we're uneasy.  I hope that assists.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, are you conducting the cross-examination of this witness?
MR. MORLEY:
Of this witness? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, the witness that is before us.  Who will be conducting that?
MR. MORLEY:
It's not formally been decided.  There are certain indications --
MR. PRESIDENT:
My question had to do with the question of anticipated duration of cross-examination and anticipated how much time you will need.  If we rose for 10, 15 minutes, what is the recommendation that you would make if I were to ask those questions?
MR. MORLEY:
If Your Honour gives me five minutes so that I've read the witness statement, I'll then be in a position to give you some idea of what is going to be contested.  My learned friend perhaps was taken a little bit by surprise by his ill witness this morning, and we only found out about 10 minutes ago about the difficulty.  I'm presently reading the statement now.  So if you allow me five minutes, I'll be able to help.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, you are scheduled to testify this morning, but counsel has indicated that you're sick, that you're not feeling well.  He has indicated that you might be in a position to testify tomorrow.  Could you just tell us what is your condition, please? 
THE WITNESS:
I have a headache and a stomach ache, Mr. President, and this is since 2 a.m., since 2 o'clock this morning.  All night I have had a headache and this morning I took some paracetamol, but it didn't have any effect -- it didn't help.  I still have a headache and a stomach ache.

In view of how I feel physically, I really don't feel able to testify for very long here before you.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The WVS's nurse was just out there a bit before.  I don't know if she's still there.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Does the WVS have a representative here?  
MR. HOMETOWU:
There is a representative right here in the courtroom, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
What is the position with regard to the medical provisions for the witness?  Can we ensure that he actually sees a doctor and we get some information about his condition?
MR. HOMETOWU:
Yes, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to ensure he's able to testify tomorrow, or as soon as possible.
MR. HOMETOWU:
Mr. President, we'll convey the order to the appropriate section and we'll also contact the medical officer in charge to ensure the health condition of the witness is attended to.  Thank you.
MR. HOOPER:
I mean, for safety's sake, I can defer this witness further and call -- I won't name him -- another witness so that we would have the one on the way, then the other one, and then I would expect this witness would be giving evidence, at the present rate, no earlier than Thursday.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, it is more important that you discuss that with the Prosecutor than with us.  
MR. HOOPER:
Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you can reorganise your schedule with the Prosecutor, that will satisfy us.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, very well.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we're going to excuse you.  You'll be told when you'll be required to return to give your testimony.  You may leave.
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
(Witness exited courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, we understood Mr. O'Shea had a two-minute presentation to make to us to comment on the propositions advanced yesterday by Mr. Morley.  Perhaps we could hear him now.
MR. O'SHEA:
Thank you, Your Honour.  It is really more of a comment than anything else.  I don't believe I need to dwell upon this.  

First of all, I'm pleased to hear that the Prosecution appear to finally accept that their case is closed.  That seems to be the underlying premise of Mr. Morley's submission.
With regard to his legal argument, I don't think it is necessary really to go into the substance of it, since Mr. Morley is not asking for a ruling.  However, let me just say this.  There is no arbitrary line to be drawn before the close of the Prosecution case and after the close of the Prosecution case for the purposes of interpreting the words material to the preparation of the Defence case.

The case which was brought to Your Honour's attention really involved a collateral matter.  It involved immigration documents which were in themselves collateral to the issues in the case, and only went strictly to issues of credibility.  And Mr. Morley's submission really has to be put into that context.  It will depend on the nature of the document.  There are documents, for instance, which the Prosecution will tender for the truth of their contents, and there are documents which the Prosecution will tender which make serious accusations against the witness, or support serious accusations against the Accused.

Those types of documents obviously require some thought and inquiry and investigation on the part of the Defence.  And that is why I say that there can be no arbitrary line drawn in that sense.  And there is, for instance, a case of Kamuhanda of 2002 where the Chamber accepted that a matter was material to the preparation of the Defence case, even though the Defence case had started.  So that's all I'm going to say about that.

But I would like to say that, in our submission, in general it should not be appropriate to introduce a legal argument in a vacuum.  The time that we have during these proceedings is, in our submission, very, very precious, and we would like to do our very best to ensure that this case is dealt with expeditiously.  Thank you, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
In certain other arenas I should simply respond by saying, "Ahem, ahem" to your last expressed view.

As Mr. Morley mentioned yesterday, I don't think the Court is required to comment at this stage, but we have noted what you've both said.  I think what we'll do now is we'll rise for a few minutes.

Mr. Registrar will notify us when we can resume, so we'll rise for a few minutes. 
(Court recessed from 0925H to 0955H) 
(Witness entered courtroom)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We can now resume our session.  

Good morning, Mr. Witness.
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you're going to give your testimony in this case.  But first I'd ask the registrar to give you an oath to speak the truth during your testimony.
(Declaration made by Witness 4/12 in Kinyarwanda)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, you'll give your testimony by responding to questions put to you by the lawyers who are appointed to discharge those duties.  You'll be questioned, first of all, by Mr. Hooper who is the lawyer for the Accused Rwamakuba in this trial.  

Mr. Hooper, are you ready?  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, would you grant me leave to say something before we begin? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Witness, I'll hear what you have to say.
THE WITNESS:
I would like to request that in the course of my testimony, for security reasons, I would like to be able to give my evidence in closed session, for reasons of my own personal safety and the security of my family, which I left behind.
MR. PRESIDENT:
You may sit, Mr. Witness.  I can hear you even when you are sitting.  You are permitted to sit.

Mr. Hooper, I understand the witness's concern and he is a protected witness, but would it be satisfactory if the normal procedure is followed whereby that part of his testimony which may reveal information pertinent to his identity could be dealt with in closed and the rest in open, or his entire testimony sensitive in that way?  
MR. HOOPER:
I can see from his perspective that it could be sensitive in the sense that the principal thrust of his evidence could, to the discerning eye reading a transcript, suggest who the maker of the statement is, as we'll see, but I hope that the witness can trust me to avoid those areas of evidence.  

But having said that, and recognising his concern, it may be that more of this witness's testimony will be in closed session than other witnesses so far, to reflect his concerns, which he has voiced to me before.  And, for my part, I accept that it is a real concern. So perhaps if we go into closed session at this point, I can deal -- I'll progress his evidence and you, Mr. President, and your brother Judges can perhaps intervene if you feel that these are matters that could be in open court.  I don't think there's any easy route; that's the problem.  Can we start in closed session and see how we go?

MR. MORLEY:
May I invite that we do go into closed session and that Mr. Hooper is able to elicit from the witness exactly what it is he's concerned about.  At the moment, we don't really know, and we're relying on Mr. Hooper to be helpful as always in suggesting but without any background information that closed session may make sense for this witness.  

I still don't understand why this witness might want the bulk, if not all, of his testimony in closed session.  So if we go into closed session, no doubt Mr. Hooper can ask the witness to explain, to assist Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Morley.

For the benefit of the members of the public, I think we are obliged to go into closed session at this stage.  We can't give you an idea of how long we will be, but we're mindful of the importance of the trial being a public trial and the closed session will be as brief as possible in the circumstances.  We'll go into closed session now. 
MR. HOOPER:
Very well.

(Pages 1 to 7 by Maureen Dunn)

















BY MR. HOOPER: 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I'll just say this: I'm going to ask questions which I hope don't lead to anyone identifying who you are.  But if I ask you a question, or if anyone asks you a question that you think may put your security in danger through revealing who you are, just say so.  You don't have to answer the question; you can tell the President Judge that you're worried -- yes -- and we can sort it out.  So just because you're asked a question doesn't mean you have to answer it if you're worried about your answer affecting that.

So with that in mind, I just want to ask you some general questions now about the Accused in this case, who is called Dr André Rwamakuba.  My first question is this: before the war, did you know of André Rwamakuba and, if you did, in what way?
A.	Before the war I heard André Rwamakuba spoken of, but when I saw him for the first time was at the rally in Kayanga.  It was an MDR party rally.  We went off to see what was happening.  We were especially curious to see one Faustin Twagiramungu, who was the national chairman of the MDR.  And that is when I saw Rwamakuba for the first time.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, could you assist with the spelling of the name just mentioned?
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, it is T-W-A-G-I-R-A-M-U-N-G-U.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And the --
MR. HOOPER:
And the Christian name Faustin -- F-A-U-S-T-I-N -- Faustin Twagiramungu, who was then president, as we know, of the MDR party.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you remember if any other important person was present at that meeting, aside from Twagiramungu.  You've mentioned André Rwamakuba -- anybody else?
A.	I remember that André Rwamakuba took the floor to introduce the guests of honour -- first, Anasthase Gasana, Minister of Foreign Affairs and then the Minister of Information, Pascal Ndengejeho, Bonaventure Ubarijoro and the Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the Prime Minister.  He also presented Jean-Marie Vianney and Rucogoza, Minister of Primary and Secondary Education and, finally, introduced Faustin Twagiramungu, and other prominent figures who I have forgotten.
Q.	And I've forgotten some of those spellings.  Perhaps I can come back to them at a convenient moment, sir.

So this MDR rally, can you remember when it was, when it was held, approximately?
A.	I don't remember very well.  It could have been in 1993, but I'm not sure of that.
Q.	Now, one of the allegations in this case against André Rwamakuba, Mr. Witness, is that he came up to your commune and held meetings where he called for the Tutsis to be exterminated.  Have you ever heard of such a thing?
A.	I never heard such things come out of Rwamakuba's mouth.  He merely introduced the prominent figures who'd come to attend the meeting.  The main purpose of that political meeting was to criticise, if I can say so, Habyarimana's regime, and I think that Rwamakuba, in my opinion, did not say anything else.
Q.	Now, aside from that meeting, did you attend any other political meetings in the year or so before the war?
A.	I did not attend any other meeting.
Q.	Dealing with André Rwamakuba, do you know where he came from, where his family came from?
A.	Rwamakuba lived at Nduba -- N-D-U-B-A -- N-D-U-B-A -- Nduba in Bumbogo secteur, which borders Nduba secteur.  ***************************************, so I went to visit members of my family, and that is how I learned that Rwamakuba lived or came from Nduba and subsequently I saw him in the meeting I have just mentioned.
Q.	Have you yourself ever visited Nduba?
A.	No, I never went to Nduba secteur, but when I was in Bumbogo secteur, I could see Nduba territory from Bumbogo.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I am sorry, I'm not sure about that -- 
MR. HOOPER:
Bumbogo, I think -- B-U-M-B-O-G-O -- which is on our sketch plan, I think, and just on the other side of the valley is Nduba.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So can I ask you this: have you ever been to Sha or Shango?
A.	No, I have never been to Sha or Shango.
Q.	Now, we know in 1994 where you were living.  We know where you are living today.  I'm not going to mention that place.  But have you always lived in that area, or not?
A.	I have always lived at my present home -- my present home is where I've always lived.  But towards the end of the war I did have to leave my home with my family.  We would spend some nights in the bush, because we were afraid to go home, inasmuch as the war and massacres were raging everywhere.
Q.	Now, living where you do and having lived all your life there, is there any reason why you've not visited Sha or Shango or Nduba?
A.	Are you referring to the wartime?  Well, if that's what we're talking about, I couldn't circulate, nor would I seek refuge in Sha or in Shango, because those places were in Inkotanyi hands, and the local people who could flee fled with the Rwandan government forces.  The other local inhabitants were more or less held hostage by the Inkotanyi.  It was therefore impossible for me to go to Sha or Shango or Bumbogo.  In any case, Kayanga and Rutunga were also in Inkotanyi hands, so it was difficult to go and seek refuge in those places.
Q.	Yes.  Thank you for that.  In fact, you've answered my next question, but if I can just go back to the general question.  From what you say, you've never ever, even before the war, been to that side of the commune, and I'm just asking if you can help us as to why that is, if that doesn't seem a silly question to you.
A.	I already told you that before the war I used to go and visit members of my family ******************** and beyond Bumbogo I could see the Nduba area.  At Shango, at Sha, and at Bumbogo I had no friends or family, so I had no reason to go there.
Q.	Thank you very much.  Let's come to the war and, in particular, let's start with the 6th of April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane is shot down.  Did you -- what do you know about that?  Did you witness that, or not?
A.	I would like us to address that in closed session.  You should understand **********************************.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness is pointing to the location on the map and he continues by saying the following.
THE WITNESS:
If I were to give details on the matter, there are people who might identify me, since **************************, and where I live it is possible for me --
MR. HOOPER:
Don't say any more.
THE WITNESS:
-- to see what's going on at Kanombe.
MR. HOOPER:
Don't say any more -- you have.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So the area -- you are very sensitive to those indicia that can add up to identifying who you are.  So I would ask to go into closed session for this and several other questions.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  We resume in closed session.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 15 to 23] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
(Pages 12 to 14 by Maureen Dunn)



MR. PRESIDENT:
We are now in open session.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, in your evidence over the last half an hour or so -- I'm going to attempt to summarise it and if anyone wants to contribute to that, they may.

Basically, you're telling us that you've lived where you've lived all your life, and that before the events you'd seen André Rwamakuba at the MDR meeting in Kayanga where he introduced Twagiramungu and others, and that during the war you witnessed the movement of refugees after the 6th of April, and you also witnessed assailants of those refugees and, in particular, on the 12th of November -- sorry, 12th of April, you witnessed them going up towards the school; you heard shooting from the school; and you subsequently learnt from people that there had been killing -- a massacre -- at the Gikomero Protestant school.  And you described the vehicles -- four vehicles who had made their way there, and the other vehicles you saw were an army lorry, and the mayor's vehicle when he fled.  

You saw no other vehicles on that road; that you've never heard other people in your area allege that André Rwamakuba participated in any way in the genocide or the events in your secteur during the genocide or the war; that you know of a man called Matabaro, though that is an alias for his real name, a man of 35.  I think that summarises, I home, the general parameters of your testimony.  And those are all my questions.

One final question.  There's always one final question and it is this: have you ever been arrested or charged for any offence?
A.	No.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We propose to take a short break now and we'll start the cross-examination after. 
(Court recessed at 1127H)
(Page 24 by Maureen Dunn)







(Court resumed at 1150H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we can now resume.  

Now, Mr. Witness, under the rules of our Court you are now going to be questioned by the lawyer for the Prosecutor and you will have to answer questions from the Prosecutor.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I understand, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, are you ready?  
MR. MORLEY:
Of course, yes.  May I just mention, to assist Your Honour and Your Honours' colleagues, that maybe I'll slip into tomorrow morning.  Looking at the time now, we've got 35 minutes.  May I ask for closed session briefly to start with?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We go into a closed session now.  

Mr. Witness, we go back into a closed session.  
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 26 to 28] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)  
(Page 25 by Karen Holm)

















MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I would just like to assure you that the Chamber has a lot of experience dealing with protected witnesses, many of whom have the same concerns that you have, and we will take care to ensure that nothing goes on the record that could reveal your identity.  But if you feel uncomfortable about any answer you are likely to give, you can direct my attention and we will take necessary action.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will proceed now.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	It's right that you met with an assistant to the Defence on the 28th of February 2004?  That's correct, is it not? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Did you meet with a member of the Defence on an occasion before the 28th of February 2004?  
A.	Can you please repeat your question?  
Q.	Did you meet with a member of the Defence on an occasion before the 28th of February 2004? 
A.	Are you talking of someone else like myself?  I don't understand.  Are you talking about a person I might have met but who indeed would have the same status as myself; that is a witness, in other words?  
Q.	Did you meet with any member of the Defence for Mr. Rwamakuba on an occasion before the 28th of February 2004? 
A.	If you are referring to a member of the Rwamakuba Defence team, well, I met none of them. 
Q.	You clearly met someone on the 28th of February 2004.  My question is, had you met that person, or any other members of the Rwamakuba Defence team, before the 28th of February 2004? 
A.	A few days ago I met one of the members of the Rwamakuba Defence team, and when I got here another member of that Defence team came and met me, where I am staying. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Perhaps I can help.  Mr. Witness, I don't know if there's a problem with language, but the answer you have given is not -- does not answer the question that the lawyer put to you.  You gave evidence earlier that you met with an assistant to the Defence on the 28th of February 2004.  Do you recall that?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do remember. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
The question is:  Before that date, did you meet with anybody else on behalf of the Defence?  That's all the question wants you to answer.  
THE WITNESS:
As you have just said, on the 28th of February I met the person called Martin, who put questions to me concerning Rwamakuba.  I think that I have had to speak before you here on the content of my statement, that is the statement I gave to that gentleman, today. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a translation problem?  Because the witness obviously hasn't understood the question.  Is there -- 
MR. HOOPER:
In fairness to the witness, he answered this question a few questions ago, as I understand it, saying he had met no one from the Defence team before that date.  So I think it's -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I don't recall.  That answer may have slipped past me. 
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, and I think, being asked again is -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it probably slipped by all of us, Your Honour. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, if he did ask it, can we have the question and the answer, if it's there, because I think he -- I heard him -- I thought I heard him say that.  
MR. MORLEY:
There's nothing sinister in the question.  I'm simply trying to establish when the witness was first approached by the Defence.  And it may be that Mr. -- as Mr. Hooper got to his feet a moment ago, he can tell us whether that was the first occasion the witness was seen, because the witness clearly doesn't understand the question.  His Honour Judge Byron has had a go.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, he was asked the question about 15 questions ago, I think. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, I have to apologise to you.  We have found reference to his answer.  
MR. MORLEY:
All I'm trying to establish is when he was first approached.  There's nothing strange about that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I understand that.  But the witness did answer the question, indeed, so we do have it on the record.  I had suggested that Mr. Hooper's comment was not reflected on the record, but it is.
 
MR. HOOPER:
So the question was put to the witness:  "Before the 28th of February when he met the man Martin, who is the investigator, had he met anyone from the Defence team?"  His answer was "no."  I don't know if he met anyone before then or not, i.e., Martin, or how many times or whatever, but I can confirm that since then he was seen by Mr. O'Shea, a week or two ago, three weeks ago, in Kigali, who passed him as fit, and then he came here and then I saw him last week, and that's been the contact.  
MR. MORLEY:
Thank you.  
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	On the 28th of February of 2004, is it right that you made your first and only statement in relation to Rwamakuba? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	You have not had to consider Rwamakuba and the question of testimony before the 28th of February 2004; is that right? 
A.	You're asking me whether I had thought of appearing as a witness in the Rwamakuba trial?  
Q.	The first time you had to consider Rwamakuba in Gikomero during the genocide was in 2004, in February, when you made the statement to Mr. Martin.  Would that be right?  
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	Prior to your making the statement on the 28th of February 2004, you had seen Rwamakuba only once; is that right? 
A.	I saw Rwamakuba at the time of the rally I referred to here, and that was the only time on which I saw him, the only occasion on which I saw him. 
Q.	Have you had any contact with Rwamakuba since 1994? 
A.	I have stated that I only saw Rwamakuba on the occasion of the rally I referred to in my statement, and I further assert that I have not seen him since. 
Q.	Have you made witness statements in any other cases? 
A.	Your question is in respect of this Tribunal here, or other tribunals?  
Q.	Let's start with this Tribunal here.  Have you made witness statements in relation to any other cases here at this Tribunal?  
A.	On the 20th of February 2004 I -- they also spoke to me of Kamuhanda, who was also detained here.  They put questions to me about him and I answered them, saying what the situation was at the time in respect of Kamuhanda and Rwamakuba.  However, I understood that the questions put to me essentially concerned Rwamakuba, which is the reason why I am here as a witness in the trial of André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Have you given evidence before this Tribunal in another case before? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you made any witness statements in respect of others in any other tribunals or proceedings? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Does Rwamakuba know you? 
A.	Rwamakuba does not know me, but I personally must say I know him because he is a doctor, and as a doctor he is well known and, moreover, he was an authority. 
Q.	How did you come to the attention of the Defence in this case?  
A.	It's possible that Martin gave information concerning me, and I met him in Kigali.  I also met another member of the Defence committee -- of the Defence group here.  I should say that Tribunal people came once to my place and told me that my name was on a list of witnesses -- on the list of witnesses. 
Q.	When did Tribunal people come to you to say that your name was on a list of witnesses,?  Was that before or after the meeting on the 28th of February 2004? 
A.	No, they came to see me very recently.  I do not remember which month exactly.  I don't even know what month we're in.  But in any case, those people came to see me and told me that I should come here on the 14th of this month.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"What month are we in?" asks the witness, says the Kinyarwanda booth.  The witness is trying to remember what month we're in.  "It seems to me," says the witness, "we're in the month of November.  So I think those people came to see me at the end of October, at the end of October 2005." 
BY MR. MORLEY:
Q.	When you made your statement to Martin on the 28th of February of 2004, was that in Kigali, by appointment? 
A.	Yes, we met in Kigali and he had given me an appointment prior to that.  
Q.	What contact had there been between you and Martin before the appointment? 
A.	A man from my place who had been in the Kamuhanda matter contacted me, and it was he who called me to speak of Kamuhanda, and at one point we mentioned the Rwamakuba case, inasmuch as I had seen Rwamakuba at the rally; I spoke of it.  The person who asked me to come didn't know that I knew Rwamakuba, and when we started speaking of Rwamakuba, we did not speak any more of Kamuhanda, and then they put questions to me about Rwamakuba.  But prior to that, I did not know this man named Martin. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour, I wonder if that's a convenient moment. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, it is.  

Mr. Witness, we have to take our adjournment.  We don't have access to this courtroom in the afternoon, so your testimony will resume tomorrow morning.  I must advise you that while you're a witness during this or any adjournment of the proceedings, that you are not to talk about your testimony or the case with anybody at all.  Do you understand that?  
THE WITNESS:
I have understood. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We take the adjournment now, until tomorrow morning.  
(Court adjourned at 1229H)
