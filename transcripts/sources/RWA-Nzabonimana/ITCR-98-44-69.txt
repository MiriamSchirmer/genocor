P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT: 
The proceedings are called to order.  

Could the registry introduce the matter coming before the Trial Chamber this morning, please?  
MR. KIYEYEU: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  

	Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge William H. Sekule, presiding, Judge Winston Churchill Matanzima Maqutu and Judge Arlette Ramaroson, is now sitting in open session, today, Monday, the 14 of July 2003, for the hearing of the Prosecutor's closing arguments in the matter of the Prosecutor v. Juvenal Kajelijeli, Case No. ICTR-98-44A-T.  

Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Mr. Kiyeyeu, for the registrar.  

May we have the appearances of the parties, starting with the Prosecution, if you may, please, for the record? 
MS. OJEMENI: 
May it please Your Honours.  Ifeoma Ojemeni, trial attorney.  I appear with Dorothee Marotine, and in attendance, is Francis Kabwe and Eric Husketh.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

May we have also the appearance of the Defence for the record, if you may please?
MR. HINDS: 
Good morning, Your Honours.  Lennox Hinds representing Mr. Kajelijeli, assisted by Professor Bompaka, Juliette Chinaud, assistant, and Emilien Dusabe, as our interpreter.  

Your Honour, I noticed that we have some new equipment.  I don't know if it is designed to obfuscate me looking at the Court, but I can't see you and you can't see me with this equipment there.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Thank you very much, Learned Counsel.  We have noticed that.  We would try to see one another somehow.  Yes. 

We are at the stage of Rule 86, closing argument.  Does the Prosecution have any closing argument to make in the case?  If so, please go ahead, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, Your Honour, but this morning, we were served with the corrigendum on the Defence brief, and we are wondering what the Court's position is on this, whether the corrigendum will be accepted.  And if so, the Prosecution would need time to go through the corrigendum to know exactly what changes were made, because there are no notes on the corrections made in the corrigendum.  And by asking for time, this would assist us - - would more or less move the proceedings forward, because it would expedite our legal argument, but -- I mean, the closing arguments, but it depends on the convenience of the Court.  So, we should be asking for a short adjournment to go through the closing argument and determine what changes were made.
MR. HINDS: 
May I, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MR. HINDS: 
First of all, we would like to apologise to the Court and to the Prosecutor's Office for the timing on the corrigendum.  The Chamber knows that the Prosecutor's Office filed a corrigendum about three days after they filed their original brief.  We filed our corrigendum on Friday, and the Prosecutor's Office may have received it today.  We have a table of the corrections that were contained in the corrigendum.  The corrigendum does not contain any information that would, at least, prevent the Prosecution from proceeding.  However, we do not oppose an application made by the Prosecutor's Office.  If they would like a copy - - or time to take a look at the table of the changes that we have made, that table was filed with the Trial coordinator this morning and should be - - as we speak, copies should be made.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, the only reason for asking for a short adjournment is to enable us ascertain the changes made, and because I've made references to the paragraphs in the old brief and this will expedite the closing argument, if we are given just short time to know exactly what the changes are.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, we are -- we intend to proceed with these closing arguments today, and as you -- we recall the scheduling order.  If there are any matters that may arise from this kind of arrangements, they can only be addressed during the third day, but we will give the Prosecution and, indeed, all the parties, at least, who are not aware of the contents of the schedule that has been filed by the Defence with regard to the corrigendum of the closing -- of the Defence closing argument, we'll give -- we'll adjourn for 30 minutes to familiarise with what has been indicated in that table, to enable the Defence -- the Prosecution to -- maybe to make -- to note the pages, if there are any differences, so that they can  take note of them in their closing argument.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, as you speak now, we don't have the table of content, and 30 minutes would be rather too short.  I don't have it here.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Registry, make sure within three minutes or four minutes that document is available to the Prosecution.  

We remain within the time frame of 30 minutes.  We will give the Prosecution and everybody interested to know what is that in that document, 30 minutes.  

So, we'll adjourn these proceedings -- we'll adjourn for 30 minutes.  If there is any problem, we can always be notified.  We adjourn for 30 minutes, repeat, 30 minutes, to enable the Prosecution and all, indeed, the other parties to get a schedule and then we'll come back and proceed.  

So until then these proceedings stand adjourned.
	(Court recessed from 0920H to 1205H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the proceedings are called to order.  

Counsel made representation with regard to time frame we have given and we gave them this time and to begin the closing argument -- arguments now. 

Learned Counsel for the Prosecution, are you ready to start, Ms. Ojemeni?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Thank you, Your Honour.  

Your Honour, before I start, I will crave your indulgence to make a few corrections on my brief -- in my brief.  I will refer Your Honours to page 10 of the brief.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Sorry, which brief?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Corrigendum.
MR. PRESIDENT:
The corrigendum brief, okay 
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, Your Honour, that's what we are using this morning.  Prosecution, yes, that's the one we filed.  I will refer you to the footnote, footnote 26.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a minute, Counsel, I just want to locate.  

Yes, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Correction is on footnote 26.  There is no page number there.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a minute.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Do I go ahead, Your Honour?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Twenty-six.  It says "see page" -- that's what is missing.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Page 32, paragraph 133.  So insert "32, paragraph 133".  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
One --
MS. OJEMENI: 
- - three-three.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
And then the next one is footnote 27.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
There is also a missing page number there, which is 25.  See page 25, herein.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  So the page is what?

MS. OJEMENI: 
Twenty-five, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Twenty-five.  Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
And then footnote 28, to read "See page 25, paragraph 89 herein".
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Eighty-nine, herein.  Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
I refer you to page 60.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Six-zero?
MS. OJEMENI: 
No, before then, Your Honour, page 14, page 14.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page 14, yes. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
Thirteen and 14, but I'll take 13, first.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Paragraph 40.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Paragraph 40, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Of the last two lines of the last sentence, which reads, "Defence Witness FXB".  It should be "Defence Witness FMB".  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
F?
MS. OJEMENI:
MB.  The next one is page 14.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
The footnote, delete: see pages -- footnote 48, should be deleted.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Should be deleted? 
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Completely?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, completely.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI: 
The annexure mentioned therein is not -- would be handed in today as we go along.  And page -- the same page on footnote page 49, the last sentence there, which starts with "As repleted", which is jumbled, should be deleted completely up to the end.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI: 
Your Honour, we go on to page 20 -- paragraph 29 - - paragraph 290.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Which should be on page 60.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Two-nine-zero?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Just to delete the word "that" that is reflecting on the last paragraph, starting with "doubt" -- "Beyond reasonable doubt that the accused" -- no, it is correct, Your Honour.  It's page -- it's paragraph 293.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two-nine-three?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.  So - -
MS. OJEMENI:
Insert -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Where? 
MS. OJEMENI:
On second paragraph -- second line of 293, insert after the word "Stated".  I read the entire line.  It says: "The scenes of the crimes which they individually witnessed stated".  Now insert "That they have" -- "That they"; "that they", because "Have" is already there.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Stated?
MS. OJEMENI:
"Stated that they have known".
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
The same paragraph, the first pseudonym ,"GDD", should be deleted and "ACM" inserted.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
GDD taken out?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Insert? 
MS. OJEMENI:
ACM.
MR. PRESIDENT:
ACM; right.
MS. OJEMENI:
I have only two more corrections of names to be corrected, but I will do that as we go along.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Right. 
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Lords, without taking much of your -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe before you start, Counsel, just to put things in clear terms.  We'll put the time frames.  We'll have the closing argument -- your oral argument, Counsel, up to 1:00.  We would take the lunch break as we normally do at 1:00, and then resume at 2:30 in the afternoon, and then you will continue.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour.  Very well, Your Honour

MR. PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  Go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, I will not be taking much of your time, because you have sat through the trial of Juvenal Kajelijeli and listened to the 18 -- 13 witnesses presented by the Prosecution, including an investigator from the Office of the Prosecutor of this Tribunal, and 28 Defence witnesses, including the Accused and an alleged expert.  

In addition, Your Honours, you have before you the indictment, all the exhibits tendered by the parties, both the Prosecution and the Defence, the summary motions decided upon by your good selves, the transcripts of all these witnesses, and the closing briefs filed by the Prosecution and the Defence.  

Therefore, my duty today, Your Honours, is to guide you through the salient points in the Prosecution evidence that established beyond reasonable doubt, the guilt of Juvenal Kajelijeli in Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9, in the indictment.  

Your Honours, this Tribunal was established as a response to the gross and massive violations of international humanitarian law that occurred in Rwanda in 1994.  The single and clear purpose of this Tribunal was to prosecute the perpetrators so as to halt and effectively redress these violations and restore peace and unity in the Republic of Rwanda and the world at large, as envisaged by 
Resolution 955 adopted by the Security Council of United Nations.  

Your Honours, it is difficult for the mind to come to grips with the massacre, cruelties and inhumanities perpetrated on members of the Tutsi population and moderate Hutus by the Accused, his 
co-conspirators, and others throughout Rwanda between April and July 1994, which claimed the lives of more than 500 Tutsis, with their property, either destroyed or stolen by these men of no conscience.  The sheer enormity of the ruins is so beyond ordinary human experience and comprehension that there is no easy contest in which to begin evaluating the Accused's misdeeds, assess blame, and then move on to assign punishment.  The rate at which these deeds were perpetrated throughout Rwanda and, in particular, in the communes of Mukingo, Nkuli, Kigombe, Kinigi and their neighbouring communes in Ruhengeri préfecture between 7 and 14 April 1994, is beyond human imagination.  

However, outrageous these crimes are, Your Honours, the duty of the Court and all of us assisting it in this trial process, is to weigh the evidence dispassionately and come to a fair and just conclusion.  If by the process of this trial we convict an innocent man for these crimes, we would, ourselves, have committed further injustice, both to the Accused and the international community as a whole.  I, as an individual, and the office that I represent, share the highest ethical and professional standard and would seek to convict -- will not seek to convict an innocent man just for the sake of sentencing in this case.  

In the present case, Your Honours, the Prosecution submits that it has proved far beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused rightly stands guilty to the heinous deeds with which he is charged.  

Your Honours, having made this introductory remark, I will now move on to my brief to set - - to perform the duty for which I am before you.  Your Honour, the Prosecution has given sufficient and adequate notice to the Accused in the indictment dated 25th January 2000.  I need not belabour you with the history of this indictment, but it is as set out in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6.  And may I correct myself, the date of the indictment is 25th January 2001, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Twenty?
MS. OJEMENI:
-- fifth January 2001.  I will be referring to this indictment and the -- my brief, as I go along.  I will therefore draw your attention to the relevant paragraphs in the brief and the indictment.  I will make an oral presentation to supplement the brief.  Your Honour, I will refer you to paragraph 5.1 of the indictment, the concise statements of facts.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Paragraph?
MS. OJEMENI: 
Five point one on page 8 of the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI: 
And paragraph 7 -- and paragraph 8 of the brief.  This paragraph is on the power base of the MRND.  Your Honour, there is no doubt that the MRND has its stronghold -- had its stronghold in Ruhengeri préfecture, which is in northern Rwanda.  The Prosecution submits that it's common knowledge that President Habyarimana was the president of MRND from 1973 to 1991, and he was from Ruhengeri préfecture.  Defence witness -- a Defence witness, Joseph Nzirorera, testified to this fact.  

I draw your attention to -- Your Honours' attention to page 40 of transcript dated 2nd December 2000, where Joseph Nzirorera admitted that MRND had majority of its members in northern region of Rwanda, which is the Ruhengeri préfecture where he comes from.  So there is no doubt that MRND 
- - or, rather, that Ruhengeri préfecture had its -- was historically a power base for the MRND.  Similarly, Mukingo commune, as represented in paragraph 8 of our brief, being in northern area of Rwanda, was also a power base of the MRND, which is the commune where the Accused, Juvenal Kajelijeli, comes from.  

Your Honour, we draw your attention to paragraph 5.2 of the indictment on page 8 still.  And in support of this factual allegation that the Accused's relationship with such an influential figure, as Joseph Nzirorera, enabled him to flout the local authorities, carry out atrocities against the Tutsi population and avoid any criminal sanctions.  Your Honours, we refer you to paragraph 8.  We are now dealing with the relevant paragraphs in support of our brief, paragraphs 8 -- 8, 9, 22, 23, 26, 27.  Your Honours, Joseph Nzirorera testified on behalf of the Accused, and when he was asked if the Accused was a good friend of his, he retorted and said that the Accused was a peer from the same commune.  When he was further confronted with the fact that the Accused deposed to an affidavit before this Tribunal in which he state -- he averred that Joseph Nzirorera was his benefactor, he quickly changed his story and said he was a friend he had known for long.  Your Honours, Kajelijeli, also, in response to a question put to him whether Joseph Nzirorera was a friend, he similarly said, "He was my neighbour.  We are from the same commune."
	(Pages 1 to 10 by Haruna Farage) 






















1230H 
MS. OJEMENI:
Joseph Nzirorera also admitted that, perhaps, maybe the relationship or the special relationship that the Prosecution had asserted that they had, could be linked to the fact that they were neighbours.  A man of that status, using such description to draw inference of the fact that they had special close ties, is rather unbelievable or unreasonable.  

It then follows that there was something that was being hidden in their response -- in their responses.  There was something that they were hiding.  The Prosecution submits, Your Honours, that from the evidence led before this Court, there were ample evidence to the fact that they were friends, and Juvénal Kajelijeli, with his low educational background, rose to the vantage position of a bourgmestre.  Your Honours will recall that when the Accused testified before this Tribunal in his -- during his cross-examination, it became obvious that the Accused did not complete his secondary school as he had previously admitted or asserted in his direct, that he completed his secondary school, and even had speciality in economics.  On further examination on the evidence before this -- Your Honours, it was also apparent that the Accused did not, in fact, complete his secondary -- did not even go to secondary school, but he finished his primary school that went on to Busogo parish where he became a carpenter; a position he was in, when virtually all the witnesses who testified in this case knew him, and that was in 1971.  Your Honours, we refer you to paragraph 22 of the brief in respect of the: educational background of the Accused.  

To further prove that the Accused had close ties with Joseph Nzirorera, the Prosecution relies on Exhibits 32 and 33, which is evidence which was admitted through the Accused, and it is an evidence of the Accused's account in Cotonou -- which he opened in Cotonou in the name of Nzirorera when he was in exile.  He was using this account to solicit for funds, and it was testified to by the Accused.  It is not common for somebody to open an account with just a friend or open an account in the name of an ordinary friend or just a member of a commune, or a neighbour.  There must be special relationship; there must be trust; there must be confidence.  It is not just another ordinary relationship, there is much more than that.  

Your Honours, we recall that it is also in evidence that Accused was arrested in the house of Joseph Nzirorera in 1998.  All the witnesses that testified to this part, that they are friends, could not have been lying.  They had no motive to say so.  

I will draw your attention, Your Honours, to the testimony of GBV, Prosecution witness, on page 38 of 17 July 2001.  There, he described Joseph Nzirorera as a minister, and also described the relationship between the Accused and Joseph Nzirorera, to the effect that they are friends.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Yes, what is that page?  Is it --
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 38.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Transcripts?
MS. OJEMENI:
Transcripts, yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Of July 17, 2001.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  All right.
MS. OJEMENI:
I also refer you to the transcript of the same -- of GBE now, dated 9 July 2001, at page 68, where he said that he saw the Accused and Joseph Nzirorera quite often together, in particular, in their area, "And I usually came to his mother's home where the Accused would meet with him." 

Your Honours will recall that the Accused, in his testimony, denied the fact that Joseph Nzirorera came --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Thank you.  

Yes, Counsel, it has been suggested by the registry that whenever you mention the pages of the transcripts that you are referring to, maybe you should also indicate -- go further and indicate whether it is in English or French, for the purpose of clarity with regard to the actual tracing of these references, if need be, in future.
MS. OJEMENI:
Thank you, Your Honours.  And, for that purpose, may I then say that I speak only English and I am relying on English transcripts.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Maybe for the avoidance of that, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
And please, Judge Ramaroson, excuse me for that.  I assure you next time I will be speaking French.  

Your Honours, I refer you to another witness's testimony, GBH, Prosecution witness, GBH, on 
page 106, transcript of July 17th, 2001, where he stated that Nzirorera and Kajelijeli walked like one person.  What else do we need?  What other evidence do we need?  Here is a man who has known the Accused right from when he was a young child.  It was common knowledge that the Accused and Joseph Nzirorera were very close friends.  They were very, very close, like husband and wife more or less.  And if he could be described as -- they could be described as one person, what other corroborative evidence do we need from people who have known the two since their childhood.  And Mukingo commune, being like every other African commune, and, in fact, the whole world in locality, an influential man like Joseph Nzirorera who has been a member of the MRND, as a political stalwart in MRND party and a minister, secretary of MRND, and national speaker of the interim government, and then the Accused who had been their bourgmestre for five years, from 1988 to 1993, and then an accountant from 1981 to 1988.  Such a man would be well-known; his affairs would become knowledge.  Your Honours, the Prosecution submits that there is, indeed, a very close relationship between the Accused and Joseph Nzirorera.

And, of course, when he was in need, whom did he run to? Joseph Nzirorera, all the way to Cotonou.  He accommodated him.  When he needed somebody to come and bail him out from the court, he called on his bosom friend, Joseph Nzirorera.  And he testified, fabricated lies, which I will draw your attention to in a minute.  Your Honours, there is ample evidence on this issue.  I will also refer you to GDD, Prosecution witness, transcript of October 3rd, 2001 at page 60.  I will not belabour Your Honours with this, but there are also similar representation on same transcript, pages 61, 72, 82 and 89.  Your Honour, I will take it further to show how close these two are. 

Your Honour, in the course of the evidence of Joseph Nzirorera, he represented to this Court, which is trite, that the 1994 -- the interim government operated under the 1991 constitution and, in fact, all the actions taken by that government conformed with the provisions of that constitution.  It therefore follows that the appointment of a bourgmestre will also follow the provisions of that constitution.  For this purpose, the Prosecution draws the Court's attention to the law that governs the appointment of bourgmestres in 1994, which is, laws of the communes -- "Laws on the Organisation of Communes," law of 23rd November 1963, as amended on 26th September 1974 and 30 November 1975.  These are the amendments.  

Under Articles 38 of this law, it is enacted that bourgmestres are appointed by the president on recommendation of the minister of the interior.  Your Honour, the thrust of this provision is that a bourgmestre is appointed and not elected, as was represented to this Court by the Defence through Nzirorera and the Accused himself.  

I draw the Court's attention to page 71 of the transcript of 3rd December 2002 wherein, in response to a question put to Joseph Nzirorera on cross on whether he knew if the Accused was appointed or elected - no, if he was appointed as a bourgmestre in 1994.  He retorted and said, Accused was elected or maybe appointed, but that he was not the one who appointed him.  That was not the issue.  The issue was whether he was appointed or elected.  A man of that standing in the Rwandan government or Rwandan society should know which procedure that was followed.  He went on to deny that he influenced the appointment in any way as he -- because he was not the bourgmestre - sorry, the minister of the interior, and that it was the minister of the interior that appointed him, he claimed.  But he kept on using the word appointment, appointment, appointment.  He could have said elected.  

He then went on to say that, "I was short-listing" that the Accused was short-listed or selected by a technical committee. Your Honours, the Prosecution submits that short-listing or selection is a process of appointment and not a process of electioneering, because for elections you do primaries, the populace will elect you and not a committee.  But at some point in his evidence, he stated that those -- the bourgmestres who were removed as a result of the negotiation with the RPF, pursuant to the Arusha Accord, that they complained -- and the government then requested that something should be done.  But he didn't go to say whether those ones were appointed or elected.

The plausible conclusion, Your Honours, is that Joseph Nzirorera was being evasive because he had something, he did not want to tell the truth.  He did not want to admit the fact that he influenced the appointment of his bosom friend to compensate him for executing their plan to eliminate Tutsis in Mukingo commune, and to say thank you for a job well done.  Your Honour, the Prosecutor then submits that the evidence of Joseph Nzirorera in this respect should be disregarded because he is biased and he has fabricated lies.  

Your Honour, the Prosecution therefore submits that given the Accused's low education, he could not have risen to the position of a bourgmestre of Mukingo commune in 1988 when he was appointed.  But let me come to the interim -- to the temporal jurisdiction of this Court.  In 1994, he couldn't have been there but for the help of his good friend, Joseph Nzirorera, who was in the scheme of affairs who was then the national speaker of the government.  And this is the Prosecution's case in this respect. 

Your Honours, I will move on to paragraph 5.3, and part of paragraph 5.2 that I have I just dealt with will be taken under 5.3 regarding the carrying out of atrocities against the Tutsis.  Your Honour -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Five point three of which document, is it the --
MS. OJEMENI:
The indictment, Your honour, I am so sorry -- of the indictment.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, it is important to spell out for the purposes of the record.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  

Now, we are on 5.3 of the indictment.  Your Honours, this -- 5.3 reads:  "From April through July 1994, many Tutsi men, women and children were attacked, abducted, raped, massacred in their residences and at their places of shelter within the Mukingo commune or arrested, detained and later murdered."  The Accused commanded, organised, supervised and participated in these attacks.  

Your Honours, we have amply dealt with this paragraph in our brief.  I refer Your Honours to the background information first, which is on page 11 of the brief, and starting from paragraph 30.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Page?  Starting from?
MS. OJEMENI:
Page -- from paragraph 30, Your Honour, of the brief.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
It is the Prosecution's case that the Accused was a member of MRND from 1988 up to when they left -- he fled from Rwanda in July 1994.  The Prosecution, Your Honour, has led evidence, ample evidence on this.  I will refer you to the testimony of Witness GBV at paragraph 93 of transcript of July 4th, where GBV stated that the Accused --
MR. PRESIDENT:
July 4th of which year?
MS. OJEMENI:
Two thousand and one, 2001.  It is in the brief, actually; it is on page -- paragraph 32, likewise paragraph 31.  In fact, on this issue of the MRND, the Prosecution has amply represented the fact that the Accused was MRND member, and not just an MRND member, an active one, and an important member of MRND.  And we are relying on the evidence that we have in this brief, starting from paragraph 30 to 40 of the brief, testified to by Witness GBE, GBV, GDD, GAO.  All these witnesses, Your Honour, have nothing in common.  They are all from different professions.  They have known the Accused for long and are all members of Mukingo, with the exception of GDD who is a member of Nkuli commune.  

Your Honours, in paragraph 25 of this brief, we have represented the fact that the Accused maintained two homes. At least in 1994, and well before 1994, the Accused maintained two homes having been married to two wives.  He had a home in Nkuli commune, which was very close to the Nkuli communal office, another home in Mukingo commune, which was situated within Rwinzovu secteur, an adjoining secteur to Busogo secteur and in the same secteur where Munyemvano's home -- which we will come to in a minute, one of the massacres sites is -- was and still is today, but, of course, as represented in evidence, with no house standing there.  

And it is also in the same secteur, his own -- is also in the same secteur where Busogo parish, which is another massacre site, is situated.  And all this we have explained in - - or represented in paragraph 25 of the brief.

Your Honour, at this point, may I crave your indulgence to make just one correction in a name which is in paragraph - on page 5, paragraph F.  The name Rachel there should read Joyce - five, starting from paragraph 5 -- starting from the last line of that paragraph, the third line or the last sentence, "Shortly" --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which page?
MS. OJEMENI:
We are talking of page 9, paragraph 5, and we are on one, two, three, four, five starting from the top, line 5, page 9 of the brief.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Page 9 of the closing brief?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, paragraph F.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Paragraph F, okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
The name should read Joyce and not Rachel.  It is properly reflected in another paragraph in this brief.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It should read what?
MS. OJEMENI:
The brief at page 9, paragraph F, the name Joyce in paragraph -- Rachel in paragraph F shall be changed to Joyce, spelled J-O-U -- J-O-Y-C-E -- J-O-Y-C-E. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Right.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, looking at the time it is 1:00, let me but - permit me to just make one submission --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- on the issue of appointment which I did not draw the Court's attention to.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
And it is in respect of the testimony of Witness GB --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
GB?
MS. OJEMENI:
GBE -- GBH, sorry, Your Honour, GBH.  Your Honour, may I correct myself once more: GBE, GBE; the pseudonyms are usually confusing.  And it is in respect of a meeting -- the transcript, relevant transcript is July 17th of 2001 and is at page 106.  GBE testified that Joseph Nzirorera, in 1994, called a meeting whereby he told them that the Accused would be their bourgmestre, and to use the exact word that he said in respect of this, he said, "I do recall Joseph Nzirorera organised a meeting and at that meeting Kajelijeli was introduced to us, and we were told that he was the one who again will become bourgmestre."  This, is in furtherance to our submission that Kajelijeli was appointed bourgmestre and not elected, and then, secondly, that Joseph Nzirorera influenced his appointment as bourgmestre; he more or less imposed him on the community, and not elected as the Accused had alleged.  

On this point, Your Honour, I presume this is a convenient time to take the break.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Counsel.  We will take a - we'll take an adjournment, the lunch adjournment, and resume our work at half past two in the afternoon, half past two.  So, until then, these proceedings start adjourned. 
(Court recessed from 1305H to 1437H)
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes, the proceedings are resumed.  

Yes, please continue, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Before we adjourned, Your Honours, we were on MRND, and I had drawn the Court's attention to the testimony of all our witnesses in respect of that assertion, and I just crave your indulgence to pose one question, which is:  Why should all these witnesses say that the Accused was an MRND -- was an MRND member, if he was not?  Why should they say so, and why should the Accused deny that he was not a member?  But, of course, Your Honours, the Accused in paragraph -- on paragraph -- on page 31 on transcript of 22 April, line 35, admitted that he was a member of MRND up to the time he left office.  He had denied that until the question was posed to him, and he said there that, "Yes, I was a member up to 1993 when I left office."  So this corroborates the wife's evidence that he was a member up to 1993, and I am referring to this -- LMRI, the testimony of Witness LMRI.

But Joseph Nzirorera denied all through that the Accused was a member.  Somewhere down the line of his evidence he stated -- or when he was first asked if he knew whether the Accused was a member of the MRND, he stated that he was not a member, at least of the new MRND; that was the way he put it.  And he was called to testify that he was not a member.  That still goes to the fact that he was trying to hide that fact from the Court and protect his friend.  All the witnesses also called by the Accused, represented that fact; they all denied it.  

Your Honour, it is the submission of the Prosecution that we have proved beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was a member of MRND up to the time he left Rwanda.  And it is also the submission of the Prosecution that the Accused was, indeed, an active member of MRND and a member of the préfectural committee, contrary to the assertion of his good friend, Joseph Nzirorera.  

Your Honours, GDD testified to the fact that the Accused was, indeed, a member of the préfectural committee and went further to state that usually after such elections, the people who won would be -- the names of the people who won will be published in national newspapers.  So, it was common knowledge who was a member and who was not.  And Joseph Nzirorera also admitted this fact that, indeed, the names were usually published in the newspapers.  

GDD went further to say that he was, indeed, at the meeting where the Accused was elected as a member of the préfectural committee.  But of course, Joseph Nzirorera, being a good friend, would not want the friend to be convicted if there are actions that flow from his membership, as we have alleged, as a member of MRND.  Hence, he came here with a bag of lies to say that the friend was not a member.  And in any event, he tendered a document according to him, we are alleging that the Accused was a founding member, when in actual fact, we never said so.  It will only be relevant if we are alleging that the Accused was a founder of MRND, but the Prosecution's case is that the Accused was an active member of MRND in Mukingo commune and a member of the préfectural committee of MRND at the Ruhengeri préfectural level.  And, indeed, the witness, that's Joseph Nzirorera, admitted that he was elected, he was a member of the prefectural committee right from 1981.  And it was at the same time that our witnesses also allege that they were appointed -- both of them were appointed and introduced to members of the populace as the member of the préfectural committee.  And our own evidence is that in 1991 the Accused was still a member, and in 1994 he was still a member of the préfectural committee, and most people saw him when he was elected in 1992.  

Your Honour, we -- I draw the -- Your Honours' -- I have already drawn your attentions to the relevant paragraphs in the brief.  Now, I will move on to -- still on paragraph 5.3 of the indictment.  We allege there that - or, rather, it is the Prosecution's case that the Accused organised, supervised and participated in the attacks.  How did the Accused organise these attacks?  Your Honours, I draw your attention to paragraphs amply establishing in this brief that the Accused was instrumental to the formation of Interahamwe.  And it's in evidence that the Interahamwes were used as vehicle to commit the attacks on Tutsi population in 1994.  

Initially, the Interahamwe, the purpose we've also established in evidence, was to be used to attack political -- other political parties.  It was later extended to RPF members of who were mostly Tutsi -- members of Tutsi ethnic group.  Later, it was now -- RPF was also extended to the members of the Tutsi ethnic group.  We have amply established how members of Tutsi ethnic group later were considered as RPF accomplices.  And I will refer you, Your Honours, to the relevant paragraphs.  Your Honours, I draw your attention to paragraphs -- with your kind permission, Your Honours, paragraphs 41 and 42 of the brief.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Of the brief?  Forty-one and 42.
MS. OJEMENI:
Forty-two of the brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Forty-two or 41? 
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.  And the title of these paragraphs, the heading -- that is on page 14 of the brief.  The title is:  "The Accused and Joseph Nzirorera are the founders and leaders of Interahamwe and Amahindire group".  And Joseph Nzirorera financed the group through the Accused.  We've also --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Is that 42?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, 42, page 14.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  Oh, okay.  Right, yes.  You were reading the title.  I was trying to see the title within paragraph 42; it's not there, it's at the top.  
MS. OJEMENI:
Okay, Your Honour. 

We have established within these paragraphs, the two paragraphs, that the term "Inyenzi" and "Inkotanyi", and it is also in evidence, that the terms were interchangeably used to widely describe the Tutsis.  Initially, it was a term that referred -- that was used to refer to the RPF, and many of the witnesses testified to this fact.  I will draw your attention to the testimony of Witness GBB, Your Honours, where he talked about a meeting to sensitise the population, which was held in Mukingo commune, and the purpose of the meeting was to fight persons -- is in paragraph 94 of transcript of July 4, 2001.  And the persons who were called - the people who were to be fought were called Inyenzi, and he stated that Inyenzi was used to refer to Tutsi.  

GBG also, a Prosecution witness --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Just a minute, Counsel.  Any problem?
Mr. HINDS:
Yes, Your Honour.  I am just trying to follow the testimony and I -- my learned counsel said paragraph 95.  I am just trying to find out is it paragraph 95 or it is page 95?
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I think she said paragraph 94 in the transcript of 4th July.
MR. HINDS:
But there are no paragraphs in the transcripts.  I am not quite sure what --
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I am sorry.  I am referring to pages.  I am sorry, my learned friend, I am referring to pages.  It was a slip of the tongue.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  So it's page 94 --
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 95.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ninety-five.
MS. OJEMENI:
Open session, because I realise I have been -- I have not been mentioning that.  It is bound to --
MR. PRESIDENT: 
To cause problems, yes. 
MS. OJEMENI:
-- cause problems, Your Honours.  Of July 4th.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Two thousand and --
MS. OJEMENI:
Two thousand and one, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am merely supplementing my brief.  I have already stated the evidence we are relying on in the brief, but I am supplementing it, just in case.
MR. PRESIDENT: 
It is important because we may be using these transcripts that are being made now in trying to look for these things later.  So, I think it is good that the proper citation is made for people to be able to follow them up and be able to identify them later.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, go on please.
MS. OJEMENI:
I draw Your Honours' attention again to the testimony of GBG in the transcript of 12th July 2001 at page 339.  He also described -- talked about a meeting where Tutsis were described as Inyenzi, and he quickly made an exit because his colleagues or classmates had pointed at him as another Tutsi and, therefore, his life was in danger, he had to make a quicker - disappearance.

I also refer to the testimony of Witness GAO at page 24 of 23rd July 2001, where he categorically stated ethnic original of people killed were Tutsi, and they were called -- sorry, Your Honour.  Where he talked about a song that they, the Interahamwes, were singing, and in that song they were referring to Tutsis as Inyenzi, and the song in Rwandan language is a well-known song of "Tuba tsembe tsembe," which in English means:  "Let us exterminate the Inyenzi.  Let us exterminate the accomplices, and let us exterminate Kagame."  All pointing to the Tutsi. 

Now, Your Honour, why am I making references to the Tutsi when I am talking about Interahamwes?  I am doing so because the Interahamwe is in evidence that Tutsis were killed in 1994, and most of the people that killed the Tutsis -- or the people that killed the Tutsis were Interahamwes, and they were Hutus.  The Interahamwes, as I stated earlier, were subordinates or -- subordinates of the Accused, and we have established in evidence that the Accused and Nzirorera formed Interahamwe.  And for the formation of the Interahamwe and the Accused's participation in the formation, I refer Your Honours to the testimonies of GDD.  GDD was a member of -- an active member he called himself of Interahamwe.  And he was also a leader of the Interahamwe in Nkuli commune.  And he confessed to the killings of Tutsis.  He further testified as to how this killing was prepared, or how it was organised, and the Accused's participation in the killing.  And, in fact, he testified that he - their Interahamwes were used by the Accused to perpetuate the killing.  

I will refer Your Honours to the testimony of GDD on formation of this Interahamwe and the Accused's involvement in the formation, as a leader and founder of Interahamwe.  I refer you, Your Honours, to page 92 -- pages 92 to 93, open session transcripts of 2nd October 2001.  In these extracts he talked about how the Interahamwes were trained, and in Nkuli commune Interahamwes were also referred to as Amahindires, and likewise in Mukingo commune.  

I also refer you to GDD's testimony again, open session, 3rd October 2001, page 14, still on the same issue.  And in this extract on this page, he testified that there was no member of the Tutsi ethnic group in the Interahamwe organisation; that it was (sic) all Hutu in 1994.  

He also talked about the training of Interahamwes, which the Accused also participated in.  GDD also testified how the Accused and some other people, Hutus -- notable Hutu members of the populace of Nkuli and Mukingo commune, like Shaddrachk Sendugu, Joseph Nzirorera, influenced him to train the youths that he was in charge of in Nkuli commune.  His testimony on this also could be found on page 16 of 3rd October transcript, October 2001, open session.  Likewise, 94, 96 of 2nd October 2001, and 14, 3rd October 2001.  In the latter reference, he described how Joseph Nzirorera, the Accused, another member of the Hutu population, called Karorero, Sendugu, Shaddrachk, then the president of the MRND in Nkuli, and some other members of Nkuli commune, got him to train the boys on the use of arms; the military training that he gave the youths that he was teaching how to play football and literacy. 

Your Honours, I take it further to the testimony of GBV.  GBV testified that Interahamwe had a branch in Mukingo commune, and Kajelijeli, he described as the person in charge of the training and of Interahamwe in Mukingo commune.  I am referring to his testimony on page 97 of 4th July, 2001.
	(Pages 11 to 22 by Petrus Chijarira)








	1500H
MS. OJEMENI:
On July 9th, 2001, pages 66 to 67, still talking about how MRND was formed.  On this page of -- pages 66 to 67, GDD placed it as -- Interahamwe as being formed in 1991 or beginning of '92 and talked about how he went to a meeting in Ruhengeri préfecture where the president of -- the then president, President Habyarimana of Rwanda appointed -- I mean mentioned -- introduced the Interahamwes and mentioned that the Accused led Interahamwes to the place.  But he said he was not sure of the date, but put it at 1991 or beginning of 1992. 

But, Your Honours, we have in evidence through GAO that Interahamwe was actually formed in Mukingo in 1993.  Likewise, the leader of Interahamwe who testified on behalf of the Defence also put the formation of the Interahamwe in Mukingo commune at - I mean at 1999 --1993 as well, but went further to say that the Accused had no role to play.  What does one expect from such an accomplice, who is a 
self-confessed convict?  It is expected that he will hide or lie to protect his indomitable boss.  

Your Honours, still on this issue, I refer you to GBV, the testimony of GBV, and I will not waste the time of this Court by going further to talk about the content of these paragraphs.  So, I will just make reference to -- quick reference to the relevant paragraphs.  

GBG (sic), page 75 of transcript of July 9th, 2001, closed session, and also July 9th, page 66 -- July 9, 2000, page 66 to 67.  Your Honour, may I crave your indulgence to change -- to correct a reference that I gave earlier.  The reference to the setting up of Interahamwe at the end of 1991 or at the beginning of 1992 was actually the testimony of GBE, not GBV and could be found in the transcript of July 9th, 2001 at page 66 to 67.  

GBE testified, in addition to what the other witnesses had testified, that the Accused is somebody who has money, and was using the vehicle that belonged to a school, and went on to talk about how he set up the Interahamwe is in evidence that the Accused was using the vehicle of the ESTB.  And GBE also placed him as somebody who had money or anything at his disposal.  

I move on to the testimony of GBG.  At page 39 of transcript of 12 July 2001, still on formation of Interahamwe and the Accused's involvement in the formation of Interahamwe in Mukingo commune.  

GBH also placed the Accused as a leader and founder of Interahamwe movement, he calls it.  This could be found at page 108 of July 17th, 2001.  Likewise, GAO, who also was a member of the Interahamwe, and who has also confessed that he participated in the killing of Tutsis in Mukingo commune in 1994, and I will be coming to the myth of his testimony later in my -- as I go along in my submission.  But at this page, he also corroborated other witnesses' testimonies to the fact that he --the Accused, was the founder and leader of Interahamwe branch in Mukingo.  And as a matter of fact, the Accused issued him with an ID as a member of MRND when he qualified as an Interahamwe after the military training in 1993.  He testified to being trained to fire - trained in the handling of firearms and other weapons, and according to him, he wondered why the association that they were told was for fighting the enemy to protect the populace, all of sudden turned and started killing the Tutsi families in Mukingo commune, and he had no choice than to obey the order of the boss of Interahamwe, who is the Accused Juvénal Kajelijeli, and participated in the killing of Tutsis in 1994. 

Your Honour, we have ample evidence as well, that the Accused, Juvénal Kajelijeli, was in control of Interahamwe.  GDD testified to that fact and went further to say that he was the spokesman of Joseph Nzirorera, his bosom friend, as we have established in evidence.  

This -- I refer Your Honours to page 86 of October 2nd, 2001.  At this page he also testified as to how the Accused assisted in the procurement of weapons for use by the Interahamwe, particularly in 1994. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 86? 
MS. OJEMENI:
It is page 86 of transcript of October 2nd, 2001. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
GBV also testified at pages 98 to 99 of July 4th, 2001.  GBV was a member of the cellule committee, and he asserted that it was on that basis that he was informed of his testimony to this Honourable Chamber that the Accused was a leader and founder of Interahamwe.  And he went on to say that Interahamwe had branches at the local levels, the cellules, the secteurs, and he was well informed as a member of the cellule committee. 

I refer Your Honours to the testimony of GBE, again, once more, of 9th July 2001, at page 68 and page 75 closed session, both are closed sessions.  GBH 17, 45, 46; 17, 2001 at pages 45 and 46.  And here he talked about how the Accused gave instructions, how he witnessed that to the Interahamwe and how he supervised the Interahamwes.  He also, at pages 63 to 64 of the same transcript of 7th July 2001, testified that the Accused was an influential personality, and by that, he is referring --  he referred to him as a leader of Interahamwe. 

Your Honours, there is ample evidence on that.  And Your Honours have the transcripts before you, and the submission of the Prosecution is that the Accused is no doubt, no doubt the leader of Interahamwe and we proved this fact beyond any reasonable doubt. 

On that note, Your Honour, I move on to paragraphs -- I refer Your Honours to paragraphs 41 to 46, in furtherance of the Prosecution's case that he was -- the Accused was the leader and founder of Interahamwe.  That's paragraph 41 to 46 of the closing brief.  

It is also established, Your Honours, that the Accused participated in the training of Interahamwes, military training.  He participated, he organised, and as GDD said, that he was the spokesman of Joseph Nzirorera, and we have at least established in evidence that he was a close ally of Joseph Nzirorera, who was the national secretary of MRND.  The Accused was able to acquire uniforms, through the assistance of Joseph Nzirorera for, the Interahamwes.  

And, Your Honours, I refer you to paragraphs 57 to 60 of our closing brief.  And as expected, the Defence's position is that there was no such uniform.  However, I ask again, why should all the Prosecution witnesses say that there was uniform, even an old woman like GDD?  All these Prosecution witnesses are from various professions, they have nothing in common.  They testified before Your Honours that there was no motivation; all they were after was to see that justice is done in this case. 

Your Honours, I refer you to the ample evidence we have -- you have before you in the transcripts.  I refer you to the transcripts in respect of testimony of GDF, who was a rape victim.  When she was accounting -- recounting or testifying before Your Honours as to how she was raped by the Interahamwe on the 10th of April 1994, which we will get to in a minute, she also mentioned that she recognised that those people were Interahamwe because they wore uniform.  

I refer Your Honours to paragraph 73 of -- sorry, page 73 of open session of July 10th, 2001.  GAO, who himself was an Interahamwe, also admitted in evidence before the Court, sworn evidence, that they had uniform as Interahamwes.  

Defence called RGM, who was the leader of the Interahamwe, an accomplice, who testified that there was no such uniform.  Of course, naturally it is expected.  It is expected that RGM would lie to save the leader.  

Your Honours, I refer you to the testimony of GBV, who had lived all his life in Mukingo commune and saw the Interahamwes' uniforms.  I refer you also at page 47 of transcript of 5th July 2001, GAO, transcript of 23rd July, 56 --  GBV again - GBE, sorry, GBE's transcript of 9th July 2001 at page 67;  GBG at page 49, transcript of 16th July 2001 at page 49, transcript of 16th July 2001, still in open session.  GBH again at page or pages 54 and 66 of 17th July 2001.  GDO at page 18 -- page 62, sorry, of 18th July 2001; GAO, once more, at page 56 -- pages 56, 31, 32 of transcript of 23rd July 2001.  GDD, who himself was a leader of Interahamwe, also testified that the Interahamwe had a uniform, and mentioned -- also testified as to how they got it, that it was Nzirorera who sent it to them through the Accused.  And he knew about this, because:  One, he was at the meeting where this issue of uniform was discussed.  

In 1993, a meeting held at Isimbi, that I will come to in a minute, which was the headquarters of Interahamwe in Mukingo commune and the meeting was for leaders of MRND -- of Interahamwe, I am sorry, in Nkuli -- Interahamwes of Nkuli commune and Mukingo commune.  And Nzirorera made a promise to deliver the uniforms which was eventually delivered to the president of MRND in Nkuli commune.  And GDD, because of his close relationship with -- and association with the president of MRND, got to know when it was delivered.  Apart from being at the meeting, he was also -- he also knew when it was delivered.  What other evidence does one need?  On that note, Your Honour, I need not go further on this issue of uniform.  And it is the Prosecution's case that on this issue of uniform, whether Interahamwe had uniforms, it has proved beyond reasonable that doubt a uniform indeed existed, as testified by its witnesses before this Honourable Court. 

Your Honours, as regards distribution of these uniforms, GAO at page 93 and 94 of the transcript of July 24th, 2001, testified to the Accused distributing these uniforms to the Interahamwes.  Likewise, GBG also testified and lit up on Nzirorera's involvement in the distribution of uniform.  

GAO also linked up at that particular page, the pages that I have made reference to earlier that I mean, the relationship of Nzirorera with the Accused on the issue of distribution of the uniforms.  And GBG's testimony is at pages 37 and 38 of transcript of 12th July 2001.  The two witnesses linked Joseph Nzirorera and the Accused on the issue of distribution of witnesses (sic).  According to them, Joseph Nzirorera provides the uniforms and the Accused distributes to the boys -- to the Interahamwes.
 MR. PRESIDENT:
Distribution of what, Counsel?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Uniforms of the Interahamwe. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, I move on to the headquarters of Interahamwe.  In Mukingo commune, the headquarters of Interahamwes was at Isimbi building, A building in the Byangabo commercial centre.  The Prosecution's case is that this building was owned by Joseph Nzirorera, and there was a flag in front of the house signifying the presence of Interahamwes at the building, and also the fact that the Interahamwe initially was the youth wing of MRND, and that in the evenings -- in the mornings the Interahamwes would come, lift the flag and in the morning they would come and also pull the flag down, so a flag was actually hoisted there.  And we have testimonies of GBG, who as a child, not really a child, a youth, saw the flag being hoisted there.  And other Prosecution witnesses have since testified to that fact.  and - Your Honour, two minutes, please.  There has been ample evidence before Your Honours to the effect that this building was used for the Interahamwe's meetings.  And training also was held -- the training of Interahamwes was also conducted in the compound of the building.  And there were also a bar located in the compound or within the building where Joseph Nzirorera and the Accused entertained the Interahamwes from time to time.

I refer Your Honours to the training of the Interahamwes in that regard.  I refer you to the testimony of GAO.  It could be found at page 24 -- pages 24, 54, 55 of 23rd July 2001.  These extracts establish --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Transcripts?  
MS. OJEMENI:
Transcripts, Your Honours.  Transcripts, open session -as well - testify -- these extracts -- the evidence in these extract establish that the Accused was involved in the training of the Interahamwes, and he did this in concert with one Chief Warrant Officer Karorero.  There was also one Dusabe, which is also in evidence that he was an Interahamwe.  He was a leader, he was an ex-soldier and he was Nzirorera's brother.  

I refer you to also to transcripts of GDD regarding the training of Interahamwe as well as in Nkuli commune and this could be found at pages 36, 95 of 2nd October 2001; 4th October at page 48 and 49.  This is also an involvement of the Accused in the training of Interahamwe in the Mukingo in Nkuli commune.  And for the training also, I refer Your Honours to the transcript - sorry, to the closing brief, 47 -- paragraph 47 to 56 of the closing brief.  

Your Honours, I stated the purpose of Interahamwe.  Interahamwe initially was used to fight the political rivals of the MRND.  Down the line, they were used as tools in 1993 up to 1994.  Immediately after their establishment in Mukingo commune, they became attackers of Tutsi population.  

I refer Your Honours to meetings that were held to sensitise these Interahamwes to attack the Tutsis, and each of the Prosecution witnesses placed the Accused at the central focus of these meetings.  He was a very active member, he convened these meetings and he mobilised the masses to also attend.  And, of course, these meetings were held to the exclusion of the Tutsis.  GBV testified as to how he happened to be there in 1993, as a young child, as a student of a primary school and not secondary school as the Accused had tried or made attempts to discredit his evidence, that he was purporting to place him as a student of secondary school such as ESTB, Busogo Secondary school and the rest.  

GBG testified to the effect that at 18, due to the persecution on Tutsis, he could not go to school early in age, or even if he did, he was not constant because they were afraid that -- the parents were afraid that he could be killed, so he was not constant, and that explained why at 18 he was still in primary school.

Your Honours, in respect of that meeting, the meetings that were held, which - it's the Prosecution's case that those meetings were held in furtherance of the plan which I will come to in a minute to eliminate Tutsis.  I draw the Court's attention to paragraphs 61 to 71 of the closing brief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Sixty-one to 7 --
MS. OJEMENI:
To 71, particularly from 61 to 64.  The rest of the paragraph merely talks about how Tutsis were eventually considered as Inyenzis or RPF accomplices.  In reference to these meetings, Your Honours, I refer you to the accounts of some of the witnesses, Prosecution witnesses.  GAP testified to the fact that these meetings continued up to March 1994, and that they were usually held at Joseph Nzirorera's house in Byangabo -- or his mother's house in Byangabo commercial centre. 

I refer you to the meetings at Isimbi, Busogo, which I deferred until now.  GAO's testimony at page 57, July 23rd, 2001 transcript, where he stated that they held a first meeting of the Interahamwe at Nzirorera's house, and the house was called Isimbi, which we have since established in evidence that Isimbi belonged to Nzirorera's mother - I mean, to Nzirorera and it was the headquarters of the Interahamwes.  

I refer Your Honours to the testimony of GBG that I just referred to at pages 59 -- pages 59, 60 and 63 of 12th July 2001.  I also refer Your Honours to the testimony of GDD.  GDD testified about two meetings where he talked about a meeting being held at Nkuli commune, which I had made reference to, where the issue of uniform was discussed.  He talked about another meeting at Nkuli commune where Amahindure was launched, and Joseph Nzirorera and the Accused were present, and as a matter of fact, they -- were the main speakers at that meeting where the Amahindures were introduced, and at the same time, Joseph Nzirorera told them the purpose of the formation of Amahindure and went further to say that the purpose was to fight the enemy, and the enemy was who?  The Tutsis, the RPF, Hutu moderators -- Hutu moderates, I beg your pardon.  And we've established the connection in paragraph 41 and 42 of the brief.  And we've led further evidence on that in those paragraphs.  I also refer you to the testimony -- and these meetings that I have talked about all took place in 1993. 

I refer you to the testimony of GDD on this meeting at Nkuli at page 16 of the transcript of 3rd October 2001.  Also he talked about -- I will come to that in a minute -- another meeting that was held later in 1994, but I will come to that in a minute, Your Honours.  But GDO also a Prosecution witness, an old woman who had no reason to lie, testified to the fact that she was told, which the Court will say is hearsay evidence, but hearsay is admissible under Rule 89.  The woman testified how she saw -- she had seen Joseph Nzirorera and the Accused going into Nzirorera's mother's house before she went into hiding in 1994.  According to her from 1993 -- this happened before 1993 -- her life was threatened and she did not move freely any more, but she heard from neighbours that the meeting continued -- the meeting at Nzirorera's mother's place, continued up to 1994.  And it has since been corroborated in evidence by GAP who happened to be around when such meetings were being held.  

Secondly, the -- Nzirorera's mother's house was situated at a commercial trading centre where people were always present for events.  RGM testified -- the Defence witness, testified that whenever he didn't have anything doing at home, he would come to the trading centre, and that many witnesses have since testified to the fact that it was like a leisure place, there was always -- people were always when they had nothing to do at home or when they came back from work.  It was the trading centre for the community - or the community.  It was always busy at night and people are bound to know what was going on around there.  They didn't need to go in, but, of course, we are talking of an African setting and a house owned by a mother of such an influential man, of course, people would want to know what is going on there.  

We have established, Your Honours, and I submit, that meetings did in fact take place, but we have since heard the evidence of GAP, who was a security officer of Nzirorera or whenever Nzirorera was around, he was the one guiding him.  

Secondly, he was also the brigadier in the communal office when the Accused was reappointed bourgmestre of Mukingo commune.  

The Prosecution submits, Your Honour, that the meeting -- we have proved beyond reasonable doubt that meetings to sensitise the public as testified to by GDD, GAO, GAP, GDO, GBV, and as set out in the paragraphs that I've drawn the Court's attention to, were actually held in Mukingo commune and at the places that we place the meetings of the Interahamwes to have been held.  

Your Honours, I will then move on to the events of 1994, having established the fact that the Accused indeed organised the Interahamwe for the sole purpose of using them at the appropriate time to eliminate the Tutsis.  And in that regard, I will refer Your Honours to two meetings that were held in 1994 as testified to by GDD.

GDD again testified before Your Honours that, indeed, he was convicted in 1986 (sic) as the Defence had alleged.  He confirmed it, that it was no longer an allegation, he didn't deny it.  

Secondly, he confessed to the killings of the Tutsis in Rwanda.  He did not wait for Gacaca to be set up.  He confessed right from day one that he did indeed commit these atrocities and asked for repentance.  It is in his testimony, Your Honour.  

GDD also testified to the fact that the Accused and Joseph Nzirorera knew that he had criminal intents and used him because they knew that he couldn't refuse because he needed them in his life, having been an ex-convict and having lost his position as the cellule committee member or responsable, and it was based on that that he was appointed the youth officer of Nkuli commune, ministry of youth, to teach students -- young boys and girls literacy and later on, taught the youth football.  And from there, he was now used to train the youths, now the Interahamwes, for the sole purpose of elimination of the Tutsis at the appropriate time.

MS. OJEMENI:
He further testified as to -- as I've established, that at a meeting held in Nkuli when the Amahindire was formed, the populace was also informed as to what the purpose was; to fight the enemy.  Who are the enemies?  RPF accomplices, the Tutsis.  GDD now testified about a meeting that the Accused convened on the 6th of April 1994, immediately after the killing of the -- sorry -- the President, Habyarimana's plane crashed.

He testified -- at page 70, the footnote, Your Honours, is on page 23 of the closing brief.  And the relevant paragraphs are paragraphs 81 to 82 -- 81, Your Honours, 81.  He testified --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Eighty-one is GAO?
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I think I am making a mistake.  Sorry, Your Honour.  It is at page 22, paragraph 78, which is titled "Execution of the plan to kill members of the Tutsis ethnic group in Kinyababa cellule on 7th April 1994."

This paragraph, basically, is on 6th April meeting where the Accused attended -- Your Honours, the paragraph is wrong, I correct myself.  It's Actually -- the reference is wrong.  It is on page 21, paragraphs 73 to 77.  Yes.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 21 - 
MS. OJEMENI:
      Tweny-one, paragraph 73 - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
      Paragraph 73 to 77.  Okay, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
And this paragraph is titled: "The meeting of the 6th April in the Officers Mess."
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, all right.  Go on Counsel.  We plan to take a break at 4:00, so you can organise your submissions accordingly for that break.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, I know I have made representations to the fact that I must finish today, but looking at the time, I will try.  I will try and see if -- I will not read the paragraphs, I will just go through.
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, it is just -- go on with your representations as you wish it to be.  We just wanted to alert you that you can organise your thoughts  that we may -- we will be plan to take a break for 15 minutes at
4:00 and then well come and continue.
MS. OJEMENI:
Very well, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yeah, Please go on.
MS. OJEMENI:
Oh, I should go on?  Sorry, I thought you were rising, I now sorry.

Okay, Your Honour, I refer you to these paragraphs, and they are all self-explanatory as to how GDD was summoned by the Accused on the 6th of April at about 11 p.m. and went the communal office of Nkuli, and when he got there he saw the Accused, and there were other people and they went into a meeting, and he asked them:  "What are you - why are you -- people doing?  Why have you not done anything?  Haven't you heard that the President of the country is dead?"  And from there they started discussing as to how to implement the plan that they have always had, which was to eliminate or exterminate the members of the Tutsi ethnic group.  And the Accused went further to refer them to the commune of the -- where Tutsis -- the cellule where the Tutsis were in Nkuli commune and asked them:  "You don't need to go far, you don't need to go anywhere.  I mean, there is the cellule, what are you waiting for?"  And then they discussed, and all the members at that meeting were members of the Hutu population who shared the ideology.  What is the ideology?  To eliminate Tutsi, the ideology of the MRND.

The Accused demonstrated this in all his activities while he was a bourgmestre, and even then,
Your Honours will recall the evidence of GBE, who said he was a member of the MDR, and the Accused asked him:  "Why are you in that party of MDR which is regarded as a party at the early stage of the Tutsi, why are you a member?"  And in order for his own security, he left the party and joined MDR -- MRND and it was the Accused who issued him with a card.  It's in evidence.

Your Honours will also recall that when the Accused was asked, during his re-examination, to mention one Tutsi member of the technical committee of the Mukingo communal office - communal office, he could not, the technical committee, he could not.  Eventually he mentioned one man, only one man that he said was a priest.  There is, in evidence, or  what happened or what the situation was each time the RPF attacked, what was happening in Ruhengeri Préfecture as a whole.

However, GBV, GDO -- GDO, for instance, mentioned that when the Accused came to her locality on the 7th morning and said:  "Search for Tutsi women, rape them and kill them."  On -- rather, in response to my question -- to the Prosecution's question, as to why the Accused would say so, he said there were mostly women in the area.  What happened to the men?
Your Honours, I need not go further because I am still within the temporal jurisdiction of this Court and I will refer you to how the plan was eventually executed as planned at the meeting of that 6th.
At that meeting, as stated in the paragraphs that I've made reference to, the -- GDD testified as to how the roles were shared.  Each one of them was assigned a role.  His role was to call the Interahamwes first thing in the morning with his whistle.  He said he did eventually.

The Accused undertook and immediately arranged the procurement of more weapons from the -- with the help of Mukamira camp.  There were other people there.  Sendungu, Shadreck was there, he was also assigned to see that the plan that they arrived at was executed the following day on the 7th.  And what was the plan?  To kill the Tutsi.

The Accused, of course, to add credence to what he said, said it was the Tutsi who killed the President.  There were so many other people, Yakiremye, spelt -- I don't think I am pronouncing it correctly for the record, sir.
MR. PRESIDENT:
I think so.  Yakiremye, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yakiremye, also was -- his role was to follow the Accused to Mukingo the following day and to take down the reinforcement of Interahamwe to Kinyababa, where the Tutsis would be eventually wiped out or eliminated on the 7th, the following morning.

Eventually, on the -- at about 5:00 or 6:00 -- this is still GDD testifying, that at about 5:00 or 6 a.m. the following morning, the weapons were delivered, the weapons that the Accused arranged for.  And GDD was present, the Accused was also called from his house, which was like two kilometres away from the communal office, Nkuli communal office, and he was present, he took delivery and then left for Mukingo for the final onslaught.

At page 22, paragraph 78, we also established how the plan was eventually executed and the Tutsis at Kinyababa cellule were eliminated eventually, and that particular attack is on page 23.  That's the Accused's participation -- GDD's participation and the Accused's participation is on page 23 to 24, paragraph 83 -- it is actually paragraph 83 on page 22 which ends on page 24.  The Accused's participation in complicity is also established there.
Your Honours, I wonder if this is the appropriate time to --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  What do you mean by participation in complicity?
MS. OJEMENI:
He aided -- the weapons he delivered -- the weapons he arranged which were delivered, and the intent also to kill has already been established in the plan.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, we will take a break for 15 minutes, and resume our work at a quarter past four.  Until then, these proceedings stand adjourned.
(Court recessed from 1600H to 1625H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
We continue.  Sorry we are late, we had said 15 minutes.  Could you continue, Counsel?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, now I'd draw the Court's attention to the execution of the plan, 78, as testified by GDD, and 79 is background of this GDD.  And the meeting -- there was another meeting on the 7th of April l994, at Byangabo market where the Accused ordered the Interahamwes who gathered there whom he invited to come and meet him at the Byangabo commercial centre where his bar was.  And that morning he addressed them and asked them -- when he saw them at Byangabo, he was asking them:  "What are you people doing there?  Why have you not started work?  Come and meet me."  Then when they came he then asked them -- after he discussing with them, he then asked them to go to work.

Your Honours, if there was no plan to eliminate Tutsis, why did the Interahamwes understand the word "work"?  Why did GBV understand -- who was passing by -- a Prosecution witness who was not an Interahamwe, why did he understand the word "work?"; why did the Interahamwes immediately understand  that work meant to kill Tutsis, and they immediately went to work by killing Rukara,  bringing Rukara and killing Rukara immediately.

Your Honour, we submit -- the Prosecution submits that there was a plan in place. Work, we know, means to do something, and that something, because they were talking in codes, in coded words, but the code was directed to a particular group, and they understood immediately that it meant they should go to work.  GAO, a member of Interahamwe, also testified that that morning most of them were already there in their uniforms and with their weapons.  He, in particular, was there with his weapon.  So all they needed was just that directive, or that instruction from their boss, asking them to go to work.  Of course, the Defence, which is natural, the Accused has to come up with a story, which is now known -- or a defence or excuse called, "pass the buck."  Now in Rwandan parlance of all the convicts facing this Tribunal, it's now known that their excuses is usually, "pass the buck, it wasn't me, of course, it wasn't me, it was you.  In this particular case, the Accused and his witnesses now pass the buck to the military, to the soldier, whom they said gave the order.  They needed to protect the Accused, hence from nowhere, a lieutenant emerged that morning.  He was his only vehicle -- it was only his vehicle that was on that road that particular morning, and he gave the order; "Get Rukara!"  Something has to be said.
RGM, who GAO testified killed Rukara with an axe.  Another witness testified that he killed Rukara with a club.  RGM on his own said, "No, I used a pipe."  How can a pipe kill a man?  But then on a 
follow-up question he said, "I knifed him."  Is it knife?  Is it club?  Is it axe?  The important thing is that a member of the Tutsi, Rukara, was killed.  An instruction was given.  RGM kept -- throughout his testimony said, "I did it on orders" and, of course, he has to pass the buck to some other person, unknown human being, because his boss has to be protected.

It is our submission, Your Honour, that given all the evidence in this case, that the Accused did order, as GBV and GAO have testified, the Interahamwes to get to work, and the work was to kill Tutsis on the 7th April 1994 at Byangabo commercial centre in front of his bar.

Now, this bar, the Prosecution -- the Defence say, yes, after cross-examining our witnesses to the effect that, "No, how did you know that Kajelijeli had a bar," having seen that we have irrefutable evidence or proof that bar actually belonged to Kajelijeli, in order to exonerate him, of course, they have to come up with a story.

Now they have admitted, "Okay, it is his bar, but he wasn't the one running the bar."  Our witnesses testified that that bar belonged to Juvénal Kajelijeli and he was running the bar.  He could have put somebody there, it doesn't matter.  Somebody has to run it.  No one expects an influential man in Mukingo, like the Accused, to run the bar.  But it is amply established in evidence that the Accused was always seen at the bar.

And this issue, Your Honour, I draw your attention once more to evidence of GBV, which is in evidence, GAO -- on this issue of the bar, and the Defence, like I said, through RGM, MEM, TLA, they have all admitted that indeed Kajelijeli owned that building, but what is now in issue is whether the bar actually belonged to him.

Your Honour, we have since established in evidence, that all the co -- the common thing that all these "men" -- when I talk about all these "men," I include the conspirators or accomplices of Joseph Nzirorera - of Juvenal Kajelijeli, excuse me, Your Honours  -- is that Joseph Nzirorera had a bar at Isimbi.  Karorero was running a bar at Nkuli communal office compound.  Kajelijeli now had this bar.  It is also in evidence that Kajelijeli's bar, according to GBG, yes, the evidence of GBG, that the bar was fairly new, so it wasn't well-known.  And Kajelijeli's brother also had a bar.  These were venues for the Interahamwes where they converged and where they were entertained.  It is also in evidence.

Your Honour, the events of 7th, 8th, 9th, l0th, all the attacks we have mentioned on pages -- before I go to - that's events, I am referring to attacks.  Where the Accused participated, his participation is also stated where, he aided and abetted, where he instigated; all these, Your Honours, we have particularised in a grid which I will use in buttressing the charges, but looking at the time and for judicial economy, Your Honours, I will not want to waste further time.  I would merely make references and tender it as the Appendix III that we have not -- we mentioned in the brief, but was not submitted at the time.  But in any event, the particulars of all the attacks referred to on pages 26, paragraph 9, I will start with the attacks of the 7th, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page twenty --
MS. OJEMENI:
No, Your Honour, let me start with the attack of the 7th.  Firstly, it is in evidence that there was an attack on Tutsis at Kinyababa cellule, Gitwa secteur, Nkuli commune on 7th of April.  GDD testified to that effect.  GAO, GBV, and many others that Your Honours have before you in our Appendix II, where we set out the particulars of the days -- particulars of events of the days that the attacks or the charges for which we are charging the Accused took place.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Which Appendix are you referring to, Counsel?  We want to be sure.
MS. OJEMENI:
I am referring now to Appendix II.  Appendix I is the indictment; Appendix II before Your Honours is the particulars of the attack, starting from 6th, 7th, -- starting from long before the 6th though, but for conspiracy purposes, which is a continuing offence.
MR. PRESIDENT:
So you are talking about Appendix II that was attached to the original brief?
MS. OJEMENI:
Brief, yes, Your Honour, before I come to Appendix III.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Right.  Yes, we want to be sure which document you are talking about.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Appendix II.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Right, go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes.  We've  set out their the particulars of events of between January to 14th of April, but specifically, events of 6th to 14th of April l994. Your Honours, I will not take much of your valuable time to read the Appendix or draw your attention to it.

Now, the attack itself, we have set out from pages 27, 23, Kinyababa attack, the first attack -- 23 of the closing brief, Your Honour, paragraph 33.
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right, yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
That is in respect of the attack at Kinyababa cellule, Gitwa secteur, Nkuli commune on the 7th of April l994, which was as a result of the meeting held at Nkuli communal office compound, at the canteen, to be precise, the previous night.

GDD testified to that effected.  Then we move on to paragraph 84, which is in respect of the attack at Rwankeri cellule -- secteur, Mukingo commune on the 7th April l994.  Various witnesses have testified on it as we set out in Appendix II, Your Honour.  We will also move to paragraph 86, the third attack, the attack at Munyemvano's compound in Manjeri cellule, Rwinzovu secteur, Mukingo commune. This attack is from 86 to 93.  We have set out the particulars of this attack also in Appendix II in addition to paragraph 86 to 93 of the closing briefs.

The fourth attack is the attack of April l994 --
MR. PRESIDENT:
April?
MS. OJEMENI:
-- 1994, which starts from '94, that is, the account of 8th April l994.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Eighth April?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, 8th April 1998 (sic).  It's on page 26 and it's at -- starts from paragraph 94 to 97, as testified by GBH, GBV, GDQ, GBE.  We have also particularised the events of that particular day in Appendix II, Your Honour.

I move on to events of l0th April, testified by -- which is within that paragraph of the 8th, which is on paragraph 98 -- GBE, where he cited the Accused at a roadblock in front of ISAE.  And, Your Honours, this roadblock at ISAE has since been corroborated by the Defence Witness MEM.  He did admit there was such roadblock.

We move on to, Your Honours, to the fifth attack, which is the attack at Kinigi, Suswa, where GDF was raped.  That is under "Rape."  We just mentioned it briefly.  Sir, I won't call it fifth attack, really.  It is -- I am referring to the attack at Ruhengeri préfecture of the 14th, because the GBF attack took place on the 10th, but it is under another paragraph of rape - we fitted "Rape."   So I will come to that in a minute.  But the next attack, which was a mass -- where many people were killed, and those people were Tutsis and we have in evidence --  we've since established that the people killed there were Tutsis, which Juvénal Kajelijeli also organised weapons, organised reinforcements to assist the Interahamwes of Kigombe in killing including the Tutsis.  We have since established that in evidence and it is also set out in Appendix II in addition to paragraphs 99 to 100.

(Pages 31 to 38 by Regina Limula)

































1645H
MS. OJEMENI:
Now, Your Honours, it's true that the numbers killed of these - of Tutsis at Busogo parish which is under attack of 7th as well, paragraph 84, that the number of Tutsis killed there has not been established.  Some people put it at 10, 100 --, some people put it at 138 -- 321, rather, Your Honour, the number of the bodies counted.  But from the witness testimonies, one could infer that there were much more than that; however, even a single -- even 10 bodies is a lot.  So, 321 is really enormous, Your Honours, and they were all Tutsis.  At Byangabo market -- at Byangabo centre, it's also in evidence that Rukara was killed there on the 7th, a member of Tutsi.  Rwankeli, Tutsis were also killed at their homes.  Rwankeli, incidentally, is -- was in l994 a locality for Tutsis.  And we have in evidence that Tutsis were living on both sides of Rwankeli.  One side of the road, there's only a road dividing Rwankeli and Busogo cellule.  And Rwankeli and Busogo cellule are in Busogo centre -- Busogo secteur, Your Honour, Rwankeli, Busogo secteur.

We move on to also account of GDQ of how many killed in Rwankeli.  He placed it at 30, and these were his neighbours.  MEM (sic) also admitted in evidence that it is true that neighbours of GDQ were Tutsis and they were killed.  MEM is a Defence witness.  

Your Honours, as -- regarding the number of Tutsis killed as we have it in evidence, are represented from 101 to 106 of our brief.  And, in addition, the number of people killed at Ruhengeri Court of Appeal, the Tutsis killed there, were also given as 300 by GAO, who incidentally participated in the attack.  

Your Honours, we have it also in evidence that when these Tutsis were killed, their property was also looted; some were burnt.  GAS gave evidence to the effect that their house that she saw few months before the -- few weeks before the attack took place on the 8th of April 1994 at the father's house, Munyevwano's compound, that it was demolished by the time she got back from the war.  She gave evidence to that effect.  She also gave evidence to the fact that the compound itself had about five houses.  ACM testified to that effect as well.  And this explains why the people who were present on the 7th, the Tutsis who were there at Munyevwano's compound on the 7th, could not give exact account of how the killing took place.  They came from different angles.  Their compound was so big that what B was seeing at one of the houses is different from the account of B in another -- who was probably in another house or another compound.  ACM gave -- ACM and GAS gave vivid description of the compound.  ACM is a member of that family, incidentally, grandchild of Munyevwano -- the old Munyevwano, who, in 1994 was late; while GBG was a refugee.

Your Honour, in my submission, I am more or less, referring to the Defence allegation that there was inconsistency between ACM; account of the killing that took place at Munyevwano's compound and GBG's account.  And I am simply saying that both of them saw the event from different accounts -- from different parts of the building.  Neither of them said that they were together when they saw Kajelijeli; neither of them said that they were living in the same -- or they were in the same house.  They were in the same house the day the incident took place or before the incident.  ACM was already comfortable, that was her house, and GBG was a refugee.  

Secondly, Your Honour, human -- two people could see an event, and you cannot account -- give the exact account of the event, but that does not mean that the other is telling lies.  It depends on the angle the person must have seen the event.  So, in that respect, Your Honour, we submit that there was no inconsistency, whatsoever each one of them gave the account of what they saw on that particular day.  And one thing is very clear, that both of them saw the Accused at the massacre site on that 7th of April 1994.

Your Honour, in furtherance to the Prosecution's case that there was indeed a plan,  ACM testified that when the Accused came to Munyevwano's compound that day in the morning, at about 9:00, the Accused left -- brought 30 Interahamwes and left them, and asked them to wait until he gets back for them to start work.  He then went out, came back and asked them; "Start work".  ACM's account was to the effect that the Accused first and foremost, asked that the Tutsis should be lined up and go to Busogo parish and they should take them to Busogo parish, but that the ones who are incapacitated or who refused to go should be killed.  As she testified as to her relations who were frail at that point -- at that time, who were old, who were incapacitated, handicapped, couldn't go, they were killed.  The uncle, Gateyiteyi, who incidentally is a friend -- was a friend of the Accused, and the godfather -- the Accused was the godfather of the son, was killed.

Your Honours, and the two witnesses, eyewitnesses, who saw this event from different angles as they saw the Accused, placed the Accused at the massacre site, and they had ample time to identify the Accused at the massacre site, and it took place during the day.  It wasn't at night.  There was nothing that blocked their view.  They had no motivation to come here.  They are different people.  ACM incidentally did not know about GBG.  It's in the evidence.  They didn't know each other.
Your Honours, we submit that the Accused was there and gave orders and when he came back and said; "start work", it was in furtherance of the plan.  That was the signal the attackers needed to execute the plan.  And these two witnesses, GBG and ACM, are credible.

Your Honours, I will move on to the position of the Tutsi land and property.  It's well established in evidence that their property were destroyed; their property stolen.  GAO gave an account of how he couldn't go to Busogo parish to kill because he was busy sharing from the cow.  GDD also didn't leave  -- the Accused didn't allow himself to be denied of that privilege.  He also -- it was also extended to him, GDD testified, that they also took part of the cow that was killed -- the Tutsi cow that they confiscated or they stole, that part of it was also taken to the Accused's house in Nkuli commune.  

Defence witness also testified to that fact, MCLF, RGM.  So it was common knowledge that Tutsi's house homes were burnt right after killing them or they were even burnt with the Tutsis in the houses.

One other feature of this particular attack, Your Honours, was the weapons used.  There were grenades, machetes, spears, cudgels, guns, clubs; both traditional and sophisticated weapons were used.

Another feature, Your Honour, is that soldiers were also involved.  Defence witnesses also testified to that fact, MCLF.  And going by the testimony of Defence exhibit -- sorry, Defence Witness 3 -- JK312, whom, according to him, was ferried to a safe place by the soldiers.  It's also -- one could draw that inference from there that the soldiers were involved, that gendarmeries were involved.  GAP also was a police communal.  He also testified to events of that day, though he wasn't present at some of the sites that we have mentioned -- we have testified or mentioned in our brief.  

Also there was a relation of the Accused, Nason.  Nason, the name came up also during the cross-examination of the Accused.  The name was put forward to him; he also participated.  Dusabe, a soldier also participated, Musafiri a soldier, although the Accused alleged that they were all deserters.  That's a feature that the attackers constituted of Interahamwes and soldiers.  And the common purpose was to eliminate Tutsis, and we have demonstrated through ACM's account of "Start work", that that work is a clear indication of the plan, all they were waiting was a signal to go ahead, and the meetings we have made reference to. 

Your Honour, still on paragraph 5.3 of the indictment, we also made reference to Accused's commanding, the 6(3), responsibility.  We have also, on page 29, from 109 to 119, demonstrated and also - and the latter part of paragraph -- I am referring to the brief now, Your Honours -- 260, on page 53 to 59 - sorry, page 53, paragraph 260 of the brief; 53, paragraph 260 to 287 of the brief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Fifty-three, paragraph --
MS. OJEMENI:
Page 53, paragraph, 260 - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
      Okay. 

MS. OJEMENI: 
      Which is Article - 
MR. PRESIDENT:
      All right 
MS. OJEMENI:
      Article 6(3):  Responsibility --.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
-- to 287 in addition to 109 to 119. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
All right.
MS. OJEMENI:
We have also set out in paragraph -- in Appendix III, which we will be tendering at the end of this  -- our oral presentation in order to save time, I will just draw the Court's attention that it's there, and it's well spelt out at 6(3), responsibility, and other relevant pages that could also be of great assistance to the court is referred to in this document.

Your Honours, I will just give a simple -- just a simple demonstration of this superior responsibility.  Your Honour, just basically referring to again, to ACM's account of how the Accused gave orders upon getting into their house on the 7th of April with the 30 Interahamwes and instructed them to hold them and they held on.  They respected, and the Accused came back and asked them to start work and never stopped them at any point in time from continuing with the work.  

Also, GAO mentioned how they were also told to start work at Byangabo market - or Byangabo trading centre.  And Your Honours, it's in evidence that Byangabo market is also referred to by witnesses as Byangabo trading centre.  MEM, who is the Defence witness, referred to it as Byangabo market, which most Prosecution witnesses referred to as Byangabo market.  So the two names were used interchangeably.  It wasn't as if there was just a market for selling clothes, as the Defence represented in their exhibits and then through the testimony of the witnesses.  The entire place, still today, is called Byangabo market.  

Your Honour, another feature about these attacks is the fact that these attacks took place at the same time, different localities on the 7th, different localities.  

Another feature about the Accused's responsibility was when the Interahamwes, according to GDQ, testified that Kanote's wife was brought to the Accused at the roadblock and they just brought the woman and the son and showed the Accused, and he said; "No Tutsi should survive", and they did exactly what he ordered.  That was a clear indication of his command, a clear indication that the Interahamwes were his subordinates and they respected and killed the woman and the son.  

Your Honours, without taking too much of your time, I will refer you to other pages of the brief, incitement, which is on page 30, and also paragraphs 120 to 125.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Page 30 of which document of the brief?
MS. OJEMENI:
Of the brief, Your Honour, 120 to 125 - murder, we gave instances for the incitement.  I need not go into that.  The Accused's words as to his instructions at the Byangabo market.  It's a public place on 
the 7th, which was heard by GBV and the others who were there.

We also referred to murder, Your Honour, which is on page 126 to -- page 31, paragraph 126 to 130 of the closing brief.  We also established that Rukara was a member of Tutsi population;  Luciene, member of Tutsi population; Joyce, member of Tutsi ethnic group;  Gateyiteyi, member of Tutsi ethnic group, who all lost their lives in the course of the attack on Tutsi population by the Hutus and at different locations on the same day.

Your Honour, once more, the issue of rape.  This is one of the heinous crimes committed by the attack -- by the Accused and his conspirators in 1994.  GDT -- GDO had testified -- also testified as to how the daughter was raped as she watched it and the Accused was there.  They had eye contact.  Immediately the Accused saw her, because she -- when she heard the daughter's cry, she got up and that was - it was at that point she saw the Accused, the second time.  She had seen the Accused when he arrived with his car, very close to where she was hiding and she had also given evidence to show that she was on a higher elevation and the car was on the lower elevation.  There was no obstruction as to her sight.  It was in the daytime.  The woman testified that she is an illiterate, she doesn't know time.  She said so several times.  It was a human error, we don't know who that gave -- put 4 o'clock, but still she had amply explained that she didn't say 4 o'clock, she it was the investigators, according to her.  She said she is an illiterate, she doesn't know what the time is, but it was clear -- one thing is clear, she saw the Accused, Juvenal Kajelijeli, on the 7th.

It's also in evidence that GBV saw the Accused at Byangabo market, still Byangabo trading centre.  After addressing the Interahamwes, he took off with his Interahamwes in the car, I mean, the Accused, he saw him with weapons in the car.  

ACM also testified that the Accused left.  There were other cars outside when the Accused came, and he now left with the cars full of Interahamwes.  GDD also testified that the Accused left Nkuli commune on that same very day at about 6:30.  So, either of these times, the Accused could have sneaked and do whatever.  Apart from that, there's a possibility that the woman, just like she said, couldn't give an estimate of the time limit the event took place, likewise the other witnesses.  We are talking of an event that took place eight years ago.  The human brain is not a computer because a computer gives you what you feed it.  It is quite possible that it was actually around 10:00, it could be 8:00, but one thing is certain that the women saw Juvénal Kajelijeli that morning at Rukuma and that he brought the Interahamwes and ordered them to search for Tutsi women, rape them, and kill them.
He wanted them eliminated.  

And it's common knowledge, Your Honours -- it's quite right, that populations come from women.  So if you kill a woman, you are killing the population.  So, that was a only way, if need be, to eliminate the Tutsi.  GDD also testified that when there's a product of Tutsi and Hutu, a child, you kill the child.  And he gave a Rwandan name, and he said that that child is looked at as a Tutsi, and he gave instances of the women -- of the children he killed on the 8th, after the Accused had asked them to go and eliminate the Tutsi survivors.  

Your Honours, once more, on this same 7th -- on this same 7th after the killing had been done, the Accused thanked all the Interahamwes for a job well done.  He entertained them at ISAE bar, canteen.  His bar, Sindi bar is in evidence and we have established that through the witnesses who saw them, and it's also in Appendix II.

Your Honour, GDF was also raped on the 10th.  She has also given an account, a clear account of what happened.  She was asked about a roadblock and she said there could be roadblocks but she never went there, but roadblocks, you go there, that's where people were killed.  So she never went there.  She also testified that she saw the UN officers long before that event took place.  She testified also that she came back from -- running for shelter about three weeks after she came back or thereabout, was when she was attacked, and that before that day, she was already hiding in the bush.  Hiding and coming back.  And what was she running away from? "Interahamwes", she testified.  And she testified that she came out with the sister from the bush where they were hiding, which was within the compound, the maize farm, to take some foodstuff when they sighted the Accused in his motor vehicle.  FMB, who testified to the fact that there was no way the Accused could have been there on the 10th, did admit one thing that even if there were roadblocks, he admitted that there were other ways apart from going through Mukingo, to get to Kinigi, on cross.  

Secondly, the witness herself, GDF, testified that she clearly saw the Accused.  His identity was not in question at all; she saw the Accused.  There was no obstruction whatsoever, it was day time and she was in hiding.  So she was apprehensive of the surroundings.  And she also testified that she could have been - that she could be seen from the road, given the kind of fence that they had in the compound.  From her evidence, it's very probative that the Accused was there irrespective of roadblock or no roadblock.  If somebody hates something and you want that thing eliminated, you can go to any length, it's quite reasonable to do anything.  And in any event, why should -- why would GDF hide on that day?  Why?  Apart from that, why should she be hiding long before that day in Kinigi?  If there was the RPF, if it was a buffer zone, why should she hide?  She should feel comfortable in her house, but she testified not knowing what excuse the Accused was coming up with, that before that day of the 10th of April, they had started hiding in the bush.  

The same proposition was put to GDO.  Oh, Rukuma is very close to Kinigi.  There were roadblocks until later on witnesses were now brought to say he was never there -- she was never there.  She was taken away.  Your Honours, it is the submission of the Prosecution that these two witnesses saw the Accused on the days and at the places that the Accused -- they established that the Accused was at Kinigi, Susa - or Susa on the 10th, GDF established that.  Also, GDO clearly established that the Accused was at Rukuma and he actually led and was there when the daughter was raped, in furtherance to his instructions because immediately after giving the Interahamwes the instructions to go search the Tutsi women, rape them and kill them, they were discovered, immediately.  

Your Honour, I will move on to the legal charges, but there's also inhumane acts.  We have also elaborated what the particulars  -- on page 32, paragraphs 135, to 137:  GDO, GAF, GDF testified to various acts of inhumane -- of inhumane acts, various inhumane acts as crimes against humanity.  

Your Honours -- Your Honours, these are tiers of fact and law.  I need not lecture you further -- or lecture you at all on issues of law.  We have already set out the relevant legal provisions and facts we are relying on in proof of the charges against the Accused.  In counts I, which is conspiracy to commit genocide.  

And, Your Honours, this is a continuous offence; hence we made references to meetings and certain events that took place before 1994.  We have also -- this charge is on page 33, we set out the intent, we set out the mens rea; we set out the facts we are relying on and the law, and we have also, in addition, particularised the elements of this charge in Appendix III, and I will draw your attention, Your Honours' attention to pages 1, 2,  -- 1 -- to pages -- to page 1, of Appendix iii.  We have not at this point -- may I crave your indulgence to -- Your Honours, may I crave your indulgence to distribute the appendix.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, appendix, what?
MS. OJEMENI:
Three.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Appendix iii.
MS. OJEMENI:
That we are relying on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
So as to take -- not to take much of your time, we will tender it and then I draw your attention, otherwise, I will read it into the record, but it's lengthy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
You have shown a copy to your colleagues, on the other side, I suppose.
MS. OJEMENI:
That's what we are doing now. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I didn't want to rise while my colleague was on her feet making her closing arguments, but I don't know what this document purports to say.  I have not seen it and, of course, we are not conceding or accepting that this be part of the record at this late stage.  I mean, we are now being presented with a document that she says she is submitting.  I think, in all fairness, we should have the document and if it's going to be admitted, we should need -- we should have time in order to rebut if there are any allegations in here.  So I am objecting to this being submitted at this last  -- at this last moment, unless the Court is going to be giving us an adjournment of time for us to respond to it.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honours, if I may respond.  I would have started my oral presentation this morning, but for my learned friend's action in filing a corrigendum after work on Friday, which was only served on us today, this morning, and here I am, I did not object.  I am on my feet presenting the Prosecution's case because it's our case.  We have to prove, we have the burden to prove.  I did not object.  What I have before you, Your Honours, is something I would have read into the record, but given the time constraints, it's basically just elements of the crimes that we are relying on.  I am entitled to my oral presentation.  If the Court allows, I will read that into the record as I am dealing with each charge, but it's just element of crime, they are all elements of crime.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel -- yes, Mr --  Professor Hinds. 
MR. HINDS:
Your Honour, I don't mean to be unfair -- 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
 -- to the Prosecutor, but quite frankly, if she is making a representation, what is in a chart form, is exactly what is what was submitted in terms of the legal arguments, I have no problems with it.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. HINDS:
Okay, and I will -- because we have dealt with it, but if there's anything new with respect to witnesses and so on, I think that we should be able to rebut it, if there's anything new.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, we see it to be -- I mean, on the face of it, we haven't read it also because we have just seen it, there seems to be a summary of the evidential aspect arising from, I suppose from the brief.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
And if that be the case, well, we see no difficulties about that.  If there's anything that the Defence may find, that is -- goes beyond what they think was -- was expected, they can always raise the matter before the Trial Chamber.
MR. HINDS:
Absolutely, Your Honour.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We would like to see that everybody is fully heard on all of these aspects.  So, we are not -- it's not a question of admitting any evidence at this particular time, but I think it requires -- if it's an illustration of what the closing brief is, I think you can go ahead and use it.
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, this is more or less -- in fact, this document was made reference to in the brief.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
But was not submitted.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
However, what is here is in the transcript.   It's just the evidence that we are relying on, in addition to what we have presented to the Court.  So it's just oral submissions on it.  It's nothing new, it's just the evidence before the Court.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
But to assist the Court, we have just summarised the evidence and the elements.  We have now particularised the elements that we are relying on.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.
MS. OJEMENI:
Nothing new.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, I think they can use the -- it can be used as an appendix to the closing brief with the observation that the Defence who have not seen it, if there's anything that goes beyond that they will need to comment on, they can always make the necessary application to the Trial Chamber.  

Go on, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, in support of the conspiracy charge, we are relying on page 1 of this Appendix iii.  In support of complicity -- genocide, rather, Count 2, we are relying on pages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and part of 8.  In support of complicity --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Of this appendix?
MS. OJEMENI:
Yes, Your Honour, of this -- of Appendix iii.  Thank you, Your Honour.   In support of the charges of complicity in the brief, we are relying on pages 8, 9, 10, of Appendix iii.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MS. OJEMENI:
In support of direct and public incitement to genocide, in addition to what we have in the brief, we are relying on pages 11, 12, and part of 13, of appendix iii.   In support of Count 5, which is murder as a crime against humanity, we are relying on pages 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 -- no, 18, Your Honours -- 13 to 18 for murder.  

In support of Count 6, extermination, we are relying on pages 19, 20, 21, and part of 22 of this Appendix iii.  

In support of rape, Count 7, we are relying on pages 22, 23, 24 of Appendix III.

In support of Count 9, which is in inhumane acts, we are relying on pages -- on page 25 -- pages 25 and part of 26.  
Then as I said earlier on, Your Honours, 6(3), responsibilities is also in these pages that we have referred to and, in addition, we have other relevant issues and we mentioned and drew the Court's attention on effective control, which is 6(3), responsibility, pages 26, 27 and 28 -- pages 26 to 27 of this appendix.  

Then land issues of the committee, which is in evidence, set up in Mukingo commune to distribute Tutsi's property.  We also referred Your Honours to evidence in support of the Prosecution's case of the Accused's involvement in -- on the issue.

Now, Your Honours, I will move on to the next issue, which is the issue of alibi.
(Pages 39 to 49 by Judith Kapatamoyo)

























	1730H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Counsel, this is a new element.  How long do you think you are likely to take?
MS. OJEMENI:
On the issue of element?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Alibi.
MS. OJEMENI:
Alibi.
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you need --
MS. OJEMENI:
Maybe an hour -- an hour and a half to sum up Defence case.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Then this might be an opportune moment to adjourn, and we can start with those issues tomorrow.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, I hope it won't be held against me that -- because I would have been finished long before the end of the day but for my learned friend's --
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, no, not at all, because these could be important issues.  So, it is not a question of holding against anybody -- any party for that matter.  

Yes, Counsel, sorry. 
MR. HINDS:
Excuse me, Your Honour.  As you recall, early this morning we, in fact, not only consented but, in fact, were advocating in favour of the application being made by the Prosecutor on the basis that she said, that knowing her work, that she, in fact, was going to be able to -- first she wanted an hour, then two hours  -- whatever time, she gave that assurance.  I am looking at this Appendix III, quite frankly, and while there is no question about it, it is a summation of things that are in evidence, but when you compare what is in Appendix III with the arguments that have been made previously in the brief, there are new areas that are being introduced to support and buttress the legal arguments, which are facts to support basic legal requirements.  And I am going to be looking at them tonight, but I may very well have to make an application to the Court.  And I don't want to extend the time for us to deal with these closings - um, but I just want to serve notice to the Court that on just the brief review, I am seeing that there are facts being alleged with respect to elements of the crime which were not alleged before, and, therefore, we did not address those particular facts in our brief, and so now we will have to address these facts.  I am not saying they are new matters that we have not seen.  It is clear that they are -- the same allegations are being recycled, but they are now being done so within the context of particular charges, and we have to now study these to see how we can supplement our brief to deal with those matters.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.
MS. OJEMENI:
Your Honour, is my learned friend saying that the transcripts of the witnesses are not before the Court, because what is there is simply a summary of the transcripts that are before the Court?  We only assist the Court as an officer of this Court to expedite the trial of this case or conclusion -- or bring to conclusion the trial of this case, otherwise we are making a - I mean, a representation.  We could have read them into the record, but I think this will facilitate the work of Your Honours.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  The Defence were talking on general aspects.  If there is any aspect that they need to raise formally arising from the appendix, certainly there -- they are entitled to do so, and the Trial Chamber will hear them with regard to any other supplementary aspect they will think may be required to be made on their side.  So, I -- 

Yeah, we will stop here and tomorrow we will continue.  Counsel, in the morning I hope you will be able to finish.  We are aware of the time frames, but we are also aware of the fact that we would like to see that parties ventilate before the Trial Chamber the issues they think are pertinent to their case for the assistance of the Trial Chamber.  We will have to bear that in mind, that fact, as we go along, but within the time frames. 

Yes, so we'll adjourn these proceedings to tomorrow at nine.  And when we resume tomorrow the Prosecution will continue their oral submission -- their oral argument from the stage we have reached today.  So, until tomorrow at nine, these proceedings stand adjourned. 
(Court adjourned at 1735H)
