P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everybody. 

Mr. Registrar, can we open the proceedings? 
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Short and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session today, Wednesday, the 26th of October 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of The Prosecutor versus Karemera et al, Case No. ICTR-98-44-T.  

Thank you, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
With regard to appearances, is there anything new to report this morning? 
MR. WEYL:
There is a small change, Mr. Present.  Pardon me for being late.  I thought I would be here at 
10 o'clock.  Unfortunately, Precision Air did not live up to its name.  They were late out of Nairobi and I am just arriving now.  Thank you for waiting for me.  

So I am here now, Frédéric Weyl, co-counsel for Mr. Ngirumpatse and I am available to the Chamber to continue my cross-examination.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And thank you, Mr. Weyl.  We are glad that you are back and you may proceed now to continue your cross-examination because Mr. Sow kept up to his promise and completed his cross-examination yesterday.  So you may proceed now. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
WITNESS G,
CROSS-EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Good morning, Witness. 
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	I am back in Arusha now and I am going to continue -- rather, my cross-examination of you.  I have a few questions for you regarding the composition of*********************************. 

Witness, you told us in the beginning of your examination - 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, remember this is an open session and ******************************is too specific a question.  So we are going to have to redact it from the record and ask you just to be careful in the way you reframe your question. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I thought that the Interahamwe comprised some 3,000 people in Kigali and 10,000 throughout Rwanda.  And if I speak about the Interahamwe, it wasn't sufficiently precise so that this witness would be identified.  But if I am mistaken -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, we heard in the English translation********************, and that is the issue to which I recommend that, not the Interahamwe, but*****************************.  So it was the reference to the ***************which we wanted redacted. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I believe that the ***********is something that exists and I didn't draw any link that might lead to the identification of the witness.  I talked about the **************as such and its composition.  I thought that I could ask questions to the witness about the ***************as such without really endangering his security or leading to his identity being revealed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Maybe you are correct.  We will redact this section of the discussion and (inaudible) this question and we will see how it goes from here. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	My question, Witness, was very broad.  During your examination-in-chief, you talked about the fact that members of the MRND of Tutsi origin had left the MRND party to create the Liberal Party.  Would you confirm that for me, Witness? 
A.	They left the MRND to join another party which already existed, which had been created; many members, not everyone. 
MR. WEYL:
I forgot about the interpretation.  Let me observe a pause.  Thank you.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	So, Witness, you will confirm that many members of Tutsi origin from the MRND party left that party? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In the same manner, you said that when the Interahamwe were created, there were some Interahamwe members who were Tutsis; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You also told us that the Interahamwe of Tutsi origin remained at the first meeting; is that correct?
A.	Yes.
Q.	You told us that changed in May 1992; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.
Q.	And you also told us that at that time some Interahamwe of Tutsi origin went to join the youth wing of the Liberal Party; is that also correct? 
A.	I wouldn't say all of them, yes, but some of them did. 
Q.	So they were the ones who left the Interahamwe? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	They were not excluded from the Interahamwe then? 
A.	No, they were not. 
Q.	Don't you believe that they were the ones who practiced some sort of discrimination then? 
A.	Perhaps they saw that they would be more at ease in the PL party.  They were free to change. 
Q.	Thank you for those clarifications, Witness. 

Now, I want to go back to Interahamwe activities when they participated in the meetings.  Would you confirm that during the spring and autumn meetings of 1992, they participated in entertainment for the meetings? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	They made up groups of singers, for example; is that correct? 
A.	That's not correct. 
Q.	They didn't sing? 
A.	Yes, they sang party songs; songs talking about the party activities but they didn't have a specific Interahamwe group for that.  They sung with all of the MRND members at rallies. 
Q.	Did they form dancing groups? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did they do any plays or sketches or skits? 
A.	No, I never saw that, but during the rallies there are people who do skits.  But, again, it is not exclusively the Interahamwe; it's MRND members from the secteurs, the secteur groups.  
Q.	So during the MRND rallies there were young people who sang, danced, who presented skits? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	I want to talk about the Ruhengeri meeting of 15th November 1992. 
MR. WEYL:
I would need the assistance of Mr. Sendze, who I would like to help me show some of the excerpts of the CD-ROM about the Ruhengeri meeting which were tendered into evidence.  The first excerpt I would like to see from that CD-ROM is a KV000392A.  I would like us to project it from 23:10 to 
24 minutes, and I would ask the witness to listen attentively to the audio portion. 

MR. WEBSTER:
The usual problem.  I am looking to the audio visual booth, now that we have the link with The Hague, can we have the button -- there we are. 
(Audio tape played)
MR. WEYL:
Thank you.  Perhaps we can stop here for the time. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you listen to that audio recording? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did you recognise the song? 
A.	I did. 
Q.	Can you tell me who wrote it? 
A.	I don't remember. 
Q.	If I were to tell you that the song was written by Jean Gilbert Rumiya, would that ring a bell for you?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell me who Jean Gilbert Rumiya is? 
A.	Rumiya was a member of the préfectural committee in Butare, the MRND committee, I mean. 
Q.	Can you tell me what ethnic group he belonged to? 
A.	Yes, he was Tutsi. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
A.	But he was killed in April 1994 because he was Tutsi, even though he was an MRND member. 
Q.	Witness, I believe, just like you, Mr. Ngirumpatse also lost many friends from April to July 1994, both Tutsi and Hutu friends.
MR. WEYL:
Now, Mr. Sendze, could you kindly assist us again and show another excerpt from CD number 3, this is still KV000392 and it will be C from 28:50 minutes to 30 minutes.
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Once again, Witness, kindly listen attentively to the audio portion.  It is not very clear, but if you listen attentively you will be able to make out what is being said. 
MR. SENDZE:
This is Mr. Sendze.  I think I am experiencing some difficulties with the laptop.  The video does not want to run, so I would need a few minutes to work it out. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, is it possible to deal with another issue while Mr. Sendze is putting the stuff together? 
MR. WEYL:
Everything is possible, Mr. President, but the way my questions were lined up, I would have preferred to deal with this matter now without having to interrupt and introduce something else. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Excuse me, Mr. President.  If it is a matter of a few minutes, I did have something I wanted to raise with the Trial Chamber some time this morning.  I will leave it to you if this would be a good time to do that. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Robinson, we can hear you now.  

Mr. Weyl.  
MR. WEYL:
Yes, Mr. President.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you.
MR. ROBINSON:
Mr. Sendze says he is ready now, so I can take my matter later. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, Mr. President, I am ready now.  Could I please have the minutes you want me to play, Mr. Weyl?
MR. WEYL:
Yes, this is CD KV000392C; the portion goes from 28 minutes and 50 seconds to 30 minutes. 
(Video tape played)
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, unfortunately, we don't have any sound and for this particular portion, it is quite important. 
MR. SENDZE:
I am afraid, I can't get any sound and the volume is on the maximum. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is there a problem with the computer or something else?  
MR. SENDZE:
Mr. President, I doubt it because the other videos have been able to give us sound, so maybe there is a problem with this particular video. 
(Video tape played)
MR. WEYL:
We can stop there, Mr. President, for the time being. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you hear the video? 
A.	Not a 100 per cent, Counsel. 
Q.	With what you did hear, well -- first of all, we know that -- I believe you saw it and from what you heard, can you tell us at least what this video was about? 
A.	I heard some songs; they were talking about Habyarimana and the MRND.  They were praising Habyarimana, and it was about the MRND, that is what I heard. 
Q.	Can I assist you.  In fact, we have a transcript in translation which is quite detailed of this video.  Can I suggest the following translation to you.  "The president is invincible.  He has resisted the mean traders.  He is defending his country and has not provoked anyone.  We support all Habyarimana's actions.  He has brought unity amongst Hutus, Twas and Tutsis.  He is the uniter, never a divider.  We are with the president.  They cannot beat him.  All of us Hutus, Tutsis and Twas, we are united and we want peace."  

Does this translation seem more or less accurate to you, Witness? 
A.	I can't comment on that because when people sing at rallies, they always say good things and I believe that was the case. 
Q.	Witness, I am simply asking you to tell us -- to confirm whether or not what I said was, indeed, what the group that we saw on the video was saying.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	I can't confirm something I didn't hear, Counsel.  I heard invincible because I believe that at some congress that was said of Habyarimana, but for the rest of it, I didn't hear it clearly.  At any rate, there is nothing negative on what they said. 
Q.	Thank you.
MR. WEYL:
On that same very CD, I would like us to look at the portion from 11 minutes, 40 seconds to 12 minutes, with the assistance of Mr. Sendze.  Thank you.

Mr. President, Precision Air is not the only thing that is working against me this morning. 
MR. SENDZE:
I am afraid I cannot explain this difficulty, Your Honours.  After playing a video, it is quite hard to open another one and I don't know why. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is it a question of time?  Would you need just a little time just to --
MR. SENDZE:
Yes.  I would need two minutes to rush upstairs and get the actually CDs of this video so that it would make it easy. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was a bit sensible to give you the time.  Perhaps we could have Mr. Robinson during that period. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President.  With respect to Mr. Mbonyunkiza, he's resumed cross-examination, I have a few matters that I would like to raise that I hope that can save us some time later on.  
When we got to the point where I was going to ask him about the Ruhengeri meeting and the speech of President Habyarimana -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It might be advisable for the witness in The Hague to have his headset removed at this time, please.  I see you are ahead of the game, thank you.  
MR. ROBINSON:
I think he knows the drill by now.  

With respect to the Ruhengeri meeting, I think it would be useful if this witness, when he arrives this afternoon, can be directed to view the CD of President Habyarimana's speech in Ruhengeri, which is Exhibit P. 11F from 17 minutes, 16 seconds to 23 minutes, 50 seconds.  And I would ask that you direct a court officer, not a member of the Prosecution staff, but a court officer to make that video available for him in the waiting room while he is waiting to testify, so that by the time he returns to give us testimony he can be questioned about the contents of that speech.  

Secondly, in light of your ruling about the way I need to approach the speeches, I think it will be also advisable for him to be provided copies of Exhibits D. NZ 20 to 32, which is a series of 12 speeches -- 13 speeches that were made in 1994, that I would be asking him about during the cross-examination.  I think it would be a good idea for him to read those during the time before he testifies, so that when I ask him about those speeches, he's got some -- he doesn't have to review them at the time.  So, I am asking that we take those measures to expedite his cross-examination when it resumes. 

My other point is that we have received so far only the addendum to the registrar's submission in connection with his personal issue regarding the passport.  We have not yet received disclosure of the actual initial submission made by the registrar.  So as I understood it, you ordered the disclosure of two documents to us.  Yesterday in court we were handed an addendum to the registrar's initial submission.  And I would also ask that the witness's letters be disclosed, the ones he wrote to WVSS, so that I have those before getting to that point in my cross-examination.  Thank you. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Before the Court deliberates on this, perhaps I should comment that, as a practical matter, it would be very difficult to have the videos displayed to the witness, we are having problems here in Court.  Playing the videos -- this is something that ideally CMS could do entirely independently of either of the parties -- as things turn out, we bear the burden of showing these videos to the Court and to the witness.  So, Mr. Robinson put us in an awkward position to request that the video be shown to the witness and not to have OTP participate in the process.  The only way I can conceive of doing that is putting it on a laptop and working from that -- I don't know if that is practical.  I would have to consult with Mr. --  
As for the other request that Mr. Robinson has made, I think I have already expressed myself in previous application.  The Court is in a position to consider whether any additional disclosures are required, if they would assist in the fact finding process that the Trial Chamber must undertake.  

And as for the transcripts of all of those speeches, I have made my position clear earlier on whether that's an appropriate way to proceed to have a witness read documents that he has not heard, that we haven't established that the witness heard all of these speeches that Mr. Robinson is referring to.  Clearly in his testimony, he mentioned the speech of Habyarimana because it was a radio broadcast.  We have not established on the record if any of these two other speeches were radio broadcast, if the witness has heard those or whether he is going to rely simply on reading these things for the first time now.  All those are things that need to be put to the witness before we get to the stage of handing him transcripts of the 20 or so exhibits that Mr. Robinson suggests be delivered to him, but I have raised these concerns before.  I leave it to the Court to resolve the matter. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, the -- I gather the disclosure issue is being addressed shortly.  I just heard the assurance from the registrar.  The registry has also confirmed that they have the capacity to show the witness the video clip and they will do that before he testifies.

We are still having this legal problem about the concept of refreshing memory.  We take the point of view that the witness's memory can be refreshed from documents or from video clips that he did not have anything to do with.  But there must be some indication that he had a memory of some sort to be refreshed.  And as of now, we don't know if the first time the witness gets information of these speeches is when he read the documents.  And even though it interferes with our anxiety to proceed as quickly as possible, it might serve the course to just establish a bit of foundation before showing the document to the witness.  So I think that is what I think should happen. 
MR. ROBINSON:
Thank you, Mr. President, I can do that.  

Concerning my request for disclosure of the letters by the witness, that would be WVSS.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But I must say we did not review it.  Now, you are on your feet, but I don't think we -- we had thought of it before and decided not to make the requirement from WVSS.  I think the Bench wants to maintain the decision that we had made.  We had in fact discussed it, even before your application was made.  Even if we hadn't discussed it now we discussed it yesterday, and for that we should not make -- (inaudible).
MR. ROBINSON:
So it's clear that my application for disclosure of the witness's letters to the witness victim section is denied.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.
MR. ROBINSON:
Am I free to seek the consent of the witness for that disclosure?  Thank you very much.
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have no problem with the witness giving disclosure of documents.  I have no problem with you taking the documents.  We didn't think it was appropriate first to make that order.
MR. WEYL:
Has Mr. Sendze been able to solve the difficulty, and can he help me to show the extract from 11:40 to 12:18 on the video KV000392C, please?  
MR. FRY:
This is the registry in Arusha.  I just wanted to check if the witness has his headset on. 
MS. TALON:
Yes, the witness has his headphones back on, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I am sorry, Mr. Weyl, I did not hear your last intervention.  Is it possible to repeat it for us, please?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I was asking Mr. Sendze to help us in having projected the video extract or clip from 
CD KV000392C from minute 11:40 seconds to 12:18 seconds.  Thank you. 
(Video tape played)
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President the video clip can be stopped now. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, did you hear that clip? 
A.	Yes, Counsel, I did. 
Q.	Were you able to recognise the speaker? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us who the speaker was? 
A.	It is Casimir Bizimungu who was speaking. 
Q.	And can you tell the Chamber what Mr. Casimir Bizimungu is saying on that video clip? 
A.	Mr. Casimir Bizimungu was introducing one Kamana, Clavier from Gitarama préfecture from the MRND. 
Q.	I am going to propose to you the exact translation of what he said, and I would like you to tell me whether it's correct or not in your view.  Mr. Bizimungu is saying "Applause, applause, please.  I want to introduce to you someone who has suffered a great deal of late because people came and burned down his house.  Kamana, Clavier, very well known in Gitarama, who is fighting at all times in his life to promote our party."  Is my translation more or less faithful to what you heard? 
A.	Yes, Counsel. 
Q.	Did you hear the crowd applaud? 
A.	Yes. 
MR. MORLEY:
All the witness answered -- it's not a complaint, Your Honour, but when my learned friend quotes 
from -- or what he proposes is a translation, could we simply know where it is coming from?  We are not complaining about his using it, we just want to know where it is from. 
MR. WEYL:
Maybe to answer the question -- but I would have liked for the witness to remove his headphones as is usual. 

Mr. Morley was not there in April of 2004.  He went for some days.  We examined, at the Chamber's request, the contents of these various CDs and the translation is what was suggested by the interpreters in the booth when we heard these CDs from the 3rd to the 9th of April 2004, Mr. President.  

Maybe the witness can put his headphones back on. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, I think it is practice that would be useful if you could just indicate -- if you're referring to a transcript -- if you are referring to a transcript, it will assist everybody if you just say -- indicate what you are referring to as a means of reference.  So I took it from your comment that you are referring to a transcript from a previous proceeding.  And if you could just identify the transcript, that could assist. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, my difficulty is that it is a transcript but not quite so because these are records of the informal record which took place at the request of the Chamber and they led to the formation of transcripts and this was in closed session.  It is transcript, but it doesn't have the exact validity of a transcript.  This is why I am somewhat finding it difficult that it be tendered as an exhibit.  I can do so, but I think that since I believe I am not betraying the words of Mr. Bizimungu as they were translated or interpreted by the interpreters in the year 2004, I thought I would simply ask the witness to confirm, and I am glad that he is not finding any difficulty with the interpretation that was provided.  But if the Chamber wishes that I tender the transcripts as an exhibit, I would be at his disposal to obey. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Speaking for myself, I don't think that is necessary.  I think you have given a sufficient application as to the source of the translation. 
MR. WEBSTER:
Actually, it is not sufficient for me.  If he could just -- the question was very, very simple.  Just tell us where is he reading from; give us the date and the page on the transcript and then we will be finished with the issue. 

MR. WEYL:
Mr. Webster knows exactly from what transcripts I am quoting because he was present as I was at those informal hearings where we saw over a period of four days these various CD-ROMs.  These are transcripts which I could inform the Chamber of their exact nature after this session, by leave of the Chamber, of course. 

May the witness replace his headphones? 

Can I be informed whether the witness has his headphones or not?  
MS. TALON:
Yes, Mr. President, the witness has his headphones on.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, I can actually see that from the screen.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, there is something I wanted to say.  Maybe the witness should take his headphone off.  

There is a certain amount of jousting between counsel, which, I suppose, is inevitable in proceedings of this nature.  But as far as we are concerned, it is not really necessary.  Now, the point is if you don't know the -- if you don't have the information that has been requested, you can say so.  That will solve that problem.  If you have the information and counsel on the other side were present, what is the harm of saying it?  It would assist us too.  So, to me, it's a very simple issue which did not require the interference of counsel. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I agree with you and I have suggested that the translation which was accepted by the witness as being faithful, and I think at cross-examination what the witness was able to say to the Chamber was sufficient to respond to the question I had put to him.  And if we can continue in that manner, maybe I can request the witness when he will have put his headphones back on to tell us who Kamana, Clavier is. 

Can the witness put his headphones back on?

Mr. President, do you think the witness can put his headphones back on now? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes. 
MR. WEYL:
He has done so, Mr. President.  Thank you.  So we can even have exercises raising and putting down headphones. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please tell the Chamber who Kamana, Clavier was? 
A.	Kamana, Clavier, was a member of the MRND.  He was living in Gitarama préfecture and he was an entrepreneur. 
Q.	Can you tell us to which ethnic group he belonged? 
A.	Kamana was a Tutsi. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Sendze, I still need you for the last but one clip from the Ruhengeri meeting.  I want the clip from the CD whose K-number is K000392B as in Bravo, 35:45 to 36:30, please. 
(Video tape played) 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, the video can be stopped there.  I would like it to be clear, Mr. President, that when I suggest that the video be stopped, it is not because the subsequent clips would contradict what I want to show, but it's just in order to save the Chamber time. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you tell us who is the speaker in this clip? 
A.	It is still Mr. Casimir Bizimungu. 
Q.	Do you hear what he said? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Can you tell us what he said? 
A.	He was saying that the barbarous acts and killings and the Ukubuhoza system would not lead to anything, and he is asking the youths of the MRND to remain disciplined to avoid committing acts which are anti-democratic.  
Q.	We agree since -- I still want you to give me a small clarification in relation to the proposed translation.  At a point in time Mr. Bizimungu says when one engages in Ukubuhoza, you obtain a servant but not a militant or a member.  Do you understand that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  At this point in time, given what you have seen in the Ruhengeri meeting, I would like to remind you of another extract, another clip which was shown to you by the Prosecutor and it showed youths who were mimicking and teasing a young man who was being called to order.  Do you remember that, or do we have to show this clip again? 
A.	I think I was shown that clip.  Yes, I remember it. 
Q.	And you told us at that time when the youths grabbed a lone young man, you told us that they were arresting an enemy, a Tutsi, do you recall? 
A.	It was like a skit and I was drawing conclusions because of what I was seeing, but this would have to be confirmed and I was not confirming that myself.
Q.	It was a skit, we do agree. 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But do you think that at a rally when people come to sing and they are thanking President Habyarimana for having contributed to peace and friendship between Hutus, Tutsis and Twas and a rally at which Mr. Casimir Bizimungu who praised Kamana, Clavier, with force and applause -- a rally which is animated by a song written by a Tutsi singer who is very well known, we can, indeed, interpret this as the arrest of a Tutsi, or would it not be a caricature of the Ukubuhoza which Mr. Casimir Bizimungu has just denounced in his speech?  
MR. MORLEY:
Before the witness answers and perhaps he will be entertained here, can he take his headphones off for a moment, please?  

Your Honour, listening to my learned friend Mr. Weyl's long question in which he is inviting the witness to draw a conclusion in respect of a piece of film which we saw two weeks ago, it is my respectful submission that for this question to be of evidential significance or not, that piece of the film ought to be shown again to the witness so that the witness can help Mr. Weyl, if that's the right word, with what is on the film.  Mr. Weyl is asking the witness to remember a short piece of film from two weeks ago and draw a conclusion about it when really he ought to be shown the film again. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We think it is really a matter of the witness whether he needs to have his memory further refreshed.  If he recalls, well, you can continue with the questioning.  If he requests to see the film, then you can show it to him.  But we think it is a matter for the witness and his memory. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I agree with you in your analysis, except the witness had indicated himself that he remembered the video clip and the conclusions that he had drawn at the time.  If he wishes to have his memory refreshed, I can in that instance recall that this clip was following the song sung by the group in white, as we have just seen a moment ago. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, it was my recollection that -- I thought I had heard the witness saying he had remembered.  That's what our ruling meant.  But then you want to preclude him from saying anything he wishes to say, but I thought that is what the witness had said. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you put your headphones back on, please. 

Mr. Witness, do you wish us to refresh your memory by showing the video clip again where the young men are grabbing one lone young man or do you have the clip sufficiently clear in your memory? 
A.	You know, on the CD-ROM it is not very clearly, one cannot hear what they are trying to say.  And when that clip came on, I was there but I didn't actually see it physically.  Whether you project the 
	video clip again, I don't think it would be of much use. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I am a bit disturbed because when Mr. Prosecutor showed this clip about 15 days ago you had said that you recognised it and you gave an interpretation of what you had seen.  So if the clip is not clear enough in your mind now, I am ready to show it to you again.  Are you ready? 
A.	As you wish. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Sendze, in order to avoid any difficulty, could you please show us CD K000392C, an extract which should begin at about 30 minutes and 30 seconds. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Maybe while this is being prepared, we could take a brief recess.  

Do you intend to show any other videos besides that? 
MR. WEYL:
Not in this line of questioning, Mr. President.  Perhaps later on I will have a different clip to show, but that would be a different line of questioning. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Mr. Sendze, you are now ready. 

We can just deal with this particular issue and then we will take the break immediately after he answers your question on this clip.
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
(Video tape played) 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I don't believe this is the clip.  Perhaps we could take the break and during the break I can consult with Mr. Sendze to find exactly which clip -- which we can play directly after the break. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take the break now.

(Court resumed at 1205H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Sendze, are all systems working now?  
MR. SENDZE:
Yes, Mr. President, all systems working and ready to go.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Mr. Weyl?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, are you with us?  
MR. WEYL:
Can the witness hear us?
THE WITNESS:  
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you.  Can we have the video clip shown, please, Mr. Sendze?  
(Video tape played) 
MR. WEYL:
The clip can be stopped, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, does this adequately refresh your memory, or do you want to see a little bit more of the clip?  
MR. MORLEY:
I'm on my feet.  We have the clip here.  We can play the whole thing.  It lasts for about three minutes.  I don't know what the point of just playing 30 seconds of it is.  Either he looks at it again or he doesn't.  I don't understand why we're just doing a short clip within the clip.  It seems pointless.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'd explained myself a moment ago.  I was trying to save the Chamber time, but if the witness wanted us to continue with the video clip, we may do so.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you hear us?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, everything is against me today.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you wish to see a longer version of the clip, or has what you've seen -- is what you've seen enough to refresh your memory?  
A.	If you wish, you can add a few more, but --
MR. WEYL:
Mr. Sendze, please, can you show us a little more?  
(Video recording played) 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is that enough for you?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So does that clip remind you of what you said in examination-in-chief?  It is, indeed, a skit that we have just seen; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Counsel.  
Q.	It's a little skit which is mimicking what happens in Kubohoza?  
A.	I don't know, because it begins with the speech that Mugenzi had made in Gikongoro, and then it continues with the -- pursuing someone who is brought down to the ground.  And then they say that we, the Interahamwe, we cannot accept these acts of violence.  And then I heard something like "Kubohoza" towards the end.  
Q.	So we are not dealing here with the arrest of the Tutsi enemy, are we?  
A.	There is a chase after having repeated what Mr. Mugenzi said in Gikongoro.  Mugenzi was, I believe, at the time, full chairman of the PL, and you know what trend it was for, the PL, at the time.  And then they pursue this man, and they bring him down.  They were carrying traditional weapons.  
Q.	And it ends by saying something about Kubohoza, did you say?  
A.	Yes.  They say that they cannot support acts committed within the Kubohoza system, but now when you're talking about them not accepting this, and then you see how the skit is, they're not pursuing an Interahamwe.  They're pursuing someone who is not of the MRND and is not a member of the MRND.  It must be an opponent or someone else.  
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  I want us to go over problems concerning the organisation of the Interahamwe very quickly.  I would like to have some explanation, given what you have already stated before the Court.  The Interahamwe did not have a constitution or statutes of an association or organisation of the Interahamwe, was there (sic)?  
A.	No.  
Q.	However, they did have a bank account, didn't they?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you tell us how the bank account was opened, if you know?  
A.	The members of the provisional national committee of the MRND went to the Banque de Kigali, which was managed by a member of the MRND.  His name was Cyril Bizimungu.  Yes, Cyril Bizimungu.  And they facilitated the opening of that account by the organisation, and the account name was "Interahamwes MRND." 
Q.	Can you please be shown P. 9?  Can you tell us, if you know, who were the signatories of that account?  
A.	Number 2 and number 5, and they were to sign together.  If either one was absent, it was number 1 who would replace the absent signatory.  
Q.	Was it into that account that members' contributions were paid -- deposited? 
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Who determined the amount of contributions to be made by members?  
A.	The amount of contributions was determined in one of the Wednesday meetings, and the members who were there, plus the members of the committee, as well as the founder members, those who initiated the Interahamwe organisation, it's that group of people who adopted the amount for contributions to be made.  
Q.	What was the amount of contributions?  
A.	If it wasn't 100, it was 200.  
Q.	Are you referring to Rwandan francs?  
A.	Yes, Rwandan francs, obviously.  
Q.	Was there only one amount for the contributions?  
A.	No.  Sometimes if there was something special that was being organised, there were what were known as special contributions, and anyone could give whatever amount he or she so wished, over and above the 1- or 200, maybe a thousand Rwandan francs or more.  
Q.	But that is voluntary contribution.  I'm talking about membership fees or dues.  Was it the same for everybody?  
A.	The fee was the same, but it wasn't obligatory.  It wasn't forced on members, because some members didn't have such amounts of money, and it was accepted as if it were some kind of credit allowed to such members.  
Q.	Now, the membership fee, was it paid on a monthly basis, on an annual basis, or was it only once at the time of membership -- the time of joining the organisation?  
A.	As far as I know, the membership fee was paid only once.
Q.	And, in principle, this was paid at the time when one received one's membership card?  
A.	No, that's something else.  The membership card, for one to receive that card, one needed to pay 50 Rwandan francs.  
Q.	So apart from the membership fee, there was the price of the membership card for the members of the Interahamwe?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And there was accounting which was done regarding the membership fees and the monies paid for the cards?  
A.	Yes, there were receipts which were to be given to members who were paying the fees and members who were buying membership cards.  
Q.	Who would sign the card?  If necessary, please use the names on P. 9.  Can you please tell us, who was the one who signed the membership cards?  
A.	It was number 1.  
Q.	Did he sign all the cards?  
A.	At the meeting which was held on Wednesdays, it had been agreed that the membership cards should only be signed by number 1.  
Q.	So number 1 must have signed a lot of cards?  
A.	I believe so, yes.  
Q.	You told us that from May 1992, the Interahamwe would join the organisations in préfectures.  At least that's what you told us.  
A.	Yes, that is correct.  
Q.	Were they many in number in all the préfectures, or were there any préfectures which didn't have any Interahamwe as members?  
A.	What I know is that it depended on the préfectures.  There were some which had many members and others which didn't.  
Q.	Do you recall the names of the officials in the préfectures?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Do you know if there were any meetings between the officials at préfecture levels and the individuals whose names appear on P. 9?  
A.	I know that there are some members of this group of 11 who would meet with the MRND officials at préfecture level.  
Q.	Yes, but my concern is that I want to understand how the membership into the organisation occurred at préfecture level.  What was the procedure?  
A.	I don't know how it happened.  I don't know what the procedure was.  The procedure was organised by each préfecture.  It was not controlled by the committee of the organisation.  
Q.	But there was, nonetheless, a membership card which was issued, wasn't there? 
A.	I don't know.  When the cards were established, these were cards which were established for the Interahamwe of the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  
Q.	So you're unaware whether the identity of Interahamwe members at préfecture level were registered?  
A.	I don't know how they organised themselves.  
Q.	And you don't know whether they had cards -- or membership cards for Interahamwe?  
A.	I don't know.  
Q.	Did it ever happen that number 1 signed cards without names being placed on the cards?  Did he ever sign any blanks?  
A.	I wouldn't be able to tell you because I didn't sign them -- I didn't see him sign these cards, so I wouldn't be able to confirm or deny what you've just said.  
Q.	Do you know who kept the blank cards before they were signed?  
A.	You know,******************.  The association had an office in the premises of the MRND offices, and there was a secretary who kept the keys.  And in that office, there were cards.  
Q.	Cards which were signed or blank cards?  
A.	Blank cards.  But I can tell you that when the Interahamwe were established in the various secteurs in Kigali préfecture.  Because number 1 was unable to be present at all the secteur (sic) -- and these meetings took place on Wednesdays.  If you were responsible for going to take the cards to a particular secteur, number 1 would sign blank cards, maybe 20 or 10 or so blank cards which he signed.  And when the people arrived at the particular secteur in Kigali, they would fill in the card, and they would also fill in the register.  
Q.	Did it ever occur that cards that were signed, though blank, may have gotten lost?  
A.	I'm not aware of any such occasion.  
Q.	But from what you've just said, one can understand that there wasn't too much officialdom in the establishment of the membership cards before it was signed -- before they were signed by number 1?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I believe we've lost the signal.  Just a moment.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  
MR. WEYL:
If I'm going to put my question again, I have to turn on my mike.  So let me repeat the question.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	If I were to put it to you that there was no very rigorous red tape in the proceedings -- in the procedure for signing the membership cards, would you agree with me or not?  
A.	What I know is that when the cards were supposed to be issued to members, these cards were given to one person who was to go to the particular secteur with cards that were signed.  Now, there was somewhere where the number of cards given to the person would be written down, and the person would sign the same place when he returned.  
Q.	And the register -- and the register of members was -- was signed off before the card was signed?  
A.	No.  You know, the cards came after the establishment of the organisation.  People were already in existence, and they were in the association, and they were not -- they did not have cards.  So when the cards were introduced, a register had to be introduced in order for the cards to be distributed to those who were always attending the Wednesday meetings.  
Q.	You're telling us that the cards were established when, exactly?  
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you the exact date, but it was in 1992.  As for what month, I wouldn't be able to tell you.  
Q.	Wasn't it during the initial meetings?  
A.	I would say maybe in January, February, because there was a problem with the youths from the other parties who were attending our meetings on Wednesdays.  And people started to recognise these people, and so they said that in order to have admission into the room where the meetings were being held every Wednesday, one needed a card.  So there was -- the cards were introduced, and there was monitoring.  So it was from that point on that they tried to introduce the membership cards, which had a photograph on it.  
Q.	So according to you, before the cards were established, people could join the organisation without receiving a card; they were simply put down in the register of members; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So there was a list of members as early as the initial meetings, which also stated whether or not they had paid their membership fee?  
A.	What I can tell you is that at every Wednesday meeting, every person who came to the meeting had to put their name and signature down in the register, which was always there.  
Q.	So there was an attendance sheet at the Wednesday meetings, in fact?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	That finishes the portion of my questions regarding the membership cards and the procedure for joining the organisation.  

Now, I want to talk about uniforms.  In your various statements, you talked about the Interahamwe uniform, and you said that it was also the MRND uniform initially; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	So it was not a specific, particular uniform exclusively for the Interahamwe?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Anyone could wear that uniform then?  
A.	I don't know.  I can't tell you.  I believe that it was for MRND members.  
Q.	Whatever their age may be?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Whatever sex they may be?  
A.	Yes.  
MR. WEYL:
With that answer, Mr. President, I think that I can avoid going into another video clip.  I wanted to show the witness a clip of Mr. Bizimungu's speech -- or, rather, Mr. Bizimungu's old mother who was wearing the uniform in Ruhengeri, but I think that we can save some of the Chamber's time with that answer.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good.  Thank you very much.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, did you, yourself, have a uniform?  
A.	I wore a cap from the party and a scarf.  That was my uniform.  
Q.	That wasn't exactly my question.  I wanted to know if you were given a uniform.  Did you have one?  
A.	I didn't buy the uniform, no.  
Q.	So members were not obliged to buy the uniform to participate in MRND meetings or initiatives, therefore?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Could someone pass as an Interahamwe if they were wearing the MRND uniform?  
A.	Could you repeat the question?  
Q.	Inversely, suppose a young man wore an MRND uniform.  Could he be considered or taken as an Interahamwe member?  
A.	I believe that anyone who wore the MRND uniform wasn't necessarily an Interahamwe.  They could pass as a simple member of the MRND.  
Q.	Was it easy to get a uniform?  
A.	I can't tell you how they were purchased, but I think it was easy.  At one point the fabric was made in Rwanda.  And there were some merchants who went to buy fabric in Nairobi, and they made the uniforms there, that that was their business.  Some of them engaged in that kind of business.  So it was rather easy to get a uniform.  In fact, I know a member of the committee who had received an order from the MRND.  He went all the way to Nairobi to fill the order and have the uniforms made there.  So, yes, it was easy to get an MRND uniform.  
Q.	Let me remind you of a statement that you made to the investigators of a certain country.  This is K0151611.  In that document, you said that the uniforms before were sold at the MRND office, but since it became a business, one could also buy them in shops.  One could also buy them at the tailor shop, at Odette's shop, who would make the uniforms.  Later on, at K0151612, you say, "Before, payments for the uniforms were made to the MRND office.  Later on, you could buy them at the retailers."  Do you confirm that statement, in fact, Witness?  In fact, today you are confirming the prior statement you made.  
A.	What you have just read is, indeed, true.  
Q.	So it was very easy to get a uniform?  
A.	Yes, it was very easy.  You could buy them everywhere.  
Q.	There was no uniform rationing, therefore?  
A.	I told you, it became a business.  People made money.  The fabric was not expensive.  The uniform was not expensive.  
Q.	You may know this saying:  "Don't judge a book by its cover."  I'm sure you know that one.  So the uniform doesn't make the Interahamwe, to draw that parallel.  
A.	No.  I remember there was a communiqué that was published by the national committee, requesting the Interahamwe to stop wearing the uniforms at one point in time, because there were other people who were wearing the uniforms and who were committing depredations, and so this was blamed on the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you once again are making this very easy for me.  That was, indeed, the question that came next.  To remind you of D. NZ17, you also talked about this exhibit.  I think that I can save some of the Chamber's time simply by mentioning that document.  And so I've finished with that question.  
So, in fact, wearing the MRND uniform was not proof that someone belonged to the Interahamwes MRND initially; correct?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And even less it proved that they belonged to the Interahamwes MRND during the tragic period of April to July 1994?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Let me now move on to military training and the issues surrounding that.  Witness, did you receive any military training personally?  
A.	No, sir.  
Q.	So I can say -- no, in fact, let me ask you another question.  Did you ever watch any military training sessions?  
A.	No.  
Q.	You never saw instructors training young recruits; you never saw that with your own eyes?  
A.	No, sir.  
Q.	Were you invited to undergo training?  
A.	No, sir.  
Q.	Did you request to undergo training?  
A.	No, sir.  
Q.	Was there someone who decided who would receive training, or "if" the Interahamwe would receive training?  
A.	I can't tell you.  I'm not aware of that.  
Q.	To your knowledge, there was no type of rotation for participants in military training?  
A.	According to what number 9 said, after the 6th of April, he said number 6 convened people and sent them to the training centres.  
Q.	Did you see number 6 sending people to training camps?  
A.	What I've just said is that number 9 told me that.  I didn't see number 6 do that personally.  
Q.	In summary, you heard about training; you heard people talk about training?  
A.	Yes.  And number 9 confirmed it for me.  I met with him, and he was at a training location.  
Q.	According to what you were told, how long did the military training last?  
A.	I think between two and three months.  
Q.	According to you, people would leave for two to three months to undergo military training?  
A.	That's what I heard.  One, two, maybe three months, that's what I heard.  
Q.	So some of your friends disappeared for two or three months?  
A.	Yes.  One of my friends I met with returned from that training, and he told me as much. 
Q.	And you hadn't seen him for two or three months?  
A.	Two, maybe three months, something like that.  
Q.	You told us that with that training, the Interahamwe became bodyguards for MRND officials.  Do you remember saying that?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Don't you think it would have been easier for the officials who wanted bodyguards to simply recruit bodyguards who had already been trained?  Were there trained bodyguards in Kigali at the time who were already trained?  
A.	I don't believe Kigali had a security service that already existed.  I'm not sure.  
Q.	You told us that former soldiers were recruited at that time.  Perhaps it would have been easier for former soldiers to become bodyguards without having to become Interahamwe.  
A.	Let me tell you, at one point in time, when the Interahamwe were created in the préfectures -- and I believe I said this during my examination-in-chief -- important and wealthy members of the MRND created their own Interahamwe.  They fed them.  They led them.  They funded them.  Those Interahamwe were used as their bodyguards.  
Q.	I'm having difficulty following, Witness.  You're telling us that MRND personalities recruited Interahamwe?  Is that what you're telling us?  
A.	They created groups of Interahamwe.  They funded and fed those groups -- that group of -- those groups of Interahamwe, and they were called Interahamwe because they wore Interahamwe uniforms, or MRND uniforms.  Those young people were used as bodyguards.  
Q.	According to what you said earlier, the uniform didn't make the Interahamwe.  What I understood is that to be an Interahamwe, you would become a member; you would receive a card from the Interahamwe organisation.  So what makes you say that personalities would recruit Interahamwe and make bodyguards out of them?  
A.	Let me point something out for you.  After the congress of April 1992, at one point, the Interahamwe were created in the préfectures.  Those specific Interahamwe in the préfectures -- let's talk about Kigali-ville préfecture, for example -- they were not under the control of the national committee.  They had a préfecture coordinator in Kigali.  That person was in charge of the Interahamwe in Kigali-ville préfecture.  So what I'm telling you, I've seen these things with my own eyes.  I went with someone, high-ranking person, to the MRND -- from the MRND, rather, to his home.  He confirmed to me and showed me that there were -- there was a shop in a container.  It was for those Interahamwe.  Those Interahamwe were used as guards at his home outside of Kigali.  The container was on the road, leading into Kigali.  Every time there were demonstrations by the MRND, he ordered them to close down the road so that supplies could not get into Kigali.  It's just one case in point.  
Q.	But that case you raise really deals with activities that took place without any control by the normal Interahamwe structure?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	And those activities were under no control by MRND structures?  
A.	That's correct.  
Q.	There's one more thing I still have trouble understanding.  You told us that at one point in time, the Interahamwe started to include people who were unemployed; demobilised soldiers also began to join; they were looking for a means of survival.  Is that what you said?  
A.	There was one Wednesday meeting.  During that meeting, Mr. Murenzi said that the MRND, since it held many of the ministerial posts -- in fact, at that time, I think they had all of the parastatal companies and all of the ministry seats -- he said that the MRND would have employment for those unemployed people, and in the parastatal companies, which were represented by MRND members, or led by them.  Those unemployed members or those reservist soldiers became Interahamwe.  They took advantage of the opportunity.  They were hired in the ministries or in those parastatal companies for all types of different jobs.  They took advantage of the situation.  
Q.	So according to you, young interested people could join the Interahamwe simply out of their immediate and personal interests?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	What if another political party offered them more?  Do you believe they would remain members of the Interahamwe, or would they have joined a different political party which was offering more?  
A.	The MRND was able to do that because they had the resources.  The others did not.  If there was another party that had the same rank or importance of the MRND, those unemployed people may very well have joined that party.  
Q.	Nevertheless, Witness, people joined the movement out of their own personal interests; those were the people who were trusted the most, who would ensure the security of the party; is that correct?  
A.	The unemployed included people who weren't just criminals or bandits.  There were people who had the skills but who were unemployed.  They were employable.  Weren't simply going to recruit someone who smoked marijuana or was not capable of being a bodyguard.  There were people who were reservists.  They had the skills to become bodyguards.  
Q.	In your mind, they were the most trustworthy; the high-ranking political officials could put their trust in them?  
A.	Everyone had their job to do.  I wasn't going to be asked to guard an MRND official's home.  There were other people who had that job, not me.  And not everyone would do it, not petty criminals, for example.  
Q.	To your knowledge, did UNAMIR provide security for MRND officials?  
A.	Not to my knowledge.  
Q.	To your knowledge, did Mathieu Ngirumpatse have a personal bodyguard who was a member of the Interahamwe?  
A.	I did not see Ngirumpatse with an Interahamwe bodyguard.  
Q.	And yet Mathieu Ngirumpatse was one of the highest ranking MRND officials.  
A.	I didn't go to his house.  I didn't go to Karemera's house.  I did go to Nzirorera's house.  I never saw Mathieu with an Interahamwe, save for those occasions when there were popular rallies at Nyamirambo stadium.  Now, there, he was always escorted by Interahamwe.  
Q.	You mean there was an escort at the rallies, and the escort included Interahamwe; but you didn't see Mathieu Ngirumpatse, on any other occasion, avail himself of personal bodyguards?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Just to wrap up with these issues of security and how different officials could have security provided for them, UNAMIR did have RPF protection in January 1994? 
A.	Yes.  I believe the RPF had brought 600 soldiers who were used as security.  That was in the agreement.  
Q.	UNAMIR did not escort vehicles belonging to the RPF when they left their camp?  
A.	Yes.  Yes, they did.  
Q.	Do you remember which UNAMIR contingent provided such security or which battalion?  
A.	I can't tell you.  I believe it was the Belgians.  
Q.	Perhaps I can provide you further information with regard to that security detail, but I want to finish this discussion with regard to the Belgian UNAMIR contingent.  You brought it up.  According to you, the Belgian UNAMIR contingent provided security for the RPF.  What was the situation with regard to legitimate Rwandan authorities?  How did the Belgian contingent work with them?  
A.	I know many wrongful acts were committed in Kigali.  They arrested, for example, certain Rwandan officials, and they attacked members of the MRND who were wearing the MRND uniforms.  
Q.	You even said that the Belgian UNAMIR contingent ran around as if it was a conquered country.  You brought up the names of certain officials who were disturbed or attacked by the Belgian UNAMIR contingent.  Do you remember what happened to the chief of general staff of the Rwandan army?  
A.	Who?  
Q.	The chief of general staff, Nsabimana.  
A.	I didn't quite understand the question.  
Q.	Do you remember that the chief of general staff was attacked by members of the Belgian UNAMIR contingent?  
A.	I don't think that the Belgian contingent of UNAMIR would have dared attack Kastar (phonetic) --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I didn't quite get that name.  
THE WITNESS:
Kastar would be -- attacking Kastar would be like attacking the army.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	You don't know that this was what led to the summons of the head of the UNAMIR by President Habyarimana?  
A.	I'm not aware of that, Counsel.  
Q.	Do you think that the Bangladesh UNAMIR contingent was more neutral than the Belgian UNAMIR contingent?  
A.	You know, in UNAMIR, when the Belgian contingent was suggested to be the team to ensure security in Kigali, you know, the MRND had refused, and the Belgian -- that the Belgian contingent replace the French soldiers in Kigali.  But they were forced to accept because the government in place so decided.  

And so the Belgian contingent, when it came to Kigali, they were already not wanted by a group of people, and they had problems with the French, and they also had problems with the members of the MRND.  As for the Bangladeshi, they didn't have any problems entering Kigali, and I wouldn't say that they were more reliable or more trusted by Rwandans.  I wouldn't be able to tell you that.  But the Belgian contingent had problems in Kigali.  
Q.	So you don't know whether it was the Bangladeshi UNAMIR contingent that was responsible for security at the surroundings of the CND when the RPF battalion was set up, or posted there, close to the CND?  
A.	No.  I know that there was UNAMIR guards here and there, but I wouldn't know because when the president was the transitional president, there was the Bangladeshi contingent at the entrance to the CND.  That is true, yes.  
Q.	Do you know that Colonel Marchal accused the Bangladeshi UNAMIR contingent of being extremely incompetent?  
A.	No.  
Q.	You don't know that Colonel Marchal, when he assessed the effectiveness of the Bangladeshi, gave them between zero and one, out of a scale of ten?  
A.	No.  I didn't follow that incident, no.  
Q.	So you don't know either that Colonel Marchal accused them of complicity with the RPF, allowing them to leave, come and go without any control, even when they were bearing weapons?  They were unable to -- they were unable to even remove a barrier which was erected in order to control the comings and goings of the members of the RPF?  
A.	No, I didn't hear that from Colonel Marchal.  
Q.	So all you know is one thing, that there was -- or maybe you don't know, but do you know that there were frequent fights between the Belgian contingent of UNAMIR and the Bangladeshi contingent of UNAMIR?  
A.	I believe I heard only of one such fight.  
Q.	And during that time, nor (sic) the Belgian contingent, nor the Bangladeshi contingent was responsible for security for Mathieu Ngirumpatse?  
A.	No.  
Q.	Now, I want to move into another point dealing with weapons.  I'm going to do this -- I believe, Mr. President, we still have the break as 1330.  I'll try and go about this quickly.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you confirm that you knew Kassim very well or Jean Pierre Turatsinze -- is that the names?  
A.	Yes, I saw him on several occasions.  
Q.	You would say often, would you?  
A.	No, I wouldn't say often.  
Q.	So would you say regularly?  
A.	During the two-year period, I saw him on several occasions.  
Q.	But you wouldn't be able to recognise him from a photograph, would you?  
A.	You know, it's many years since I've seen him, and since he wasn't my friend as such, we didn't have anything to talk about.  He wasn't close to me.  It would be difficult for me to remember his face.  
Q.	And yet you rely quite a lot on faces, don't you?  
A.	Yes.  If I'm talking about friends, yes, and people who are close to me, yes.  
Q.	And yet you easily recognised -- simply by face, you can make out a Tutsi from a Hutu, just by looking at them? 
A.	Well, sometimes it's not very easy.  
Q.	Actually, I was going to ask you a question because, for me, it's a really big question mark.  How can one tell from the face of someone that that person is a Tutsi or a Hutu?  
A.	I'm not a specialist in that area, because sometimes you can make a mistake.  They say that they have an aquiline nose, and that they are tall, and that they are -- they have a light complexion, but sometimes there are Hutus who -- it's also said that Hutus have flat noses and the Tutsis have an aquiline nose, a fine nose.  So it is difficult to say certainly that this is a Tutsi and that's a Hutu sometimes.  
Q.	Now, what happens to people whose parents belong to either one group?  What happens in such a situation to the children?  
A.	In Rwanda, the children take the nationality of their fathers.  
Q.	Do you mean -- 
A.	I meant the ethnic group and even nationality.  
Q.	We were speaking about ethnic groups, because I'm sure you had a slip of the tongue when you came to us here on the first day when you were being asked by the Prosecutor who -- what was your nationality was (sic), and I believe you said "Hutu," and I was a bit surprised.  But, anyway, according to you, the children of a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother are Hutu, are they?  
A.	Please can you repeat your question?  I didn't quite understand.
Q.	The children of a couple, in which the mother is a Tutsi and the father is Hutu, are Hutu, are they?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	If a child -- if a Hutu child looks more like his mother, his Tutsi mother, nonetheless, he remains a Hutu?  
A.	Yes.
Q.	So how are you able to tell us that during meetings of the PL, it was admitted that they were Hutus just by merely looking at them?  
A.	If I said that, it's because I was using that as a principle.  You know, you see someone.  You can say that that person is a Hutu or Twa or Tutsi.  And if I said that I realised that in the Parti libéral, there were many Tutsis, it's because many of these people who were in that party were known to me.  
Q.	So it's not a matter of physical appearance that one can determine whether one is Hutu or Tutsi, it depends on your personal knowledge of the person?  
A.	I think that it is very easy in Rwanda to recognise which family is Hutu or Tutsi, because everybody knows everybody.  
Q.	So it's because it's very easy that when you left your home on the 9th of April 1994, and you were walking in the streets of Kigali, you were able to identify the victims because -- as being Tutsi because from a distance they appeared to be so, to you?  
A.	I was with others who had manned those roadblocks, and on the 9th of April, everybody knew what was happening.  The killings that were taking place were of Tutsis.  It's the Tutsis that were being killed and some opponents -- I don't know how many, but the majority, 90 per cent of the dead were Tutsi.  And the people with whom I was were telling me that.  And then the area, the area through which we passed with these people, it was the area which was lived in by Tutsis, many Tutsis -- unless you want to say that there was no killing of many Tutsis in Rwanda --  in Kigali more so?  
Q.	Well, Mr. Witness, I'm not saying anything.  I'm listening to you, and in your answers, you have not said that there was something -- as you did a few days ago -- something to tell you that these people were Tutsi.  
A.	I have answered you.  I will not answer you further on that question.  I was with people.  I was with people who had manned those roadblocks or who had gone through those roadblocks, and they told me.  And in the radio, the killings were encouraged, and instructions were given as to how the Tutsis looked like.  And I really have nothing more to add.  
Q.	I'm happy with your answer.  I'm satisfied with your answer.  

Now, let's come back to Turatsinze, who, according to you, was allegedly the go-between in the supply of weapons to the Interahamwe; is that what you said?  
A.	Not only was he the go-between, this Turatsinze was Mathieu Ngirumpatse's go-between with the Interahamwe.  
Q.	You stated that you saw weapons in the home of number 1 of P. 9.  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Can you please specify under what circumstances that sighting took place?  
A.	I went to visit number 1 on P. 9, and on that occasion, I believe he wanted to hide the weapons which he had in his possession.  So he was putting them in sacks with people who were there, so that he could find a place to hide them in his house.  That's what happened on that occasion.  
Q.	Can you please specify the period of time or give us an approximate estimate?  
A.	It was in 1993.  I cannot be more specific about the period of time.  
Q.	So you saw these weapons because you had gone to the home of number 1, and at that point in time, the weapons were in open view?  
A.	Yes.  
Q.	Do you know who had brought them there?  
A.	You know, those weapons were spoken of well before I saw them in the home of number 1.  There was a rumour circulating in the group of the Interahamwe, a rumour according to which Turatsinze had received 800 pieces.  And out of those 800, he gave 400 to number 1, half, in order that they be distributed to the various secteurs.  So you will understand that I was aware of this matter concerning the weapons.  
Q.	So when you saw the weapons, there was already a rumour circulating about the disappearance of half of the weapons?  
A.	Yes.  Because people were circulating that rumour, according to which, number 1 and Turatsinze had organised that alleged loss of the 400 weapons so that they could sell them and get money.  And it was said that they shared the proceeds.  
Q.	When you saw the weapons in the home of number 1, they were not in cases or boxes, were they?  
A.	No, I didn't see the boxes, but -- I didn't see where they came from.  All I could see was that they were being placed in sacks or bags.  That's all.  
Q.	So were you able to count them?  
A.	No.  
Q.	So you have no idea how many weapons were stored at the home of number 1 on that occasion?  
A.	No.  I knew that he allegedly received the 400, but the number that he kept in his house, I wouldn't know.  
Q.	So you didn't know whether he had 10, 20, or a hundred, 400, or 800 weapons in the home of number 1? 
A.	I'm unable to determine the number of weapons which were in the home of number 1.  The fact remains that these weapons, maybe some of them had already been distributed to the various secteurs.  
Q.	But you didn't know about the number of weapons, nor where they came from, except through the rumour that you'd heard?  
A.	But at a meeting subsequently, after UNAMIR had wanted to seize the weapons, at that point, I knew that the weapons had been distributed and that the weapons had come from Mathieu, who was the chairman of the MRND at the time.  
Q.	That is what you are saying to us now, but I'm talking about the weapons whose existence you mentioned to be at the home of number 1.  I'm talking about those weapons that you saw in the home of number 1, and you don't have any idea about their number.  You have nothing to tell us about where they came from except from the rumour that you'd heard.  
A.	I don't remember very well.  
Q.	Do you know whether number 1's house was ever searched?  
A.	No.  
Q.	You told us that according to the rumours circulating about weapons, you told us that number 1 had also been accused for participating in arms trafficking with Jean Pierre.  Do you remember?  
A.	Yes.  That dealt with the 800 weapons.  Four-hundred were given to number 1, and the remaining 400, the Interahamwe group had circulated the weapons that -- these people had sold the remainder.  
Q.	Did you discuss any of this with number 1?  
A.	What I spoke of with number 1 was the weapons that he had.  He told me that those weapons were supposed to be distributed by him to the various secteurs and that he had already began the distribution to the various secteurs in Kigali.  
Q.	And did he mention Jean Pierre to you? 
A.	Yes, he told me about Jean Pierre, and he said that those weapons came from Mathieu, who had given them to Jean Pierre.  
Q.	That wasn't quite what I wanted to ask you.  I wanted to know whether number 1 told you that Jean Pierre was suspected of having stolen 400 of the weapons.  
A.	No.  
Q.	You never mentioned with number 1 the disappearance -- the disappearance of the weapons, did you?  
A.	No.  I spoke of that disappearance with someone else, but not number 1.  
Q.	You never spoke with number 1 about the rumours which accused him of arms trafficking?  
A.	I don't remember.  
Q.	Were you in touch with the ministry of defence?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I'm a bit disturbed.  Maybe I'll conclude after the lunch break.  But I have just a few questions on this line, and then I wouldn't be far from concluding.  I still have a few more points that I want to cover, but I will have finished before we close -- before the afternoon break.  I'm trying to make a promise, but I think this will be the case at this present pace, before the afternoon break.  So maybe I can leave my last questions to the first half of this afternoon's session.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  So it's convenient now to go for lunch; right?  
MR. WEYL:
If you agree, Mr. President, I think that will be the best solution.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  Thank you very much.  

We take the luncheon adjournment now.  

I'm sorry.  Let me make one enquiry.  Mr. Morley, if Mr. Weyl does finish before the afternoon break, is there any chance that you'd finish before close of court today, or should we --  
MR. MORLEY:
No.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay.  

Mr. Registrar, perhaps it's -- you can advise the other witness that he does not have to appear this afternoon.  
MR. FRY:
Okay.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, that would mean that we won't continue with you until tomorrow.  
MR. ROBINSON:
Okay. 
(Court recessed at 1333H) 
(Pages 15 to 31 by Wendy Molnar)

























(Court resumed at 1540H)  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everybody.  

Mr. Weyl, we are ready to recommence. 
MR. WEYL:
I'm ready, Mr. President.  Thank you. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, are you ready?  Are you ready to respond to my questions? 
A.	Yes, Counsel.  Thank you. 
Q.	Witness, I want to raise the issue of weapons once again.  Were you in contact with the minister of defence? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Were you in contact with General Ndindiliyimana? 
A.	I didn't hear the name, Counsel. 
Q.	Ndin -- Ndindiliyimana.  
A.	I also have difficulty with that name. 
Q.	Yes, you've understood.  You've come to my rescue.  That's the person.  Were you in contact with him? 
A.	No, sir. 
Q.	Did you ever go to any meetings between the general and the minister of defence? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Did you ever see Mr. Ngirumpatse with him or with one of them? 
A.	No. 
Q.	So you never witnessed any such meetings? 
A.	No, sir.  I can't tell you.  I never saw Ndindiliyimana with those people -- rather, Ngirumpatse with those people. 
Q.	Very well.  So, when you say that Mr. Ngirumpatse informed that there was going to be an imminent search because he got the information from the general or from the minister, that is information that you obtained through hearsay? 
A.	Yes.  I learned it from someone.  I trusted that person who told me. 
Q.	How do you explain that, in his book, Colonel Marchal doesn't make any mention whatsoever of this? 
A.	I didn't read the book and I don't know why.  All I can tell you is what I heard.  I'm only talking about my own experience, not someone else's.  I'm telling you what I heard. 
Q.	Very well.  Do you know that one theory about Mr. Turatsinze is that he was a crook.  Did you ever hear that Turatsinze was a fraud? 
A.	No.  
Q.	He was someone who was involved in trafficking? 
A.	I do believe a Belgian official or soldier in Kigali said that he was not a fraud. 
Q.	Did you know that Faustin Twagiramungu thought that Mr. Turatsinze was perhaps a fraud?  I think that same Twagiramungu had put Turatsinze in touch with UNAMIR.  Perhaps Faustin Twagiramungu had that information from experience.  But are you aware of an accident with a Pajero near the CND and in that Pajero weapons were found? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you believe that the weapons in that Pajero were going to the RPF? 
A.	At that time what I heard is that those weapons were going to Burundi. 
Q.	Was that logical that they would be near the CND where the RPF was if, indeed, they were on their way to Burundi? 
A.	Well, it was a main road in Kigali.  It came from the airport.  That's all together possible. 
Q.	So you exclude the possibility all together that Turatsinze was an RPF agent? 
A.	You should ask your client.  Your client trusted him.  He was the one who put him in contact -- who put him as the go-between with the organisation. 
Q.	I would prefer you answer the question, rather than asking me a question.  That's not my role.  Can you please just answer the question.  Do you exclude the possibility that General Pierre, alias Kassim, alias Turatsinze was an RPF agent? 
A.	I don't know. 
Q.	Thank you.  I would like to wrap up the discussion with the period regarding a period just before the tragedy.  I would like to talk about the formation of youth groups and massacres that may have been committed.  I want to look at it in an isolated manner.  When the Prosecutor was questioning you early last week, he, himself, talked about certain massacres and asked you if any of the perpetrators were tried or punished, and you said, to your knowledge, that they were not.  I asked you if you remember the 400 persons who were detained, who were in Kigali gaols in April 1992 when Mathieu Ngirumpatse left the ministry of justice, and you said that that reminded you of something.  I want to ask you if you know about a commission of inquiry about the problems in Kibuye in August 1992.  It was launched by the prime minister.  Are you aware of that commission of inquiry? 
A.	I don't recall very well. 
Q.	You don't remember that, following the ethnic problems in Kibuye, a decision was made to set up a position of inquiry which included representatives of the prime minister, representatives of the ministry of the interior, the defence, the minister of justice, information, and the chief of staff of the president, as well as political party representatives.  This does not ring a bell for you, Witness? 
A.	I read the documents that you sent here, and, indeed, it did refresh my memory a bit.  I was able to remember that a commission, indeed, was set up. 
Q.	Did it help you to recall that the commission drafted a report in November 1992? 
A.	Yes, sir. 
Q.	That report talks about the causes of the massacres that were committed in August 1992.  
A.	Yes, I read that. 
Q.	Do you remember that those disturbances were blamed on the war of October 1990 which revived some of the ethnic hatreds? 
A.	Yes, I read that. 
Q.	You read it?  Does it remind you of anything? 
A.	Yes.  I know in 1992 there was unrest amongst the youth groups, and I believe there were also killings at that time.  That's what I can say. 
Q.	And you recall that the commission was set up to find out what the causes were, and what possible remedies were, and possible solutions.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I would seek to tender into evidence the document at tab 273 of the Prosecution's binders.  In fact, this document is a report of the prime minister of 17 September 1992, and it is K0010753 (sic) and it goes up to K -- unfortunately I do not have a legible copy -- K010766.  I would request that it be tendered into evidence and marked Exhibit D. NG4, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, it's -- how many languages is it being tendered in?  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I can only tender one version, the one disclosed by the Prosecution which happens to be in French, which, in fact, is the original document which was in French.  The report was drafted in French. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted.  Admitted into evidence.
(Exhibit No. D. NG4 admitted)
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, would you be surprised if I were to tell you that the report established in September 1992 talked about the failures of the Kibuye Prosecutor's office because the Prosecutor talks about the late intervention of that Prosecutor's office? 
A.	I believe that is what is written in the report.  This is the first time that I've read this report.  It is right here and now.  But I did know that a commission was set up. 
Q.	Would you be surprised if I told you that the report also talks about the diligent intervention of the armed forces, contrary, therefore, to the intervention of the Prosecutor's office? 
A.	Everything's in the report that you've given me. 
Q.	Would you be surprised if I were to tell you, or remind you, that the report stigmatised the role played by Radio Muhabura with regard to the massacres that occurred in Kibuye? 
A.	I do not know how to answer you.  Everything you were saying is in the report.  I cannot contradict what the people wrote down and submitted in the report. 
Q.	But you would agree with me that, in looking at this report, the authorities were not insensitive to the unrest that occurred, and they worked diligently to find solutions to prevent anything like that happening again? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Thank you.  In the same line, Witness, were you aware of a report that was written upon a request from the minister of interior?  The report dealt with the behaviour of youth groups of political parties in Cukiro, Kicukiro, Nyarugenge and Kamembe communes; a report which apparently was published in December 1992.  
A.	I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	I asked you to examine a document.  It's the report about the behaviour of the youth groups.  Did that document not help to refresh your memory? 
A.	You know, there were commissions set up to investigate things, and these were inter-ministerial or between the prime minister and other ministers.  I didn't receive copies of those reports, as you can tell from where you are. 
Q.	No, but I suppose that when a commission is set up and it is given a mission to accomplish, it is a public matter, and the report and conclusions of the commission become public.  
A.	I don't believe so.  In fact, I don't remember.  I thought it was an internal matter. 
Q.	That could explain that early last week, in response to a Prosecution question, you were very careful, and you responded that, to your knowledge, the conclusions were not always given with regard to the matters raised by the authorities.  So this could be imperfect knowledge -- this could be the result of the imperfect knowledge of the situation.  
A.	I don't know how to respond to you.  Investigations were commissioned.  Sometimes the results were broadcast over the radio.  Sometimes the investigations were a matter between two ministries, or ministers and the prime minister, or perhaps they gave copies to the political parties, copies of the results.  Not all of the commissions that were created broadcast the results of their report and their conclusions over the radio. 
Q.	Witness, you read the report.  Just like me, you must have seen, for example, that this time the JDR attacked the CDR and the MRND and tore down their CDR flags.  One member of the CDR, called Nyagama (phonetic), was arrested.  He had a pistol.  Does this remind you of any of the incidents that were made public in November 1992? 
A.	No, Counsel, I don't remember that.  I don't remember.  Many things happened.  Some things I remember, some I do not. 
Q.	You read the report and, no doubt, just like me, on page 5, you must have seen that leaders of the MDR, PL, PSD, and PDC parties had promised that the demonstrations of 17 November would be conducted peacefully; is that correct, Witness? 
A.	I can't find that, Counsel.  There are some illegible pages.  
Q.	This is page 5 of the document, K00 -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Mr. President, could counsel repeat the K-numbers?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, there is a request for you to repeat the K-numbers. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President. 

Yes.  This is the document under tab 68 which bears number K0503075 to K0503089. 

Mr. President, I would have asked to tender this document into evidence.  I've tried to lay the foundation with regard to the document through the witness, but as it was not possible with some other cases, I nevertheless don't think there should be any objection to it being tendered into evidence since it is a Prosecution document.  If the Chamber agrees with me, I would request that the document, indeed, be tendered, and bear exhibit number D. NG5. 
(Exhibit No. D. NG5 admitted)
MR. WEBSTER:
I haven't had an opportunity to look at this particular document right now.  Mr. Weyl explains that it is a Prosecution document.  I don't doubt that because we've served over 300 documents in our exhibit bundle.  But as I have requested previously when Mr. Weyl was on his feet, if he had provided us with a list of the documents he is going to use with the witness, then we'd look at these materials before we even come to Court.  The fact that we've served it, doesn't mean that I have it at hand.  As a practical matter, we have been shifting courtrooms for the last three weeks.  I don't have the document in front of me, and I would prefer to have it as the testimony is ongoing. 

The last document that Mr. Weyl mentioned, I didn't get the tab for it.  I believe he said that one document was at 273, and that's already entered at D. NG4.  But the document he's trying to move now, could he please repeat the tab number and we will try to have a look at it.  The problem we have with the admission of these items is how they are being used, because, in principle, all of these things can come into evidence.  That's not our issue.  But the way things have been proceeding, we have been using documents in a way that I hadn't anticipated because, even if something is in evidence, that doesn't mean that it relieves the moving party from laying some sort of foundation when they place it before a witness.  So, for example, if we had our investigator testify as the first witness, which is what we anticipated, and all of these exhibits came into evidence with the very first witness before any factual elements were listed on the record, that's how we would like to proceed.  But that does not open the door for the Defence to simply take an exhibit that's admitted in evidence and put it before a witness.  He still has to lay some sort of foundation to make the exhibit itself relevant to that witness's testimony.  And unless we adapt -- unless we clarify how we're proceeding, then it is a problem to admit documents without foundation.  

If the foundation is required for the question, then it's not an issue.  We could admit all of these things into evidence.  But the way we have been proceeding, we put documents in front of witnesses, we ask them questions, and no foundation is there to establish the relevance of that document for the particular questions being asked.  So I leave it to the Court's discretion.  I think we've made our position clear, and we need some direction from the Trial Chamber on how we are going to go forward with this issue. 

Again, if he could remind us of the tab. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, tabs 68 -- I'm surprised by Mr. Webster's objection in the sense that, in my correspondence, I expressly mentioned which documents I was going to use during my cross-examination.  That was disclosed on Thursday morning.  So, since Thursday morning there should be no surprise.  It should not be surprising that I raise this document.  I, furthermore, transmitted the documents to The Hague, to the registry there, who I would like to thank.  But from the very beginning I have made this known. 

Now, with regard to laying a sufficient foundation to use this document, I think, Mr. President, that you brought up the fact that, during Witness G's testimony, there was a somewhat lax approach with regard to the examination in-chief which you said may be more strictly applied or tightened later on.  But during his examination in-chief the Prosecution had that latitude.  With regard to the irrelevance of this document, either the witness remembers it and we can discuss it, or he does not remember it.  But he answered the Prosecution by saying to his knowledge that not much was done by the authorities.  

I think that I can contradict his knowledge using elements.  He can have the same view of the authorities' actions, but here we have a document that establishes what the authorities did to stop some of the behaviour of the youth groups.  And at any rate, I think I have, in that way, laid a sufficient foundation for the document. 
THE WITNESS:
Let me tell you, Counsel, that the document under tab 68 has just now been received by me.  I have not yet been able to read the document yet. 
MR. WEYL:
There must have been a misunderstanding.  Thursday, at noon, before we took the luncheon break, I had suggested that the two documents, 273 and 68, those being the tab numbers, be read by the witness before I conduct my cross-examination and this was done on Thursday afternoon. 

MS. TALON:
Mr. President, there was no misunderstanding.  But Mr. Weyl, in his mail, did point out that it may have been possible that he was going to use the documents.  He was not certain that documents in the first paragraph of his correspondence were given to the witness who received them.  

Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much. 

Well, Mr. Weyl, it is clear that your application is premature, so you will have to move forward a bit further. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I have noted your observations. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Witness, do you think that the judicial authorities were diligent enough in the prevention of acts of violence committed by some youth movements? 
A.	All these troublemakers -- let me take the example of the Interahamwe -- even if the Prosecutor's office were to have arrested them, they would only have spent one or two nights in a gaol, maybe at the brigade of the gendarmerie, and two days later they were released.  That's what I can tell you. 
Q.	So, if the commission referred to the omissions of the Office of the Prosecutor --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Counsel is quoting at some rapid pace and he has not told us where the quotation is coming from, 
Mr. President.  I'm sorry, I haven't been able to do anything about that quote.  
THE WITNESS:
I believe it was on the 25th November 1992. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness -- Mr. Weyl, the English translators were not able to get you.  You were going a bit fast for them and you did not give a reference from which you were quoting. 
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, I had put on my table something to remind me that I should go slowly and, in my haste, my note to myself has disappeared and I haven't been looking at it since the beginning, so I will read again very slowly.  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Your own perception of what happened in November 1992, is it that the operations of the Office of the Prosecutor were not rapid, nor effective enough; it would seem even that the Office of the Prosecutor unjustifiably released some persons that had been arrested.  Does that go along with what you, yourself, felt at the time? 
A.	I told you that the Office of the Prosecutor detained some troublemakers, and some of them would only spend one or two nights in gaol, and then they would be released.  The demonstrations took place on the 27th of November, I believe, and the commission was established in December.  People had been placed in the gaols and they were released, and the commission was established so that it could determine who was at the source of the disturbances.  But people had already been released.  So would it have been the Office of the Prosecutor, or the ones who released those people from prison before the investigations were carried out, who was wrong or who is lax?
Q.	This is approximately what is being said by the report when I have -- which I have here when it says that the Office of the Prosecutor released people who were put in detention without informing the relevant administrative authorities.  
A.	Why, I do not know. 
Q.	You, yourself, mentioned that there was a lack of cooperation between the military, administrative, and judicial authorities.  The gendarmes on patrol would rest -- would sit with their arms crossed when they saw disturbances, and they would claim that it was someone else's job to put an end to such disturbances.  Does this go along with what you, yourself, saw at the time? 
A.	I don't know what you want of me, but I know that I was clear on this issue. 
Q.	Do you know that it had been suggested that, in order to strengthen the cooperation between the services responsible for security and safety, the commission recalled the recommendation for the need to establish a national security commission -- commission or committee? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know that a committee or commission suggested that the government needed to ensure that laws were strictly applied in terms of the security or safety of persons and property because, in that manner, all troublemakers would be punished? 
A.	That was their duty. 
Q.	But as far as you know, there was no follow-up to those recommendations, were there? 
A.	I told you all I can say on this matter on which you need answers from me, and I have nothing further to add. 
Q.	Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEYL:
Mr. President, Your Honours, I would like to come back to my request that the document, under tab 68, K0503075 to 3089, be admitted as an exhibit, as D. NG5. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We have one or two concerns about the process, but we think it probably might be better to wait until our status conference on Friday to discuss these issues. 
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President, for that solution which to me seems to be quite fair.  So this would be document -- Exhibit D. NG5 for the record. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, I now wish to look at what happened on the 7th of April 1994 whilst you were at home.  You informed the Court that -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, I didn't understand what counsel was saying, Mr. President.  Could he kindly repeat that?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Can I interrupt you?  Mr. Weyl, the English translator did not get you again, your question, so could you please repeat that?  
MR. WEYL:
Let me repeat my question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you stated that on the 7th of April 1994, whilst you were at home, a minibus or van stopped in front of your house.  Can you please tell us under what circumstances that van stopped in front of your home? 
A.	On the 7th of April I was at the gates to my house and I was discussing with my neighbours, who were also outside their houses, and then we saw a van come up and the van stopped right where I was with my neighbours. 
Q.	Did the van stop because there was an obstacle in its way, or did it stop because the driver or the passengers wanted to speak with those who were on the roadside? 
A.	No.  No.  There was not even a roadblock or anything like that, and the van came by, and after -- at about five metres away from our group, it stopped, and in that van I realised that I was able to immediately recognise one individual, and that was it. 
Q.	Do you think that the van stopped because someone in there recognised you and wanted to talk to you? 
A.	No, no, that's not how it was. 
Q.	So the van stopped by chance and you just happened to discuss with that person by chance? 
A.	No, the van stopped because we were in a group, a group of people who live in the same neighbourhood, and we were discussing.  So they stopped.  And on the 7th of April, according to the communiqué which had been issued, it was said that everybody should remain at home. 
Q.	You stated that one of the Interahamwe, who came down from the van, was known to you, and that this was one Suberi (phonetic), is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's right. 
Q.	Can you tell us -- respecting the limitations of the open session that we are in, can you tell us under what circumstances you knew that person? 
A.	He was***************************************************************, and he had been there for a certain time; therefore, he recognised me. 
Q.	Did you know that person well? 
A.	I wouldn't say well, but I knew the person because he was***************************. 
Q.	Did you know him well enough for you to discuss freely with him? 
A.	Not quite.  He was someone from the town, and I didn't have any particular relationship with him.  I just saw him in a meeting.  He recognised him (sic) and I recognised him. 
Q.	So when you discussed with him, you wouldn't ask him questions, would you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You wouldn't ask him where he came from? 
A.	I asked him about news of, I believe, number 6 and number 9.  I was wondering whether he had seen them.  That's all.  And he -- I asked him what he was doing and he said that he had a mission.  I think I've said that already.
(Pages 32 to 41 by Jennifer Spring)



























1630H 
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	It is precisely because of the manner in which you spoke to us about this incident that I am asking you these questions.  Did you not ask him from where he came? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You did not ask him either where he was going? 
A.	I know that he told me that he had a mission.  He had a specific task to carry out. 
Q.	Did you not ask him what that mission was; what that job was, or task? 
A.	No.  I could not ask him that because on the 6th of April, as you know, the night of the 6th into the 7th we knew what had already happened.  That is my friends and myself already knew what had happened, and the group that we were in of neighbours there were Tutsis.  So I did not ask anything of him.  
Q.	When I say that I had wanted you to be clearer, it was because in your examination-in-chief you were less affirmative, or less assertive, because there you stated that you imagined that he was on some mission or that you had understood that he was on some mission; or that you thought that he was on some mission, but at no point in time do I remember you saying that he told you that he was on a mission.  I want you to be more specific on those particular aspects.
A.	As for him having a mission, there was communiqué which had stopped us from going anywhere.  We were supposed to stay at home and I've seen people going about in a van as if they were on some mission or other.  How was I supposed to react?  I assumed that they had some kind of job to carry out at that point in time.
Q.	Didn't you imagine for a moment that these could have been people who were fleeing and wanted to find a hiding place? 
A.	Could you please repeat the question, Counsel?  
Q.	You did not think that people may have been trying to flee from areas which were unsafe in order that they find some place which was safe. 
A.	I know that in the area that I lived there were people who had been displaced by the RPF so that they could escape that tragedy which had just begun but the people in the van were in uniform.  I would say the uniform of the MRND, if I am to refrain from saying that it was the uniform of the Interahamwe.  
Q.	Were you yourself not afraid at the time? 
A.	Yes, of course. 
Q.	Did you try to organise your escape, your flight at that point in time? 
A.	Yes, that is true. 
Q.	Now, if you were trying to organise your safety, it is possible that other people may have the same thing in their mind, that their mission would be in some way trying to find safety and security. 
A.	I can say that if you are looking for safety and you want to hide somewhere, I think that you would not stop suddenly when you see a group, because if you see a group of people, maybe you would be afraid because you may think that these people are organised -- maybe they will do me harm.  This is to indicate to you that these people were not looking for a hiding place or some place of refuge.  I recognised the same individual in the cassette, the video cassette of Petit Kigali.  
Q.	Is the witness still on line with us?   
MR. WEYL:
	Hello, hello; are you there?  
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Yes.  We were at the point where these people had stopped and you concluded, if I understood you correctly, that they were not afraid to stop where you were.  You did not know where they were coming from. 
A.	No.  
Q.	And you didn't wonder where they were coming from, did you? 
A.	At the time, no.  But, the young man lived in Buryogo.  
Q.	You imagine or you think that they are on a mission and you state that you did not ask them specifically what mission that was; can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And neither do you ask them who may have sent them on such a mission, did you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	You didn't try to stop them from accomplishing that mission either, did you? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Thank you for that information.  Now, I want to move on to the 9th of April.  I believe I recalled that you stated that on the 9th -- oh, number 9 and number 6 of P. 9 came to your house accompanied by Interahamwe; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct.  Pardon?  
Q.	Did they come to help you flee? 
A.	No, to help me move.  
Q.	You were very afraid at the time, you and your family members, weren't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Weren't you? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Here with me I have the transcripts of your statement before, before the investigators of a certain country.  Counsel made reference to the K-numbers.  I am going to read you a portion of there, "From the 9th of April each time I contacted him he wasn't there.  So I left a message with his wife, telling him that once around the 7th or the 8th of April, because, because I was beginning -- there were many gunshots and the children began to be afraid and panic". 
	
	Later on you say, "I asked somebody, someone whose name I would not mention here, how to join, to ask the members of his bodyguard to come and help me move the children because that was -- that would have been safer.  There was reason to be afraid at that time."  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And that is why that on the 8th or the 9th, because in your statement before this inspector, investigator, you were less precise --  on the 8th or the 9th -- to your home and this is what you stated, "There were at least two or three and a group of Interahamwe because they came in two vehicles. So, they told me that I had to hurry.  They had come to evacuate me in order to take me to a safe place."  Do you confirm what you said there?   
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In fact, on the 8th or the 9th of April it was urgent that you find a safe place? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And this is how you covered the five kilometres between your house and another location where you saw the St. André church and the victims' bodies were piled up in that church; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	In front of the St André church, did number 9 tell you anything; do you remember? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	During your examination-in-chief you said that he told you in speaking about the victims, that they were killed by the army and the army's children; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Did he say that with pride or shame, at that time? 
A.	He was telling me, I can't tell you how he was, he was agitated at any rate.  
Q.	Do you think when he said that that he was overjoyed with the work done by those children of the army, or do you think he had a feeling of regret, perhaps guilt?
A.	I wouldn't say regret, but, he told me that the children had worked with the army.  But there was no regret in his words when he told me. 
Q.	Are you sure, that when he spoke about the perpetrators, that he said "the army and its children"?  
A.	Yes, I believe so.  
Q.	At any rate, I believe this is what you remember, because in response to prosecution's questions you stressed that it was the army and the army's children.  Didn't number 3 more naturally say, when speaking about the Interahamwe, "our children"? 
A.	Which number?
Q.	Number 9? 
A.	I don't see the nuance between "its children" and "our children". 
Q.	If number 9 said the "Interahamwe" or "the children of the Interahamwe" or "our children", that's more than a nuance? 
A.	No, when he says, "its children", he is talking about the Interahamwe, not the Interahamwe of the army.  These children he is saying, he is talking about the Interahamwe as these children. 
Q.	Let me remind you of the nuance, just as you understood it in your hearings before a certain government.  This is cassette KT7910151414.  And that you say, "When we went down and arrived at St. André number 9 was there.  He pointed out to us 'Here's what our children have just done'."  Then the investigator asked you, "Number 9 said, 'our children'."  You responded, "our children", which over there meant Interahamwe?   
Q.	Do you believe that "those children" or "the army's children" or "our children", is that only some type of nuance or is there meaning behind all of this?
A.	No. For them, "our children", meant Interahamwe.  The soldiers were not the children of that group.  From six to nine when they say "our children", they mean Interahamwe.  
Q.	So the investigators from a certain government --
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes -- 
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
	Timing, how close are you to completion now?  
MR. WEYL: 
I believe that I have at least another half an hour.  I am practically near the end.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
Okay.  We will take the break when you conclude your cross-examination then, will that be okay?  
MR. WEYL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MR. WEYL:  
Q.	Witness, I am seeking some clarification about the pacification mission on the 10th of April.  You went into the secteurs to put a stop to the killings, that is what you told us; is that correct.  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	You thought that the government did not want to put a stop to the killings but they gave you that mission nonetheless; is that correct? 
A.	We were called for that mission.  We undertook the mission.  If we had refused, it would have been a bad thing for us.  So we did it.  But we could notice the government did not have the willingness or the will to have the killings stopped.  Because if you really want to put a stop to the killings they would have had to stop everything they did at the Hôtel des diplomat; this was an urgent situation, they themselves had to act.  It was very urgent.  They had to go into the field and stop the killings in Kigali.  Because if they were able to stop the killings in Kigali, I believe the killings would not have spread into the other prefectures.  
Q.	But it was because the mission was very clear that you accomplished it; correct? 
A.	The authorities ask you to do something, you have to obey them.  
Q.	And to be more clear, it worked.  The killings stopped, the population understood, it worked.  It was effective.  
A.	When we left, they had accepted what we told them.  Yes, it worked but after, right after the tour, as it were, the killings recommenced. 
Q.	So if it worked, it was not a bad idea to have sent you in the first place, was it.    
A.	It would have been more meaningful if they had decided to go themselves. 
Q.	In a society where corporals no longer obeyed generals, and that is what you told us; on the 10th of April, you told us that it was the law of the jungle that corporals no longer obeyed generals, conseillers no longer obeyed bourgmestres who no longer obeyed préfets.  On the 10th of April it would not have been a bad idea to send those who were able to make the killings stop because the killings, indeed, stopped. 
A.	The killings did not stop.  We went there, on site.  We told them that we were there on behalf of the government.  "The government has sent us with this message for you."  They could see that we had an escort, and army escort.  
Q.	Let me remind you of a statement you made before a certain government, page 30, cassette KT791, K0151430, you said, "I was speaking about the conversation we had with Nzirorera.  We thanked -- who thanked us for doing a good job. 

But the RPF had, began to bomb.  And he said 'The RPF is beginning to bomb areas.  Now if the population becomes angry they are going to kill all of the Tutsis who remain'."  And that was true, a bomb fell on Nyamirambo and at that time all of the Tutsis nearby, that they had protected, were practically all eliminated.  They blamed that on the RPF who had bombed Nyamirambo.  Do you remember saying those things, Witness? 
A.	I believe so.  
Q.	Do you also remember further on, in that same document  K0151430 that you said, "There was a discussion, we had, with number 9.  We said, that this time, Nzirorera will go for pacification, because we cannot ask the population any longer to stop because afterwards, bombs start falling. 

	So they're going to lynch us, they're going to lynch us, the population is going to lynch us". You said it three times, you said the population was going to shoot you if you went back to try to put a stop to the killings that only resumed because an RPF bomb fell.  Do you remember saying that witness?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And do you confirm it? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So you confirm that it was the law of the jungle, and that anyone who would have tried to stop the killings, after they recommenced, in spite of all of your efforts, would run the risk of being lynched?
A.	Don't forget Counsel that that is what I said, I said that it had to be Nzirorera.  He was an authority.  He was supposed to organised (sic) that, not us.  We were running the risk of being lynched because they would consider us traitors, if the authorities like Nzirorera -- he had more authority that (sic) we did. 
Q.	You do not think that Nzirorera would be lynched? 
A.	He was not supposed to go alone.  The government and the parties could have organised a tour of the various sectors in Kigali, with the army and gendarmerie and give orders to the gendarmerie. 
Q.	And to the corporals who didn't obey the generals? 
A.	One day the government asked that looting had to stop.  They set up a brigade to stop the looting in Kigali.  They used the strongest resources to do so.  They gave the order that anyone caught looting, should be shot down.  And that was done, looting stopped in Kigali.  People were killed because they were looting. 
Q.	Thank you witness. I am almost finished, only a few minutes more.  Witness, you said that starting in *********************************************************; is that correct? 
A.	I did not really say***************************************************************************************.  
Q.	You told us nonetheless, that it was sufficient for people to assume that you could run the risk of being killed and that you took a low profile, yes, but************************************************************** **********.  
A.	Which ones?  
Q.	********************************************************.  
A.	*********************************************************************************************************** *************************************************************************************************************** *************************************************************************************. 
Q.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the evidence has been extracted and filed under seal) 
MR. MORLEY:  
Your Honour, I am just on my feet.  Please stop for a moment. It has been a long time since we started and, inevitably, there has developed a culture within the courtroom of trespassing closer and closer on the issue of his identity.  It is late in the day and I imagine Mr. Weyl was not aware of where his question was going just a moment ago but Your Honour may recall he asked and that would have been one of those questions.
MR. WEYL:
I do not think that any of my questions are over the line here with regard to that, Mr. President? 
THE WITNESS:
	I think so, Counsel.   
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Mr. Morley, it may not have been -- it has slipped, we may not have noticed what you said.  
MR. MORLEY:   
It is late in the day.  It may be that some people are waiting for a break.  The question just a moment ago put the witness in a certain situation with regard to*************************************************** **********************************************************.  And that is something that two weeks ago we would have struggled to avoid bringing out in open session.  Obviously, if I say exactly what the question was I am going to compound the problem. 
MR. PRESIDENT: 
I heard the question.  Basically you are saying that a certain organisation was named.  That is what I did not pick up myself.  
MR. MORLEY: 
The context of the question was to establish that there has been ************************************ *************************in which the defendant -- I am sorry, that the witness was involved.  
MR. PRESIDENT:  
I understand now.  
MR. MORLEY:  
It seems to me as time has gone by we have lost control of this.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Weyl, do you understand that now.  It is not a blatant problem but I think it is subtle and I think --
MR. WEYL:  
Mr. President, I mentioned something about not judging the book by a cover this morning and I am remembering La Fontaine and he is talking about a bear, and he is talking about the bear not throwing a stone which will then kill the fly.  We have not identified the individual, so maybe I did not speak about any communiqué drafting. I was talking about initiatives which were pursued in 1993 and I do not think that that should have identified anyone whatsoever.  
MR. PRESIDENT: 
Just a minute.  Just a minute.  That issue was addressed in examination-in-chief.  The objection is not to you asking questions, but the way you phrased the question could give a perceptive reader an indication of the identity of the witness.  That is not the point.  It is a question of how -- I myself had not seen it at first.  But now the matter has been drawn to my attention I think that I should redact the question and ask you to, in a different way.  So the objection is not, I don't think there is an objection to you raising the issue but where the question is put it should avoid providing a clue to the identity of the witness.  That is the issue.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, let me repeat my question. 
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	Mr. Witness, you stated that from November 1992, you had taken a low profile and I asked you whether that low profile stopped you from participating, in certain initiatives, throughout the year 1993.  
A.	Let me answer you by saying that there were certain activities which I had carried out in 1992, which I almost put to an end in 1993.  I was not as interested as I had been earlier.  
Q.	If you refer to P. 9, would you regularly see some of those individuals on that list, be it one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 and 11.  
A.	Not during that period of time that you have referred to. 
Q.	Not in 1993, nor in 1994? 
A.	In 1993, I would say that number 6, 7, 8 and 9 -- I did not have regular contacts with them as I had previously.  
Q.	But from the 7th of April 1994, you did have regular contacts with them? 
A.	I called upon them. 
Q.	No one reproached you for having adopted that low profile in that previous period? 
A.	I do not quite understand the question.  
Q.	When you called for help for your evacuation and when you participate in pacification missions, nobody ever told you that you hadn't done anything for us, since November 1992, did no one reject you?
A.	I would not want to go into details but I would like to tell you that from number 6 to number 9, those individuals, number 9 was a long term friend.  I had known him for about 20 years.  We knew one another when we were young.  There were things that we had done together.  And there were family relationships that we had.  But despite the fact that he was in that group of numbers 6 to 9, there were times that he would call me, and he would also call upon me.  And I would come to his aid, despite the fact that he was in that group of individuals, from number 6 to number 9.  
	
Now, on the 9th of April, well, from the 6th to 7th April, I called on him for help, and he didn't refuse to come to my assistance and this is to show you that despite the fact that I had taken that low profile I was able to call on him.  And later on, when we had left the country, he spoke to me about that.  
Q.	You see I am kind of surprised, he comes to your assistance, and your relationships do not end there because between the 6th of April and July of 1994, you came three times to Kigali and on those three occasions, you had meetings at very high level and everybody trusts you.  And yet, you had adopted that low profile from November 1992.  I don't quite understand this.  
A.	Let me tell you that when I came back to Kigali on those three occasions the first time around, I was lucky enough to meet number 1.  And I had not met him for a long time.  There was also number 3 who was there.  Now, when I arrived in Kigali and all these meetings were taking place there, I was not expecting that.  When I arrived in Kigali, there was a meeting and since I was there, number 1, each time when I was in number 9's house, I would be invited to these meetings and then afterwards I would go back. 
Q.	Yes, that is what I was saying, everybody trusts you including your Tutsi friends who joke within January 1994, to the extent that they tell you, that someone will end up assassinating President Habyarimana.  They can joke with you and they trust you and there is no fear. 
A.	Maybe I am a trustworthy man.

1715H
BY MR. WEYL:
Q.	It would be up to the Chamber to decide on that, what they deliberate, Mr. Witness. 
A.	Well, what do you want me to say?  What do you want me to say?  
Q.	Well, this is particularly my conclusion, you stated that you hadn't killed anyone; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is true.
Q.	That you didn't help in killing anyone; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, that is correct? 
Q.	Do you agree with me that someone -- someone who is weighed down by some amount of presumption wouldn't be in any way responsible or guilty?  
A.	I don't know how to answer you.  You asked me questions and I gave you answers as they came.  I don't know what to say to you, given that question. 
Q.	Maybe I'm going to remind you of things that are undoubtedly very painful.  You did lose members of your family during the killings; did you not? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Do you feel that you did everything in your power to stop them from being killed? 
A.	You know, I was very far away from them.  I couldn't do anything to come to their assistance.  I was -- they were living very far from me.  There are people whom I tried to help and I did my best. 
Q.	You did your best, but this wasn't good enough.
A.	I tried to save the lives of some of my friends, and that was successful. 
Q.	When you think about all of these events, does it happen that you remember what number 9 said in the St Andre's church when he said that, "It is our children who did all of this." 
A.	No, I don't think about what number 9 said there.  I do not think about my own things, my own relatives, my parents, my friends who are dead.  I think about this tragedy which made Rwanda lose many lives.  I think about friends who are dead.  That is what I think about. 
Q.	And you have a great feeling of impotence.
A.	I'm a human being. 
Q.	And you are guilty of nothing.  Thank you, Mr. Witness.  
MR. WEYL: 
Mr. President, I am done with my cross-examination. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Weyl.  

We will take a short break now.

Mr. Morley, are you ready to start?  

MR. MORLEY:
Yes, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We will take a short break and we will commence with the re-examination.
(Court recessed from 1720H to 1735H)
MR. MORLEY:
With Your Honours' leave, before I start, perhaps, if the witness might take off his headphones, his favourite activity?  

It may be that I am being over cautious but I just want to be clear before I begin a re-examination, what precisely is not being challenged.  Having listened carefully to the cross-examination by Mr. Robinson, and more recently by Mr. Sow and by Mr. Weyl, it occurs to me that on the face of the cross-examinations there are a number of features to the witness's evidence which have not been challenged.  And I don't know whether I have just misunderstood or whether they are, in fact, being challenged.

The first area concerns Ngirumpatse.  Mr. Weyl, as far as I can see, has not challenged the presence of Ngirumpatse at committee meetings.  He has not challenged the drafting of letters for the committee by Ngirumpatse.  He has not challenged the evidence that money raised after April or May of 1992 went directly to the executive committee, of which Ngirumpatse presided.  He has not challenged that once the Interahamwe was established in the préfectures that the préfectures made direct reports to the executive committee of the MRND, over which Ngirumpatse presided.  Although he has invited consideration as to whether Turatsinze was a fraud, he has not challenged whether there was any relationship between Ngirumpatse and Turatsinze on behalf of the committee.  

I see Mr. Robinson is on his feet, if I might just finish with the list.  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Actually, Mr. --  
MR. MORLEY:
Before Mr. Robinson helps us, can I just finish the list in relation to Ngirumpatse and Mr. Weyl?
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, although you have not finished, we have a view which we would like to express; but before doing that, I just wonder if you would like to indicate whether you have any recently arrived juristic appearances to report. 
MR. MORLEY:
Your Honour is quite right.  If I might introduce into the record an important member of the Prosecution team, Mr. Lombardi, who has come back from The Hague and is sitting to my right.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, we think that the approach you are adopting embarrasses the Defence.  We don't think the Defence should be obligated to disclose their defence at this stage.  We had, in fact, discussed it a little during the course of cross-examination earlier.  We think that you have to rely on your analysis of their cross-examination.  

In our view, this is an omission which will affect us when we are assessing credibility of the witnesses, but we think it would embarrass the Defence to allow you to make this statement, because if the Defence don't respond, the record has it already.  And we think it embarrasses the Defence to be put in a position of this nature.  Unless there is some voluntary disclosure that you wish to make, but we don't think that they should be compelled to do it.  I will enquire if they wish voluntarily to make a statement, but I don't think they should be put in the position where there is an appearance of requirement to respond; that is what we see. 
MR. MORLEY:
I understand, Your Honour, the reason why I have listed --and there are two other items under Ngirumpatse, three under Nzirorera and one under Karemera.  The reason why I was listing those is not to embarrass the Defence, although I don't shirk from doing that.  It is, in fact, because if these items have not challenged, technically it might be that I am not supposed to re-examine on them because they have not been raised in cross-examination.
MR. PRESIDENT:
But that is the normal rule.  If they, in fact, have not been raised in cross-examination then you don't have to examine on them. 
MR. MORLEY:
But if I am not going to re-examine on them, and they are subsequently challenged by way of comment and closing remarks -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But what is the evidentiary base?  You see, this is the point that we had -- we are not going to adjudicate on what counsel say; we adjudicate on the evidence. 
MR. MORLEY:
I had thought that what would happen if I read out my list is that Mr. Robinson might helpfully stand up, as I think he was about to, and say just assume that everything is challenged.  And on those circumstances we can proceed. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if it is not, in fact, challenged on the record, what do we do?  I mean, as far as I understand the rules, the Defence are not obliged to disclose a defence at this stage and that is the point.  What we have had now is testimony, which in some time we are going to have to determine what we believe.  And our -- the issue of how the cross-examination proceeds, in my view, will have a bearing on it.  But I don't think that one can say anything much more than that at this stage. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, yes --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
But if I can ask if the Defence has an objection?  

Mr. Robinson, you had stood up.  I'm sorry I said what I said before you had a chance to express yourself right now, but you can do so now. 
MR. ROBINSON: 
No, that is fine.  I'm not at all embarrassed by the enquiry, I would not even have thought about being embarrassed because, as Mr. Morley correctly anticipated, and I have told the Prosecution in our meetings from day one that every element of every offence is open to be proven by the Prosecution.  And nothing that I will ever do in this trial, not one single small thing is ever intended to relieve the Prosecution of their burden of proving every fact beyond a reasonable doubt.  Even if I don't ask a witness about a particular thing, it may be that I don't think him sufficiently proximate to the event to even have useful information for me to challenge.  So you should draw absolutely no inference from the fact that I have not asked a particular witness, a particular fact.  

Everything has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Prosecution if they want you to rely on it in the judgement.  And nothing -- no failure on our part, while you may on the end when deciding a witness's credibility, properly take the fact into consideration whether or not the witness was confronted with something.  But nothing is admitted or conceded in this trial.  Thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Weyl, we will hear you.  
MR. WEYL: 
Yes, Mr. President, I thank you.  I go along fully with my learned friend, Mr. Robinson.  And I must say that I am somewhat surprised to have heard Mr. Morley of the Prosecution going into submissions instead of going into re-direct.  But I believe that re-direct has an objective, other than for Mr. Morley to begin his closing remarks.  And I know it is up to the Prosecution to prove his case as he wishes or sees fit.  

And they should not come to conclusions from the answers that we have drawn out of the witness, given the questions that we have put to the witness.  This should not remove the burden of proof from the Prosecutor.  It is up to the Prosecutor to provide that evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.  And if he believes that there is something necessary in that regard, he should go about his redirect in order to ensure that there is -- that the burden of proof is met.  And this is what the Prosecution should endeavour to do, Mr. President, Your Honours.  
MR. SOW: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  In order to gain time further and not to lose it, Mr. President, I think the Prosecutor should not simply summarise our cross-examination.  It is up to the Prosecution in the framework of its redirect -- his redirect to go into matters in which he believes there is need to further shed light on matters for the Chamber; but he should not summarise the cross-examination.  That would not in any way be justified.  I thank you, Your Honours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Morley, without commenting on motives, we think you should start your re-examination now. 
MR. MORLEY:
Very well. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are going to -- we take the adjournment at 6 o'clock, in any event. 
MR. MORLEY:
Well, it does occur to me to enquire of Your Honour whether the remaining nine minutes are fruitfully spent at the end of the day beginning this exercise when we could sit possibly ten minutes longer tomorrow.  It is a matter for Your Honours, but Your Honour will be familiar, I have no doubt, in another place with starting an exercise like this almost on the clock, might be thought unattractive.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Robinson, do you have any idea of how much longer you are likely to be with your cross-examination?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
I still think several hours. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Several?  
MR. ROBINSON: 
Yes, because I thought I had about two hours left, but now I have to add the Ruhengeri meeting, which I put at about one more hour and other areas of speeches that Mr. Webster went into, that I was hoping to just cover by asking, isn't it true that a video -- a recording is more accurate than your memory.  I now see that I have to go into those areas, so I'm adding a few more hours for that.  So, I think it is going to be, in light of the ruling that you have made, it is going to make my cross-examination longer than I had originally thought; unless you want to reconsider.  But that is -- if you want me to -- if you want me to do it the way that it has been suggested to put all of these things to this witness, especially in light of Mr. Morley's feeling that if I leave -- let any subject aside, I'm conceding the accuracy and credibility and conceding the fact, I don't see how I could complete that cross-examination in less than several hours.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, thank you very much. 
We will take the adjournment now.  

We are not going to permit you to cross-examine on matters that have not been raised in --  
MR. MORLEY:
I hope not to cross-examine on anything. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that slip of the (inaudible) -- but we would not expect you to re-examine on matters which were not raised on cross-examination.
MR. MORLEY:
Can I just list those things which I won't be re-examining on?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
No, that is not necessary.  Again, we expect -- as I said, we expect, first of all, that it comes through with -- 
MR. MORLEY:
Well --
MR. PRESIDENT:
If you have the list, it will guide you.  We -- I don't think, I would hope that we don't have to intervene. 
MR. MORLEY:
I imagine Your Honour will from time to time, I'm afraid. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay.  But we will take the adjournment now.  

Mr. Robinson, we will still start tomorrow morning at quarter to 9:00.  I hope I don't appear unduly optimistic, but we do hope that you can complete some time tomorrow. 

We will take the adjournment.  We will take the adjournment now.  
(Court adjourned at 1755H)
