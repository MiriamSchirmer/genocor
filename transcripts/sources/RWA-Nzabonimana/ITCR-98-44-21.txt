Learned counsel for the Prosecution, any

objection to that statement?

discussing the statement of 26th June 2000,

as highlighted by the Defence.

No objection, Your Honour.

That's right.

PROFESSOR HINDS:

15

Now, with respect to 7B, we are proposing

16

that that whole document be submitted,

17

because there's a comparative analysis.

18

basis of our objection was that there were

19

statements made to the members of the ICTR

20

on July 21st which were not made on June 26

21

and there's no way that the Court will be

22

able to assess this, based upon what we are

doing, unless we submit both documents.

using now, whether we are now going to end
