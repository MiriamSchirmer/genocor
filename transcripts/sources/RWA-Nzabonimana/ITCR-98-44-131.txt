P R O C E E D I N G S
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

Mr. Registrar, could you open the proceedings, please.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour. 

Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, composed of Judge Byron, presiding, Judge Hökborg and Judge Kam, is now sitting in open session, today, Thursday, the 23rd of June 2005, for the continuation of the trial in the matter of The Prosecutor versus André Rwamakuba, case No. ICTR-98-44(C)-T. 

Thank you, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, very much Mr. Registrar.  

I would like to welcome back Judge Hökborg.  We have been sitting under 15 bis during her absence, and the proceedings were videotaped so she would have access to the video record of the proceedings in addition to the other transcripts which were available.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
Your Honour, I just noticed that Your Honour mentioned -- the registrar mentioned we are in open session, but I note that we are not.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that observation.  We are in open session, and I would be grateful if the curtains were pulled.  

Now, there is no witness here at the moment.  Mr. Registrar, what is the position, please?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, WVSS has just informed me the witness, GII, will arrive at about 9:15, and Witness GIT says he is too sick to attend.  Sorry, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I have another certificate issued by the medical practitioner who saw Witness GIT which confirms the opinion that he is able to testify.  Now, if he does not come on the ground of an alleged illness, should I, at this stage, issue a subpoena to compel his attendance?  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I think that if the medical certificate does indeed say that the witness is able to come and testify, I shall bow to your decision.  The witness came yesterday, he said he was unwell, and I even suggested to you that he should go and rest; he confirmed that he could not continue.  I believe that given what the certificate is saying -- the medical certificate is saying, I would have to bow to your decision.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Ms. Fall.  Mr. Registrar, could you show the certificate to Ms. Fall.  I suppose you should show it to Mr. Hooper as well.  

Mr. Registrar, is it sufficient to direct that a subpoena be issued?  Is that a sufficient order to the registry, or do I have to do anything else?  
MR. FRY:
Your Honour, I don't know.  I'll have to check and get back to you.  Sorry, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.

Ms. Fall, do you have any advice?  I'm not quite certain what procedure I should follow at this stage.  Do you have any advice as to the procedure I should follow?  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I think that since you are policing the proceedings, you could direct that the witness appear.  I do not have any other suggestion myself.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, do you wish to offer any advice on this at this stage?  Do you have a position on this matter?
MR. HOOPER: 
We were approaching one.  Could you just give me one moment?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, in regard to your last directions, we have taken the necessary emergency measures in case the witness were not to be here this morning, and as of last night we asked for GII to be present here this morning.  When we arrived this morning, the first thing we did was to inform ourselves as to whether the person was there.  We were told there was a small problem because apparently he had washed his clothes and so on and so forth, and he wouldn't be here before 9:15.  I don't know whether this could be a solution -- this is a problem for us -- but we could take on GII for the examination-in-chief. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for that, Ms. Fall.  I appreciate these steps taken to have a -- another witness present, and that is what I would expect of the Prosecution in any event, because my -- my general policy would be that if a witness collapse -- witness's testimony collapses for any reason, I would expect the next witness to be called promptly.  I would always expect that, so thank you for taking those steps.  But I think we shall -- should complete our management of Witness GIT first before calling Witness GII.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Yes, I have no position on it.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I think then we will probably rise for few minutes to consider what we should do.  It should not take us more than five -- five or ten minutes.  

But before we do that, I would like to draw our attention to a reminder that was issued by the court interpreters, who laid out some guidelines which would assist both interpreters and the court reporters in their work.  I believe that each of you have received a copy of this document, and I would just like to confirm that we endorse the contents -- its contents, and we suggest that they be followed as closely as possible.  

We'll rise for a few minutes.  
(Court recessed from 0911H to 0940H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, before you swear in the witness, I would like him to be removed from the court for a moment while I make an order -- while I make an order that does not concern him.  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 

In relation to Witness GIT, I have read the -- or the Chamber has read the medical certificate indicating the doctor's opinion that Witness GIT is capable to continue his testimony before the Court.  In view of his -- the statement reported to the Chamber this morning, I think I should direct the registrar, in accordance with the powers vested on the Chamber under Rule 54, to take all necessary steps to compel the attendance of the witness before the Court to continue his testimony.  That completes the order.  
MR. FRY:
So noted, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Registrar. 

The witness can be brought back into court.  Thank you, 

Mr. Registrar, would you please swear in the witness, please.  
(Declaration made by Witness GII in Kinyarwanda) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Registrar. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President 
WITNESS GII,
first having been duly sworn, 
testified as follows:
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Good morning, Madam Prosecutor.

A.	Just give me time to look through it.  I do not see my current occupation on this sheet. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, could registry be requested to help the witness?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
So directed.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Madam Prosecutor, wouldn't it be best for the Kinyarwanda interpreter to help the witness?

MS. FALL: 
Thank you, that is true, I was just going to suggest that a Kinyarwanda-speaking interpreter should come down and help the witness identify the information that is indicated on the document, if the Trial Chamber so pleases.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Is the problem a problem of language or is it a problem that the information is not on the document?  

Mr. Witness, are you able to read the document in the language in which it is written?  
THE WITNESS: 
I can only read some parts of the document, that is the parts that are written in Kinyarwanda, but I am not able to read the rest of it.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  If the interpreter can help.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, they are directed to.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Interpreter.  Would you be so kind as to indicate the reference to his occupation, his current occupation, which is indicated in this -- on this document.  
THE WITNESS: 
I was not able to read because I was not -- I do not understand French, so I couldn't understand the indication of my current occupation in the document.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Is -- your current occupation is correct?
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
The witness says it is correct, he was just unable to read.  
MS. FALL:
Okay, I understand.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Is his occupation in 1994 correct?  
A.	Yes, it is correct. 
Q.	Indications of his date (sic) of birth, that is, the cellule, secteur, commune and préfecture, is this information correct? 
A.	Yes, the information indicated herein is correct. 
Q.	Indications of his current residence, which is the same as his place of birth, is this information correct?  
A.	Yes, it is. 
Q.	Indication of the place where he lived in 1994, is this information correct? 
A.	Yes, this information is correct. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Interpreter.  

Could registry help the witness to sign the document and write down the date on it.  
THE WITNESS: 
What's the date today?  
MS. FALL: 
	I think we are -- today is the 23rd of June 2005, if I'm not mistaken. 

Mr. President, I would like to tender this document into evidence.  It should be P. 35.  I would also like the document to be placed under seal because of its confidential nature.  I may have made a mistake about the number perhaps?  P. 36.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Admitted into evidence, P. 36, under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 36 admitted, under seal) 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness GII, have you ever given testimony before this Court? 
A.	Yes, I have given testimony before this Court. 
Q.	Do you remember the time or the date when you did so? 
A.	I think it was in April or May 2004.  I do not remember the exact date any longer. 
Q.	Do you remember what trial it was? 
A.	It was the Rwamakuba trial. 
Q.	You say the Rwamakuba trial, can you give us Rwamakuba's first name? 
A.	André, it was. 
Q.	Have you ever given testimony before a court in Rwanda? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever been prosecuted? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Have you ever met with investigators of the ICTR? 
A.	Yes, I have met them. 
Q.	Where did you meet them? 
A.	In our home. 
Q.	How many times did you meet them? 
A.	I met them once. 
Q.	When you met them, did you make a statement? 
A.	Yes, I made a statement. 
Q.	Do you remember the date when you made this statement? 
A.	It's a long time ago, a very long time.  I no longer remember. 
Q.	Do you at least remember the year in which you made the statement, even you cannot remember the exact date on which you made it? 
A.	I think it was in 1998 or 1999; I can no longer remember exactly. 
Q.	Do you remember signing this statement? 
A.	Yes, I signed this statement. 
Q.	Before you signed the statement, were its contents read out to you? 
A.	Yes, the statement was read back to me. 
Q.	Did you then make any changes to the statement? 
A.	I no longer remember, it's a very long time ago. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us in what commune you lived in 1994? 
A.	Gikomero commune. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that you gave testimony last year in a trial involving André Rwamakuba; is that correct? 
A.	That is true. 
Q.	Do you know André Rwamakuba? 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I should indicate that in relation to this witness, this witness's knowledge of Dr. Rwamakuba is a matter in dispute.  I would therefore ask that that matter not be led.  
MS. FALL: 
I do not understand what Mr. O'Shea is driving at because the witness gave testimony last year in a trial involving André Rwamakuba.  I am going to put questions to him -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, I think the question was rather a courtesy, informing you of the position of the Defence and expecting that you would, in the course of your examination, recognise that so that they would not have to make objections.  So I think it is really nothing more than a courtesy informing you of their position.  So I don't think it's a problem at this stage.  
MS. FALL: 
May I proceed, Mr. President?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I was asking you whether you knew André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I did not know him before. 
Q.	How did you meet André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him when he came to our region's trading centre where I plied my trade. 
Q.	So, Witness, you are telling me that you did not know him before.  So how did you know that it was André Rwamakuba? 
A.	When he arrived at the centre I asked people who he was, and they told me that he was André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Witness, can you say what time this -- when this happened? 
A.	In 1994. 
Q.	Can you give us a more exact date, perhaps the month or the date, if you can remember it? 
A.	It was in April. 
Q.	Witness, can you give us more detail as to the month, what time in the month of April it was? 
A.	I saw him on the 4th or the 5th of April, if I remember correctly. 
Q.	Witness, how can you know for certain that it was either the 4th or the 5th of April? 
A.	I can confirm this because barely a day later, the president's aircraft was shot down. 
Q.	Do you know the date on which the aircraft of the president of the republic was shot down? 
A.	Yes, I do. 
Q.	Can you tell us? 
A.	The 6th. 
Q.	How did you learn of this accident? 
A.	I heard it on the radio in the morning; it was announced. 
Q.	Witness, to return to the people who told you that the gentleman was André Rwamakuba, apart from that, did they tell you anything else apart from giving you his name? 
A.	He came for meetings of the party that he'd just created. 
Q.	Can you tell us what party this was? 
A.	MDR-Power. 
Q.	Do you know what MDR-Power was? 
A.	It was part of a political party referred to as the MDR, and it was said that this was the strongest wing of the MDR party. 
Q.	When you say the strongest part, was it explained to you what exactly it was? 
A.	This is what the militants of the party said.  They said it was a powerful party. 
Q.	Did they tell you how this party was powerful? 
A.	They said that the party was powerful and that its members recruited people for this new party which was within -- from within the former MDR. 
Q.	You told us about meetings being organised.  Can you tell us where these meetings took place? 
A.	The meetings were held at the home of one Muhire. 
Q.	Can you remember Mr. Muhire's first name? 
A.	He is called André. 
Q.	Can you tell us who André Muhire was? 
A.	He was a trader. 
Q.	How often did you see André Rwamakuba -- you, yourself, see André Rwamakuba organise meetings at this man's house? 
A.	I saw him twice. 
Q.	On the two occasions on which you saw him, was André Rwamakuba alone? 
A.	No, he came with his driver. 
Q.	How, by what means did he come with his driver? 
A.	They would come, park the vehicle at Muhire's house.  I used to see someone else in the vehicle whom I assumed to be his driver. 
Q.	Can you tell us from what direction he came when he did come? 
A.	He came from the Rutunga road towards our trading centre. 
Q.	And where is your trading centre? 
A.	The trading centre is between Rutunga and Gasabo.  So the centre is between these two secteurs. 
Q.	What is this centre called? 
A.	It is called Ndatemwa centre. 
Q.	Do you know any of the people who participated at these meetings? 
A.	There was a certain Ndamage, a certain Jonas Habimana (sic).  These were the leaders of this party.  Joas, not Jonas.
Q.	You say that they were leaders of this party, what party?

Q.	Can you tell us the position that Joas occupied? 
A.	He was chairman of MDR-Power in Rutunga secteur. 
Q.	And Ndamage? 
A.	He represented the party in Gasabo. 
Q.	Witness, were you present at these meetings? 
A.	No, I was not. 
Q.	Were you told what transpired during these rallies? 
A.	The young people who came from these rallies came out talking with pride about what had transpired there. 
Q.	Did they tell you personally what occurred at these rallies? 
A.	One young man told me, but other people said this outright, they said, "We are going to kill people."  
Q.	Did they tell you what people they were going to kill? 
A.	They said that they were about to kill the Tutsis. 
Q.	Can you tell us -- can you give us names of the people who told you what was said at these meetings? 
A.	One Phillip Zibukira, also David Bonibirahira as well. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Sorry, can we have the first name again?  I didn't get it, I'm sorry.  The first name, please.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, would you be so kind as to repeat, for the benefit of the Defence, the family name of the first person you named? 
A.	Phillip Zibukira. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that you saw André Rwamakuba coming from Rutunga.  Where were you at the time? 
A.	I was standing *****************. 
Q.	Can you tell us where *********** was in relation to the road? 
A.	About ********** away. 
Q.	Can you tell us **************** is not far from the place where André Muhire's house how is located? 
A.	No, it's not very far.  I could see what were going on at -- what was going on at Muhire's because his house was not far **************. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, at this stage, with your leave, I would like to show the witness a document, which is a photograph taken from Prosecution Exhibit P. 2 and K -- the K number is K0276235.  This is photograph number 4 of page -- on page 16 -- 15.  I have deleted the references to the location and the road.  I would like to show this to the witness so that he can answer some questions thereon.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Prosecutor, could you repeat the K number, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Counsel.  
MS. FALL: 
		There are two photographs in P. 2 -- in Exhibit P. 2 on page 15 of page 2 (sic).  The number, the K number is K0276235, and we are referring to photograph No. 4.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
I wonder if the Prosecutor may have a spare copy of that exhibit.  We haven't brought that exhibit with us.  
MS. FALL: 
I am sorry, I do not have a spare copy.  I have a copy which is not in colour, but I might lend you my document so that you can see if -- whether this is exactly the exact photograph.  
MR. O'SHEA: 
We might not need it.  We do not know what's going to be put to the witness; perhaps we can wait and see.  The copy without colour would be fine.  

If is not immediately at hand, we can just see how the testimony goes; I mean, we may not need it.  

Thank you very much.  
MS. FALL: 
It won't take a long time.  I think what I need to do can be done fairly easily.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you have been given a document.  Can you tell us whether you recognise anything on the document? 
A.	I can see Muhire's house. 
Q.	With the assistance of the registry, and if the Trial Chamber so pleases, would you please place a mark or write down the name of André Muhire next to the house that you referred to.  Thank you, Witness.  Witness, there is a road that goes past Muhire's house.  Can you tell us in what direction this road goes? 
A.	Northwards.  It goes towards Rutunga and Kayanga. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  Is it possible, Witness, to tell us approximately where ******* was, based on this photograph? 
A.	*****************************, but it was nearby -- it was near to this house that you can see. 
Q.	Is it possible to indicate on this document the approximate location of ***********, with the assistance of registry and the leave of the Trial Chamber? 
A.	************* was here, but unfortunately, ****************. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  That will be all for the time being as concerns the photograph, at least.

I see that the witness indicated two crosses.  I would like to ask whether it is possible for the witness to indicate Muhire's name on the house, as the other cross that he has placed on the document indicates the location **********.  
A.	I don't know how to write very well.  This is where **********.  What should I write?  How should I indicate the place where **********?  
Q.	Just put "G", if you can.  Thank you.
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I would like to tender this document in evidence as Prosecution Exhibit P. 37.  I would also like it to be placed under seal in view of the confidential information it contains.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Registrar, P. 37?  
MR. FRY:
Yes, Your Honour.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Under seal. 
(Exhibit No. P. 37 admitted, under seal) 
MS. FALL: 
Most obliged, Mr. President.

1030H
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, do you confirm that from where ********** was located you were able to see perfectly clearly what occurred or what took place in front of Muhire's house?
A.	Yes, I could see everything that was going on. 
Q.	Witness, apart from the events that you say occurred on the 4th or the 5th of April 1994, did you see the person introduced to you as André Rwamakuba again? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I'm sorry to just interrupt, my friend.  I'm sorry.  But my understanding is that there has been a compounding of the two dates so far of what happened on those dates, the coming of the car from Rutunga and what was said.  We have not had an isolation of dates and events on a particular day.  And now we are being directed to a specific date, whereas I understand this witness has been talking about a conjunction of dates, of a generality of events. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I do not want to repeat my examination-in-chief so far in its entirety.  I did ask when the witness saw him, and the witness saw -- said that he saw him on the 4th or the 5th of April 1994.  I asked him some questions.  I asked him how, he said that it was for meetings at the home of one Muhire because they were looking for members of the MDR -- I'm just trying to summarise -- MDR Power.  I went on -- I went onto something else and asked the witness whether apart from the time when he saw the person introduced to him as André Rwamakuba he had seen the person in other circumstances.  I think I have the right to do that.  I do not see why anything should be confusing. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Madam Fall, I don't think that the comment challenged your right to do it.  But if somebody was confused, they are confused and you just had an opportunity, if you wished, to clarify the situation.  He can deal with it in cross-examination if you don't deal with it.  He wasn't challenging your right to talk, but it gives you an opportunity to clarify a problem, if you wished to.  I don't really see it as a controversial issue. 
MS. FALL: 
I hope my learned colleague has now been edified as to the question that I put.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, I shall repeat my last question.  Apart from this period of the 4th or 5th of April 1994 when you saw the person introduced to you as being André Rwamakuba come there, did you see this person again in your secteur, that is? 
A.	Yes, I saw him again. 
Q.	Can you tell us if you remember when you saw him again? 
A.	I saw him again between the 10th and the 11th of April. 
Q.	Can you tell us why you say it was the 10th or the 11th of April? 
A.	That was a period of unrest for us at the time.  I remember that two days later we fled.  We were attacked and we were forced to flee from our homes, which is why I remember that this was the time. 
Q.	Can you tell us the circumstances under which you saw the person named André Rwamakuba? 
A.	I saw him when he came down the road, the Rutunga road, and went to Muhire's house again. 
Q.	You told us that it was on the 10th or the 11th of April.  Was it in the morning or in the afternoon? 
A.	It was in the afternoon. 
Q.	How did you -- did he arrive in your local area? 
A.	When he arrived, he immediately went to Muhire's home as he used to do before. 
Q.	By what means did he go to Muhire's house, where was he? 
A.	He came on board a vehicle and he went towards Muhire's house. 
Q.	Can you describe this vehicle to us? 
A.	It was a white vehicle. 
Q.	Can you tell us whether André Rwamakuba was alone in the car? 
A.	He was with someone else. 
Q.	Do you know this other person? 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Would Counsel be so kind as to give some space between the question and the answers. 
THE WITNESS:
No, I did not know this person.  I assume the person was his driver.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Where were you exactly when that happened? 
A.	I was standing ***********. 
Q.	Is it the place that you indicated on the photograph that was shown to you? 
A.	Yes, this is the place I indicated on the photograph. 
Q.	So, when you were ************************* and you saw André Rwamakuba parked in front of the person -- the house of the person known as André Muhire, could you tell us what happened then?
A.	He immediately went into the house.  And afterwards, young people unloaded bags from the vehicle and took them to Muhire's house. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I wanted to draw your attention to paragraphs 4 and 5 on the guidelines.  
MS. FALL: 
I'm sorry, Mr. President, and I thank you for reminding me.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, when André Rwamakuba came to Muhire's house, did you observe whether there were any other people with him? 
A.	When he came on board his vehicle -- a vehicle, I told you that he was with one other person. 
Q.	When you saw him go into Muhire's house, were there other people in André Muhire's house? 
A.	Yes, there were people in Muhire's house. 
Q.	Can you tell us who were these people in Muhire's house? 
A.	There were many people, amongst them Joas Habimana and Ndamage and many others. 
Q.	Witness, do you know what happened inside of Muhire's house? 
A.	No, I don't know because I was not inside of Muhire's house.  I don't know what happened inside. 
Q.	Witness, while you were outside, did you observe anything? 
A.	Yes, I observed that bags were being unloaded from the vehicle.  The bags were in the vehicle. 
Q.	Witness, can you tell us in what part of the vehicle these bags had been? 
A.	The bags were in the back. 
Q.	Witness, can you be more precise as to what you call the back or the rear of the vehicle? 
A.	I mean the rear of the vehicle. 
Q.	Could you try to be more precise, Witness? 
A.	You know the vehicle has a cabin, and then it has a rear, and so the bags were in the rear of the vehicle, in the back part. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone please, Counsel.  
BY MS. FALL: 
Q.	Would you be so kind as to explain to us what you refer to as the rear of the vehicle? 
A.	You know there is a cabin where the driver sits, then there is a flat part in the back.  That is the boot of the vehicle, if you wish. 
Q.	So, you say it is the boot of the vehicle, do you? 
A.	Yes.  I don't know whether it is a boot actually, but I know that this is a part that you raise and you can put luggage in there and shut the part again. 
Q.	You referred to bags, Witness, can you tell us what sort of bags there were? 
A.	They were plastic bags. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I would just like to make an inquiry of the witness.  

Mr. Witness, you have described this thing as a vehicle.  Now, do you know the difference between a car, pickup, and a truck or a station wagon?  Do you know the difference between those types of vehicles?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I know the difference.  I know that this vehicle was a small --  
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, a small --  
THE WITNESS:
It wasn't a pick up, it was a vehicle which was closed all around. 
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	In other words, you have quite answered my question by saying that they were plastic bags.  Can you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I can, I do confirm that, plastic bags, yes. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you please tell us how many bags were unloaded? 
A.	There were five bags. 
Q.	How can you be so sure about the number of bags that were off loaded? 
A.	I was close by the place, I can -- I was able to see the bags. 
Q.	Merely seeing the bags made you determine that there were five in number? 
A.	Yes, when they were off loading the bags, I was counting them as they were being off loaded. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, during the off loading of those bags, were you aware of their contents? 
A.	No, I wasn't able to know the contents of those bags because I was not as close as that to be able to determine what was in them. 
Q.	When those bags were off loaded, can you tell us where they were deposited? 
A.	They were deposited inside Muhire's house. 
Q.	Can you tell us how long André Rwamakuba stayed in André Muhire's house? 
A.	He spent a relatively long time in there. 
Q.	Could you tell us approximately what the duration of that time was? 
A.	I wasn't wearing a watch to enable me to determine how many minutes he spent in there, but I think he spent about an hour and a half in there. 
Q.	Did you see André Rwamakuba when he was leaving André Muhire's house?
A.	Yes. 
Q.	So, throughout all of that time you were still standing there ***************, were you? 
A.	Yes, during that period of time there was a lot of insecurity, and when we saw a vehicle come we would think that those people were going to come to kill us.  So we were on the lookout.  We were monitoring all movements to be able to keep abreast of the prevailing events. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, before we come back to those bags, I want to know from you whether during this period of time you saw the person whom you had been introduced to as being André Rwamakuba and then who you recognised to have come back to André Muhire's house between the 10th and the 11th.  Now, we are looking at the employment or the position of that same person. 
A.	I was told that he was a civil servant.  There was no exact position mentioned to me, the position that he held. 
Q.	Did you subsequently get to know what position he held? 
A.	Yes, subsequently, through the radio I got to know what position he occupied. 
Q.	Can you tell us what that position was? 
A.	It was said that he was a minister; that was on the radio. 
Q.	Do you have any specific idea as to which ministry he held? 
A.	No, I was not able to know which ministry he was heading.  It was a time of war and I did not get to know what ministry he was minister of. 
Q.	I want to come back to the bags.  You said that while the bags were being off loaded you didn't know what their contents were.  But did there come a time when you did come to know what was in the bags? 
A.	Yes, I was able to know what was in the bags when the distribution began. 
Q.	Can you tell us, please, when this distribution you mentioned began? 
A.	The distribution took place from the 13th of April. 
Q.	What makes you so sure about that date of the 13th of April? 
A.	After the distribution, I recall that we immediately fled and I know that we fled on the 13th, so I cannot forget that date. 
Q.	So, when the distribution was done, you got to know of the contents of the sacks.  What was in those bags? 
A.	The bags contained machetes. 
Q.	Can you tell us who made the distribution? 
A.	It was Muhire who distributed the machetes to the people who lived in the neighbourhood. 
Q.	Can you be more precise as to the people who were living in the neighbourhood, where did they come from? 
A.	They were young people who had been trained to kill.  It is to these people that the machetes were given by him. There were people from Rutunga and Gasabo who were living close by the trading centre. 
Q.	What do you mean, "young people who had been trained to kill"?  
A.	I'm referring to young people from Rutunga and Gasabo secteur, young Hutus who were living close to this centre at Ndatemwa. 
Q.	According to you, who was it that trained them? 
A.	It was Muhire and these other people that I had mentioned Ndamage and Joas. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, were you, indeed, present when the distribution of those weapons was done by Muhire? 
A.	When they brought out the machetes and started to share them out, I was in front ********** and could see them, and it was on that occasion that I decided to flee. 
Q.	Now, then, after those machetes were distributed, where did the people who then came in possession of those weapons go for you to have been able to see them at that particular moment? 
A.	After the distribution, I fled but I do know that they immediately began destroying houses and killing people. 
Q.	You're saying destroying houses and killing people, can you tell us what were the houses and people who were targets of such action? 
A.	It was the houses belonging to Tutsis that were destroyed. 
Q.	*************? 
A.	**************. 
Q.	For how long did you remain -- between the distribution of the machetes and the time when they began to destroy houses, how long did you remain in that place? 
A.	Immediately after the distribution of the machetes I went to *********************** and I went to my father's -- my parents' house. 
Q.	What did you do after going to your parents' house? 
A.	I informed them that the war had begun and that people were starting to be killed and that it was necessary that we flee. 
Q.	So, where then did you go? 
A.	We went to seek refuge at a place known as Kajevuba. 
Q.	Can you tell us in what secteur this place, Kajevuba, is to be found? 
A.	It is in Gasabo secteur. 
Q.	When you were fleeing to go and seek refuge in that secteur, were you alone?
A.	No, I was together with members of my family. 
Q.	Were you alone with the members of your family as you fled to that location? 
A.	We found other people who had also come there to seek refuge. 
Q.	Can you tell us, if you know, from what commune these people that you found in that location? 
A.	Some of the refugees came from Gikomero secteur, there were some others who had come from Rutunga and also from Mugambazi. 
Q.	If you know, can you please tell us the ethnic group to which the persons you found there belonged, the persons with whom you sought refuge?
A.	They were Tutsi.  There were definitely other people who had come from very far off and whose ethnicity I wouldn't be able to tell you. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, when did you come back to your secteur? 
A.	I went back there in July. 
Q.	Can you tell us the date of your return, if you can? 
A.	I do not remember the date. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, you have told us that the killings began but you were not there.  When you came back, did you get to know whether there were a significant number of victims? 
A.	Yes, there was.  Many people were killed in our commune and in the secteur neighbouring mine; some people were drowned, others were killed by the use of machetes. 
Q.	Would you be able to give us an approximate number of the victims that you came to be aware of, without mentioning their names? 
A.	Are you referring to victims from our commune?  
Q.	Yes, if you can, please do so, and I will be more specific later on.
A.	There were many people who were killed in our commune.  Some of these victims came from the surrounding communes, such as Rubungo.  I would imagine the number of victims to have been 30,000, but let me specify that these people came from various other communes, especially Rubungo and Kanombe commune. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, without giving information which might identify you, did you have any victims in your own family? 
A.	Yes, there were. 
Q.	Would you be able to give us an approximate number? 
A.	There are only those who fled with me, otherwise, members of my extended family were killed; nephews, sisters, cousins, uncles.  I think that they -- the victims, I mean, were many, in my family.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, apart from what you have already told us about André Rwamakuba, did you ever have any opportunity to see or hear him? 
A.	From the time I fled, I never saw him again.  However, on the radio I was hearing it being said that he was minister.  Otherwise, I never saw him again. 
Q.	Mr. Witness, I would like to conclude by asking you how much education you have. 
A.	I only stopped at the third year of my primary education. 
Q.	Thank you very much, Mr. Witness? 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, for the time being I believe I am done with my examination-in-chief, and I thank you. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  We will take a short break now for about 15 minutes. 
(Court recessed from 1105H to 1128H) 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, your evidence will be continued, but at this time you will be questioned by the lawyer representing the Accused person, and you will be obliged to answer his questions.  Do you understand me?  
MR. HOOPER: 
He needs to put his earphones on, doesn't he? 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I lost my whole speech.

Mr. Witness, can you hear me now?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I can hear you, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Your evidence will continue now, but at this time the questions will be asked by the lawyer for the Accused person.  And you will be obliged to answer his questions.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I do, Mr. President. 

MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, thank you.

You may proceed, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  
CROSS-EXAMINATION
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And good morning, Mr. Witness.  I hope you are feeling well? 
A.	Good morning, Counsel.  Yes, yes, I am fine.  I am doing fine. 
Q.	And I want, first of all, to ask you to help me.  I'm going to provide you with a list of names, and this is being passed up to you now, and I'm going to ask you to look at the names on it.  Now, if you have any difficulty reading that, don't be in the least way embarrassed or shy about that difficulty.  If you have a problem you let us know so that we can approach the problem in, perhaps, a different way.  So this is a list of, I think, now, nine names which is coming to you.  And I want you to look at it, not mention any names out loud.  And if can you be given a pen, put a cross against anyone who you know in any way.  
A.	Are you asking me to put a mark against the name, Counsel?  What did you say exactly?  
(Pages 13 to 20 by Donna M. Lewis)




















1130H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In front of you, sir, I think you will see a list of nine names.  If you know in any way, any of the people on that list, just put a cross in the box on the right by the side of the name, to indicate that you know them. 
A.	I have been able to note some names, actually, just two.  I do not think I know the rest of the people whose names appear here. You know, in our country, several people could -- can have the same name. 
Q.	Well, if you can just -- if you recognise a name there of someone who lives in Gikomero or used to live in Gikomero commune, indicate it, please. 
A.	I have already placed a mark against the names that I was able to recognise. 
MR. HOOPER:
Well, if that document can be passed to me, please, or via the Prosecutor, perhaps. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And you've indicated 2 and 3 on that list, is that right? 
A.	The persons against whose names I have placed a mark are persons I can recognise without any difficulty. 
Q.	Do you recognise any of the other names? 
A.	I told you that in our country several people can bear the same name.  The names that I -- were shown to me and about which I'm not sure that they're the main names of such and such a person, I did not indicate. 
Q.	Well, let's deal, first of all, with the two names that you have recognised without difficulty.  And can I ask you, first of all, about number 2.  How do you know number 2? 
A.	Will you please give me the list again, please.  This person lived very near the place where I ******************, so it is very near this centre. 
Q.	Number 3, please?
A.	The person whose name is at number 3 is *************. 
Q.	Thank you.  Now, can we go to number 1 on the list.  Somebody who was once a ****************, is that someone you know? 
A.	After the war, we had several ************* in the war -- in the secteur.  I don't know whether this is the current *********** or the one that came before him. 
Q.	Well, were either of them called "Claude" et cetera? 
A.	I do not seek to find out their names.  I know that they are conseillers, because this secteur is far from mine, so I do not have any -- much information about their names. 
Q.	How far away is that secteur that's far from you?  How far is that? 
A.	First, there is our secteur, then you get to the secteur that we're referring to. 
Q.	So is that one kilometer? 
A.	No, it's further than that.  There is a great distance between the two places that we're talking about. 
Q.	Let me move on and ask you about number 4.  Do you know someone by that name? 
A.	There is no one in our cellule who bears that name. 
Q.	Do you know someone who lives in Kayanga by that name? 
A.	I do not.  Kayanga is not near my cellule.  I do not know many people who are natives of Kayanga. 
Q.	But it's just up the road, isn't it? 
A.	From the place ***********, you follow the road and you go up right to Kayanga, which is higher up. 
MR. HOOPER:
Mr. President, I don't -- I'm not seeking any advantage here, but I can't see the witness because the curtains have been pulled so much to this side.  It would be helpful -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Registrar, could you (inaudible).
MR. HOOPER:
Right.  Thank you very much. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	You were a trader, weren't you, trading in the trading centre of Ndatemwa? 
A.	That is correct. 
Q.	What did you trade in? 
A.	I traded in foodstuffs.  I also traded in Primus. 
Q.	What foodstuffs did you trade in? 
A.	I used to trade in beans and sorghum. 
Q.	And Primus is a bottled beer, is that correct? 
A.	Yes, it is.  It is a beer; that is its name. 
Q.	And when you -- and when you say that you traded in Primus, what did you mean?  Did you sell it with the top on the bottle, or did you have a bar there where people drank? 
A.	A person might come and buy beer and drink it there from the bottle. 
Q.	So did you have a bar or cabaret there? 
A.	Yes, that's right, it was a bar. 
Q.	And did people from as far away as Kayanga ever come and have a beer there? 
A.	Yes.  I used to sell beer and anyone who came by there could buy a beer.  And when the beer was finished, I would go and buy more supplies and sell those. 
Q.	But you barely knew anybody from Kayanga, is that right? 
A.	No, I didn't know them.  Do you think that when a person goes to a bar you -- you can ask him his name and his identity? 
Q.	Can I ask you about number 6, have you ever heard of that person? 
A.	No.  I do not know anybody who bears that name. 
Q.	Number 7, from Kayanga, ever heard of that person?  About your age? 
A.	No.  You know, Kayanga is not near my local area.  It's not close enough for me to be able to -- to identify people who come from Kayanga. 
Q.	What about number 9?  Have you ever heard of someone by that name?  Again, not very far from your age at the time? 
A.	I told you a while ago, that several people can bear the same name in my area.  I have an example, here, before me.  There is someone who I know who bears that name, but I cannot be sure that it is, in fact, this person who is referred to. 
Q.	Was it the time, a **********?  Does that help you? 
A.	Do you say a **********?  I don't know.  I don't know whether this person used to be a ***********, I don't know. 
Q.	And is *********** of number 10?  Does that help you at all with either one of those names? 
A.	No, I don't know these people. 
Q.	Who in your area -- in your secteur was the representative for the Parti Libéral?  Can you tell us that, please? 
A.	I don't know.  I do not know because I was not interested in the activities of political parties. 
Q.	Who was the representative or head of Parti Libéral Power in your secteur? 
A.	I actually, instead, remember someone from Gasabo secteur.  It is he who came and said that he represented PL  Power and he was called "*********".  In our secteur, I cannot say that I know anyone who represented any faction of the PL. 
Q.	Who represented the MRND in your secteur? 
A.	I do not also know the person who represented that party in our secteur. 
Q.	So would it be the case that the only party you took an interest in your secteur appears to have been the MDR? 
A.	No.  I've never been a member of that party. 
Q.	I -- I understand that, but it appears to be the only party that you refer to in your evidence.  So would it be the only party that you ever had any interest in? 
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, I think I -- either I did not understand correctly or Mr. Hooper did, in fact, say MRND.  The witness said MDR.  He gave information about MDR Power, so perhaps there is some clarification to be provided. 

What I understand Mr. Hooper said was MDRN (sic).  He said, "In your statement you talked of this party", but I think what the witness said was MDR.  So if there is a correction to be made, I think it should be made, so that the witness can clarify this. 
MR. HOOPER:
Can I repeat the question?
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	In your evidence you refer to the MDR in your secteur.  So are we to conclude that it was only in the -- only with the MDR party that you had any interest as you know so little about the rest? 
A.	I was closely interested in MDR activities because they came to look for members and those people attacked my -- my cattle.  That is how I got to know MDR Power.  There is no other reason and when I saw these people return, I said to myself, "These people do not have good intentions."  That is how I came to know very well what MDR was doing in our area. 
Q.	When were your cattle attacked by MDR? 
A.	This was before the death of President Habyarimana. 
Q.	Have you ever mentioned this before today? 
A.	No, it is because you ask -- you asked me about my close interest in the activities of MDR Power.  So I was trying to describe to you the circumstances under which I became interested in what this party was doing.  Amongst other things, they attacked our cows and they organised rallies.  They came and conducted an awareness-raising campaign, targeting the people.  That's why. 
Q.	And where -- when were those rallies held that you're talking about? 
A.	These meetings -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- says the witness -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- were held in Muhire's house.  This is the group that included Joas and others.  It is this group that came and attacked my cow with machetes. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And when did they attack your cow? 
A.	This was in 1994, at the beginning of the year. 
Q.	And how many cows did you have? 
A.	I had six cows. 
Q.	And where were they kept? 
A.	They were -- they were kept at home. 
Q.	And is home in ********* or is it somewhere else? 
A.	No, *************************, but it's not at the same place where I was carrying out my trade.  It's the place where my parents lived. 
Q.	I'll come back to the politics in a moment.  I want to go back to your circumstances at the time.  Ndatemwa is a small area or a relatively small area.  It's not a secteur, is it?  It's a trading centre in a secteur; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, you're right.  It's a centre which is between two secteurs. 
Q.	And in which secteur is the trading centre? 
A.	That centre sits astride Rutunga and Gasabo secteurs. 
Q.	And in which secteur was your home?  Now, don't answer that if you think it's going to identify you.  But I think you may have mentioned it anyway, so unless there's any objection, you can answer that question.  In which secteur is your home? 
A.	Do you want to know where my house was located or my parents' house?  
Q.	Well, thank you, sir, for drawing that distinction.  Let's -- let's deal with your house.  In which secteur was your house? 
A.	My secteur --
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- says the interpreter -- 
THE WITNESS:
-- was in ***********************centre -- secteur, I beg your pardon. 
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So your home is in **************?
A.	Yes, that's correct. 
Q.	And your cellule in 1994 was the same cellule as your place of birth and appears on your statement, so I don't need to read it out.  We can all see where that is. 
A.	Yes, that's right, I haven't changed the cellule. 
Q.	So you -- your house in 1994 was in the same cellule and, indeed, of the same secteur as your parents; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And how far did you live -- and how far did you live away from your parents? 
A.	Between my house and that of my parents, it was about 1800 meters. 
Q.	And you were a single man in 1994? 
A.	Yes, I was a bachelor. 
Q.	And with your six cows at home, who looked after them when you were at the shop? 
A.	These were cows that belonged to me, my sisters, my younger brother, and we had employed someone to look after them. 
Q.	Am I correct in saying that in your immediate family -- you understand, your immediate family, mum and dad and your immediate brothers and sisters -- fortunately, none were killed in the genocide; is that correct? 
A.	That is true because I went to seek refuge together with those members of my family that you've just mentioned.  It's only those who didn't follow us that met their death. 
Q.	And is it right that no Tutsis were killed in Ndatemwa centre? 
A.	Tutsis were killed.  There were three young men and a young girl who were killed.  Now, these people have a relationship with a person which is on the list at number 2.  It's Muhire who had them killed by having accused them of having participated in the training to handle weapons and the attackers killed them at Kayanga.  
Q.	I'm asking you about Ndatemwa.  There's no dispute that people were killed elsewhere. 
A.	When we came back from the place where we had sought refuge, people were saying that Muhire had someone killed.  Even today, in the Gacaca courts, Muhire is being accused of having had someone killed in Ndatemwa.  Now, these are the people that I spoke to you about, were attacked in -- in Ndatemwa, and they were finished off once they got to Kayanga.  So it's at Ndatemwa that these people were attacked initially. 
Q.	Are these -- two of these people -- people who were attacked on or about the 11th of April and injured and taken to the Kayanga health centre, are those two of the people that you're talking about? 
A.	Yes, those are the two but even two others who were watching over them were also killed. 
Q.	Killed at the Kayanga health centre or nearby, is that correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	I'm asking you about people killed in Ndatemwa itself.  Can you confirm that no Tutsis were killed at the trade centre of Ndatemwa? 
A.	I immediately left to go and seek refuge.  I don't know whether someone was killed.  But now when we came back from the place of refuge, we had a census made in Ndatemwa, and recently Muhire has been accused of having committed atrocities in this particular place. 
Q.	And who is he said to have killed who was a Tutsi living in Ndatemwa in 1994? 
A.	Those who accuse him said that the person wasn't a native of Ndatemwa, but had come to seek refuge at the Rubungo bureau communal.  But people came from Rubungo and Kanombe, so it wasn't clear as to the identity of the person.  But he was accused of having killed that person. 
Q.	Let me ask you one last time.  Is it right to say that no Tutsis living in Ndatemwa were killed in Ndatemwa during the genocide? 
A.	I've told you that people were killed in Ndatemwa.  When we came back from our place of refuge, we saw human bones.  There's an old lady known as Kanangwe (sic) and one Ruhimba who were killed in that place.  These are people whom I knew, Kahindi and Ruhimba.  
Q.	You made a statement on the 9th of February 1998.  An investigator came to see you called Sidibe, together with somebody else, and you remember making that statement; is that right? 
A.	Yes, I gave them a statement, but I didn't know their names. 
Q.	Perhaps you can accept the name from me.  Do you know why those investigators came to see you? 
A.	No, I just saw them come to where I was. 
Q.	Well, how -- how did they approach you?  What did they say to you? 
A.	They asked me questions about the events, which took place in our local area, and I spoke to them about them in the form of a statement, I would say. 
Q.	Well, all your statement is about Rwamakuba, nobody else.  How did that happen?  I say "nobody else," but it's all in the context of André Rwamakuba.  
A.	I spoke about him because he is the one that I saw.  Furthermore, he had brought machetes to that place, and that's why I mentioned him. 
Q.	Did the investigators come to you and say, "Do you know anything about someone called
	André Rwamakuba?" 
A.	They asked me questions about people who had acted reprehensibly -- reprehensibly in my local area, and I explained to them that one André Rwamakuba came to distribute machetes in my local area and to incite people to kill others. 
Q.	Did you know and do you know a man called Faustin Rutabagira (phonetic) who was bourgmestre of the commune after the RPF, the Inkotanyi, arrived in April of 1994?  Did you know that man? 
A.	Yes, I do know the person.  It's -- he's someone from my commune.  I know him.  He was bourgmestre in our commune.
Q.	Was he also president of the Parti libéral?  
A.	I don't know whether he was chairman of the PL.  I knew him while he was a school teacher, and then subsequently, he became bourgmestre -- he was appointed bourgmestre. 
Q.	Do you know that a report on the genocide in your area was compiled in 1996, and that 
	Faustin Rutabagira, the bourgmestre, was one of the contributors of information as to the events in your area.  Were you aware of that? 
A.	Who drafted the reports, Counsel? 
Q.	It was a national commission that was established in Rwanda. 
A.	I'm not aware of that. 
Q.	You've mentioned Gacaca.  What stage has Gacaca reached in your area? 
A.	They're at the stage where they're collecting information. 
Q.	Have you provided a statement with your information? 
A.	Everyone who has any information provides that information.  I also did the same. 
A.	Have you mentioned André Rwamakuba in your statement?  
A.	Yes.  I mentioned him, Muhire and Joas.  
Q.	And when did you make your statement? 
A.	It's about two months since the Gacaca courts began, and that's when I provided the information. 
Q.	So in April of this year, you provided a statement to the Gacaca court for your secteur; is that correct? 
A.	Yes.  I don't remember the date, but I do recall that I gave the information, and that information appears in the notebooks in which information collected is written. 
Q.	Before the 4th or 5th of April, what previous MDR meetings do you remember being held at Ndatemwa? 
A.	Ndatemwa -- Ndatemwa was a trading centre, and Rwamakuba came to organise meetings there in secret.  Otherwise, public meetings were held at the secteur office. 
Q.	Please, just answer the question.  Before the 4th or the 5th of April of 1994, what other MDR meetings were held in Ndatemwa? 
A.	Are you speaking about the MDR in general, or are you speaking about the wing -- the MDR Power wing? 
Q.	What meetings by MDR were held in your commercial centre of Ndatemwa before the 4th and 5th of April 1994? 
A.	I've tried to explain to you that public meetings were held at the secteur offices.  But meetings of the MDR Power were held in Muhire's house.  There are only those two meetings of the MDR Power that took place in Muhire's house that I know about.  Otherwise, I do not know of any other meetings which may have taken place at the secteur offices, since I didn't attend them. 
Q.	So no MDR meetings took place, whether Power or not, before the 4th or the 5th of April; is that correct? 
A.	The 4th and the 5th -- between the 4th and the 5th, there were meetings of the MDR Power, according to the information I received. 
Q.	According -- all right.  What meetings -- MDR meetings or MDR Power meetings did you hear about that were held before the 1st of April 1994 in your commune?  What meetings can you tell us about? 
A.	I no longer remember on what dates these meetings took place, but I do recall, however, that one time there was a meeting in Kayanga.  I got to know that one Twagiramungu, who was prime minister, had come to Kayanga on one occasion only.  But I no longer remember on what date.  At that point in time, there had, as yet, not had been any split within the MDR. 
Q.	The president of the commune of the MDR party was Anathase Gasana.  That's correct, isn't it? 
A.	That's possible, but I wasn't interested in that.  I know that he was a member of the MDR, but I do not know whether he was the commune chairman. 
Q.	And his house in the commune is in Ndatemwa, isn't it? 
A.	He built a house in Ndatemwa to which he would come to rest from time to time, but he didn't live there. 
Q.	And -- and that house is the most substantial building in Ndatemwa, ************************************* on the main road; isn't that right? 
A.	No, ***********************************************************************************************************************************. 
Q.	Very well.  And Anastase Gasana was leader of the MDR in your area and he was -- 
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...
Q.	-- excuse me, I haven't finished the que- -- I'm sorry, I did pause a long time.  I haven't finished my question -- he was the president of the MDR in your area and he was a moderate man in the sense that he was not someone who expressed anti-Tutsi sentiments.  Would you agree with that? 
A.	I didn't speak with him.  He would come in the company of soldiers from UNAMIR.  He would enter his house, and I didn't have any opportunity to speak with him. 
Q.	The man who came on the 4th or 5th, and the 11th and the 12th in your evidence and who you say was André Rwamakuba -- and I make it plain it's not accepted he was in Ndatemwa at all in April -- 
	André Rwamakuba, would you describe that man to us, please, the man that you saw?
A.	This person came.  When I asked who that person was, I was told it was Rwamakuba.  He came again on the second occasion, and I got to know, still, that it was André Rwamakuba.  I'm saying that it was Rwamakuba because I was told the person's name was André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Will you describe him to us, please? 
A.	This was a man of -- more or less, light-skinned, not quite light and not dark either.  He was of medium size, rather hefty but not fat. 
Q.	So he is light-skinned but he is not darked-skinned and he's not light-skinned.  He's -- he's hefty, hefty not fat.  Can you help us any better than that?  
A.	I do not have any other details to add. 
Q.	On a previous occasion, did you describe André Rwamakuba in this way.  "His skin is not too dark.  He's not very big, but he's quite robust, quite solid.  He wore glasses -- spectacles also when he came, spectacles."  And then later, your describe --
A.	(Microphones overlapping)...
Q.	-- let me finish, "A solid man, thick, stocky, solid, robust, a robust, stocky man with glasses."  Is that -- is that a -- a fair description of him, according to you? 
A.	According to the way I know this person, I saw that he gave the impression of wearing glasses.  He was someone who was solid.  He didn't have a very light skin.  His complexion was between dark and light. That's what I said. 
Q.	So a solid man, would that be right? 
A.	Yes, he gave me the impression of being someone who was quite energetic. 
MR. HOOPER:
I see the time.  I don't know if that is an appropriate moment?  Thank you.
MR. PRESIDENT:
Do you have an idea about how much longer you might be?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone, please, Your Honour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, thank you. 

Do you have any idea about how much longer you may be? 
MR. HOOPER:
One hour. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
One hour, thank you. 

We'll take the luncheon adjournment now.
(Court recessed at 1230H)
(Pages 21 to 29 by Jean Baigent)





(Court resumed at 1412H)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon.  We'll resume now.  Mr. Witness, you will continue giving your evidence this afternoon.  You're still under the same oath to tell the truth that you took this morning when you began to give evidence.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
	Yes, I do, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you.  

Mr. Hooper?  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Yes, Mr. Witness, just before we rose for lunch, I was asking you about a previous description you'd given of André Rwamakuba, and I want to go to the page of the transcript because I wasn't clear whether you had accepted that that was something you'd said before or not.  So I'm looking at        page 24 of the transcript of the 22nd of April 2004, at line 20 -- at line 19, when you were asked by the Prosecutor, "Could you describe him to us?"  And your words were these:  "His skin is not too dark.  He's not very big, but he's quite robust, quite solid."  Do you agree, first of all, that you said that, and, secondly, is it a correct description of the man you saw?  
A.	I think that is how I described this man, and I confirm that description today.  
Q.	Thank you.  And it continues, and you said, "He wore glasses also when he came, spectacles."  Do you agree that you said that, and is it a correct description?  
A.	When he came, I observed that he was wearing a jacket and also spectacles.  
Q.	Thank you.  Now I move to a later point in your evidence, on the 27th of April of 2004, at page 46, at line 32, and I just read your words.  "As I saw him on that day, he wasn't neither very dark-skinned or light-skinned.  He was wearing glasses.  He wasn't a very hefty man, but he was rather stocky."  

I'll read that again for the interpreter, if I may.  "As I saw him on that day, he wasn't either very dark-skinned or light-skinned.  He was wearing glasses.  He wasn't a very hefty man, but he was rather stocky."  Do you remember saying that, and is it a true description of the man you saw?  
A.	Yes.  As I said, he's average size.  He's of average height.  He's neither too tall nor too short.  That's what I said.  
Q.	And then you said -- and these are two separate statements, I omit the surrounding questions -- "Answer:  Yes, a robust man, if you will."  And a moment later, you said, "A solid man, if you will, or thick."  Do you agree that you said that, and is it an accurate description of the man you saw?  
A.	I said that he was of average size and that he was neither too fat, nor too thin.  
Q.	No, sir.  I'm putting to you what you said.  Will you accept that you said this?  
A.	Yes, I said that.  
Q.	Thank you.  You did not know André Rwamakuba at all before the 4th or 5th of April; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, it is.  Because I got to know him when I saw him come to our local area on the two occasions that I mentioned.  
Q.	You recall you made a statement in this matter, the one statement, dated the 9th of February 1998.  And you said this morning that you'd had the opportunity to have that read to you, or to read it, and to correct anything that was in it.  That is correct, isn't it?  
A.	It's been a long time.  I don't really remember.  
Q.	Well, I will be corrected by the Prosecution if I've said anything there that's inaccurate.  I want to read to you the first paragraph of your statement.  Just one moment.  

I don't know if the interpreter has a copy, particularly, the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  I'll get one to him, if I may.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
"Counsel, we have the statement," says the Kinyarwanda interpreter.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you very much, Interpreter.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I'm looking at my English page GII4, but it's also the commencement of the French on its appropriate page.  "In April 1994," your statement starts, "I owned a small business at Ndatemwa trading centre in Gasabo secteur, Gikomero commune.  ************************************"  So far that's all correct, sir, isn't it?  
A.	I live in ***********.  As to the distance between that place and ************************, I would say the distance is not -- it's not a long distance.  It's short.  
Q.	"I met Dr. André Rwamakuba at the meetings he organised in our area.  He was a member of the Mouvement Démocratique Républicain, MDR party.  With the division within the MDR, he joined the so-called Power wing.  He thus held those meetings to recruit members.  Before that, I had only heard of him, but had never met him.  

"On 10th or 11th of April 1994, Rwamakuba came to the Ndatemwa trading centre in a vehicle carrying machetes, which he off-loaded at the home of a man named André Muhire" 

Now, I want to ask you, what do you mean in your statement when you say that you met                André Rwamakuba at MDR meetings he organised in your area?  What did you mean by that?  
A.	I think the person who took down those notes made a mistake.  What I wished to indicate was that he found me in Ndatemwa.  That is where I was when he arrived.  That is what I meant.  
Q.	So when you say, as you just have, that the investigators made a mistake, you acknowledge, don't you, that this is a different story to your evidence that you've given in this Chamber?  It's different, isn't it?  
A.	I see that there is a minor contradiction, a misunderstanding.  There was a misunderstanding because I said that I saw him.  I met him when he came to organise these meetings, seeking members to join the Power wing.  I did not actually meet him personally.  
Q.	And when you refer in your statement to the MDR meetings he organised in our area, what meetings are you talking about there?  
A.	Actually, what I mean is small meetings.  He would come and organise small meetings in houses of the inhabitants of that area.  I'm not referring to rallies as such.  
Q.	And did any of those meetings take place before the 4th or 5th of April?  Yes or no?  
A.	The meetings during which I saw him are the two that I mentioned.  
Q.	Or is it that you're now giving us a different story to the one you gave to the investigators?  
A.	The way I see it, there's no contradiction.  I said that I saw him when he came to meetings organised by his party.  That's what I said.  
Q.	No.  You say here that you met him at meetings, which is quite different, isn't it?  
A.	I have told you that I am not the one who wrote down this statement.  If the document you're reading is not clear, that is another matter altogether.  What I wanted to say, what I meant, was that he found me at the centre when he came.  I did not imply -- or did not wish to indicate that I participated in any meeting that he organised.  
Q.	If this difference is obvious to you now, why didn't you correct it when you had the opportunity to do so before signing the statement?  
A.	It didn't seem to be a contradiction to me.  I was asked for information, and I said that I saw him when he came to that place, and he found me there.  I think that is what I said.  
Q.	In your statement, there's no mention of the meeting of the 4th or 5th of April.  Why didn't you mention -- why didn't you mention seeing Rwamakuba on that first occasion?  
A.	I was answering the questions that were put to me.  I did not know the objective of the questions.  So I used the questions, I based myself on the questions that were put to me, to provide the answers.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	When you spoke to the investigators, did you mention this meeting on the 4th or 5th of April?  
A.	I spoke about it because this shows -- this can be seen in my statement.  
Q.	Well, you see there's no mention of the 4th or the 5th of April, of the car coming, of you standing and watching, of you learning of the man's name.  There's nothing there about that at all.  Do you see?  
A.	But just a moment ago, I told you that I was answering questions that were put to me.  
Q.	And it would be difficult, wouldn't it, to tell your story and not mention that the man came on the 4th or the 5th, and then he came a few days later?  That would be a natural recounting of your story that you tell us today.  So how come it's not in your statement?  
A.	I told you that I'm not the one who wrote this statement down.  
Q.	But you're the one who had it read to you and signed?  You signed it, didn't you?  
A.	I signed that statement, yes.  
Q.	So let's come to this first of the two incidents in your evidence.  The -- and let's just have this in context, first of all.  It's right, isn't it, that on the 4th or the 5th of April, nothing particularly dramatic had yet happened in -- in Rwanda?  The president hadn't been killed.  That wasn't to happen for -- until the evening of the 6th.  And so this was just, in a way, another day, wasn't it, the 4th or the 5th of April, another day in Rwanda?  Would that be fair to put it like that?  
A.	No, that's not quite right.  
Q.	Well, why not?  
A.	Because there was a split which had occurred in these parties.  I told you that my cattle had already been looted or stolen, and there was obvious insecurity.  
Q.	The incident, if it had happened, if it happened to your cattle, was back in January, wasn't it?  We're talking here of the 4th or 5th of April.  
A.	That's what I was telling you a moment ago.  There was a split in all the parties.  The Power wings caused insecurity almost everywhere, and this was the situation that obtained in the country.  There was no security.  
Q.	But on the 4th or the 5th of April, political events were slowly making their way towards a transitional government, and the dramatic event of the president's death had not intervened at that time, had it?  
A.	I do understand, yes, that the president hadn't died.  
Q.	So what was it that was striking about a car arriving outside Muhire's home? 
A.	It's because *************************************** that man lived.  And then there was no security, and many people had also gathered there.  And people were active in the multi-party politics.  
Q.	How many other vehicles came that day, that you remember?  
A.	It was the only vehicle that I saw.  
Q.	So no other vehicles came to Ndatemwa on the 4th or 5th of April; is that what you're saying?  
A.	I was able to see that vehicle.  It was the only one that I saw that came and parked in that place.  
Q.	What other vehicles did you notice arriving that week from the 1st of April?  
A.	There is a road which goes by there, and let me tell you that I wasn't responsible for inspecting and monitoring the vehicles that were going along that road.  I saw all the vehicles that passed by that road.  
Q.	And you were monitoring these vehicles, were you?  
A.	No.  I told you that I was not responsible for monitoring all the vehicles that were passing on that road.  That was the only vehicle that I saw which came and parked where I said.  
Q.	Was there somebody monitoring the vehicles, to your knowledge?  
A.	To what end, Counsel?  There wasn't anyone.  
Q.	Can I come back to your shop?  You showed us the position with the cross on a map, and I just want to -- on a photograph.  I don't have those photographs, but could you be shown the bundle, please, at page 16, of the exhibits bundle, dealing with *************, which is a slightly different view.  And could you indicate whether the site of your shop is there?  I ask that because you seem to have indicated ***********************************************************************************************************, and I suspect that isn't correct.  So perhaps there's a better shot of the area.  Page 16.  Any copy will do.  
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, before the photograph is shown, I would like to ask, since I know that the witness is able to recognise André Muhire's name, would that not be a difficulty for the Defence?  Wouldn't that document not bear the name of André Muhire, because when I took the photograph this morning, I took the trouble to remove the name, so that the witness is unable to identify the photograph through that name being there.  
MR. HOOPER:
I have no problem with that, with Muhire's home being shown on there or indicated on there -- or his homes, in fact.  If the witness can be shown it, I'm just interested to know where ***********.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So could you look at the top photograph there with the cows in it and just tell us where the site **************** was in relation to anything in that photograph, please.  
A.	The house was here below the road.  
Q.	We can't see where you're pointing, and we don't have the camera facility in this Court.  Just -- can you describe where your house is in terms of -- is it where the cow is, for example, or cows, or is it somewhere else?  
A.	It's on the lower end of the road where one can see three cows.  
Q.	Are the cows stood where ***************?  
A.	No.  It was, rather, before the place where the cows can be seen, a little bit away from the place where the cattle can be seen.  
Q.	Is it possible for you to mark -- can we mark that document that you have?  Is that acceptable to everyone?  Can you mark with a cross where -- where - where *************************?  If that's all right, can you be given a pen, and can you just mark with an X -- it's an exhibit. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I know.  But would the location -- would the location ************* be a confidential issue?  
MR. HOOPER:
It would be -- well, ************* then, it probably would be, yes.  Though he's given details in open court about position and things which are probably pretty -- I don't think this is new ground in its way.  But if caution is needed, is it possible for the witness to mark this particular document, or would he need to be provided with another -- another document?  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It might be safer because -

MR. HOOPER:
Yes.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
It would be better to put the document in under seal.  
MR. HOOPER:
In that case, I'm afraid I'm lacking my -- I don't have a copier.  In fact, I'm lacking my own exhibit bundle, I'm afraid.  Can the Prosecution help me at all?  Is there a photograph of this, of page 16, that he can mark?  No?  
MS. FALL:
I'm sorry, Mr. Hooper.  I had taken care this morning to produce this document myself.  Unfortunately, I don't have a spare copy.  I'm very sorry because I can't seem to be able to help you.  
MR. HOOPER:
Excuse me.  I'm sorry.  

Is there a copy we can borrow, and we'll photocopy quickly?  We think it may be in the office, ours, but it equally might not be.  Could I borrow yours, Ms. Fall, and give it back to you unmarked and unscrutinised in a moment and just trust it to Ms. Pouplard, who will go and photocopy a page and bring it back?  And later I'll deal with this singular point with the witness, if I may.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall, Ms. Fall, I can't resist commenting on Mr. Hooper's determination to get a favour from you this afternoon.  
MS. FALL:
I will not disappoint him, and it is with a great deal of pleasure that I have given him my copy, but I hope that he will return it to me as is.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Okay.  Mr. Witness, we're going to come back to that later briefly, I hope, exactly where *************.  But I understood you to say that you were only -- that you were ************************ when this car arrived, and you were four metres away from it; is that right?  Four metres away?  Four metres, sir, is about less than from me to you.  Did you mean four metres?  
A.	I was in front of the house, and what I said is that there was a distance of four metres between the house and the vehicle, and I was in front of that house.  
Q.	So you were very close, indeed, a couple of paces away; is that right?  
A.	You're speaking about a few metres from where, Counsel?  
Q.	Well, from the distance you described, that you were in front of ************* and just four metres away from where this car was in front of Muhire's, as I understood you to say it.  
A.	No, that's not what I said.  You had asked me about the distance between the road and ***********.  And I said that ************ was on the lower side of the road and was four metres from the road, but it's not the distance between *************.  
Q.	And this building you refer to, how many rooms did it have?  
A.	It was a house which was **********************, and it had a large room and a smaller room.  
Q.	**********************?  
A.	There was a part in which *************************************************************************************************.  
Q.	The 4th of April 1994 was a holiday, was it not?  It was Easter Monday.  Do you remember?  
A.	I do not remember.  All this happened a long time ago, and I do not remember.  
Q.	And the shops wouldn't have been open on Easter Monday, would they?  
A.	No.  We were open.  
Q.	Well, can you remember if you were open or not on that Monday?  
A.	There was no law preventing one to carry out one's business on that day.  I do not believe it was prohibited to trade and run one's shop on that day, that Easter Monday.  
Q.	Well, was it the Easter Monday, the holiday, that you saw the car?  
A.	I do not remember whether it was a Monday or not.  I told you that I saw this vehicle on the 4th or 5th, but I could not tell you now whether it was Easter Monday or not.  
Q.	And what time of day was it that the car came?  
A.	The vehicle came in the afternoon.  
Q.	Can you help us as to what time in the afternoon?  
A.	I am telling you that it was in the afternoon.  
Q.	Can you give us the time?  
A.	I do not wear a watch.  I cannot risk giving just any time.  What I said is that it was in the afternoon.  
Q.	In your evidence on a previous occasion, you risked giving the time by saying it was between 
	2 and 3 p.m.  That was a year ago.  Have you now forgotten the time that you knew then, a year ago?  
A.	You, yourself, understand.  I said it was in the afternoon, and I confirm that.  In view of the time that has passed, I cannot remember hours.  
Q.	Well, why were you able to say between 2 and 3 p.m. last time you gave evidence but not now?  What's changed?  
A.	You must understand that this is an approximation.  I'll give you an example.  We're working this afternoon.  I'm not wearing a watch.  If you were to ask me the time, I would not be able to tell you the exact time.  If I told you anything, it would be approximate.  I may tell you what I think the time is, and when you look at your watch, you will find that it is not correct.  
Q.	And on this first occasion, on this first occasion, how long did the man who came in the car stay at Muhire's before leaving?  
A.	He stayed there for a relatively long time, but I did not calculate the number of hours that he spent there.  But I can confirm that he stayed there for a relatively long time.  
Q.	Well, how long is that?  
A.	About one-and-a-half to two hours.  
Q.	And during the time the man was in Muhire's, what were you doing?  
A.	I told you that I was standing **************.  
Q.	For two hours you were standing *************?  
A.	I moved from time to time.  I would go *************************************************.  But when the vehicle went away, I saw it leave.  I saw the vehicle come and leave.  
Q.	And where was the driver of this vehicle during this time?  
A.	I didn't pay attention.  I think he was also inside the house.  
Q.	And who were you with during that time?  
A.	There were many people in the centre, but I was standing **********************, whereas my neighbours were moving about.  
Q.	Well, were you with anybody?  
A.	Yes.  From time to time ******************************************************************************.  Yes, people did come.  
Q.	Can you remember any of their names?  
A.	I don't remember.  I did not know that these people's names would be asked of me.  
Q.	Now, obviously you weren't in Muhire's house, but did you come to hear, on the 4th or the 5th, of what had happened at Muhire's house -- or not?  
A.	I was not able to determine what was said inside Muhire's house, but there are young people who came out of the meeting and who were boasting of what they had discussed during the meeting.  
Q.	And can you just tell us again what these young people were saying that you heard?  
A.	They were saying that they were going to kill people.  
Q.	Did they say what -- which people?  
A.	They said that they would kill Tutsis.  
Q.	Now, you didn't tell the investigators that in your statement, did you?  There was no mention of that, was there?  Why was that?  
A.	Nobody asked me anything about it.  They asked me questions, and I answered the questions that they put to me.  
Q.	Why would you leave out the fact that after a meeting with this man, young people were coming out saying they were going to kill your people?  Why didn't you tell them that?  
A.	Nobody asked me about that.  If they had asked me about that, I would surely have talked about it.  
Q.	Did you believe what these young people were saying, that it was something they meant, to kill Tutsis?  
A.	Yes, I believed it.  At the time, the security situation was precarious.  They had already attacked my cows, and, in general, the situation was very shaky, indeed.  And even when they organised the beating of the four people that I mentioned, I understood that there was no longer any safety in the area.  
Q.	Do you remember saying before that you -- you didn't believe it, that's why you didn't tell the investigators?  Which is it -- you did believe it, or you didn't believe it?  
A.	I did not say that I didn't believe it.  You asked me why I did not indicate this to the investigators, and I told you that nobody asked me any questions about it.  
Q.	Do you remember saying this on a previous occasion in evidence -- and I'm quoting you here -- "I think that I mentioned that, but they didn't include it in the statement"?  Do you remember saying that, and is it true or untrue?  
A.	That's a long time ago.  I don't remember what it is that I said.  In any case, after interviewing me, I was told -- after I was interviewed, I was told that I should be prepared to come to Arusha to give testimony before the Court.  I did not find it necessary to give all the details because I had been told that I would be appearing before the Court and that I would then give more information, if necessary.  
Q.	But we're left with this, no mention of the 4th or the 5th of April in your statement, no mention of people saying they were going to kill Tutsis after such a meeting.  You agree that doesn't appear in your statement?  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	I have told you that I did not have to chat with the investigators.  They put questions to me, and I gave them answers.  I was not able to provide all the details.  They took down the main points, the points that were most important to them.  They did not ask me everything, and I did not say everything.  I did not give all the details about what I knew.  
Q.	Let's come to the second meeting -- this is -- or opportunity that you tell us about.  And this is on the 10th or the 11th of April.  Let's put this in context.  On the 6th of April, Habyarimana is killed.  And from the 7th of April, there is, to use a neutral word, great unrest.  Were you listening to the radio during that period?  
A.	Yes, I was listening to the radio.  
Q.	On the 10th or 11th, you say you saw a vehicle arrive.  Was this the same vehicle that you'd seen before in your evidence?  Is it the same vehicle?  
A.	I saw a white vehicle.  I think it was the same as the one I had seen before.  
Q.	And you saw the same man with glasses; is that right?  
A.	Yes, I saw Rwamakuba again on board this vehicle.  
Q.	The same man with glasses.  And was it the same driver?  
A.	He came and parked his vehicle once more in front of Muhire's house.  I did not pay attention to the fact of whether or not he had a driver on that day.  
Q.	Well, you -- you told us this morning he had a driver.  So did he or didn't he?  
A.	Yes.  There were two of them.  
Q.	What do you mean "two of them"?  Two of them in the vehicle, presumably.  Just for clarification.  
A.	Yes, there were two of them in the vehicle.  
Q.	The question is, was it the same driver as you saw before just a few days earlier?  
A.	I did not pay attention in order to determine whether it was the same driver, and I didn't know this driver anyway.  No one told me his name, that is, the name of the second person who was with Rwamakuba.  
Q.	But that second person may have been a very important person.  Why didn't you interest yourself in who it was?  
A.	They said that it was Rwamakuba who was coming.  Nobody talked about this second person.

1515H
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Was it the same man as you saw on the 4th or 5th who was the second person, or a different person? 
A.	Yes, it is the same person. 
Q.	Can you describe him -- 
A.	Because they told me, "This is Rwamakuba," and when I looked, I realised that it was, indeed, Rwamakuba. 
Q.	That's the man in glasses, is it? 
A.	Yes, it is the same person. 
Q.	So the thick -- 
A.	I was told that it was Rwamakuba, and it is this person whom I saw the second time. 
Q.	The solid, thick man in glasses; is that correct? 
A.	I told you this was a person of average size, neither too fat nor too thin.  He was wearing a jacket and he was wearing spectacles.  That is all I said about him. 
Q.	Did you know of a man called Ephrem, E-P-H-R-E-M, E-P-H-R-E-M, Ephrem -- let me finish -- Ephrem, who was a local Interahamwe?  Do you know that person I am talking about? 
A.	I heard that he was well known during the killings and that he was the younger brother of the accountant.  He was a well-known Interahamwe in Gasabo area, but I never saw him. 
Q.	What time of day did the vehicle come on the 10th or the 11th? 
A.	The vehicle also came in the afternoon. 
Q.	What time in the afternoon? 
A.	In the afternoon hours. 
Q.	On a previous occasion, do you agree that you had said that he came between 2:00 and 3:00 in the afternoon? 
A.	Yes, I gave approximate times.  I told you that I wasn't wearing a watch.  In any case, it was in the afternoon. 
Q.	And how long did that vehicle remain there before the people left in it again? 
A.	About an hour and a half. 
Q.	And you were ***********, were you? 
A.	Yes, I did see the vehicle.  I went forward to look at the vehicle. 
Q.	And who were you with during the time the vehicle was there? 
A.	There were many people at the centre who came very often.  People were coming and going.  There were people who came to look at the vehicle and went away again, so I cannot say exactly who was with me.  All I can say was that the centre was very busy, and that there was also a group of refugees which had come from the north and which lived nearby.  This means that there were many people at the centre. 
Q.	Now, you can't remember who you were with, but was your shop open, your bar, was it open? 
A.	Yes, it was. 
Q.	When did you re-open it after the 6 of April when everything was ordered to be closed?  When did you order -- when did you re-open your shop and bar? 
A.	Yes, at the time, we went on with our daily activities.  I had foodstuff; I had beer, so I went on plying my trade. 
Q.	But hadn't the leaders of the country, after the president had been killed, ordered everyone to stay indoors, the markets to close, and the shops to close? 
A.	Yes, people stayed at home, but since I lived in the same house, to protect my property, I didn't go back to my parent's home, I stayed where I plied my trade. 
Q.	But hadn't you been ordered not to trade after the president was killed? 
A.	No, people continued to ply their trades. 
Q.	And so you counted five bags being unloaded from this car:  one, two, three, four, five; is that right? 
A.	Yes.  I could see what was going on clearly, so I saw the five bags. 
Q.	You are sure it wasn't four bags or six bags? 
A.	No, I counted the bags well. 
Q.	Why did you do that? 
A.	I could see well.  I could see clearly what was going on. 
Q.	But did you think they contained machetes? 
A.	No, I did not know from the start that there were machetes in them, but I found out.  Some people told me that the contents were machetes. 
Q.	But that was on the 13th you told us, wasn't it, some two or three days later? 
A.	Yes, that is what I said.  However, people were talking about it.  There were rumours that there were machetes in these bags, but I was not yet sure until I found out that there were indeed machetes in the bags. 
Q.	You have never said before today that anyone had hinted to you that those bags contained machetes.  You've never said that before this afternoon, have you? 
A.	Before that, I was asked when exactly I saw these machetes.  I could not say that there were rumours about the bags containing machetes, whereas it is on 13th that I saw that the bags had contained machetes.  It was on that date that I saw this with my own eyes. 
Q.	Indeed, in your statement in 1998 you say, "I must say with all truth that I didn't know they were machetes until I saw him distributing them."  In all truth, is that right, you didn't know they were machetes? 
A.	Yes, I confirm this.  I have sworn to tell the truth and it is the truth I am telling.  But since the security situation was difficult, people were fleeing.  We were forced to monitor closely what was going on.  I myself was eager to find out what was the content of this vehicle and the bags, but I cannot say that I saw machetes before the 13th, however, there were rumours that these bags had contained machetes, but until the 13th when I myself saw that these bags did indeed contain machetes. 
Q.	How big were these bags; can you demonstrate with your hands their dimensions? 
A.	They looked like rice bags. 
Q.	How big is that; can you demonstrate with your hands, please? 
A.	So the bags were unloaded into the house.
MR. HOOPER:
Apologies to the interpreters.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Can you demonstrate with your hands, please, the dimensions of the bags as you sit there?  Can you show how high and wide they were?
A.	Unless you bring a bag here so that I can show you the sizes that these bags were, otherwise it would be very difficult for me to show you -- to indicate to you with my arms the sizes of these bags. 
Q.	Well, I'm asking you help us in -- I know I'm -- what I know are not easy circumstances, but can you show us with your hand, first of all, how wide was the bag that you saw -- the bags you saw, and secondly, how high would they be off the ground?  Can you do that, please? 
A.	The bag was wider than my arms.  I do not know how I can really show you the size of this bag. 
Q.	Well, can I have your attention for a moment, sir?  Would you like to look at me for a moment and I will see if I can help you.  If this is the ground, this table, tell me how high the bag was.  All right, just say "stop" from the ground.  
MR. HOOPER: 
And I'm going to have a difficulty.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So you are able to demonstrate, I think -- just show the President -- the Judges how high from the table. You are -- you are doing a good job there, you show us.  
A.	No, you have to give me a bag.  You see, there is length, there is weight, perhaps if a bag were brought to me and things were put in the bag, I would be able to show clearly how big the bag was. 
Q.	Well, I'm not going to do any of that, sir.  I'm just going to ask you again, as you just did a moment ago, to deal with length and breadth and weight, and we'll do it one at a time, if you can help me.  If you can't help me, you say so.  But, first of all, you had your hand raised, just a little distance above the table in front of you.  Can you do that again, please? 
A.	Yes, now you are asking me to give you something approximate.  Perhaps after a while you are going to be asking me how many kilos the bag could take.  But I'm telling you that this is a bag like those that are used to store rice. 
Q.	All right, let me put the question in a different way.  You are a trader, you know the answer to this.  How many kilogramme bag of rice was it? 
A.	50 kilos. 
Q.	And what was the material of the bag made of that you saw? 
A.	These bags looked like rice bags. 
Q.	Was that sacking, plastic, hessian, what was it?  You are a trader, you know, you tell us.  
A.	We call these bags Manyowa or packet. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Could we have the spelling for that, please?  Not from the witness but from the interpreter, perhaps, if he knows the spelling, Manyowa.  
THE KINYARWANDA INTERPRETER:
Manyowa is spelt M-A-N-Y-O-W-A, Manyowa.  
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you very much.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And these were in the boot or cuff of the vehicle, according to you, is that right, when you were counting them with keen interest:  one, two, three, four, five, out of the booth of the car, the cuff; is that right? 
A.	That's correct. 
Q.	When you were talking to the investigators, you said there were approximately five bags on the back seat.  Is that a mistake or are you changing where these bags were? 
A.	I said that these bags were in the rear of the vehicle.  I saw these bags being taken out from the rear of the vehicle. 
Q.	Not the back seat? 
A.	Listen, I was not the one who wrote down the statement, but I told them that the bags were in the boot of the vehicle, which is generally in the rear of a vehicle.  I don't know whether they did not understand me correctly, but that is what I told them. 
Q.	What happened after that meeting?  Did anyone come and tell you what had happened at the meeting?  I was unclear, can you help me? 
A.	I told you that the young people who had took -- taken part in the meetings said at the end of the meeting that they were going to kill people.  These were the meetings during which massacres -- the massacres were prepared. 
Q.	So have I got this right?  After the first meeting you saw people came out and told you that they were going to kill the Tutsis, and then after this second meeting people came out and told you that they were going to kill the Tutsis; is that right? 
A.	That is correct.  People both said that they were going to kill the Tutsis.  I don't remember the exact day, but the following day after one of the meetings, Muhire organised the beating of Rugembesa and Rutembya.  He pointed them out to the soldiers and accused them of being Inyenzis who were training how to use weapons in the Pentecostal church, and then they were taken to Kayanga where they were killed. 
Q.	Let me -- I'm not going to get into a story with you about the Pentecostalists who were beaten and later killed.  And it's accepted that they were beaten and later killed.  But, in fact, they had been drinking at Rutabagira's bar, hadn't they, and they were beaten up by soldiers, FAR soldiers, who gave them a hiding so bad that they had to go to the Kayanga health centre.  That's what happened.  But, of course, your story for Gacaca is that they were here; that's the position, isn't it?
A.	What you are saying is not correct.  Rutabagira did not have any houses in that place.  The information that you have is erroneous. 
Q.	Right, but I'm not going to go into that, in any event, with you unless I have to, and I don't think I do.  By the time of this meeting, the 11th, had you heard any shooting or firing? 
A.	No.  There was no firing in that area.  There were soldiers of Habyarimana's government who were placed -- who were positioned in that place. 
Q.	Indeed, the FAR had a position between Rutunga and Gasabo, just north of Ndatemwa, going towards Kajevuba; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, they had a position at Gasabo. 
Q.	Is it right that they were forced out and fled on the 11th of April? 
A.	And who would that have been who chased them away from there?  
Q.	Before you left on the morning of the 13th of April, had you heard any -- let me rephrase that.  Before you left on the 13th of April, had you heard any shooting or firing of guns? 
A.	It is the Interahamwe and members of MDR-Power who were shooting at people and killing them.  In the various secteurs we could hear the firing by those various groups. 
Q.	All right, let's deal with Interahamwe shooting first.  When did you first hear Interahamwe shooting, which was obviously shooting your people; when did you first hear that? 
A.	It was on the 13th that I heard firing. 
Q.	Had you come across any refugees from Gikomero on the 12th who were fleeing Gikomero where 3,000 people or so were killed or allegedly killed? Did you come across any refugees fleeing there? 
A.	At that point in time, the refugees had been killed.  I didn't see them.  Where I was, I didn't see any refugees go by. 
Q.	Did you learn of any massacre that had taken place at Gishyaka near the commune centre and the Catholic Church was, under Father Donné, **************************?  Had you learnt anything about that by the time you fled on the 13th? 
A.	I got to know that many people had sought refuge in that location.  The people from Rubungo, Kanombe communes and those from Kigali were assembled there.  They were attacked, many of them were killed, and those who were able to survive, we met them on the road as they were trying to seek another refuge.  And it's at Kajevuba that we met them. 
Q.	Rutungo is not very far from you, is it, the parish of Rutungo?  It's the other side of the river, but it's not very far from you.  Can you remember hearing any firing of guns, and I don't just mean rifles, I mean heavy guns and mortars in the days prior to the 13th of April? 
A.	No, I didn't hear firing on the 13th; however, people were saying that the Inkotanyi had passed by there on their way to Kigali. 
Q.	Oh, indeed, but hadn't you heard firing or shooting coming from slightly to the north, northwest, northeast?  From the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th of April, had you heard any shooting or firing at all? 
A.	Our local area hadn't yet been attacked on 8th.  It was towards the 13th that our local area was attacked:  Tutsi houses were demolished, Tutsis themselves were killed, and survivors manage to escape.  
Q.	Were you actually where you say you were or were you somewhere else?  Had you fled perhaps earlier than you are telling us? 
A.	No, I fled on the date that I gave you.  It's then that I left my house when I saw those machetes. 
Q.	Well, according to you, you already knew that there were machetes because someone had told you that there might be machetes.  Isn't that your evidence now?  
A.	I told you that I witnessed the distribution of those machetes on the 13th. 
Q.	Every family there already had a machete, didn't they? 
A.	Each member of the population had a machete, but when we came back from our place of refuge, we realised that the people had been given arms and other equipment that they were going to be using to kill others. 
Q.	Well, I am just talking here about your machete delivery, delivered then by a minister of the government on the 10th or the 11th all the way to little Ndatemwa.  Did that machete distribution really take place as you say it did? 
A.	Yes, those machetes were indeed distributed. 
Q.	And you saw this.  You were ***************; is that right? 
A.	Yes, that was the case.  When Muhire brought out the machetes in order to distribute them, I saw them. 
Q.	So he brought out these bags again, did he, and out into the front of his house, that we can see in the photographs, and opened the bags up and started distributing them?  Is that what you say happened and what you saw? 
A.	Yes, he began to distribute these machetes to the youth -- youths from Rutunga and Gasabo, and when I saw that these people were starting to take the weapon I immediately fled. 
Q.	I dare say you would.  Well, what time of day was this? 
A.	It was in the afternoon (sic) at around 9:00, 9:30.
MR. HOOPER: 
Can we have that translated again, please?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I do beg your pardon; it was a slip of the tongue.  In the morning.  He -- the witness said that it was in the morning at 9:00 -- around 9:00, 9:30.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And why were you at ***************? 
A.	I didn't have a house.  My bed was in the building *********************, and that's where also were my goods which were in that house ***************. 
Q.	Why didn't you move your stock -- and I'd suggest perhaps not much stock -- why didn't you move your stock to your home your where your parents and brother were, perhaps for greater safety? 
A.	How would I have moved those belongings?  Furthermore, if the attackers would have found those goods in my house, they would have looted them.  On the radio, people were being asked to remain in their homes, but in order to have them killed.  When we heard that some people were asking others not to attack others, we thought that this was for reality, but, in fact, for security -- I'm sorry, but, in fact, it was so that people could be killed. 
Q.	And so 9:30 on the morning of the 13th of April, you see the distribution of machetes.  How far were you away from Muhire when he was doing that? 
A.	********************** from Muhire's house. 
Q.	************** now, is it? 
A.	Yes, I guess the distance was approximately *******************************************************.  And I had a good view of Muhire's house. 
Q.	And ********************************************* they would know that you were Tutsi, wouldn't they?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	But you managed to escape? 
A.	When I realised the prevailing situation, I realised that I was threatened myself.  I passed below my house and I fled. 
Q.	And we'll come back to this point:  none of the Tutsis who lived in the centre, the commercial centre, lost their lives, did they? 
A.	They fled; however, their houses were demolished.  It was the centre that had been spared, otherwise, the surrounding cellules were attacked and people were killed there. 
Q.	And when you fled, presumably you went *************************************************************** ; is that right? 
A.	I told you that even the centre was situated in ************************************************************************* I went to my parents' home, I told them, "People are being killed, you must flee," and we fled. 
Q.	But didn't you know people were being killed before the 13th?  Didn't you know they were being killed on the 12th at Gishyaka, at Gikomero?  Didn't you know that already? 
A.	Gishyaka is far from us in other secteur.  However, we learnt that the refugees who had gathered there had been killed on a Tuesday, and Wednesday the survivors fled.  And we started to go there around the 13th.  Some survived, but others were killed. 
Q.	And on what day was the 13th? 
A.	It was a Wednesday.  I believe it was a Wednesday. 
Q.	I have only one other question just as a general question of the case.  Were you involved in the atrocities that later took place at the Makogote camp, M-A-K-O-G-O-T-E? 
A.	I don't even know that place you are referring to as Makogote.  How could I participate in the attacks, the killings, whereas I myself was being threatened?  How could I have had the strength to go and kill others, whereas I myself was being sought?  
Q.	Now, I'm talking about the revenge, and then more, that was inflicted on Hutu people living in the area.  Did you know anything about that?  Have you ever heard that there were Hutu people there who were killed later in April and May and June?  Have you heard anything about that? 
A.	No, I never learnt anything of the sort.  I myself fled.  I was rescued by the Red Cross which was feeding us.  In July, I went back to my home and we were told to avoid seeking vengeance.  In fact, people who killed were arrested and put in prison.  Even Muhire was arrested and put in prison.  If I were to revenge, I would have revenged on Muhire, who had killed others.  They are -- these people are in prison, and they will be tried by their Gacaca courts. 
Q.	So you are not aware of any Hutus being killed by the RPF or by Tutsis later in your commune?  You've never heard of that; is that right? 
A.	No, I didn't get to hear of that.  What I know is that when the RPF arrived, it saved people.  I didn't see the RPF kill people.  We were assembled by the Red Cross in a camp, and I was not a witness to any killings by the RPF.  
Q.	My last question:  You can confirm, can you, on your story on the 13th when you reached Kajevuba, that the RPF were there; is that right? 
A.	No, there were no RPF soldiers.  We left our area, we mixed in with other refugees.  We did not see any soldiers of the RPF. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Thank you.  Those are all my questions.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Mr. Hooper.  

We will take a -- we will take a short break now.  
(Court recessed at 1600H)
(Pages 40 to 47 by Gifty C. Harding)












	(Court resumed at 1624H)
MR. HOOPER:
Before I give way to cross-examination, can I mention the photograph that we took the trouble of coping, but we have not had it marked?  I think, as this is an area slightly incomplete, it may be helpful if he could very quickly and appropriately put a mark where his ******** was.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Mr. Witness, if you can do that, just put a cross on the top photograph where ***************************.  If looking at that photograph you don't think ********************* was there, then say so and we won't ask you to put a mark.
A.	I think it is about here. 
Q.	Thank you very much.
MR. HOOPER: 
And the only other matter -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
We are just about exhibit it under seal.
MR. HOOPER:
Yes, if that would be exhibited under seal as -- 
MR. FRY:
D. 13. 
MR. HOOPER: 
D. 13, Your Honour.  And may I also take the opportunity to exhibit the statement of 1998, in which we say lie discrepancies which have been referred to, for completeness.  And we need to provide a clean statement of that, which I don't have at the moment, in both French and English; we do have it.  And while I'm on my feet there is also, perhaps, some catching up I can do with respect of other witnesses, but I don't touch on that now; and, oh yes, the list of names which were ticked by this witness and which has gone back to the registrar, who is holding it now.  Thank you very much, Mr. Fry:  And if that could be exhibited as D. 14, that is, the ticked list.  And if the statements together could be exhibited as D. 15, English and French, being the statement of 1998. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
So admitted into evidence.  Special mention that D. 13 is under seal. 
(Exhibit No. D. 13 admitted, under seal) 
(Exhibits Nos. D. 14 admitted)
(Exhibit No. D. 15(A) and D. 15(B) admitted)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Now, Mr. Witness, your evidence continues.  You will now be asked some questions in re-examination by the lawyer for the Prosecution.  Do you understand?  

THE WITNESS:
All right, Mr. President.  
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I shall not take much time.  I just wish to revisit a few issues.
RE-EXAMINATION
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	Witness, you were shown a list of names, and on that list you recognised that there were two people that you knew; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is true.  These are neighbours of mine, I know them. 
Q.	You also said that as part of your business you ran a bar.  
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	You also said that people could come to this bar and take their drinks there; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that is correct. 
Q.	You even told us that you did not know everyone who came to take a drink in your bar? 
A.	Quite so, I did not know them all. 
Q.	So, is it possible that people came, they know you as customers? 
MR. O'SHEA: 
I'd just asked my learned friend not to lead on this kind of matter, please. 
MS. FALL: 
Thank you, Mr. President.  I am not leading the witness but I shall be careful in that regard.  I'm not leading him, I'm putting questions to him; he is answering them.  I think that these questions come from questions that were put in cross-examination to which he answered perfectly clearly.  So I shall proceed.  
BY MS. FALL:
Q.	So, considering the questions that you answered in your cross-examination, is it possible that people would come to your bar and know you as the owner and manager of the bar, and you would not yourself know them; is it possible? 
A.	There were some of them who were neighbours whom I knew, but there were others who came from afar.  They would buy what they wanted, but I did not ask them who they were.  I did not seek to obtain information as to their identities. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  You said during the cross-examination that this place you called your bar or your store is the place where you lived and spent your nights, where you practically lived.  Do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I plied my trade there and I spent my nights there; that is correct. 
Q.	Witness, you told us that in Rwanda, it is possible for several people to have the same name; is that correct? 
A.	That is quite correct.  You might meet several people who bear the same name. 
Q.	Do you think there are other people who might bear your name? 
A.	There are many of them. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I shall now come to the transcript or the transcript of 1998, especially the first sentence of which much was made in your cross-examination.  When, in the first sentence, you referred to meetings that were organised by the MDR, can you tell us what meetings you are referring to here? 
A.	What I meant was that there were small meetings organised, more or less in hiding, by members of the MDR Power wing.  It is the sort of meeting that was organised at Muhire's home.  These were not the official meetings which were organised in the secteur.  It was that sort of small meeting that was organised at the trading centre in Muhire's homes.  And these meetings were organised by André Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Witness, you were charged with not talking about the meeting that occurred on the 4th or 5th of April 1994 in your first statement.  You defended yourself by saying that the question was not put to you; is that correct? 
A.	That is correct; no precise question was put to me about this matter.  
Q.	Do you remember when a question was put to you regarding the exact date, or the period when these meetings took place? 
A.	As regards these dates, I told them that I saw him during these meetings of the 4th and the 5th.  And the meetings -- during the meetings that took place on the 10th and the 11th of April, I think they note -- they wrote that down. 
Q.	Witness, to return to the description of André Rwamakuba, I wanted to find out from you what the difference is, in your view, between a solid man and a stocky man?  
A.	I was asked to give a physical description of this man; I said he was of average size, and that he was neither too fat nor too thin, and that when you looked at him you could see that he was a solid man.  He was a strong man; in any case, he wasn't weak. 
Q.	Witness, you said that you were present during the distribution of the machetes; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, I was present.  I could see when the distribution was being done.  
Q.	When Defence counsel was cross-examining you, and in reference to the distribution, maybe this was a mistake, but I thought I heard the name of the minister who had helped in the distribution of the machetes.  Can you please tell us exactly who distributed the weapons on the 13th of April, 1994? 
A.	The machetes had been supplied by Rwamakuba. 
Q.	Yes, you told us that, but what I want to know is who actually distributed the machetes on the 13th of April? 
A.	It was André Muhire who distributed the machetes. 
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I believe I have no further questions for this witness. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much, Ms. Fall.
Mr. Witness, you have come to the end of your evidence.  I would like to thank you for your attendance and for giving evidence in this trial.  You are excused now.  
THE WITNESS:
Mr. President, I wish to thank you also.   
(Witness excused)
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Madam Prosecutor, are you ready to have -- I was going to tell you to call the next witness, but I realised that we have to continue the testimony of Witness GIT; so could he be brought back into the courtroom, please.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, Witness GIT. 
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Mr. President. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
And how are you this afternoon?  
THE WITNESS:
I think that after having taken my medicine my health is improving, if I were to compare my condition today to that of yesterday. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, I'm very glad about that.  What we would like to do, we would like to have you resume your evidence now.  It may be finished this afternoon.  

So, I would invite counsel to continue your examination.  

I should remind you that you remain under the same oath that you took to tell the truth when you commenced your evidence.  Do you understand me?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood, Mr. President. 
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. President, I have put myself in an embarrassing situation in as much as I don't seem to have my file relating to this witness.  I suppose I last looked at it this morning, but not here.  And I haven't missed it because when I arrived I was then told we were then dealing with another witness.  I am just now turning and looking for it -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, if we recessed for a few minutes, for five or ten minute, would that give sufficient time to locate it? 
MR. HOOPER: 
I could get it in 15, I suppose. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It is on the premises?  
MR. HOOPER: 
No, it is not -- well, at least, I don't think so, I think -- and I can't see it here which is a puzzle to me.  I must --  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Your microphone has gone off, Mr. Hooper. 
MR. HOOPER: 
I would say I would prefer to have it than not have it.  Could we -- I don't want to waste time.  Let's see how we go. 
WITNESS GIT
CROSS EXAMINATION (continued)
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	I think we left, Mr. Witness, on the cusp of a question  before you were taken ill, which was whether you could provide this Court with a description, a description of Andre Rwamakuba.  
MR. HOOPER:
I'm sorry, my switch keeps going off, I don't know why.
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	So, can I ask you --  
MR. HOOPER: 
I hope it is not Your Honours pressing the button. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
I remembered to turn mine off this time.  
MR. HOOPER: 
(Microphone not activated) -- out of control. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe if you can switch off the microphone in front of your assistant, Mr. Hooper.
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.

1645H
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Maybe you could switch off the microphone in front of your assistant, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Thank you.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	Let me start again.  Can you provide us with the description, please, of André Rwamakuba as you remember him in 1994?  
A.	From what I remember, he was someone who was of average size.  Now, as for his complexion, his skin was between light complexion and dark complexion, the light complexion being the more dominant.  He was not a fat man, nor was he thin; between the two.  
Q.	I can't recall what page we were on earlier in the transcript in your earlier account of a description, but it was along the similar frame, really, of he was neither too dark, nor too light, nor too big, nor too small, nor too tall, nor too short, as I recall.  Can you help us any better than that?  
A.	Unless you have other details that you're thinking of, I believe I've given you the physical description of the man.  
Q.	Well, as we say, it wouldn't help me pick him out in a crowd, would it?  And this is a man, you say, you got to know very well.  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	Yes, I knew him very well.  I do not see any other distinctive signs or any particular traits that I can give you regarding the physical description of this man.
Q.	And you appreciate that I'm suggesting to you that you've greatly exaggerated your knowledge of 
	André Rwamakuba.  You appreciate that, and it's in that context I'm asking you to help us to describe him, in some particular human way that you might do if you know someone very well.  
A.	In that regard I think you're complicating my task.  If this man was in a crowd of people, I would be able to identify him without any problem.  But since he's not here, I don't see how I can help you further.  But, otherwise, if I was to see him -- if I were to see him in a crowd, I would be able to identify him.  
Q.	What -- would you say he had fairly thick lips, for example?  
A.	On the thickness of the lips, that is part of his body -- it's a detail that you've reminded me.  But I think that one would tend to say that his lips were thick.  
Q.	Did he ever wear spectacles?  
A.	No, he didn't wear spectacles.  
Q.	Would you describe him as physically thickly built?  
A.	Yes, I think I've said that.  He was someone who was neither too fat.  I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't call him fat.  He was someone who was solid in build, and he was neither too big nor too thin.  
Q.	Now, let's come to the position with the MDR party.  Can you remind me -- were you a member of any party yourself?  
A.	Yes, I was a member of a party, and I think I said that.  I said so either yesterday or the day before.  
Q.	Do you remember that you were saying that you held a certain position that we can see on your statement, at page 2?  But you seemed to be saying yesterday that you weren't, in fact, holding that position in '94, but then you said, well, you were, up until the genocide.  You seemed uncertain about that.  But we can take it, can't we, that you were in a position, ******************************************************?  That's right, isn't it?  
A.	As I explained yesterday, I said that during the genocide -- before the genocide of 1994, there were signs of insecurity.  I do believe I said that it was officially understood that I was occupying that post.  But, in practice, the party was no longer operational, as it were.  But let me say that before the insecurity situation, I did, indeed, ************************************************************************************.
MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we are in a public and open session, and he has mentioned -- the witness has mentioned a post that he occupied.  Would it be a good idea to remove or have that stricken from the record?  The interpreter didn't say it, but the other interpreter did. 
MR. PRESIDENT:
It was not stated in the English interpretation, but apparently it was stated in the French interpretation, so it would be stricken from the record.  

Witness, you are reminded that we are in open session, and the information which could identify you ought not to be revealed.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	The MRND was the dominant party by far in Gikomero commune, is that correct?  
A.	I cannot confirm that statement because I didn't try to find out about the numbers of the various parties, so I cannot confirm that statement you made, because I didn't seek to find out any details about the numbers of the different parties.  
Q.	Isn't that rather strange for someone who's one of the leaders of one of the few political parties in the commune?  Isn't it strange that you wouldn't want to find out that very basic information?  
A.	Let me say the following.  All the parties had their own ways of running their affairs in full liberty before these events occurred.  That means during the period where there was insecurity, I wouldn't have been able to know the number of the members of the other parties.  All I was happy with was to know what was happening within my own party.  I believe this is the answer I can give you in relation to the question you put to me.  
Q.	Thank you.  How many members of your party were there, in the commune?  
A.	You're asking me the number of members of that party at the commune level.  I am unable to give you that number given the time that has elapsed since those events occurred.  And remember, I told you that after the war I was no longer interested in the activities of political parties.  Therefore, I'm unable to provide you with the numbers of the members.  
Q.	But -- but coming up to and through the beginning of 1994, when political activity was understandably intense, and you held that position in the party that you were a member of approximately how many members did you have in the commune?  
A.	In 1994, during the first months of the year, there were parties which were actually operational or functioning.  But the other parties were there seeking members.  The party that I was in also got to know a situation of -- of strife, because it also split into two and had a Power wing.  I am afraid I cannot answer your question given all that I have just said.  
Q.	How many Parti libéral Power meetings were held in your secteur?  
A.	The number of rallies organised by this party, in our secteur, I saw nothing about that.  But in Gasabo, I heard that this party had organised rallies.  But in the part, in the area where I was, I did not see any members of the PL Power wing.  I'm, of course, referring to my own secteur.
Q.	And -- and what about your commune?  How many PL Power meetings were there in your commune?  
A.	I didn't do any calculations.  I didn't try to find out how many calculations -- how many meetings or rallies were organised by the PL Power wing.  I heard that someone represented the PL Power party, I can give you his name if you want, but I don't know how many meetings he may have organised. 
Q.	So you don't know how many meetings of your own party or its Power wing were held, but you do know how many MDR meetings were held?  Is that your evidence?  
A.	If you listen to what I said closely, and the way in which I explained how these meetings -- rallies were held, you -- you will realise that the people who went there, went past the place where I was.  So if rallies were organised by PL Power and the people who went to the rallies did not pass by where I was, then, I wouldn't know about them.  That's nothing strange, is it?  But I'm telling you that if you read my statement again, you will see that I knew that there were people -- meetings organised and rallies organised by MDR Power.  I knew that these meetings and rallies were organised because these people went by where I was.  But I didn't see anyone pass by where I was to go to meetings organised by PL Power, even in regard to meetings organised by MDR Power.  I refer to those that I know.  It is entirely possible that others were organized, of which I have no knowledge.  
Q.	Now, we know what position you had in the party.  Are you saying none of your party friends would come and tell you about your party's Power meetings held in the commune, but, instead, only the MDR friends you had or people who'd attended such MDR meetings, only they came to tell you about MDR meetings?  That's not right, is it, sir?  It doesn't make sense, does it?  
A.	I did not tell you that I did not have any information.  But what I said was that I have no knowledge of rallies organised by PL Power.  However, I know -- I knew the person who represented PL Power, who was not a resident of the area in which I lived.  I heard about rallies, but I know of no precise rally that was organised by PL Power.  
Q.	What about -- what about MRND and its Power wing?  The big party in your commune, how many meetings did that hold?  
A.	As to these rallies organised by the MRND, there were several of those.  The MRND usually organised many rallies.  In almost every secteur, the MRND organised rallies.  There were several.  
Q.	And how many in your secteur, and when were they, please?  And -- and so I'm -- we're talking about the same period, I'm talking about the year leading up to April of '94, that year.  
A.	Several rallies were organised by the MRND.  In our secteur, I think I remember that three -- three rallies were organised by the MRND, about three.  
Q.	And did you go to those meetings, or did you hear about what was said at those meetings?  
A.	I did not take part in any of the rallies organised by the MRND.  
Q.	Did you hear what was discussed at those meetings?  
A.	MRND rallies were organised in the football field.  ****************************.  As I told you, ********************.  Once I saw events organised by MRND -- and on other occasions there were rallies organised.  This means that on almost on a daily basis there were activities -- political activities organised by the MRND.  Sometimes I remember they would go to three cellules at once and organise political activities there.  It was all the more easy for MRND members, as some figures -- several figures of authority were members of the MRND.  So there was some competition amongst these figures of authority.  That is what I mean, that -- when I say that there were meetings and rallies organised by the MRND.  
Q.	Could you possibly answer the question?  Did you learn what was discussed at these meetings or rallies?  Yes or no.  Shall we start with a yes or no?  Is that possible?  
A.	Yes.  I received some information, but there are other things that I was not able to know.  It depend -- it depended upon the people whom I met.  It also depended on the people who would attend these rallies.  
Q.	Well, thank you.  What -- what did you learn was discussed at these rallies?  Briefly, as briefly as you can.  
A.	It is not easy for me to speak briefly about the MRND.  However, it is true that MRND members aimed to exterminate some Rwandans.  
Q.	And these MRND meetings, where they -- there was discussion about exterminating Rwandans, did these meetings take place in the six months leading up to April of '94?  Were there such meetings during that period?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	Would you be so kind as to repeat your question, Counsel?
Q.	Certainly, sir.  In the six months leading up to April 1994, were there such MRND meetings where the killing of people was discussed?  
A.	If I tried to talk about the MRND party, it would take a long time.  From the 1st of October 1990 -- 
Q.	No, I don't want you to go back -- 
A.	I would say that -- 
Q.	Mr. Witness, can you confine yourself, if possible, to the question.  I'll ask the question again.  During the six months leading up to April '94, were you aware of meetings held by the MRND in your secteur or commune, where the killing of Tutsis was discussed?  
A.	Mr. President, he has the right to put questions to me, but he should also give me time to answer the questions in the way that I feel that I should answer. 
(Pages 53 to 57 by Jean Baigent)




































1715H
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, I was not aware that anybody had stopped you from answering.  Did you understand the question that you were asked?  
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I followed the question.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Well, you can answer it, can't you?  
THE WITNESS:
I would like to answer.  I want to.  But he should give me the time to answer as I am able to.  

So as I was saying, the MRND has a long history.  From the 1st of October 1990 -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
The question that you were asked does not really require you to discuss the MRND's history.  If you understood the question, then the answer to that question does not require the MRND.  The question was related to a six-month period.  So can you answer that question?  
THE WITNESS:
In the six months before the genocide, rallies were organised.  
BY MR. HOOPER:
Q.	And at those rallies, did you learn that the killing of Tutsis was discussed at MRND meetings in your secteur or commune?  
A.	Yes.  During these rallies, the extermination of Tutsis was discussed.  
Q.	And how many such rallies were held in that six-month during, as far as you're able to tell us, in your commune?  
A.	I told you that many rallies were organised in the secteurs, in the cellules.  There were very many.  It is not easy for me to give you a figure, to give you an exact figure of these rallies.  
Q.	So would it be fair to say, sir, that on your evidence as just given of very many rallies by MRND, compared, say, to the five rallies that you told us had been organised by MDR Power, that it may illustrate that the MRND was a more active and bigger party in your commune than the MDR?  Would that be a reasonable conclusion to draw from your evidence?  
A.	Perhaps that is what you might conclude from the information I have given you, but what I think is that all parties were functional.  What I was not able to evaluate is the number of members in each party.  In any case, I can tell you that most authorities, figures of authority, belonged to the MRND party.  In any case, as I saw, all political parties were active in the commune, especially in the period preceding the genocide when the Power wings were created.  Some parties joined forces.  They formed coalitions so that when the MDR Power held rallies, MRND would go and support them.  So there was mutual support because they had common aim.  So they supported each other.  
Q.	Let me leave MRND and go to MDR Power and ask you this:  You said that there were five rallies organised by André Rwamakuba after the split, five MDR Power rallies; is that correct?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	What I said was that I told you of the rallies that I knew about, and these are five in number.  It is possible that other rallies were organised, but I know about five personally.  
Q.	I'm not asking you about all the other rallies that might have been.  I'm asking you about your evidence.  Do you understand that, sir -- your evidence?  And in your evidence, you spoke of five MDR Power rallies; is that correct?  
A.	Yes.  I knew about five rallies and I confirmed this.  
Q.	And these were called "MDR Power" rallies; is that correct?  
A.	That is correct.  
Q.	And do you agree that the word "Power" first entered the Rwandan language in the context of political parties towards the end of October of 1993, following -- I may as well finish -- following the rally that was held in Kigali and addressed by Froduald Karamira, who was responsible for the introduction and use of that word "Power"?  Do you agree with that?  
A.	As to the word "Power," I said that I know that I heard that Karamira had organised the rally, I don't know where now, and there was talk of MDR Power.  As to the date on which this word was born, I'm not able to tell you.  
Q.	Would you be happy to accept from me it was towards the end of October 1993?  Would you be happy to accept that from me or not?  
A.	I have explained that I don't remember dates.  If you remember the date, you're lucky, but I don't.  
Q.	Let me read some evidence that you've previously said on this.  

"Question:  When did you first hear the word "Power" used in this sense of MDR Power?  

"Answer:  It was around the month of August, and I heard about it over the radio.  And reports were made, and what was said during a rally that took place in Kigali.  And it's on that occasion that I heard for the first time the term 'Power.'"

Now, leaving aside the question of the month -- we'll address that in a moment -- do you remember saying that, and is it true that that was the first time you heard the word "Power"?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	I agree that one Karamira used the word "Power," and I do not remember the date on which I heard him say "Power."  If I were to tell you that I do not remember the date, it does not mean that I do not know the word.  All I know is that this happened in 1993.  
Q.	Thank you very much, and thank you for dealing with Froduald Karamira.  I can jump that bit of the transcript and put this bit to you.  Do you recall that Froduald Karamira -- that's Froduald, F-R-O-D-U-A-L-D, and Karamira, K-A-R-, I think, A-M-I-R-A -- was reported having said -- and that's at this conference -- words to the effect of MDR Power, PL Power, MRND Power, Hutu Power, to which you said, "Yes, those statements were made"?  And is it right?  Is that correct?  And is that your evidence?  
A.	As to MDR Power, PSD Power and Hutu Power, these are words that were used by the Power coalition, and they said these at rallies.  When Karamira used the term "MDR Power," he was a member of MDR Power.  When he referred to PL Power and PSD Power, he was referring to factions of other parties which joined MDR Power because the MRND party was the first to split into two.  
Q.	Just try and answer this question.  Can you confirm that it was as a result of what Froduald Karamira said at a meeting in Kigali when he recited "MDR Power, MRND Power, PL Power, Hutu Power," that that was the first you'd heard of the word "Power"?  Do you agree that you've said that before, and is that true, and is that your evidence?  Yes or no, please.  
A.	At that time when he used these words, he was in a rally, but MDR Power was created well before.  MDR Power was born when the party was split in two, when there was a schism in the party.  But when he spoke publicly of MDR Power, MRND Power, PL Power, so on and so forth, it was a way of making this official, if you wish.  But the Power wings had been created well before that.  
Q.	So when do you say you first heard the word "Power"?  What's your evidence on that?  
A.	I know it was in 1993, after the congress that took place in Kabusunzu in July.  As to the first time when I heard the word "Power," I really couldn't tell you.  I know that it was around the time that I have just told you about.  
Q.	Well, you see, what I'm putting to you is that the first opportunity you'd have heard that was        October of '93, and that, therefore, any Power meetings that took place in your area must have been after that in late October or November or December or January or February or March or the first week of April.  Do you agree?  
A.	Please listen to my answer as I give it to you.  I have told you that the word "Power" was used after the split in the MDR, and after the Kabusunzu congress in July 1993.  From that time, this word was known everywhere in the country.  When I tell you that this word was used in July, it means that the word went on being used all over the country until the genocide.  
Q.	Now, your house, do you really live where you told us you live, or do you, in fact, live about 500 metres away from the main road?  
A.	Would you be so kind as to repeat your question, Counsel?  
Q.	Do you really live where you told us you lived yesterday, or do you, in fact, live about 500 metres away from the main road and overlooking and close to ***********?  
A.	I think your question involves three sub-questions.  Please give me the time to answer each of these sub-questions.  First, you're asking me whether I still live where I used to live before -- is that what you're asking, Counsel?  
Q.	In 1994, did you live in a house that was 500 metres away from the main road ********************************?  Yes or no.  
A.	You asked me this question yesterday, and I answered you.  And I said no.  
Q.	And would you have any objection if someone, with all due discretion and secrecy, from the Defence team here, were to come and visit you at your house?  Would you have any objection to that?  
A.	Anyone who comes to my home is welcome, either a neighbour or someone else.  If you knock on my door, the door will be opened to you.  I do not know whether everyone who comes to my home comes into my house and introduces himself, but this person -- anyone who comes to my home must introduce himself so that we know who this person is.  
Q.	Well, thank you for that clear demonstration of Rwandan hospitality, and we may see our way to that.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Hooper, just before you move on to a new matter, how much longer do you envisage?  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, how long would you -- how long would you like?  I know what the answer to that would be.  I've got a bit more ground to cover.  It's not straightforward, and that's one's somewhat in the mire, if I can put it like that.  I appreciate the witness is being -- and is probably still very unwell, but if it was possible for him to be here tomorrow, it would even be a greater relief to him because he wouldn't have to stay so long in the witness box today.  And I know of his earlier complaint, so -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
That is my question.  We would like to -- we have a limited amount of time tomorrow, no more than two hours.  So if we took the adjournment now, I would want to finish this witness tomorrow.  
MR. HOOPER:
Oh, we'd easily do that.  I'd say -- I'd say we could even probably tap into another one.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, okay. 
MR. HOOPER:
But that's still showing a degree of optimism which perhaps -- 
MR. PRESIDENT:
Ms. Fall?  Ms. Fall?  

Tomorrow we would not be able to commence before 10:30, and we have been informed that courtroom 3 will be available, and we will have to stop at approximately 12:30.  So what we can do now is take adjournment now until 10:30 tomorrow in courtroom 3.  

Ms. Fall, even if you think that Mr. Hooper is being unduly optimistic, it would be advisable to have another witness here in case it's possible to start.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Microphone, please, Counsel.  

MS. FALL:
Mr. President, we are ready already, and come what may tomorrow morning, we shall have a witness for you.  I hope that the cross-examination will have ended.  I, for my part, can promise you that I shant spend much time in re-examination, and I think that we can start with another witness if we finish within an hour-and-a-half or so.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  
MS. FALL:
If you're going to adjourn, after the witness leaves, I should like to raise a small matter.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Mr. Witness, we are going to take the adjournment now, and your testimony will continue tomorrow morning at 10:30.  I remind you of the information I've given on each adjournment.  While you're continuing to be a witness, in the progress of your testimony, you must not discuss the case with anybody.  Do you understand?  
THE WITNESS:
All right, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you very much.  You are excused until tomorrow morning at 10:30.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you, Mr. President.  
MS. FALL:
Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to raise a matter regarding witness protection.  I was informed by a protected witness that people had come to see him at his home.  I did not wish to refer to the matter because I did not have any concrete facts.  It seems to me a while ago that I understood Mr. Hooper as saying -- I may be wrong, but I understood that he said that -- he asked the witness how he would feel if Defence people came to visit him, and that is actually the problem.  If it became necessary, we should be able to examine the witness on this because it seems to be this witness who told me that he was surprised to see a Defence investigator come and see him at his -- at his house.  And since he knew that he was a protected witness and he had not divulged this information, he was worried, and he worried that this might come out.  

I did not wish to allude to this earlier as I did not have any concrete facts, but from what I have heard, I think it is time for this matter to be raised.  I would like to recall that our witnesses are protected witnesses.  If by any chance, the Defence wishes to contact any of these witnesses, I think that they must contact WVSS and inform us before they go and see our own witnesses.  I think the rules of the game must be complied with on both sides.  We, for our part, commit ourselves to respecting these rules.  I hope that this is what will happen on the other side.  
I do not want to extend this to a quarrel.  If the witness is required to provide more information on this by the Trial Chamber, he will do so, but I think after hearing what Mr. Hooper said, I thought we should talk about this today, so that matters will be clearer henceforth.  Thank you, Mr. President.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Yes, Mr. Hooper.  
MR. HOOPER:
Well, first of all, I thank my friend for raising a proper concern about any protected witness.  In respect of this witness, GIT, as far as I know, no member of the Defence team, no investigator belonging to the Defence team has approached him in any way.  And if this is an allegation or suggestion that he's making, then I invite my friend to investigate this fully with him at an appropriate time and to let us know, in fact, exactly what is being said.  But I can give the Court my assurance, to my knowledge, neither one of two investigators that I have, have approached him.  And I'd be very surprised if either one has.

1745H
MR. HOOPER: 
Mr. O'Shea reminds me at that at some point in this witness's evidence last week or yesterday, he referred to having been approached in the last few days, and I meant to -- to raise that with you, Mr. President, because, again, I wasn't sure what the source of that was, and what the story behind that was.  And I'd ask that this witness's allegations, if that's what they amount to, be investigated fully by the Prosecution and by witness protection, so that we can do our best to assist.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Mr. Hooper.  

Ms. Fall.  
MS. FALL: 
Mr. President, I wish to say here and now that we are not aware of this at all.  Whether Mr. Hooper has information about people who may have approached the witness, I would be very happy to have the name so that we can be able to make the necessary investigations.  I raise this issue so that we can spend this half hour on it, and since we need to take care, not only of the protection of our witnesses, but also that we follow the Rules so that their testimony here be respected.  We are going to ask WVSS -- we had given them the name of the witnesses, and we had asked that they do not be associated with one another while they are here, and we did this in all honesty.  And for us to be told here that the witness has been approached, I am ready to receive any information which will help us to carry out the investigation because there are allegations that GIQ was seen by one Defence investigator.  We would like to have any precise information you have so that we can carry out the investigations.  And when we are properly edified of this matter, we shall inform the Chamber.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Okay, it seems this is a matter which we could address more fully tomorrow morning.  As -- if the -- what we were really trying to find out was how does one initiate the enquiries, and we would try to determine that and deal with it tomorrow morning.
MR. HOOPER: 
In fact, it wasn't this witness, I stand correct, who'd said he had been approached while he was here, it was GIQ who mentioned it in his evidence.  So we now make it clear that we have no information about any approach to these witnesses.  It's all come to by way of what my friend just said.  So we may have cross wire here and a so breeding incident but, in fact, I have no knowledge and dispute any suggested approach to any of these witnesses from Gikomero.  And if there are any matters, perhaps my friend can investigate them with witness protection.  Thank you.  
MR. PRESIDENT:
Thank you for clearing that up.  

Yes, well, we will take the adjournment now.  We resume at -- I should just make one other comment.  I expect that we will be in a position to give a ruling on the -- the Prosecutor's application for evidence submission.  And since Mr. Webster is not here, and not only that, we are not quite ready yet, but we will be -- expect to be ready tomorrow.  So expect that we will give our ruling on this matter tomorrow.  So you can inform Mr. Webster.  

We take the adjournment now.
