MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning, everyone.  

The proceedings are resumed.  

But before we continue with the testimony of the witness, could we have the appearances of the parties, starting with the Prosecution.  
MR. MAWERE: 
Morning, Madam President, Your Honours.  The Prosecution is represented by Mr. Paul Ng'arua, 
senior trial attorney; Memory Maposa, Appeals counsel; Simba Mawere, assistant trial attorney; 
Diana Karanja, associate legal officer; Efrem Mutashya, language assistant; two interns, Igor Barilik and Jamet, Marion.  The other members of the Prosecution team are presently attending to logistics and will be joining us shortly.  Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Could we have the appearances for the Defence team, please. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
The Defence team this morning is composed of Philippe Larochelle; Nathalie Leblanc; 
Callixte Nzabonimana, Célestin Kagango, investigator; Élise Le Gall, intern and Charles Brozille, also an intern and myself. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Good morning, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good morning, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We hope that you are in better health today, and we would like to remind you of the solemn declaration you made at the beginning of your testimony, and that you will continue to testify bearing that declaration in mind as well as all the other instructions that have been given to you by the 
Trial Chamber.  And, in particular, we would like to remind you to observe a pause between your answers and the questions put to you by learned counsel, as you speak the same language.  This will facilitate interpretation and the recording of your evidence.  

Witness, is that okay? 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, I have understood you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Defence Counsel.  
JEAN MARIE VIANNEY MPORANZI,
EXAMINATION-IN-CHIEF (continued)
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Good morning, Mr. Mporanzi.  
A.	Good morning, Counsel. 
Q.	To begin with, I would like us to finish with the matter concerning the second meeting of Murambi.  Yesterday you stated that there were four ministers in attendance, Mugenzi, Nzabonimana, 
	Agnes Ntamabyaliro and Pauline Nyiramasuhuko.
A.	Yes, that's right.
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I think there is a misstatement in the -- in the evidence.  Indeed, he did mention those four, but those are the only people he knew.  I think it is important for counsel to put it in that perspective.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Defence Counsel. 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I was coming to that if the counsel for the Prosecution would allow me to put my question fully.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, were there any other people in the room, other persons of high standing who may have seemed to you to be ministers or political personalities? 
A.	I beg your pardon.  First of all, I would like to react to what the Prosecution counsel said.  I would like to specify that when I introduced myself at the first meeting, the only minister that I knew was 
	Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  So I want that to be clear.  

As for the small meeting with the bourgmestres, let me specify that there was an introduction of the ministers present and they were introduced by the prime minister.  So I want that also to be quite clear. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to remind you to observe a pause.  Could you kindly observe the light in the English booth and only begin to speak when that light is switched off because there is already overlapping between your answer and the question from counsel.  

Witness, is that clear to you?  Have you identified the English booth?  Yes, if you could look there now, the interpreters have their hands up.  So if you see their red light off, then you will know that the interpretation is concluded and you can begin answering.   Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel, sorry to interrupt you.  You may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  I am asking you this question because I had put it to you in a different way.  Now, over and above those people introduced by the prime minister, Jean Kambanda, were there also present in the room where you were meeting, other people of high standing who may not have been introduced? 
A.	(No interpretation)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you may begin answering because the light is off in the English booth.  
THE WITNESS:
Obviously, we also were there as bourgmestres.  And at a point in time, Préfet Uwizeye entered the room.  He looked into the room and sat for a few moments.  He was still very angry with the answer he had received during the first meeting.  So, after a few minutes, someone came as if to tell him something discretely and then he left the room and never came back.  But, otherwise, we, bourgmestres and the four ministers of the interim government remained there. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Does the name Karemera ring a bell, Edouard Karemera?  You can go ahead, Witness.  It's when the microphone is off that you can speak.
A.	Yes, I knew Edouard Karemera by name, but physically, no.  I heard him speak on the radio as minister, but, otherwise, I had never seen him.  So I have no idea what he looked like. 
Q.	Did anyone tell you that he attended that small meeting? 
A.	No, he didn't attend.  I didn't hear his name in the introduction.  So I don't think he attended the meeting. 
Q.	Do you know the name of a minister, André Ntagerura? 
A.	The same things applied.  It is the same thing as with Edouard Karemera.  So all I did was to know him by name. 
Q.	Were you told that he attended and spoke at this small meeting of the 18th of April 1994? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Donat Murego, does that name ring a bell? 
A.	Yes, I knew him because I had read some of his works, among others, the book concerning the Rwandan revolution of -- I forget which year.  So I also knew that he had been a lawyer, a doctor of law, but I had never seen him.  For him, too, I knew him by name, but more specifically as someone who was well versed in the professional law.  
Q.	Were you told that he was there and that he spoke during the meeting, the small meeting that was held on the 18th of April 1994? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Last name that I would like to mention, one Jean Bosco Barayagwiza, did you know that person? 
A.	I knew him neither by name nor in person. 
Q.	Were you told that he was there and that he spoke during the small meeting of bourgmestres? 
A.	No. 
Q.	During that meeting, you told us yesterday that Justin Mugenzi spoke, did you not? 
A.	Yes, I did. 
Q.	Did Callixte Nzabonimana address the bourgmestres at all? 
A.	No, he was there.  He was just quiet in his little corner.  He didn't say anything. 
Q.	During that meeting with bourgmestres, was the matter of the cooperation of the bourgmestres with the government ever mentioned? 
A.	That question seems to me too wide.  I would like you to be a bit more specific regarding the domain or the area of concern. 
Q.	In the area of the implementation of government policy.  
A.	I think that since the government's priority was the war, and bourgmestres were not soldiers to be sent to the front, we were not asked very much in that aspect of the war.  But what we were asked for as our contribution was to try with the little means at our disposal to calm the population in respect of those who were in conflict with the population.  

The other thing was to try and protect the people and to allow them to flee towards Kabgayi.  To allow the Tutsis to flee, Tutsis who were under threat, to allow them to go to Kabgayi.  As for implementation, we had nothing to give to the government, given the meager means at our disposal. 
Q.	During that meeting of bourgmestres, were you asked by the ministers present or in attendance to have cooperation with other arms of government, apart from the government itself? 
A.	No. 
Q.	There, I was actually referring specifically to the Interahamwe? 
A.	In my commune, there were no Interahamwe.  And, in fact, I think the same applied to the other communes directed by bourgmestres from the MDR party.  So we could not be asked to cooperate with people who were nonexistent. 
Q.	What was the tone used by prime minister or Mr. Mugenzi when he -- when they spoke to the bourgmestres? 
A.	It was a normal tone.  I would describe it as a normal tone which was expressing advice.  It was not a threatening tone. 
Q.	There was no threatening tone or any threats directed at the bourgmestres by the ministers in attendance? 
A.	No, not at all. 
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, did you speak, yourself, during that meeting? 
A.	No, I didn't take the floor.  I didn't speak. 
Q.	Did someone speak on your behalf to explain what happened or what was going on in your commune? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Was there mention made of Callixte Nzabonimana during the meeting? 
A.	Only at his introduction.  That's all. 
Q.	Yesterday we talked about the matter of the slap, which you apparently were the object of 
	Callixte Nzabonimana.  Did anyone mention that during this small meeting? 
A.	No, no one mentioned that. 
Q.	Was there any mention made of the replacement of bourgmestres during the meeting? 
A.	Yes, mention was made somewhat of that matter, but not in a threatening -- not in a threatening tone.  Rather, it was a matter of one not being able to manage the situation.  I don't know who said it 
	was -- who it was, who said that if a bourgmestre felt himself overwhelmed, that, maybe, the best thing is for that bourgmestre to resign and to be replaced. 
Q.	But could there have been any double-meaning or double-speak intended in that mention of bourgmestres who felt themselves overwhelmed or unable to carry out their duties? 
A.	No, the statement was not in double-speak.  I seemed to understand it in the meaning of being unable, incapacity, and the matter was to be understood that the initiative would be from the bourgmestre himself. 
Q.	When I talk about a double-meaning, Mr. Witness, would that be any reference to bourgmestres who did not implement policies applied to Tutsis in the commune? 
A.	No, that other meaning is not right.  No, the statement did not go along that line.  It was not intended to be understood in that manner. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Prosecution. 
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yes, I just wanted to sound a note of caution to my learned friend, because the last question really -- is really a leading question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, and the witness is present, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Yeah, I will not go further, because the answer has already been given.  But I think counsel should be a bit more careful with this sort of thing, otherwise we will stand here for a long time.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Madam President, Your Honours.  No, you are not listening to me. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, so as not to waste time, it's quite obvious to us that this question is leading and that you should avoid putting such questions in future, Learned Counsel.  You may continue, but taking into account that observation.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I will take that into account, Madam President.  But I will also appreciate that the Prosecutors make objections or none at all, but not warnings to the Defence.  If there is anybody who has to give any warnings, it's the Trial Chamber.  And that is what they have just done.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
What we see in the CaseView is a note of caution.  Counsel, you may continue.  We don't want really to waste time on issues that may not be important.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Neither do I. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, a while ago you stated that the tone used by the ministers was not threatening; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Could the tone used by the ministers be implicitly threatening? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Very well.  Let's leave behind the Murambi meeting.  Let's go back to the course of events.  What did you do after that Murambi meeting?  We are still on the 18th of April.  Could you explain what you did to the Tribunal? 
A.	After the Murambi meeting, I went to see Father Michel Gigi to inform him of the decisions and advice that had been given by government and see together with him the decisions we could take.  Actually we were faced with three problems.  What we could do in relation to the proposal made by government, to assemble the Tutsis who were being threatened in Kabgayi.  

The next problem, Father Gigi had hosted some Tutsi displaced persons from Nyabikenke.  He had set up a small transit centre for the displaced persons who were tired and ill.  His problem was not food, but security.  So he was wondering up till when he had to keep these internally displaced persons.  

My own problem was that, I had people, some prisoners at the commune jail house, and I had avoided mentioning this case during the meeting.  So what was I going to do with those prisoners?  Solutions had to be found rapidly and reasonable solutions.  

As for the matter of assembling the Tutsis who were threatened in Kabgayi, we realised that Kabgayi, indeed, had some advantages because the infrastructure was there; there were schools, a hospital.  So people could not be exposed to the cold weather.  This was one of the reasons.  

The second reason was the opinion of Father Michel Gigi.  He was saying that there were three bishops in Kabgayi and amongst the displaced persons, there were Christians, that if we were to send people to Kabgayi, maybe the bishops would be able to help to provide for their security, their feeding and take care of them.  After looking at all these three conditions, we decided that it would be better for the Tutsis from Rutobwe to go towards Kabgayi while waiting, maybe for the situation to improve.  But the problem that I had was that I had not lived in the Rutobwe commune.  I had worked outside.  So I did not know where the Tutsis lived.  That was a problem for me.  

Father Gigi proposed the following:  He told me, "I know the Tutsis from the Cyeza and 
	Gatovu secteurs.  So I would take upon myself to go and inform them."  That was one problem less, and I thanked him.  I told him, "Me, I also know the Tutsis from my native hill and the Tutsis from the neighboring hill in the Rutongo commune.  I can take charge of going to inform them and ask them to flee towards Kabgayi."  We were now left with four secteurs.  He advised me to seek the assistance of the chairperson of the MDR to find the solutions.  

The second problem that arose concerned the displaced persons he was lodging at the parish.  We felt that it would be better for those displaced persons to go to Kabgayi at the same time as the displaced persons from the Rutobwe commune.  

As for the problem I had, the prisoners, Father Gigi said, "This is very delicate, because you cannot do otherwise.  If it had been said that we should not" -- "you should not get into conflict with the population and you are keeping prisoners, then you risk being attacked by groups and organised gangs.  So you have no choice, you have to let them go."  But I am aware that this could have a negative impact on the others who have remained in their homes on the hills.  

Afterwards, I went to the commune office.  Father Michel Gigi followed me to go and warn the Tutsis from the Gatovu secteur.  But we parted ways at the branch.  When I got to the Rutobwe commune, at the commune office, I called the officer on duty, the policeman on duty and I ordered him to release all the prisoners who were in the jail house.  So I, myself, was the one who gave the order, and this came from the decision that I had taken together with Father Michel Gigi.  

After that, I went to see the chairperson of the MDR Mr. Ndayisaba, Jean Damascène.  I informed him of the decisions that had been taken by government, and the decisions I had just taken with 
	Father Gigi.  He said, well, he thought Father Gigi had taken good decisions and I asked him whether he was ready to help me, just as Father Gigi had advised.  He said, "Yes, I am ready to help.  I even have a Tutsi brother-in-law.  So I can start with that one.  I can take charge of the Shyanda secteur."  

THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
The witness had spelt, but it's not clear.  
THE WITNESS:
He continued to say he would also take charge of the Ntonde secteur, because he knew almost everyone there.  What was remaining was the Giko secteur and the Mara secteur, these two secteurs which did not have anyone to save them.  The chairperson of the MDR told me, the secretary of the MDR, Mr. Prosper Muzama (phonetic) and the Vice-chair of the MDR, Balthazar, I don't remember his family name.  Those persons can help us.  It was kind of late, but we were obliged to go and look for them.  So, we discussed the problems and then we parted ways on the agreement that he would warn the Tutsis in the Giko and Mara secteurs.  The strategy was as follows:  Since we could not go to the houses of all the Tutsis, we thought that it would suffice to inform two or three or four families, if we could.  And those families would then maybe help or use young people who could go fast and relay the information, according to their affinities.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you have mentioned a number of secteurs, whose spellings we are unsure of.  We recall Shyanda, Giko, Mara and others, could you assist us with the spellings, please. 
THE WITNESS:
Yes, that is easy.  Let me start by Cyeza.  Cyeza is written, C-Y-E-Z-A; Gatovu, G-A-T-O-V-U; 
Shyanda secteur, S-H-Y-A-N-D-A; Ntonde secteur, N-T-O-N-D-E; Giko, G-I-K-O; Mara secteur, M-A-R-A; Cyubi secteur, C-Y-U-B-I.  And the last secteur is Rutongo, R-U-T-O-N-G-O. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, thank you, Witness.  There was also the chairman of the MDR.  You mentioned his first and second names.  Could you spell at least the Kinyarwanda name, please?  
THE WITNESS:
Very well, Madam President, Ndayisaba, Jean Damascène, the name is spelt N-D-A-Y-I-S-A-B-A. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness.  This distribution of secteurs, which day did it takes place when you decided on how the secteurs had to be managed? 
A.	Could you please repeat your question? 
Q.	This allocation of secteurs on how Tutsis have to be informed and by who, on which day did this take place? 
A.	It was in the evening of the 18th.  So this was a decision that had to be taken quickly and quickly implemented. 
Q.	And the freeing up of the prisoners who were at the commune jail house, when did this take place?  
A.	In the same evening.  I said so, in the same evening. 
Q.	Did you tell us yesterday that on the night of the 13th to the 14th, a certain person called Didas was killed?  Since that date, the 13th and the 14th, were there any other killings perpetrated in the commune? 
A.	As far as I know, no, only cows were slaughtered in some areas. 
Q.	Were you able to implement the strategy which you had outlined which entails telling the Tutsis to go towards Kabgayi? 
A.	Yes, each person tried to inform people and I believe that the information was, indeed, relayed. 
Q.	Do you know if those Tutsis were able to get to Kabgayi? 
A.	Yes, but not everyone at the same time.  Some said, "Well, let's not joke.  So let's leave immediately", but others hesitated.  I believe this was because of the experience that had been seen in 1993 -- in 1973.  There had been ethnic disturbances and Tutsis had been victims of the situation, but they took refuge in the houses of their Hutu friends and other Tutsis felt that the same thing was going to happen.  So they hesitated.  The first wave left.  Only those hiding in the houses of friends remained behind.  But since there were also some married ties between Hutus and Tutsis, certainly there must have been some people who had granted refuge to their brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, parents-in-law, and also, some Tutsi women who had married Hutu men and who remained with their husbands and joined the protection of the extended family.  Otherwise, others who did not feel safe, once they receive the information, they went towards Kabgayi. 
Q.	Could you tell the Trial Chamber how the situation evolved in the Rutobwe commune after -- as from the 19th of April? 
A.	Yes, on the 19th -- on the 19th, I went to inform the Tutsis on my hill -- there were only two families there -- and the Tutsis of my native secteur and the Tutsis of the Rutongo secteur.  This was the -- my main task of the day.  

The approach I used was that I, first of all, informed the Tutsis on my hill, and then I went to look of the conseiller of the secteur in Cyubi, to inform him and tell him to help.  He was someone that I really trusted.  He was dynamic.  We met in Gakondokondo.  Gakondokondo, I believe it's not the first time we are mentioning that name.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUCELLE: 
Gakondokondo, number 6 on the spelling list.  
THE WITNESS:
He told me, "For the time being, I am not certain that Tutsis are sleeping in their houses, but since I, myself, I'm hiding some Tutsis, I shall discuss the matter with them and we can see how to relay the information."  

After the Cyubi secteur, my native secteur, I went to the Rutongo secteur.  I was -- I had some greater luck there, because I met a Tutsi there who was my friend, my childhood friend.  We were in the same primary school.  I discussed the matter with him.  He was a Tutsi who had married a Hutu.  I discussed the problem with him.  I asked him, "Since you know the secteur very well, can you not help me to circulate the information?"  And he said, "I would send my wife since she is not afraid of anything, she would find people who can relay the information."  I also informed the conseiller of the secteur.  I informed the two conseillers.  After I had done my task for the day, I went back to the commune office. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Let me interrupt you, Witness.  I just want, once more, clarification.  You talked to us about Rutongo where you met your childhood friend and the conseiller of the secteur.  Were you informed that killings had started in the Rutongo secteur on that 19th of April? 
A.	No, I did not receive any such information. 
Q.	Very well, Witness.  Maybe -- well, unless there are some important dates, could you tell us what happened in the commune after the 19th of April, if at all, any killings started? 
A.	Yes, after the prisoners were freed, this act was badly interpreted by the people.  When the prisoners went back, they were singing victory against me, against the measures I had taken.  I believe all these contributed to concretise the violence.  I was taking charge of the evacuation of the Tutsis.  I had no choice.  People's lives had to be saved allowing cows to be slaughtered, and banana trees and houses to be destroyed, that could be taken care of afterwards.  But as for the life of a human being, when the person is gone, there is nothing that can be done.  So as far as I felt -- as I thought, I thought it was more important to save lives.  That is what happened.  

After the 21st, from the 20th to the 26th, I believe, towards the end of April, the perpetrators were doing whatever they wanted.  They did whatever they could do.  They were killing cows and eating them.  They were killing if they wanted.  But I tried to act fast, to tell people to escape fast instead of waiting for clemency. 
Q.	If I understand you well, the dates you are giving, Mr. Witness, the killings started around the 
	20th and the 21st of April, and this is important.  
A.	It is in the night or in the evening when people became more aggressive.  They took advantage of the darkness and of the fact that the bourgmestre and the policemen were not moving around.  It was particularly in the night that killings were perpetrated. 
Q.	But my question was the time.  You talked about -- we left the 18th and you went on to the -- we were talking about the 18th and 19th, and I believe you were talking about the date from the 20th, is it from that time that killings picked up speed in that area? 
A.	Let me repeat that, as from the time that the prisoners were released and went back to their homes, they started organising themselves to attack people in the night and to disturb the Tutsis.  They, first of all, attacked the cows.  They started with the cows and then went on to demolish houses to collect the roofing tiles to go and cover their small houses with.  They cut down banana trees, I do not know why.  And, finally, they started killing people that they could find.  So it is from that time towards the end -- up till towards the end of April. 
Q.	Do you know where these people who were killing had come from?  Were there people from your commune? 
A.	You must realise that people were threatened.  Tutsis were being threatened and killed by their neighbours, but their neighbours from two communes.  You could have neighbours who didn't belong to the same commune.  Let me give you an example, in Ngaryi secteur -- which is spelt N-G-A-R-Y-I, Ngaryi -- and in Cyubi secteur, there were many Tutsi families.  But for the most part, these families were attacked by people from Bulinga and Musubati.  So they worked in complicity with neighbours.  And also, in Rutongo secteur, especially in the Butare cellule, which is neighboring 
	Nyabikenke commune, there also, we had attacks which came from that commune, but we managed to repel the attack during the day, but we did not know exactly what happened during the night. 
Q.	To your knowledge, were these killers, people who belonged to a specific political party or not? 
A.	No, but you should not understand the genocide in those terms.  It wasn't a matter of political parties; rather, it was a socio-ethnic problem.  So, it's not -- it wasn't a matter of political parties, no. 
Q.	Did you ever get to know of any elements who were organised, but foreign to the commune which may have come to support the local killers? 
A.	I would like you to specify the distance in question, because I would like to tell you that people who were foreign to the commune -- 
Q.	I don't want to talk about distance, but I want to refer to structured foreign elements? 
A.	I need you to give me an example for me to better understand, Counsel. 
Q.	I am thinking about members of youth movements, for instance? 
A.	No, people were killed by their neighbours. 
Q.	(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  Can the witness be -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Witness, could you pause for a while, the interpreters have a problem and we have to listen to their problem before you continue.  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, I'm sorry.   I did not switch on my microphone when I was speaking.  So the previous answer did not come to Your Honours and the Court.  

It was not the witness's problem.  I specify and reiterate, it was my mistake, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
So, Witness, the interpreters said the problem was not you, but themselves.   So they want the counsel to repeat the question so that we can get your answer which we did not receive.  

Counsel, could you repeat your question?  We don't have it in the English CaseView.  What we have as the last answer of the witness is:  "No, people were killed by their neighbours."  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
My next question dealt with the youth movements and the witness answered, and I said, in particular, I was referring to youth movements such as the Interahamwe.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	I believe you answered the question, Mr. Witness, but can you give the answer again.  
A.	The answer is, no. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, are you saying that there were no killings by Interahamwe, by your answer, no?  What exactly are you saying?  We need to understand your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
Killings perpetrated by Interahamwe, where, in my commune or where?  Please can you be specific, because I know that in my commune -- 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Yes, please go ahead.  Finish your sentence, Mr. Witness.  
A.	Yes, in my commune, there were no Interahamwe.  There were few members of the MRND, yes, but there were no Interahamwe as a political structure within the MRND.  Furthermore, in the month of April, no one came, apart from those cases which I have mentioned already.  So there were no attacks on Rutobwe commune by foreign elements, people from outside the commune. 
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, during the genocide, did you ever go to Kabgayi? 
A.	Yes, I went to Kabgayi on the 27th.  It was around the 27th, yes, yes, it was the 27th.  I delayed in making that trip there, because my driver who was a Tutsi and he had been threatened and he had left.  So I had to wait and recruit another driver, and when I found another driver, I went to Kabgayi for two reasons, to make an assessment of the number of Tutsis who managed to -- to arrive in Kabgayi, but also to recover the police uniforms which I had lent to one of my policemen who was a Tutsi.  His father was Tutsi, his mother was Hutu, and he had been somewhat camouflaged, because he had left a bit late in the day to arrive at Kabgayi.  So I got to Kabgayi and I looked for the policeman.  He had hidden the uniform in Gitarama.  So when I went to fetch the uniform, I asked him, "What would be your estimate of the number of people in Rutobwe" -- from Rutobwe?"  He said, "I don't know exactly how many they are, but I think they are roughly 1,800."  So that is the information he gave me, but when I was coming back, I said that the figure I knew of 2,409, that would mean that there would be roughly 600 Tutsis who had not yet arrived at Kabgayi.  So I think either they are dead -- some of them are dead, or others are still in hiding.  But it was definitely -- it was sure that as far as the Tutsi women were concerned, Tutsi women who had married Hutus, they would be protected by their families.  So it was necessary for me to know exactly what the situation was and that was my thought.  That's what I was thinking as I was coming back from Kabgayi. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you have talked about the 27th without any -- without elaborating.  To which month would the 27th relates?  And we believe you are talking about 1994.  
THE WITNESS:
I was speaking of the 27th of April 1994. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Do you want to say something, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I wanted to say that with regard to the month of May, the second week of May, I also went to Kabgayi.  There were two children that Father Gigi had picked up and provided shelter to, and since it was easy for me, I put them in the pickup truck to take them to Kabgayi so that they could go and join their family members. 
Q.	Witness, after the 18th of April 1994, did you have other -- other contacts or other meetings with the administrative authorities? 
A.	No, there were no meetings at préfecture level, no, but at the sous-préfecture level, yes. 
Q.	Do you remember roughly when? 
A.	Yes, it was in the first week of May 1994, of course. 
Q.	In what form was that contact with the sous-préfecture authorities?  Can you please tell us how it happened and with whom? 
A.	Yes, during the genocide, the sous-préfet of our sous-préfecture had left.  When he felt threatened, he fled at the right moment.  So, in the beginning of May, it was necessary for the government to appoint a sous-préfet and it appointed -- I need to remember the name -- it was Habarugira, Jean Baptiste -- spelt H-A-B-A-R-U-G-I-R-A, Jean Baptiste Habarugira.  He was my new sous-préfet, my direct supervisor.  So he did a tour of the communes.  He organised pacification meetings, because the government had decided that anarchy and disorder ceased in the commune.  And that is how he came to my colline, my hill to visit the commune and to meet the people.  There you are. 
Q.	Do you know on what date or which month that sous-préfet was appointed? 
A.	I wouldn't be able to give you the exact date, but as for the month, that was May. 
Q.	Do you know whether in Gitarama préfecture, there were other sous-préfets who were appointed? 
A.	Yes, other sous-préfets were appointed.  For Ruhango sous-préfet didn't have a sous-préfet -- the sous-préfecture of Ruhango did not have a sous-préfet.  So he was replaced by one 
	Ndagijimana, Jean Baptiste.  The two sous-préfets bore the same first names, but not the same surnames, Jean Baptiste. 
Q.	With regard to Jean Baptiste Ndagijimana, do you know when his appointment was done?  In what month? 
A.	I think that it was in May, maybe the date would be different, but I don't have it in my head. 
Q.	Do you know whether in the first three months of April, ********************************* was already sous-préfet of Rutongo? 
A.	No, what I am certain of is that he was appointed in May, probably at the same time as the 
	sous-préfet of Kiyumba. 
Q.	Were you called to other meetings with your fellow bourgmestres in your commune after the 
	18th of April 1994? 
A.	No. 
Q.	Do you know any place called Musambira? 
A.	Yes, I know the place.  Musambira is a commune which is neighbouring Rutobwe and you would have to go through Musambira in order to reach Kigali. 
Q.	Were you called to a meeting of bourgmestres in Musambira? 
A.	No, that meeting is unknown to me. 
Q.	On another matter, can you please -- well, first of all, do you know someone known as 
	Sebasasa -- Sebasaza?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Which is number 22 on the list, Your Honours.  
THE WITNESS:
From which commune and secteur?  Please, if you have some specifics, that would be helpful. 
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Q.	He was from Rutobwe commune -- no, I mispronounced the name.  It is Sebasaza, he is from 
	Rutobwe commune, and I believe he was from Rutongo secteur? 
A.	Yes, I know that Sebasaza very well. 
Q.	Do you know of what became to that man during the genocide? 
A.	Yes, Sebasaza was a policeman from the PVK, the préfecture of Kigali-ville.  So when he came back from Kigali, he had received authorisation to bear weapons, and he came with a Kalashnikov with the permit to carry -- to bear weapons from the prefet of the time, the prefet of the Kigali-ville préfecture, PVK.  

And since he had Tutsi friends and Tutsi brothers-in-law, he hid them in his home and he was determined to defend them with his weapon, his gun.  So he defended them effectively right up until the month of May.  I had met him when I went to make an assessment of the impact of the small meeting for pacification in Rutongo secteur and, indeed, he was carrying his weapon and he showed me the permit for him to be able to carry that weapon.  And, in fact, for him to support those people -- his people, I was in agreement with them.  And, of course, he had to shoot.  He didn't attack people, but if people were to attack the people under his protection, then he should use his weapon.  I was in agreement with that.  I supported him. 

So, in mid-May, Rutobwe commune, I would say was militarised; in other words, it was chosen by the army headquarters to set up a command post.  So gendarmes were sent there for the preparatory phase.  This was a military secret, but I would receive some bits of information concerning the plan.  But, nonetheless, it is true that it was decided to have a safety perimeter, 10 by 18 kilometres, which was to be patrolled and this was a distance from the commune office of Rutobwe.  So there were several operations.  I didn't understand anything that was going on.  I hadn't been informed formally.  

But what I was able to notice at the time was that there were military specialists who were coming, who would come to the hills with equipment, which I didn't even know what to call them.  So they were infiltrating the population so as to gather information.  So, after a decision was made to collect all weapons and grenades, because there were also there some grenades which were in the possession of gendarmes and soldiers who had deserted the front.  So, the area was to be made safe.  And so the grenades and guns were collected.  So I can understand this hero, this brave man, Sebasaza.  So his gun was also taken.  Afterwards he was, of course, exposed to attacks from organised gangs which he had resisted for about one month.  That's all I know about Sebasaza.  

Maybe one thing I can also add is that I went to see him to try and see with him how we could evacuate those who were hiding in his home, because with his weapon, it had been easy.  So then, since he was still with his weapon in hand -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  I didn't understand that expression. 
(Pages 1 to 15 by Haruna Farage)














1030H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you repeat your last answer, relating to Sebasaza.  The interpreters didn't understand what you were saying, the last -- the very last part of your sentence -- of your -- your answer.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, quite readily so.  

I was trying to say that I, myself, went to Sebasaza's home in May, when I realised that he was 
hell-bent on keeping people.  But I eventually realised that he may break down.  So I went to see him and see -- to try and see, together with him, how we could evacuate those he was protecting.  And when we arrived, I was together with the brigadier, who was in charge of the policemen.  So it was easy for me to speak to him, because I was with the brigadier and two policemen.  

It was still easy for him to protect the people, but he had his hand on the trigger of his gun.  So I was speaking from -- to him from afar, and I told him that he should help the people to flee to Kabgayi.  So, in a few days, the operation was carried out; in other words, to disarm him.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Just a moment ago, you made reference to *******************************.  Did you know him personally? 
A.	Yes, I knew him.  He was a former co-disciple.  In the school which I did my sixth year, he was also there, and we played traditional football.  So it was someone whom I knew very well from my 
	young days.  And Butare is not far from Cyubi.  They are two neighbouring secteurs.  So I know him very well.  
Q.	During the events, or even afterwards, did you hear anything about him relating to his attitude during the genocide in the Rutobwe commune?  
A.	The only thing that was being said was that he was the friend of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  People were simply trying to link him up with the allegations that were levelled against Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  That is all I know about him.  
Q.	During the genocide, concerning the death of Sebasaza, did you hear mention made of **************? 
A.	No.  
Q.	(No interpretation) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, sorry to interrupt you, but the witness has not said that Sebasaza died so far.  He has said his gun was taken away and he was exposed to attacks.  He didn't tell us what happened to Sebasaza after that.  So maybe you can ask him about that and also about the people he was protecting.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, you heard the fair observations made by Madam President.  Could you specify or tell us what finally happened to Sebasaza, as well as to the people he was protecting, if you know? 
A.	Amongst the people he was protecting, I knew his brother-in-law, Cyprien, who was a teacher.  I do not know his surname, but his first name was Cyprien or Cyprine (phonetic).  That was his brother-in-law.  There were other close friends, but I do not know the exact number.  

How he died?  After he was disarmed, there was a military operation.  His gun was seized.  Two days later, organised gangs that wanted to take revenge, because he had resisted them for an entire month, came and killed him.  

Something else I learned was that amongst the people he was protecting, some later said, "If we must die, we must die fleeing.  We understand the situation is deteriorating."  Some people had left before.  But those who remained with him were killed, including his brother-in-law, who had decided to stay with him.  He was killed -- he was also killed.  That is the information that I have concerning the death of this brave Sebasaza.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	I don't know if this was well-noted:  Concerning the death of Sebasaza as well, did you hear that the name of Callixte Nzabonimana was being associated with this event?  
A.	I did not hear that.  
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, did you remain in your position throughout the genocide?  
A.	Maybe you need to specify the month, because the length of time varies depending on the préfectures and even the communes.  
Q.	From the 7th of April 1994 to a date I do not know, did you remain in your position?  
A.	Yes, I remained up to the 25th of June 1994, when the RPF army came and dislodged the 
	two battalions that were camped there.  So after their victory, I fled.  But, as bourgmestre, theoretically speaking, I remained there up to that date.  But in practice, when the commune was militarised, I did not have any authority.  Things were beyond my control.  So I simply remained with my stamps and my signatures for the citizens who needed identification papers.  But, otherwise, I could not take any decision.  
Q.	So, from the 7th of April to the 25th of June 1994, did you hear any negative remarks being made on the manner in which you were leading your commune, remarks made by the political authorities of the country? 
A.	No, I did not hear any such remarks.  I was not removed from my position.  I thought maybe I was not causing any problem to the political leaders.  I do not know.  What could I expect?  
Q.	Did you physically meet Callixte Nzabonimana in your commune in Rutobwe in the period from the 
	7th of April to the 25th of June 1994?  
A.	In Rutobwe, no.  The only contact I had with Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was at the Murambi meeting on the 18th.  And even there, we did not speak.  I simply saw him with my eyes; that's all.  
Q.	After the 25th of June you left the commune.  Where did you go?  
A.	I went to the Kayenzi commune, to the home of my colleague Mbarubukeye, who was the bourgmestre there.  I told him that my commune had just fallen and that I had panicked, and he panicked and said he was also going to follow me to Nyabikenke immediately.  But I went on my way and continued on to the Kiyumba préfecture in the Nyabikenke commune.  And there, I joined my family, because, with the militarisation of the commune, I had taken my wife and my children to the native hill.  I spent two days there.  

The sous-préfet told me:  "There are bags of beans that have to be distributed, so the displaced persons in your commune" -- it was difficult to find them where they were all scattered.  I distributed the bags, but the sous-préfet was moving towards Nyakabanda.  I observed the movements and I told myself, "It's better to leave after him." After the distribution of the beans, I went to Nyakabanda.  
Q.	Let's try to move faster on this matter.  

After the 25th of June, did you remain in Rwanda, your country?  
A.	I started fleeing on the 26th and continued on the 27th, as the RPF army advanced.  We also continued fleeing with everyone else and, finally, I got to the Turquoise zone.  I crossed the border.  But, in June, I was still in the country.  In July, I was in Zaire; that is what it was called at the time.  
Q.	So on what date did you cross the border into Zaire? 
A.	I have forgotten.  
Q.	Which month?  
A.	July.  
Q.	Which year? 
A.	Ninety-four, of course.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, you did talk about a bourgmestre -- the bourgmestre of Kayenzi commune with whom you took refuge.  
Could you kindly mention his name and spell it for the record.  
THE WITNESS: 
Willingly.  M-B-A-R-U-B-U-K-E-Y-E, Mbarubukeye. 

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	You stayed in Zaire for how long, Mr. Mporanzi?  
A.	From July 1994, '95, '96, and I came back in January of 1997.  
Q.	Why did you not return to Rwanda before January 1997?
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
January 1997.  The English CaseView needs to be corrected.
THE WITNESS:
There are several reasons.  It is because, somewhat understanding the psychology of the victor and the vanquished, I was avoiding -- I was waiting -- I knew that it would take some time for a strong government to be established, which was not militarised, which could be responsible for what could happen.  That was the first reason.  

So after the victory, the soldiers were the ones governing the country -- I don't know for how many years.  So I was waiting for a government that could be responsible to be established.  

Second reason:  At the time I was getting ready to return in 1995, I believe, one of my family members was killed by soldiers, and he was a Catholic priest, parish priest of the Kamonyi parish.  He was called Pie (phonetic) Ntahobali.  

Ntahobali is spelled N-T-A-H-O-B-A-L-I, Ntahobali.  

I heard about that over Radio Rwanda, because we could receive Radio Rwanda.  When I learned about his death, I told myself that the kind of government I was expecting was not yet in place.  So I postponed my decision to the time when refugee camps in the east of the Congo were demolished.  That is what happened.  So it was up to that date.  

We were scattered all over the Congo forest and, finally, we were forced to decide to backtrack and then to return, because the situation was untenable, particularly given my health situation, which was not very good.  I decided to leave the forest and to return to the country.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, as the break approaches, I shall be moving to a new line of questioning.  Could we take the break now and I finish later so that I do not interrupt the new line of questioning I would like to move into and continue right up to the lunch break?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we will grant your request to allow you time to re-organise yourself.  
Witness, we are taking the morning break.  And you are still testifying, so do not discuss your evidence with anyone.  You may leave now. 
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel, how much time will you be after the lunch break -- before the -- you expect to finish before the lunch break?  Is that what you said?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I believe so.  I think I should be able to finish by 1 p.m., unless there are any additional questions.  But I think we have one and a half hours (sic) left.  I think that should be sufficient for me to finish.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Then, in that case, we would like to encourage you to do your best to finish by that break and -- so that we can forge ahead with the testimony of this witness, Counsel.  

The proceedings are adjourned to twenty-five minutes past eleven. 
(Court recessed from 1055H to 1125H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good morning once again.  The proceedings are resumed. 

Defence Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Mporanzi, a while ago you said you returned in 1997 to Rwanda.  Did you go back to your commune, Rutobwe?  
A.	Yes, I went back to the Rutobwe commune and, specifically, to my native hill in the Cyubi secteur.  
Q.	Did you have any contacts with the authorities in place in the commune upon your return?  
A.	When I returned I was very exhausted and very ill.  It took me about a year to regain some strength.  After some time I rendered a courtesy visit to the bourgmestre of the commune, and he received me for some five minutes.  But we did not discuss a lot.  He simply welcomed me back; that is all.  

As for the authorities in my secteur, the conseiller was almost a neighbour.  So, between my house and his house, all I needed was ten minutes trekking.  I discussed almost everything with him.  From time to time I would also meet with the conseiller of the Rutongo secteur, and we would also discuss generalities.  But he was a survivor, so we would discuss the difficult times of the genocide without getting into details.  He simply told me, "I recognise that you, you did everything that you could".  I could say that in the year 1997 those were the only contacts that I could establish with the authorities.  
Q.	Did you know the name of the bourgmestre that you went to meet upon your return? 
A.	Yes.  He is called Charles Gahunde.  Gahunde is spelled G-A-H-U-N-D-E, Gahunde.  
Q.	Were you arrested?  
A.	No, I was never arrested.  
Q.	Never?  
A.	Never, right up to the time when I returned to exile.  
Q.	And you went to exile on what date? Well, we're still talking about your second exile.
A.	I went on the 12th of August 2008.  
Q.	After that year that followed your return, did you have any other contact with the bourgmestre, 
	Charles Gahunde?  
A.	Yeah, in January 1998.  This time around, he was the one who invited me to come.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, in the question, we hear "Bourgmestre Charles Gahunde", but in his earlier answer we heard, "The conseiller was almost my neighbour."  So was he a conseiller or a bourgmestre?  
THE WITNESS: 
I mentioned two conseillers:  The conseiller of Cyubi and the conseiller of Rutobwe.  They were conseillers to the bourgmestre, so they sat in the communal council.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	But the question being asked by Madam President was to find out whether Charles Gahunde was a bourgmestre.  
A.	Yes, Charles Gahunde was, indeed, the bourgmestre.  
Q.	Repeat, Witness.  You were telling us that he had invited you.  
A.	He invited me through the conseiller of the secteur.  I showed up and he told me, "This time around I have enough time to discuss with you, so please feel free." 
Q.	Go on.  
A.	He started by telling me that he was congratulating me for the work that I did together with Father Gigi during the genocide.  He told me that, from the information that had been collected from survivors and from the general population, there was no accusation against me.  

After congratulating me and this good note, he asked me whether I was supporting the RPF.  Very quickly, I realised that it was an embarrassing question for me because I wasn't expecting it, but I realised that it would be dangerous to say no.  So I answered:  "Yes, I support the RPF." 

Afterwards, he asked me whether I would be ready to assist the RPF in punishing anyone who had played a major role during the genocide of April 1994.  I told him that I was ready to help.  Then he told me:  "That is why I have asked you to come. 

"The senior officials asked me to prepare case files against such people as for my 
commune -- concerning my commune" -- correction -- "the Rutobwe commune.  I would like you to help me with these case files." And then he told me that from the information that he had received from survivors as well as from prisoners who were in the commune jailhouse -- there were many -- the authority or official that was being attacked or accused was the former minister, Callixte Nzabonimana.  
Q.	Your microphone.  
A.	He pulled out from his drawer the allegations that had been written down against him.  And the first one was that he had been told that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana had sensitised people to commit genocide in Rutobwe commune, particularly in the Butare cellule; all throughout the road where he was passing, that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana had threatened me, my person, that he had slapped me, and that he had freed the prisoners that I had detained at the commune jailhouse.  

He told me, "You were on the field; I am new." He said, "I did not even live in Rwanda during the period, so I cannot really understand.  Assist me in understanding all these allegations and help me to prepare an outline that I can use to finalise the case file." 

We discussed and we found that those allegations had to do with the road that had been plied by Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, that is, the road to his house, from Gitarama to Kavumu.  

We came up with a sketch, and we had to place or situate the allegations on the road, and that is what we did.  And he asked me if I, myself, wanted to be a witness, first of all, to talk about what I had suffered, what I had experienced.  For him it was not disputable.  He simply told me to situate the events along the road and then he asked me to be a witness of the events that I had experienced, and also to recruit some witnesses who could confirm the allegations.  

So I recruited from the Hutu side.  If I could recruit from my former collaborators, it would have been better, because he was telling me that on the side of the survivors there were enough witnesses and there was no problem.  So I promised that I could become a witness.  He was speaking to me very gently, but placing me in a situation in which I had no choice.  And the contrary choice was danger for my person.  And after that, we parted ways.  

I think he finalised his case file.  I do not know.  He did not tell me when he forwarded it to the ICTR.  I have no information on that.  He simply told me that when the investigators would come, I would be informed.  So the investigators came -- when was that?  In August of 1998.  
Q.	Just one clarification, Witness.  You said that you had to recruit people.  Did you, indeed, recruit people?  
A.	Yes, I recruited only two people -- only two people, because he was insisting that I recruit from amongst my conseillers and the responsables of my cellule -- of the cellules.  I recruited only two.  The 
	conseiller of Rutongo secteur, he is now deceased; he was killed by the soldiers who were staying at the commune office.  I do not know why his entire family was exterminated.  Subsequently, when my former conseiller of the Cyubi secteur came back, I also told him about the problem and I recruited him to testify on the events of Gakondokondo.  
Q.	Could you give us the name of these two individuals that you recruited?  
A.	Yes.  The conseiller of Rutongo was called Musafiri, Ildéphonse; M-U-S-A-F-I-R-I, Musafiri.  Ildéphonse, I believe, is no problem.  

And, also, the former conseiller of the secteur is called Kamanzi, Ildéphonse.  The first names are the same, but the surnames are different.  Kamanzi is spelt K-A-M-A-N-Z-I.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, you told us that investigators came in August of 1998.  Who were these investigators? 
A.	These were investigators from the ICTR.  
Q.	Did you meet with them?  
A.	Yes, I met with them.  
Q.	Where?  
A.	In Gitarama-town, more precisely, at a centre that was referred to as maison des femme or "house of women".
Q.	Were you the only one on that day to meet with the investigators of the Tribunal?  
A.	No.  There were other people that the bourgmestre, Gahunde, had brought on board his truck, and there were others whom I believe had come from Nyabikenke.  So there were several witnesses, yes.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, just a small matter with respect to the meaning of a word.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Sorry, come again, please. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
With the meaning of a word that has been used by the -- by the -- by the English translator.  We have been told that he was told to recruit a witness.  But I'm told by my language assistant that the meaning that has been given in French is "to get." 

So I do not know -- I see a difference in the meaning of the two tongues.  May we request that a clarification be sought?  

Sorry, Counsel.  It's something that has come up because of translation.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, while we're here, Witness, we would also like to know:  Kamanzi was conseiller of which secteur?  So, if you could, repeat your answer regarding what the bourgmestre asked you to do, then you could also tell us the -- the -- the secteur from which -- the secteur which Kamanzi, Ildéphonse led.  
THE WITNESS: 
Let me start with Kamanzi, Ildéphonse, who was former conseiller of Cyubi.  Cyubi is written C-Y-U-B-I.  
And to come back to what was said before, Bourgmestre Gahunde presented -- or, showed me allegations which he had taken down and which he had collected from survivors, as well as from prisoners.  For him, those allegations were not a matter for discussion.  He told me that they had to simply be confirmed:  "You are going to confirm these allegations in your testimony and you shall look for two or three people who shall corroborate your assertions."  So I had no choice.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	For matters to be clear and to respond to the issue raised by the Prosecutor, when you say you were asked, you were asked by Bourgmestre Charles Gahunde; do you confirm that? 
A.	Yes, I confirm that.  
Q.	When you were in Gitarama with the ICTR investigators, you said there were some people from Rutobwe who were brought by Bourgmestre Gahunde, and also some people from Nyabikenke.  Were there any people from Nyabikenke there that you knew?  But, out of caution, please, do not give their names.  
A.	Only one person from Nyabikenke.  
Q.	And from amongst the people from Rutobwe who were there, did you know their names?  But do not give the names now.  
A.	I remember that there were two people from Rutobwe.  
Q.	Can you write on a piece of paper the names of the people who were there from Nyabikenke and Rutobwe?  

Are you done, Witness?  
A.	Yes, I'm done.
Q.	Could you, please, sign that sheet of paper.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, you may continue.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I'm doing this to avoid us having to go into closed session.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel, we understand that.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Registry, could you please show that sheet of paper to the Prosecutor and to the Trial Chamber.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Very well, Witness, while this paper is going around, the people who had come to Gitarama to see the investigators, the people from Rutobwe, as well as those from Nyabikenke, could they see each other?  Could they know who else was there, just like you?  
A.	Yes, at the time of arrival.  But during the interviews, we were not together.  We were not together.  
Q.	Very well.  Did you come on board the vehicle of the bourgmestre, Charles Gahunde?  
A.	No.  He informed me in school that the investigators would come.  I had my own means of transport, so I came with my own means.  I did not wait for his pickup truck.  But he was the one who informed me that the investigators were going to come on a given date.  
Q.	Do you know whether the other inhabitants from Rutobwe who came, all came on board the vehicle of the bourgmestre, Charles Gahunde?  
A.	I had arrived somewhat earlier and I was able to realise that he was the one bringing them.  
Q.	What about the people from Nyabikenke?  Were you able to see how they arrived?  
A.	No.  I do not know exactly how they arrived.  
Q.	Were you interviewed by investigators from the office of the Prosecutor of the 
	International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda?  
A.	Yes, I was interviewed by them.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to remind you about observing the pause between the question and your answer.  If you could continue looking at the English booth, that would be helpful; otherwise, there has been some overlapping in your last answer with the question that was put to you.  
THE WITNESS: 
I thank you for reminding me.  I will need to be reminded constantly.  Maybe it's because I'm tired.  I don't know.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, it's okay, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, what did you tell these investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor?  
A.	Quite a few things, but mainly I repeated the allegations that I had been asked to confirm.  I simply omitted the incident of the slapping.  
Q.	Could you explain to us why you omitted this incident of the slap?  
A.	I omitted that incident of the slap because it did not appear to me to be truthful.  A minister who slaps a bourgmestre?  For me, that was unthinkable for me.  That was too much.  It did not appear to be truthful.  I had been asked to find allegations that could hold water in court, but I took the initiative myself not to add this incident.  
Q.	In the list of allegations that could be blamed on Nzabonimana, did you adopt the one according to which he allegedly released prisoners from the commune office, whom you had had incarcerated?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Objection.  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Clearly, that is a very -- yes, may I request the witness to leave.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes.  

Witness, we need to resolve a matter between counsel.  Could you kindly leave the courtroom in accordance with the standard procedure explained to you. 
(Witness exited courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, we only rise because in -- in a very rapid manner, my learned friend seems to -- to -- to violate the rules of examination-in-chief.  While you were still looking at the 
	picture -- at the names written on a piece of paper, he asked the witness:  "Very well.  Did you come on board the vehicle of the bourgmestre, Charles Gahunde?" That was a clearly leading question.  And the answer was "no".  

And now, when I rose last -- just now, he is now putting it to the witness -- and I'll just go there -- whether -- to confirm whether he repeated the allegation that had been asked -- that he had been asked to confirm.  Just a minute. 

Yes.  "The allegation that could be blamed on Nzabonimana, did you adopt the one according to which he allegedly released prisoners from the commune office whom you had incarcerated?" 

I think that question in itself is wrong because, although we know that the witness spoke about how he released witnesses from the Rutobwe prison, there is nowhere he has said that that is what he put in his statement or what he told the investigators of the Tribunal.  

So I feel that this question could have been put better and asked the witness:  What did you tell the investigators of the Tribunal?  Because now we'll be having a situation where it'll be:  Did you do this?  He says yes.  So, again, that is not the testimony of the witness.  But it seems that it is being done very frequently by -- by the -- by my learned friend.  

May I request that this question and the answer, thereto, be expunged from the record, because it's a purely leading question and it does not come from the witness.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I put the same question that the Prosecutor is reproaching me for not having put to the witness.  I asked:  "Mr. Witness, what did you say to the investigators of the Tribunal?" The witness answered:  "I repeated the allegations that I had been asked to confirm.  I simply omitted the slap incident." 

And let me remind the Prosecutor that, a moment ago, the witness, who was speaking about his -- about the incident of the ambush by the -- his recruitment -- I beg your pardon -- of the bourgmestre's, there was the -- he was faced with allegations which he needed to confirm, including the one involving Callixte having people who he had had incarcerated, released.  I didn't even suggest it to him.  All I did was to ask him to repeat.  He said that he repeated what he had asked, what he was -- he had said, and he gave the list.  And now, according to that list, I'm going -- the various items of the list which were confirmed or not to the investigators of the Tribunal.  I don't see the problem.  

And the Prosecutor did not read what I said, which was a general question:  "What did you say to the investigators of the OTP?" That was a general question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, we want to understand what you are saying.  You are saying you put this general question at which time, Counsel?  If you could, indicate the minute.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
It was on the CaseView in English at 12:02 at 52 seconds.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  Very briefly, My Lords. 

The explanation given by counsel cannot hold water in this situation.  The question that he asked previously at page 46, at line 18, was a proper one, and that question was:  "Mr. Witness, what did you tell those investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor?" 

It is at that point that the witness answered in a general manner and said:  "Quite a few things, but mainly I repeated the allegations that I had been asked to confirm.  I simply omitted the incident of the slapping." 

Then he doesn't get the answer he's looking for because he's looking for the details of that.  So it is still wrong, and there is no basis for him to come back in a follow-up question, by saying:  Did you tell them what -- that -- that Callixte had released you -- had released people from the jail?  That is leading, because he should let the witness go through the allegation -- lead him, tell him:  What allegations were put to you by Gahunde?  Because, apparently that has also not been gone into.  We only know that there was a discussion about a route (sic).  

So this question, no matter how my learned friend tries to justify it, has no chain of proper basis.  It is disconnected from the previous question, and that is why we're saying it is leading.  

This question can be properly put after a previous question, and when the witness has said that he actually did, in fact, talk about that incident.  And then maybe counsel can go back to it.  But in such a contentious matter, he cannot do this at this point.  

My Lords, I pray that the question and answer be struck.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  The Chamber will deliberate and give you a ruling.  

The Chamber will sustain the objection for the reasons that no basis has been laid for this question, which is leading and it prevents the Chamber from getting a genuine answer from the witness about the allegations which were put -- which were allegedly put to him by the bourgmestre, Gahunde.  

The first question that was being ask -- that was asked was the allegations that had been put to him.  And he answered in a general manner, as has been quoted by the parties.  After that, it was incumbent upon Defence counsel to ask the witness to elicit the specific allegations that were made, or were put to him to put against the minister.  That was not done and, therefore, the objection is sustained.  

We would also like to warn learned counsel, because this is happening quite frequently, to stop leading the witness, because we want to get his genuine responses and evidence.  

Finally, we cannot expunge the question and answer from the record because we cannot alter the record.  But our ruling and the other explanations will be there, and in the assessment of our -- of the evidence of this witness, it will be taken into account finally.  

That is the ruling of the Trial Chamber.  

Can the witness be brought back in court.
(Witness entered courtroom). 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you hear the Trial Chamber?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
You'll continue with your evidence.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness, at 11:40 and 22 seconds, you were explaining to the Chamber that Bourgmestre Gahunde had given you a list of allegations, the first being that Callixte Nzabonimana had encouraged the population to -- to release the people who were in -- present in Butare, and secondly -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm sorry, Madam President.  Could counsel read from number one, allegation number one?  It appears I made a mistake somewhere.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, sorry to interrupt you, but we have a problem in English.  The interpreters didn't get your question properly.  So if you could kindly repeat it so that we can benefit from the interpretation of it.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Very well.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	I was saying, Mr. Witness, I'm reminding you that at 11:40 and 22 seconds this morning, you had testified that the Rutobwe bourgmestre, Charles Gahunde, had provided you with allegations in respect of Callixte Nzabonimana, first of all, that he had sensitised the population to commit genocide in Rutobwe, especially in Butare, everywhere as he went on his way, and that Nzabonimana had threatened you, that he had slapped you, and that he had released prisoners that you had had imprisoned.  Did you follow that, Mr. Witness? 
A.	Yes, I do remember that. 
Q.	Just a moment ago, you -- I asked you what you had said to the investigators of the Tribunal and you told me that you had confirmed the allegations except the one concerning the slap.  

So, Witness, can you give us the list of the allegations which you confirmed to the investigators of the Tribunal?  
A.	In respect of sensitisation, to commit genocide, especially in Butare and in the other centres, especially in Gakondokondo as well, the threats against me, I confirmed that, and I also confirmed the release of prisoners by Mr. Nzabonimana, Callixte.  

I think that was the substance of the allegations that I confirmed.  Maybe I might have to add something, but I don't recall.  

So, in fact -- I beg your pardon -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Says the witness.  
THE WITNESS: 
-- what I am adding is the words that I put into Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana's mouth.  I made him speak and say things which go along the lines of the perpetration of the genocide.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	And the investigators for the Office of the Prosecution, how did they receive your statements?  
A.	As I spoke they would take down notes.  When my interview was concluded, I was told that it was ended and I was told -- I was told where I needed to go.  So that was basically what I needed.  That was basically the reality, how things happened.
Q.	In the manner that they were interviewing you, did it seem to you that they were looking for details?  
A.	No, they didn't add much.  They didn't ask many questions.  So I told them what I had to tell them.  They weren't looking for any in-depth information of things I said.  I don't think they were trying to read between the lines, as one often says, to analyse what I was telling them.  I think what they were doing is merely to record what I was saying.  
Q.	When you say "record", do you recall the method?  Did they have a -- an audio recorder?  
A.	Maybe I used the wrong term.  I probably should have said "note".  
Q.	You said that they told you where you should go in order to go and collect your allowance.  Where was that? 
A.	For the travel allowance -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Again, may I request the witness to remove his headset?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, can you put down your headset, please.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
In the -- well, I don't know.  Maybe he understands English.  But may I request that he leaves for a 
	few minutes, please?  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Or, maybe we could solve it this way:
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
(No interpretation).
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel Defence, hold on.  

We intended to put a question to Defence counsel ourselves.  

Where was that said, that he was ordered to go and collect another witness?  Where was it said on the record?  
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Madam President, may I confess my sins? I believe I did not include that last sentence of the witness -- 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
(No interpretation)
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
I'm speaking in line, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Defence Counsel, the interpreter is addressing us on the issue, so if you could hold on.  

Madam Interpreter, go ahead. 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Yes, I believe it was an omission on my part.  In the latter part of the answer the witness gave a little bit earlier, he had mentioned something about transport, which I had failed to understand at the time.  We could probably refer to the French transcripts to help us out, Madam President.  Thank you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Maybe, Judge Rajohnson could read to us the -- 
MR. NG'ARUA:
I've confirmed the French version and, indeed, there was a basis, so I withdrew my objection. 
(Pages 16 to 31 by Lisa D. Smith)








1230H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we don't have that in English, so we were also surprised by the question.  If the French transcript could be read so that the English interpretation could be made of it.  

Maybe we ask the witness to repeat his answer.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I have the CaseView in English, Madam President.  I don't know why even.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The interpreters have confessed that they didn't understand that part of his answer and, therefore, they didn't interpret it into English so that we can have a complete record of what he said on that issue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Witness -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
He doesn't have the earphones on. 

Judge Rajohnson is ready to read us the French version of it so that we can save some time.  

Judge Rajohnson.
JUDGE RAJOHNSON:  
Thank you, Madam President.  

At 12:23:56, the question:  "And the investigators of the Prosecution, how did they receive 
your answers?"  The answer:  "Well, as I spoke they were noting down and then when my interview was completed I was told that it was finished.  So I was told the location where I needed to collect 
my transport allowance and that was it.  So they recorded in total what I told them."  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Judge Rajohnson.  

Witness, is that what you have said?  And we just want a yes or no.  
THE WITNESS:
It is impossible for me to answer with a yes or no.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Why not, Witness?  We only want to confirm that that is what you said so that we can correct our record because the English version doesn't contain your answer.  
THE WITNESS:
But I had a problem with recording and I changed -- I amended that.  I corrected that to say "note down" or "note", because to record is using an instrument of sorts, whereas noting is with a pen.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness, for that clarification.  

I think with that clarification you can go ahead.  

Yes, Defence Counsel.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Well, regarding the travel or transport allowance, were you told where you needed to go to fetch it? 
A.	Yes, the investigators told me where -- where to go.  
Q.	Can you specify where you went?  
A.	He told me that I needed to go to the sous-préfet whose name was Marguerite.  I don't know 
	her last name and I went there.  So that was the person who was supposed to give me the 
	transport allowance.  
Q.	The sous-préfet you mentioned was the sous-préfet of which area? 
A.	The sous-préfet in the administration of the préfet's office, not in the village.  
Q.	But that is a Rwandese administrative authority.  
A.	Of course.  Of course.  
Q.	Did you take money from the Rwandan administration to cover your transport expenses?  Did you go and collect that money from the Rwandan administration to cover your transport allowances for the purpose of going to see the investigators from the ICTR?
A.	Afterwards, no.  But at the first meeting we received transport allowances which were handed over 
	to us through an administrative authority.  Bu subsequently, transport allowances and also 
	feeding allowances were given to us by one of the investigators.  So things changed.  But it is only during the first meeting that this happened.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, may I request my learned friend to point out to me on the statement that he has given us where Marguerite -- and the question of allowances is mentioned because this is 
a matter that may need to be investigated further by the Prosecutor.  We would like him to point 
us -- maybe we have omitted to see it.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, could you put down your earphones, please, so that we can resolve this issue with counsel.  
Thank you.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I do not have the statement before me.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
I can lend him mine.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Registry, you facilitate that exercise quickly.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
In any case, do I have to re-read a statement back to you?  I am asking questions to the witness.  If you want to draw from the witness's statement -- well, I think we could deal with the consequences later, but the witness has given a statement or testimony to the Court, which I am exploiting.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Now, I think at this point there is no other way, but we would request the witness to leave. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We have a question to the Defence counsel.  

Was this matter included in the statement that was given to Prosecution Counsel? 
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I do not know that document by heart.  It is some 76 paragraphs long, so there are so many issues.  So right away I cannot tell you whether this point is in there or not.  

Would you want me to take the time I need to read all these paragraphs to find out whether this matter is raised in them or not?  But I am surprised by what I consider obstruction by Mr. Prosecutor in 
my examination-in-chief.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
No, Counsel, the issue is more important than you realise.  We really want confirmation from you whether that matter is included in that statement, in which case we shall have to make a decision on whether we allow you to develop it or not.  So if you are not ready to undertake this examination right now, we can postpone this particular examination on this issue and you can continue with other matters until you have had time to address it because we need to make a ruling on it, Counsel.  

If you have other matters, you can set this aside, during the lunch hour you can revisit it and address us when we resume after lunch.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
I have two other matters to address with the witness.  I shall continue asking him questions depending on what he tells me.  So in that case I shall move on to some other matter.  

We have been speaking about that for about 15 minutes.  I am somewhat surprised by the late reaction of the Prosecutor.  I shall move on to some other matter.  In any case, I did not intend to dwell for hours on this matter.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Learned Counsel, it is best you move on so that we avoid unnecessary arguments and further waste of court time.  So move on with other areas and we will revisit this issue later.  

Witness, could you put on back your earphones.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Madam President, I do not have the feeling that I am the one who is raising arguments.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Witness -- Mr. Mporanzi, first of all, did you sign a statement during that meeting with the investigators? 
A.	No, on that day I did not sign the statement, but they came back later when it was well written down, one month later and they showed me the statement.  I read it and signed it.  
Q.	We are talking about 1998, Witness.  Subsequently, did you, once again, meet with the investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda? 
A.	Yes.  The second time I met with a new team in August 2003.  They came to my house, 
	if my memory serves me right.  
Q.	What happened on that day when they came to see you? 
A.	They came, once again, to investigate the allegations against Callixte Nzabonimana.  
Q.	Did you accept to answer their questions? 
A.	Yes, I accepted and I was bound to do so.  
Q.	Why do you say that you were bound to do so? 
A.	It is because I did not have a choice.  I had to continue in the same vein as before.  I could not backtrack.  
Q.	But, Mr. Witness, this is August 2003, several years after 1998, had your situation not changed? 
A.	No, not at all.  
Q.	Did you have any fears? 
A.	But, yes, if I had refused to collaborate, I ran the risk of being thrown into prison.  
Q.	Why? 
A.	Because given the context in which we found ourselves, anyone who was not of the same opinion as the power -- as the authority in power or who saw things in another light, a different opinion, was simply threatened and most of the time thrown into prison.  So it was risky for me to take the contrary direction.  I did what the government wanted.  
Q.	Do you know what the government expected of you in 2003 regarding the investigators from the
	Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	It was still confirmation of the allegations mentioned earlier.  
Q.	Do you remember if in 2003 you had come up with new allegations against Callixte Nzabonimana? 
A.	Yes, I do remember one that did not appear in the initial allegations.  It is this one.  In the second one, I said that Mr. Nzabonimana came allegedly to the commune office to see me between -- between the 7th and the Murambi meeting, but that he did not find me.  I pretended that I was at a meeting convened by the préfet at the Gitarama préfecture office.  That was something new.  

Something else which was new for the investigators is that I was being asked questions on a 
certain Kamari and on a certain Kigufi.  I was asked if I had any information to give.  Those were the two matters that came to add in -- to the other allegations -- in this new allegation.  
Q.	Did you know Isaac Kamali? 
A.	No, I did not know him.  I have no idea who he is.  
Q.	Did you tell the investigators anything about him? 
A.	Yes, but it was a repetition of what had been said by my brigadier.  I think the brigadier had confused Kamali with someone else who was passing right next to the place where we had parked the 
	pickup truck.  
Q.	Did you sign any statement at that time? 
A.	Yes, I signed a statement.  
Q.	Witness, how are we to consider the two statements which you gave in 1998 and in 2003 to the investigators from the Office of the Prosecutor? 
A.	I do not quite understand your question.  Could you please paraphrase to enable me better understand.  
Q.	Do you have any opinion on the contents of those statements, the 1998 and the 2003 statements? 
A.	The last statement falls within the same context as the first.  So as far as I am concerned, it is still a fabrication, lies.  
Q.	Mr. Witness, do you have an idea of the manner in which the story of the slap went around since 1998, the slap that Callixte Nzabonimana allegedly gave you? 
A.	Could you please clarify the meaning of that spread of that information.  
Q.	Did you learn that that story was relayed elsewhere?  It was talked about in books, in testimonies.  
A.	I cannot remember.  I have not read a lot.  I read a few that came into my hands, but from what I was able to read, yes, the story of the slap did go around and I do not know how, but it was told and retold.  
Q.	Did you hear mention being made about it in the media, for example? 
A.	Yes, I think when Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana was arrested there were some comments made on 
	Voice of America, the Rwandan department of that radio station, the Kirundi/Kinyarwanda department broadcast that Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana had threatened the bourgmestre of Rutobwe.  I heard that myself.  It is not someone else who told me about it, but I do not recall the exact date.  
Q.	Witness, are you okay?  Are you okay, five on five, physically? 
A.	Maybe three on five. 
Q.	Three on five would mean we can continue to break time? 
A.	I shall make an effort.  

MADAM PRESIDENT:
Well, we should point out that we have only five minutes left to the break.  So we can take it earlier to enable him to have a rest and recoup it after.  

Witness, do you want us to take a break now? 
THE WITNESS:
I would like that very much.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
In that case, we will take an earlier break to enable the witness to rest, and we will resume these proceedings at 2:30.  We are adding in five more minutes.  2:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed from 1256H to 1432H) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Good afternoon, everyone.  

Good afternoon, Witness.  
THE WITNESS:
Good afternoon, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Welcome back.  And the proceedings are resumed.  

And, Defence Counsel, you may continue.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Well, then, Witness, we were discussing your meeting with investigators in 2003.  Could you tell the Chamber what became of these meetings subsequently.  
A.	Subsequently, I was visited by Mr. Don Webster who came to my house, I believe, in May, early in 
	May or late May, early June 2007.  And at the end of July 2008 I was visited again by a group of investigators and that was the last at that point.  
Q.	Could you tell us about your meeting with Mr. Webster in June 2007?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Webster's visit was not an impromptu visit because a month prior to that he had sent an envoy to tell me that he wanted to meet me, so I was waiting for his visit.  

So when he came to my house, it was not a surprise to me.  But what was surprising was that he took care to come with a writ or a summons from the state prosecutor of Kigali, a summons that compelled me to appear the next day in -- at the Office of the Prosecutor at Kicukiro in Kigali for some reason that was not stated therein.  Maybe I am rushing ahead by mentioning this summons, but I simply -- or, rather, this summons was handed over to me at the last minute by -- Webster had come and did not meet me and he left the summons with my neighbour and gave him 1,000 francs to serve as 
my transportation cost.  But I understood the objective of the summons when I discussed with 
Mr. Don Webster.  

So this is what happened.  He came, he didn't find me at home, so he enquired from my neighbour, and my neighbour told him that I usually came back home between 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m.  So he waited, got impatient and he was accompanied by three other persons.  If I remember correctly, there was an interpreter who also served as his secretary, I believe, and two other persons who spoke French but whose names I have forgotten.  So my neighbour received them in his compound.  And while they were discussing, he was also looking out for my arrival.  So when I opened my door, he saw me and came over and told me that there were people in his compound who wanted to see me.  He told me that 
these people were foreigners.  He did not know where they were coming from, and he did not know why they were looking for me.  They were accompanied by a white man who was not entirely white, he was half-white, half-black.  So I understood that he was half-cast.  So he came and gave me this summons.  I read the summons and then he gave me 1,000 francs that had been given to him.  So he asked me if I was ready to receive them.  I replied that he should wait a bit while I went to his compound to greet them.  

I went into his compound that was located a few metres away, I greeted them.  Webster introduced himself and stated his status as a trial attorney -- senior trial attorney at the ICTR, he said he wanted to obtain information.  And I told him, "Well, you announced your arrival.  That is good.  I am not surprised.  But the persons who are accompanying you, if they are coming for some other thing, then I cannot receive you, they will have to come back some other time.  

So he told me:  "No, I am really the one looking for you."  So I received Mr. Webster and his secretary in my little living room.  So Mr. Webster interviewed me, put questions to me on the Murambi meeting, on the persons who were present at that meeting.  And after 20 minutes, it was over.  So he got up to leave.  I asked him:  "What about the summons?"  He smiled a little and said, "No, it is no longer important since I have found you.  While I was coming here I planned against two-case scenarios; first, if I didn't see you.  I have a lot of work -- so with the prosecutor in Kigali, I had planned that you be the one to come and see me tomorrow morning.  So that is why I took care to bring along these summons."  So he assured me that there was nothing bad about it.  It was just a precautionary measure.  So it would not be necessary for me to go and see the prosecutor the next day.  So he left.  

But there was still a question in my mind.  I was worried about his procedure, his approach, which was not very different from that of other investigators.  Most often, witnesses have to move towards the investigators and not the other way round.  So I was used to that.  
Q.	Nonetheless, Witness, the summons from the state prosecutor in Kigali, what was the assessment of that summons at that time? 
A.	Well, I thought that the pressure had reached its peak at that point.  That was intimidation because if a personality of the calibre of the state prosecutor of the Tribunal in Kigali was asking for me to come and meet him at a location that was not habitual, then I thought it was a form of pressure.  But maybe his intension or his concern was that he would not find me and so he really wanted to interview me.  So I tried to put myself in his shoes, but to me, I thought it was a form of pressure that was like all the other pressure and intimidation that I had received before.  

Do you want me to talk about July 2008 meeting?  
Q.	Please do.  Yes, please go ahead.  
A.	That was my last meeting with the Office of the Prosecutor.  What happened was that, there was a young lady who was called Uwera.  I have forgotten her first name, who usually came with the investigations teams.  That lady called me on the telephone.  I was very surprised that she could have obtained my telephone number because that number was known only to my children.  She called me and said some investigators wanted to see me and they were staying in a motel in downtown Gitarama.  I have forgotten the name of that motel, but it is located -- for those who know Gitarama town -- it is located in front of the big market in Gitarama.  So I said -- well, I am in the vicinity, but at least take time to come and see me so we can take an appointment because right now, I am not available.  So one investigator came with the driver.  I told them that I was tired, so they met me at Cyakabiri.  Cyakabiri is located 4 kilometres from the downtown area.  So we set an appointment for the next day.  The next day in the afternoon I honoured the appointment.  

When I got in I found an English-speaking lady, very polite, who had a lot of tact and who said that she wanted us to discuss the statements that I had given to investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor.  She put a few questions to me on my first statement, a few more questions on the second statement and she asked me if I could confirm, and if I would like to come and testify.  And since I was under a great deal of pressure, I told her, "Yes, yes, I will come and testify."  There was no problem.  I believe she gave me a small statement on a page to sign.  

Then the gentleman who was a member of the group, but who appeared to me to be some kind of manager of the group, gave me transport money as investigators are warned to do.  So I left and that was the last meeting I had with the investigators of the OTP -- of the ICTR, correction.  
Q.	There is some clarification, I can't find it in the English CaseView.  It would appear that you cited the name of the lady who called you on your mobile telephone.  Could you repeat that lady's name.  
A.	Her name was Uwera.  I don't know her first name.
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
Uwera U-W-E-R-A.
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	That was in July 2008.  Did you subsequently have any contacts with the investigators of the 
	Office of the Prosecutor or to the prosecutors themselves? 
A.	No, I actually stated that it was the last meeting.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we would like to remind you about observing a break between your answer and the questions put to you by the counsel.  Please, observe the light in the English booth before you begin answering the question.  
BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Another small clarification, Witness.  We would like to have the spelling of Uwera.  
A.	Uwera, U-W-E-R-A.
Q.	This morning I believe you testified that you went on exile again in August 2008; is that correct? 
A.	Yes, that's correct.  
Q.	Could you explain to the Trial Chamber why you did so.  
A.	Yes.  Well, there are many reasons thereto, but there is a major reason.  I was compelled by the 
	RPF regime to collaborate in the fabrication of false testimony against Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  So I gave in to that duress for two reasons.  The first reason was that if I refused to collaborate, that could lead me to prison -- straight to prison.  Prison to me meant death, given my fragile health and given the fact that the prisons at the time which were actually terrible detention facilities that were -- that had no form of human dignity.  I told myself that if I went to prison I could not survive, I would die.  Again to me, prison meant that my children will have a very unhappy life because they had lost their mother in exile and who absolutely needed me to grow up and to carry out their studies.  

Secondly, by lying -- or, in fact, by agreeing to lie and collaborate, I was convinced that it would be difficult to arrest Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana.  I knew that I left him back in Congo, Zaire, that it would be difficult to seek out an individual in the huge Congo forest.  I was convinced that even if they had to catch him sometime, it would take years and years.  So that was the conviction I had for six years or thereabouts.  

And when I finally became certain that the American government had put out a reward of 
$5m dollars for anybody who would give -- provide any useful information for the arrest of Callixte, from that point on I had trouble with my conscience.  My conscience troubled me for having imperilled the life of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana for having exposed him to -- physically to imprisonment but also for staining his character with my lies.  

But while I was having trouble with my conscience, there was a solution that came to me for having to save myself, by withdrawing my prior statements and all those lies, but I had to think about the implications that, that thing my conscience was telling me would lead me to.  So it was impossible for me to withdraw all those statements although I was in the country because I would risk being put in jail and I didn't want to risk that.  So I said to myself, I will continue to think about this and eventually, I came to the conclusion that in order to make reparations for the wrong that I had caused to 
Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana, it was absolutely necessary that I leave Rwanda and see how I could proceed.  So that was the main reason, in other words, to come and explain to the Tribunal what, in fact, happened and also to ask for forgiveness for my lies and, in particular, to ask for forgiveness of Mr. Callixte Nzabonimana for the wrong that I had done him.  

It is obvious that pressure from the regime and the intimidation from some investigators -- it's not all 
the investigators because they had different attitudes, but only from some of the investigators who 
were exerting pressure on me that I needed to come to the ICTR and that I need to follow the schedule and so on and so fourth.  So it was this kind of pressure and this intimidation which strengthened 
my decision to leave the country because all this was very discouraging for me.  
Q.	In the country to which you went, did you face any security problems after you left Rwanda? 
A.	I learned from other people that I had been sought by soldiers from my commune a few months after my departure and that quite regularly, intelligence personnel would come to try and find out where I might be hiding, but I have no further information in that regard.  
Q.	Do you have any identifying information on the soldiers from your commune who had come to look for you in your country of exile? 
A.	Yes, there were young men who knew me very well.  There was one Nsengiyumva, son of 
	Joseph Karwera from Ntondo secteur, who had been a conseiller of Ntondo secteur.  I don't know 
	the other young man's name, but I was told that he was the son of Isaiah Ndagijimana, who was a conseiller of the Rutongo secteur.  That is all.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, sorry to interrupt you.  But it is not very clear from the witness's answer whether he was sought out in Rwanda or in the place or in the country where he lives.  In English what we have is that he learnt from other people.  This is what he said.  "I learned from other people that I had been sought by soldiers from my commune a few months after my departure."  And he goes on to talk about intelligence personnel and so on.  So was he sought for in Rwanda or in his new country of residence? 
THE WITNESS:
It was in my country of exile after I had left Rwanda.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness.  

Counsel, you may continue. 

BY MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE:
Q.	Mr. Witness, is there some higher meaning to what you have said and also for you to come here and testify in open court before this Tribunal? 
A.	The first part of your question gives me problems of comprehension because -- can you not paraphrase your question so that it is not couched in such imagery, because I don't understand what you are trying to say.  
Q.	Is there a metaphysical or religious reason for what you are doing in relation to your future which made you come to provide your testimony before this Tribunal? 
A.	Now, I am understanding your question.  So what is the scope of the -- I don't know psychologically or what.  Well, I think it is the spiritual side.  From the spiritual side there is an objective but that is something personal.  I personally believe in God and I think that believing in the last judgement, the final judgement and I believe in internal life and for one to have internal life.  What Christians are asked is to be -- is not to be saints, but to admit that we are sinners and then to ask for forgiveness.  And this is what I have wanted to do because for the time being, I am counting on my fingers and the amount of time left for me in this world and I want to leave this world with a peaceful heart and that is why I have decided to come and provide this testimony.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  I have no further questions for you.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Learned Counsel.  

Prosecution?  
MR. NG'ARUA:
We have cross-examination to perform.  

And if registry can assist. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Registry.  

And, Learned Counsel, if you could switch off your microphone as you prepare.

Learned Counsel, we are ready when you are ready.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Thank you, Madam President.  

Madam President, before I proceed with my -- Madam President, before I proceed with my cross-examination, there is a matter that is still pending with respect to the testimony of this witness.  And since it does not really concern him, may I request that he goes out for a few minutes so that we can deal with it and then he can come back for cross-examination.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Witness, we have a matter to sort between counsel and we kindly request you to leave, in accordance with the standard procedure.  It will not take long.  
(Witness exited courtroom) 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Madam President, Your Honours, thank you very much.  

As you know there is the matter of great importance that is still pending.  At a certain point in the examination in-chief, Defence counsel was requested to point out to us the notice he had given with a view of the statement made by the witness, when he said that after seeing the Prosecution investigators, he went subsequently.  He was directed by them to go to the -- to a certain office and see the sous-préfet, Marguerite, who then gave him money.  

Now, that matter is important because if, indeed, it is not as we believe in the statement -- is a 
matter that embarrasses the Prosecutor because it is a matter which can be easily investigated and more importantly, that allegation which we believe is not true was made in order to show the connection.  A very important aspect of this witness's testimony is that there is a corroboration, a 
deep corroboration that just goes beyond the normal acceptable corroboration between the ICTR and the government of Rwanda in which we send our witnesses to the sous-préfet, exposing them in the process and in return they get money.  So this is a very important matter which goes to the heart of the subject that this witness is all about and his credibility.  

So we would like that matter to be revisited so that counsel can point out where he has given notice and, if not, we would like to inform the Chamber that we cannot be able to complete the cross-examination of this witness without having first had an opportunity to investigate that matter so that we can confront him with this issue.  This is a matter that involves records, accounting, if indeed, ICTR gave the money to the sous-préfet to hold it for them in trust so that they can pay to the witnesses, it requires certain accounting formalities.  

Also, this is a matter that goes to the heart of the independence of the UN system.  It goes to the heart of the matter of the independence of the ICTR, this Tribunal, in the way it approaches matters.  This is a thing that is completely unacceptable and as such we should be given the opportunity to investigate so that we can show the Court that this witness is not trustworthy and that he is telling lies.  So we would like that matter to be revisited and for counsel in particular, having laid the foundation of the gravity of the matter to show us where in his statement that he has given notice.  As the Court pleases.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELL-LABROUSSE:
Well, I am somewhat surprised, as usual.  I recall that the Defence does not have the obligation to take signed statements or statements signed by witnesses.  There is no rule which imposes that procedure.  However -- and maybe the Chamber has this document before it, disclosure of a statement which is 
ten pages long.  It is a statement which is quite dense which is made up of 76 paragraphs.  And if we look at this document objectively and it is compared to the types of statements which have been disclosed to the Prosecutor by the Defence and the statements that have been disclosed to us by the Prosecution, I think that the substance of the material we provide cannot be measured to what the OTP has provided to someone who is an accused.  

Let me recall someone who is risking sentencing and I am sure that the Prosecutor will ask for the highest penalty.  So the first thing is that the Defence does not have any obligation to disclose witness statements.  And with respect to this particular witness, it has been provided to the Prosecution an extremely long statement which provides it with an extremely detailed manner of several matters which have been dealt with by the witness.  And in this statement mention has been made at length of the conditions under which this witness was recruited by the Rwandan authorities and brought -- and that 
is very extremely serious for the Defence and two Prosecution witnesses have confirmed this interview of 1998.  So they brought on a silver platter this witness whom it would seem was the Prosecution which was waiting to receive witnesses.  

So for the Defence, this is unacceptable and the Prosecution cannot challenge me on this point because the objective of my opening statements at the beginning of the Defence case was that there was this proximity or closeness between the Rwandan services, and I am not talking about the ICTR, I am talking about the office of the ICTR, and that is a fundamental element of this trial and the evidence that we intend to bring.  

So when the Prosecutor is saying that he is surprised by this element, this information, we have stated, 
I would say, a month ago, even before we began the Defence case that this would be our stand, 
our position.  And we further -- than this extremely long statement which we disclosed to the Prosecution, we specifically notified the Prosecution that Jean-Marie Mporanzi would testify in respect of his recruitment as a witness by the Prosecution.  

So the Prosecution was notified of the areas on which the witness would come to testify.  So there is no difficulty for the Prosecution to come and cross-examine this witness on those particular issues knowing that in order to be honest, the Chamber will recall that there's been a battle for a year-and-a-half on the part of the Defence for this witness who had been placed under protective measures by the request of the Prosecution, in coming to testify for the Defence before the Chamber.  So this has been one-and-half years that the Prosecution knew that eventually, this witness will come to explain to the Chamber how he had been able to become -- to move from a possible witness for the Prosecution to become a Defence witness.  I believe and I imagine that during that one-and-a-half years, the Prosecution had enough time, if that was necessary, to revise the conditions under which its office had been in a relationship with Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi.  

The Prosecution has not done its job and is coming today -- this witness has testified for one day and a half for the Defence, and it is only on the basis of one sentence that there is a blame being laid at the doorstep of the Defence and we find that for this reason, at the very least, the objection should not be admitted.  It should be overruled.  
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Counsel for the Prosecution.  
MR. NG'ARUA:
Firstly, My Lords, we were trying to find out from the Defence where exactly in the statement which is lengthy, as he has said, and is signed by the witness and it purports to be notice of items that are going to be talked about where the heart of that beast is.  

This submission that we have been treated to lacks a heart.  It doesn't have the theme and the 
gravitas of the issues that have been talked about.  We are not trying to compare 
Defence witnesses' statements and OTP witnesses' statement.  There is no comparison.  Sometimes Defence does not give statements, sometimes they do.  But that's the risk they run.  If a witness comes here and there is no notice of what he says, the other party, in terms of equality of arms, is entitled to investigate.  

Now, we have said that the entire body of testimony before us lacks that connectivity which is so important that links his statement and grounds it on a truthful element.  Now, all we are saying is this:  That if counsel can point it out in his notice, then we would be able to work on it.  

In his opening speech, which he has referred to at length, we would say that counsel is open to say whatever he wants to in his speech.  He can make a political statement, depending on his political inclination.  He can demonise a foreign state.  He can demonise the Tribunal.  He has a latitude, but he owes a duty to his client to ensure that his opening statement has some foundation that goes to his defence and not purely making allegations.  

So all we are saying is that the opening statement is not the statement of this witness.  In the 
opening statement he did not say that this witness would say that he met Marguerite, a sous-préfet, who acted on behalf of this Tribunal.  That's a very different matter.  So we are saying that we have made our submission and counsel has not been able to meet it at all.  He has made a political-cum-legal statement.  He has accused us again, that we do not do our job, we do not know 
our job.  In the fullness of time we hope that he will, sooner or later, come to know that we know how to do our job. 

So we are not going to cast any aspersions on his side because he has very impressionable and wonderful intensity with him.  We don't want them to get bad manners from us, but he has not pointed out what we have submitted to Your Lordships that is necessary to be pointed.  So his submission should not be considered as meeting the demand for us to have, in particular, the party which shows that he has given us notice and the consequences that flow therefrom.  

In that, My Lords, we lay our submission to rest.  
(Pages 32 to 46 by Sithembiso Moyo)


















1530H
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Our understanding was that the Defence had abandoned this line of questioning.  But we would also like to understand the remedy learned counsel for the Prosecution is seeking.  

We understand that you would like to do investigations regarding this issue.  If that is the case, 
what time frame are you looking at?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
May I just consult for a minute?  

Madam President, Your Honours, we need about three weeks to investigate this, because it's a 
matter of record.  And if at the time when we got this statement that matter was there, we'd have been able to get -- and face this witness with accounting records, with affidavits, probably of even Marguerite.  We need to get information, who Marguerite is, whether she exists at all, whether she has ever existed, so that we can show to this Court the unreliability of this witness.  

So the remedy we are seeking is that we need to confront him with the reality so that he may see and request for forgiveness, yet again, for telling lies.  That is the remedy that we seek.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I'm sorry, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes, Defence Counsel.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
Yes, Madam President.  I do not know if the Chamber has the statement that was signed by witness Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi, to actually look at that statement before taking a decision, to look at the evidence and the materials that were communicated to the Prosecution and the elements on which the witness had to testify.  

If the Chamber does not have this document, could the registry officer help us to give this document to the Bench.  

Thank you.  

The other point I wanted to raise is from the standpoint of the balance between the parties, ultimately.  I would like to mention two aspects of the Prosecution evidence.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Counsel, sorry to interrupt you.  Is this about this issue or is that a different issue?  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
This is actually related to this point, Madam President. 
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Okay.  
MR. COURCELLE-LABROUSSE: 
I believe it was Witness CNAC -- Witness CNAC who was referred to his statement -- to the fact that in Masango commune Callixte Nzabonimana had given instructions for the homes of Tutsi to be destroyed.  That witness, CNAC, when he came to testify here, he said that one Esdras Mpamo held a meeting on that issue, a meeting that he held on the orders of Callixte Nzabonimana.  

That point -- and I believe that this is the Prosecution case.  That point was not notified -- does not even appear in the statement.  Yet, the Chamber considered that since Mpamo was mentioned in the statement and that since a meeting was mentioned further ahead, that element had been put on notice.  

There is the case of CNAL, as my colleague reminds me -- CNAM who came to testify about a meeting and we're still talking about a Prosecution witness who is accusing Callixte Nzabonimana of a 
criminal offence.  That was never mentioned in the witness's statement or in the 
Prosecution pre-trial brief.  

So I don't think it raises any difficulty.  But these are elements that were presented by the Prosecution during its case.  So I do not see what would justify -- whereas, you have before you the very exhaustive statement of the witness on the residual issue that the cross-examination of 
Jean-Marie Vianney Mporanzi should be postponed on account of that, whereas, the Prosecution have been put on notice that one of the main objectives of this witness's testimony was his recruitment by the Office of the Prosecution.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Thank you, Counsel.  

Very briefly.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Very briefly.  

Yes.  He has raised a new point about the conditions of CNAC.  We clearly referred to him in 
our submission to the Court, to paragraph 47 of the pre-trial brief, where we gave them further notice about that, and the indictment.  
And paragraph 47, if I can just briefly remind the learned counsel.  It states, and I quote, "In May 1994, in Masango commune, Callixte Nzabonimana ordered persons, who included MRND supporters of Masango commune, to completely destroy the houses abandoned by Tutsi and to plant in their place crops in order to wipe out all signs of the massacre of Tutsi."   

Now that -- end of quote.  Now, that read with the statement of CNAC, completely filled the picture.  So he is bringing an irrelevance here.  And it's at the same weight.  

The issue we are addressing with this witness goes to the crux of his testimony today, that there is a community of a legitimate purpose between ICTR and the government of Rwanda, and it acts through the sous-préfet in this case.  

So that is very different from talking about a group of people, one of whom is an MRND operative.  So I don't think that even if counsel gives the Court the statement, he still fails, in my submission, to point out and to highlight the point where he gives notice of that.  He can write a novel and purport it to be a witness statement, but so long as it misses the point, then it is not useful.  

That's all I have to say.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
The ruling is reserved for tomorrow morning.  And in the meantime, we will continue with the cross-examination of the witness.  

Could we have him back in the courtroom.  
MR. MWAMASANGULA:
Yes, Madam President.  
(Witness entered courtroom)
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, welcome back.  We will continue -- we will continue with your testimony.  

And we have to have a break at 4 o'clock, Learned Counsel for the Prosecution.  So organise your work in such a way that at 4 o'clock we take the break.
CROSS-EXAMINATION 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Good afternoon, Witness.  
A.	Good afternoon, Counsel for the Prosecution.  
Q.	I will be asking you a few simple questions just to clarify some of the things that you have told the Court in the last one-and-a-half days.  
Now, Witness, you have a glass of water in front of you.  You can feel comfortable and have a drink if you feel like.  And if you feel tired, please let me know.  

Now, Witness, in 1994 you were a Catholic; is that correct?  
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And a practicing Catholic; isn't it? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor. 
Q.	You saved the lives of countless Tutsis during their time of need because of your conscience; 
	is that correct? 
A.	Yes, Mr. Prosecutor.  
Q.	And you were so much of a practicing Catholic, that even in your official decisions you resorted to a Catholic priest to assist you; is that correct? 
A.	I believe that on that point I cannot judge myself as a Catholic.  But to say that I was a saint, that is not possible.  It is not possible for a human being to be a saint.  Then, again, if I took a priest to be 
	my advisor, it is not because he was a Catholic.  It was simply because I found him wise and he had spent over a decade in Rutobwe commune, in Cyeza parish.  Over 10 years.  And he knew the commune very well -- perfectly, and since we got to know ourselves at the minor seminary, where he came to check on the performance of his humanarians (sic).  So there was some mutual friendship or liking that developed between us.  So it's not a matter of being Catholics or Protestants, but it was a matter of personal liking.  

So I would like you to keep aside the argument of being a Catholic.  I needed his advice because I thought he was wise, logical minded, and ready to serve.  Thank you.  
Q.	During the height of the genocide, Witness, Father Gigi, your Catholic friend, advised you that the people should be told that killing was a sin; isn't it?  That was your testimony; wasn't it? 
A.	Could you kindly repeat your question, please.  
Q.	Witness, all I'm saying is this:  That when you sought his advice, he told you, in the height of the genocide, to inform the people that killing was a sin, they should not do a sin; is that correct?  
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, Witness, did you continue to be a Catholic when you came back from exile? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	And you continued to practice as a Catholic; correct? 
A.	I'm still a Catholic, but my present living conditions in exile have interrupted some of my 
	religious activities.  
Q.	Indeed, Witness.  

Now, this interruption in your religious practice has caused you to forget the eighth commandment; 
isn't it?  
A.	I do not agree with your interpretation, Counsel for the Prosecution.  You have arrived at a conclusion that does not tie in with your first statement.  That is not true.  I do not agree.  I do not agree with 
	your reasoning.  
Q.	Can you remind the Chamber of the eighth commandment that a Catholic must follow.  
A.	I have somewhat forgotten my catechism. 
Q.	Yes, indeed, Witness, you have forgotten.  You have forgotten.  You have forgotten that to tell lies is a sin; haven't you? 
A.	Could you point out to me where I have lied, because that is a gratuitous statement as far as I see it.  On what evidence are you relying to say that I have lied?  
Q.	Witness, can you tell the Court the distance between where you met the investigators of OTP at 
	maison des femmes and Marguerite's office? 
A.	I could answer your question but you have still not told me the evidence that you are relying upon to tell me that I've lied, Mr. Prosecutor.  I believe that you are skipping from a problem that has still not been addressed to another question.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, two matters.  

The first one is that we want to remind you about keeping your microphone closed when you are not speaking.  

The second is that we did advise you to answer all questions put to you.  And that if questions are not proper, the Trial Chamber will say so.  

The Prosecutor has heard your comment.  He -- we are sure that he will address it.  If he doesn't, we will take note of it.  But we would like you to answer the questions.  

So if you could answer that question, then we will take a break, Prosecutor, and resume after the break.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Thank you, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Witness, do you remember the question?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes.  But first I do apologise.  I did not know that it was forbidden to ask clarifications from the OTP -- 
THE ENGLISH INTERPRETER:
-- or the ICTR, correction.  

THE WITNESS:
Please, I do apologise.  I did not know about that.  

So if I remember correctly, I was asked to try to assess the distance between the maison des femmes and the office of Sous-préfet Marguerite; am I correct?  
BY MR. NG'ARUA: 
Q.	Yes.  

Can you now answer very briefly, before we go for a break.  
A.	The sous-préfet's office -- I believe she was in charge of economic affairs, is located in the 
	préfecture office building itself, that is, the Gitarama préfecture office building.  And the 
	maison des femmes -- if you draw a straight line to the maison des femmes, the distance is about 50 metres.  But if you have to follow the contours of the road leading to the maison des femmes, the distance may be between 60 and 70 metres.  So it is quite close to the Gitarama préfecture office.  
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
Madam President, Your Honours, I think this is a good time to take the break.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
Yes.  

And one further clarification, Witness.  We did say that if you did not understand a question, you could ask for it to be clarified or for it to be repeated.  What we have been cautioning you about is answering the question with another question, which may not be related.  Is that clear, Witness?  
THE WITNESS: 
Yes, very clear, Madam President.  
MADAM PRESIDENT: 
All right.  The proceedings are adjourned to 4:30 this afternoon.  
(Court recessed at 1603H)

1650H 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
The Trial Chamber apologises for coming late.  It had a matter -- an urgent matter to handle which has a bearing on the progress of these proceedings.  

The proceedings resumed.  

And Witness, good evening.  
THE WITNESS:
Thank you. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
We will continue with your testimony.

Counsel for the Prosecution.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, when you wrote your statement of 25th August 1998, you were interviewed by two investigators; is that correct? 
A.	No, I remember -- but since I had no trouble understanding French, and the investigator who interviewed me was French speaking, there was no need for an interpreter. 
Q.	That is not my question, Witness.  I know that you were interviewed in French, there was no interpreter.  My question was there were two investigators.  One was called Sebinde, the other was called Anaguma.  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
My Lords, may I refer you to your folders, item number 1 and tab number 1, page number 1.  
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	That correct? 
A.	I did not get the names of the investigators.  So I cannot give an answer on that.  I did not recall their names.  I simply observed that they were not Rwandans, that was all. 
Q.	And, Witness, is it correct that you do not keep a diary? 
A.	No, I did not keep a diary as such, because investigators always arrived unannounced.  So when I had my interview, that was all.  I did not keep dates -- names of investigators.  I always forget such details. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Learned Counsel, sorry to interrupt you.  But what was the answer of the witness with regard to their number.  The English CaseView does not indicate that that question was answered.  

How many investigators interviewed you, Witness, on the 25th August 1998?

THE WITNESS:
As far as I remember, I answered questions from one investigator who interviewed me in French because that is the one I recall.  I was not interviewed by two investigators.  I remember answering the questions of a French speaking investigator.  Now I cannot remember if he had somebody with him, but he is the one I remember because he interviewed me. 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, in the room where you were interviewed, was there another person other than the person who was asking you questions? 
A.	Maybe one other person, but that person did not ask me questions.  But my mind was focused on the person who was putting questions to me.  That is what I am insisting upon. 
Q.	Thank you, Witness.  And -- 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Counsel. 
MR. NG'ARUA:
Yes. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:  
We would like to understand the witness.  Was there or was there not another person during this interview?  Because he said maybe another person.  What does that exactly mean, Witness?  
THE WITNESS:
It means that the person I remember is the person who put the questions to me.  So my mind does not have any recollection of any person who may have been there or not because that person did not retain my attention. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Witness 
BY MR. NG'ARUA:
Q.	Witness, do you now keep a diary?  Do you -- is it something that is in your personal habit to keep a diary? 
A.	I kept a diary when I was a teacher, when there was an upcoming event that needed to be mentioned so as not to be forgotten.  So I did so, but it was not a continuous and uninterrupted process.  It depended on events. 
Q.	Witness, when you recorded your statement of the 25th August 1998, who told you to see Marguerite? 
A.	Now it was the first time that I was meeting the investigators.  I did not have many questions to put to him, so I went to the office and I signed out some money.  I did not ask the sous préfet whether there was some delegation of power.  I did not ask too many questions.  The essential thing for me was the money, then I left.  
Q.	Witness, with due respect, I wanted to interrupt you, but I stopped myself because that is not the question that I asked you, please.  Who, among the Prosecutor's investigators asked you to go and see Marguerite.  It's a very simple question.
A.	I believe he was the one who interviewed me.  I believe he was the one who asked me to go there? 
Q.	But it could not be as well.  Is that what you are telling the Court, you are not sure, whether it was him or somebody else on the street? 
A.	You should understand that since `98 to this year 2010, there are some things that one forgets even if they stuck in one's mind at some point.  And you also have to consider that with the deadening effects of drugs and medicines, some things wiped out from one's brain.  So you forgive me if I forget some things -- some details.  But that is something that happened to me.  If I tell you the number of pills I have swollen, they should be over five or 6,000.  It has an effect on the brain.  So one forgets some things, effectively, all details that I consider insignificant such as the one you are asking me.  So if someone tells me to go and take money, I went and took the money. 
Q.	Just to get the Court to understand you very well, Witness.  Are you saying that the medicines you take do affect your thinking and your memory?  Is that what you are saying? 
A.	I am saying some details.  It is possible for me to forget them, but not the substance; that's different. 
Q.	Now, Witness, can you tell the Court in your own words what the investigator actually instructed you to tell Marguerite? 
A.	Once again, please, repeat your question for me. 
Q.	Witness, my question was:  Can you tell the Court in your own words what the investigator actually told you or instructed you to tell Marguerite? 
A.	I thought that we were not given instructions to transmit.  Instructions for me, means an order that is to be complied with in a way.  So he told me; you go to the lady sous-préfet and tell her that you were questioned by investigators of the ICTR and you will be given the money for your travel allowance. 
Q.	And, Witness, you confirm to this Court that Marguerite was not part of the investigation team at any time when your statement was being taken; is that correct?
A.	Well, she was a sous préfet.  I am wondering how she could be an investigator of the ICTR at the same time.  The Marguerite whom I know, who gave me the travel allowance money was in her office as a 
	Sous-préfet? 
Q.	Witness, were you given a receipt or a note to take to Marguerite or any other form of identification by the investigator? 
A.	Yes, I think that we received a note, if my memory is good.  But the note was -- I think there were three people on that note because three of us went into Marguerite's office at the same time. 
Q.	Now, now, Witness, go a bit slowly here.  You were alone being interviewed by one or two people.  You were given a note to take to Marguerite; is that correct? 
A.	Yes. 
Q.	Now, who were these three other people on the note? 
A.	(By order of the Court, this portion of the transcript has been extracted and kept under separate cover)
A.	We signed on the list that the lady sous-préfet had and that was all. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Yes, Counsel.  

Witness, could you remember to close your microphone every time you finish speaking, please.  

Learned Counsel, are we in the right place?  
MR. NG'ARUA: 
I think, Madam President, it might be wise to go into a short closed session and then get more details out of this witness.

As the Court pleases. 
MADAM PRESIDENT:
Thank you, Counsel.  

Members of the public, we request you to leave now as the details we are going to discuss may impinge upon the identification of some people.
(At this point in the proceedings, a portion of the transcript [pages 57 to 62] was extracted and sealed under separate cover, as the session was heard in camera)
